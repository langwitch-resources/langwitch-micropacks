You never knew if you would see them again.	Nikoli nisi vedel, če jih boš spet videl.
Nothing more than him.	Nič več kot on.
I completely understand.	popolnoma razumem.
At the party.	Na zabavi.
Don't tell her about me.	Ne govori ji o meni.
I see someone like you.	Vidim nekoga, kot si ti.
But it seems fine to me.	Vendar se mi zdi v redu.
Absolutely can.	Popolnoma lahko.
Let it be so.	Naj bo tako.
I didn't want to be here myself.	Sam nisem hotel biti tukaj.
Like he doesn't know you.	Kot da te ne pozna.
That would work for her.	To bi ji uspelo.
It would be good to know how to make it.	Dobro bi bilo vedeti, kako ga narediti.
I saw you right away.	Takoj sem te videl.
He comes when he comes.	Pride, ko pride.
What not.	Kar ne.
Something like this is not possible.	Kaj takega ni mogoče.
The day before.	Prejšnji dan.
She is completely afraid of him.	Popolnoma se ga boji.
He soon heard about it.	Kmalu je slišal za to.
What was she even here for?	Kaj je sploh bila tukaj.
And yet it will.	Pa vendar bo.
They are long gone.	Že dolgo jih ni več.
And he is also not entirely right.	In tudi nima popolnoma prav.
He talks a lot.	Veliko govori.
I don’t want to see what’s out there right now.	Ne bi rad videl, kaj je zdaj tam.
That's when it happened.	Takrat se je zgodilo.
I don't want to go back to school.	Nočem nazaj v šolo.
I don't know what's wrong with that.	Ne vem, kaj je s tem narobe.
But it could be something else.	Lahko pa je kaj drugega.
You didn't have to.	Ni ti bilo treba.
Because this is my life now.	Ker to je zdaj moje življenje.
And you know, he's right.	In veste, ima prav.
Are you from here?	Ste od tukaj?
I understand what you mean by that.	Razumem, kaj misliš s tem.
We didn't have to be here today.	Danes nam ni bilo treba biti tukaj.
I'm your friend.	Tvoj prijatelj sem.
I think they have been and have been for a very long time.	Mislim, da so in so že zelo dolgo.
It's your money.	To je tvoj denar.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ni.
You made me feel like person of the year.	Zaradi tebe sem se počutil kot oseba leta.
We did this as follows.	To smo naredili na naslednji način.
I will find a job.	bom našel delo.
It didn’t look like anyone was there.	Ni bilo videti, kot da bi bil kdo tam.
No one had money.	Nihče ni imel denarja.
And there is much more.	In še veliko je več.
But that does not seem to be the case.	A zdi se, da ni tako.
It won't be long.	Ne bo dolgo odšel.
Obviously you can't.	Očitno ne moreš.
I would do so.	Tako bi naredil.
Angry was good.	Jezen je bil dober.
I like that too.	Tudi meni je to všeč.
I can't believe it's mine.	Ne morem verjeti, da je moja.
I want to be with him more.	Želim biti več z njim.
I mean obviously.	Mislim očitno.
Even if you're alone.	Tudi če si sam.
I don't know how to feel about this.	Ne vem, kako naj se počutim glede tega.
I have too much work to do.	Imam preveč dela.
Even now he may be doing it.	Tudi zdaj morda to počne.
I hope so.	Upam, da ima.
Hard to leave.	Težko oditi.
I told you earlier.	Prej sem ti rekel.
I thought you did too.	Mislil sem, da tudi ti.
Not for a while, he said.	Ne nekaj časa, je rekel.
That or nothing.	To ali nič.
It's very nice.	Zelo lepo je.
Maybe you're right.	Mogoče imaš prav.
I do not understand that.	Tega ne razumem.
I haven't heard from him in years.	Leta ga nisem slišal.
Now here's the problem.	Zdaj je tukaj problem.
I would definitely be back.	zagotovo bi se vrnil.
He was the only one who wasn't.	Bil je edini, ki ga ni.
I just couldn’t eat it.	Preprosto ga nisem mogel jesti.
It will only get better.	Samo še bolje bo.
We need to work together.	Delati moramo skupaj.
I could still do that.	To bi še lahko storila.
It's not mine!	To ni moje!
Nothing was good.	Nič ni bilo dobro.
It just wasn't true.	Preprosto ni bilo res.
There seemed to be nothing else to do.	Zdelo se je, da ni nič drugega za početi.
I knew right away he had nothing.	Takoj sem vedel, da nima ničesar.
You are never alone.	Nikoli nisi sam.
This could not be more true.	To ne more biti bolj res.
He'll call you at the hotel today.	Danes te bo poklical v hotel.
That's it !.	To je to!.
No, that wasn't it either.	Ne, tudi to ni bilo to.
There! 	Tam!
that's enough for her.	to ji je dovolj.
We have all that.	Vse to imamo.
Not so now.	Zdaj ni tako.
We would go home together.	Domov bi šla skupaj.
He saw her often.	Pogosto jo je videl.
I mean, you saw it.	Mislim, videl si.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
You haven't seen him in a while.	Že nekaj časa ga nisi videl.
I would hear them.	Jaz bi jih slišal.
Don’t think you’re going to make it.	Ne mislite, da vam bo to uspelo.
It feels like.	Počuti se kot.
He called him.	Poklical ga je.
It's almost there now.	Zdaj je skoraj tam.
Even when we are alone, we are never alone.	Tudi ko smo sami, nikoli nismo sami.
But there was much more.	Bilo pa je še veliko več.
I saw it wasn't.	Videl sem, da ni.
He died on me.	Na meni je umrl.
He couldn't see that well.	Ni videl tako dobro.
You will go to school.	V šolo boš šel.
If I had to.	Če bi jo moral.
I didn't know you'd see it that way.	Nisem vedel, da boš to videl tako.
No matter what she said, it would be wrong.	Ne glede na to, kaj je rekla, bi bilo narobe.
Now we're the only ones left.	Zdaj smo edini, ki jih še imamo.
Sometimes they are not sure what to do next.	Včasih niso prepričani, kaj storiti naprej.
Just not with me.	Samo ne z mano.
It's pretty simple.	To je precej preprosto.
And indeed they were.	In res so bili.
I know that.	Vem to.
And she's obviously very interested.	In očitno jo zelo zanima.
I hope not.	Upam, da ni.
I wish this would happen soon.	Želim si, da bi se to zgodilo kmalu.
Or we will be gone.	Ali pa tudi nas ne bo več.
Even more than usual.	Še več kot običajno.
I wish that were true.	Želim si, da bi bilo to res.
This happened for the first time.	To se je zgodilo prvič.
They are not who and what you are.	Niso kdo in kaj si.
He was on me then.	Takrat je bil na meni.
He won't leave.	Ne bo odšel.
I didn't know about all that.	Nisem vedel za vse to.
He came home.	Prišel je domov.
I'll give you something.	Nekaj ​​ti bom dal.
He asked me.	Prosil me je.
Now I know what it is.	Zdaj vem, kaj je.
Why do you want to do this?	Zakaj želite to storiti?
Some of it is already there.	Nekaj ​​od tega je že tam.
There are obviously a lot of them now.	Zdaj je očitno veliko.
Either way, he did what he wanted.	Na vsak način je naredil, kar je hotel.
We've been around for a while.	Smo že nekaj časa.
Not you either.	Tudi ti ne.
That's what a friend told me.	Tako mi je rekel prijatelj.
I've never done that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem naredil.
Because he was still a child.	Ker je bil še otrok.
There is a lot to do here.	Tukaj je veliko za početi.
He worked, worked and worked something else.	Delal je, delal in še nekaj delal.
Now I have nothing on it.	Zdaj nimam nič o tem.
And I have a job.	In imam službo.
One knows them immediately.	Človek jih takoj pozna.
I sat down and said.	Sedel sem in rekel.
I want to tell you that.	To vam želim povedati.
You knew that.	To si vedel.
He has it now, he knows that.	Zdaj ga ima, to ve.
He can't help himself.	Ne more si pomagati.
That's how it can be.	Tako lahko je.
You couldn't know.	Nisi mogel vedeti.
I had a really nice time.	Imel sem se res lepo.
I want fun.	Želim zabavo.
Don't talk about it anymore.	Ne govori več o tem.
Maybe he just went home.	Morda je pravkar odšel domov.
But there seems to be more to it than that.	A zdi se, da je tukaj več kot to.
I expected more.	Pričakoval sem več.
But no one seemed to care.	A zdelo se je, da nikogar ne zanima.
I should go right away.	Takoj bi moral iti.
Looks nice.	Videti lepo.
There was a lot of work.	Bilo je veliko dela.
Again, this is not true.	Še enkrat, to ni res.
Because no one knows what to do with it.	Ker nihče ne ve, kaj naj naredi s tem.
He thought he knew that now.	Mislil je, da zdaj ve tako.
I never said anything like that.	Nikoli nisem rekel kaj takega.
He didn't speak for a long time.	Dolgo ni govoril.
Tomorrow will be better than today, that’s for sure.	Jutri bo bolje kot danes, to je zagotovo.
I don't have any money right now.	Trenutno nimam denarja.
Dad all the time.	Oče ves čas.
That will always be true.	To bo vedno res.
You weren't that one.	Ti nisi bil tisti.
He said well.	Dobro je rekel.
He was still alone.	Še vedno je bil sam.
You're here now.	Zdaj si tukaj.
However, this did not happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
He couldn't tell.	Ni mogel povedati.
No, just not.	Ne, samo ne.
I hope so.	upam, da je.
You have to go.	Moraš iti.
I'm like a.	sem kot a.
I don't believe in that.	Ne verjamem v to.
We can't go on.	Ne moremo naprej.
I am glad to see many of you here today.	Vesel sem, da vas danes vidim veliko tukaj.
The only thing is.	Edina stvar je.
Not even that.	Sploh ne to.
He thought it would be so.	Mislil je, da bo tako.
You may have to be.	Morda boste morali biti.
And she's not here.	In ni je tukaj.
I know it's very good.	Vem, da je zelo dobro.
You have to come out and work.	Moraš priti ven in delati.
She's never been here before.	Še nikoli ni bila tukaj.
Not a bit like that.	Ni malo tako.
No one has been there yet.	Nihče še ni bil tam.
It is hard and serious work.	Je težko in resno delo.
In a way that was good.	Na način, ki je bil dober.
Tell me.	Povej mi.
I just got home.	Pravkar sem prišel domov.
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
She needs to leave.	Oditi je treba.
He did it.	On je to storil.
I don't want to be surprised.	Ne maram biti presenečen.
We both would.	Oba bi.
I can't talk now.	Ne morem govoriti zdaj.
Not even from you.	Niti od tebe.
It's true.	Res je.
Just not today.	Samo danes ne.
Maybe she didn't know.	Morda sama ni vedela.
I lost so much time.	Izgubil sem toliko časa.
This is clearly not happening.	To se očitno ne dogaja.
I let her have her way.	Pustil sem ji, da ima po svoje.
In fact, it wasn’t hard.	Pravzaprav to ni bilo težko.
We like it.	Všeč nam je.
And that's just it.	In to je samo to.
We have too much stuff.	Imamo preveč stvari.
He saw them.	Videl jih je.
That's why you're here alone.	Zato si tukaj sam.
He ate alone.	Jedel je sam.
I'm afraid.	Bojim se.
I hope you are well.	Upam da si dobro.
It had to be done.	To je bilo treba narediti.
But he knows he can't.	A ve, da ne more.
He's like you.	On je kot ti.
I couldn't eat.	nisem mogel jesti.
he asked.	je vprašal.
It will never be again.	Nikoli več ne bo.
Once upon a time, this was life.	Nekoč je bilo to življenje.
To me, what is mine is mine.	Zame je tisto, kar je moje.
I'm doing well.	Dobro mi gre.
He was glad it wasn't.	Bil je vesel, da ni.
And someone else.	In še kdo.
I mean a lot.	mislim veliko.
Today was much better.	Danes je bilo veliko bolje.
I know it and you know it.	Jaz to vem in ti veš.
I know what to do with it.	Vem, kaj storiti s tem.
It seems like nothing ever happened here.	Zdi se, kot da se tukaj ni nikoli nič zgodilo.
I had time to get to know you well.	Imel sem čas, da sem vas dobro spoznal.
.	.
I hope you like them !.	Upam, da so vam všeč!.
Always, no matter what.	Vedno, ne glede na vse.
Which he was.	Kar je bil.
I wish you luck!.	Želim ti srečo!.
He let go.	Pustil je.
He is not human.	On ni človek.
I can't believe he won.	Ne morem verjeti, da je zmagal.
But it can't be helped.	Vendar se ne da pomagati.
Or we were alone.	Ali pa smo bili sami.
But he is.	Ali je on.
Which we just did.	Kar smo pravkar naredili.
I bought this, this, and this.	Kupil sem tega, tega in še tega.
You have to be.	Moraš biti.
Maybe not much, maybe a long time.	Morda ne veliko, morda dolgo.
I don't know who, I don't know how, I don't know why.	Ne vem kdo, ne vem kako, ne vem zakaj.
He will.	On bo.
He's everything you weren't.	On je vse, kar nisi bil.
That's not no either.	Tudi to ni ne.
I know it's him.	Vem, da je on.
It was really quick and easy.	Bilo je res hitro in preprosto.
He was human.	Bil je človek.
But to me.	Ali meni.
I can't believe it now.	Zdaj ne morem verjeti.
In fact, they may not be.	Pravzaprav morda niso.
We never knew what to do.	Nikoli nismo vedeli, kaj narediti.
You're going to have to get out.	Moral boš ven.
I've done this before.	To sem storil že prej.
However, it is there.	Vendar pa je tam.
He said it was true.	Rekel je, da je res.
Here it was all together.	Tukaj je bilo vse skupaj.
This is going to happen now.	To se bo zdaj zgodilo.
Life is so beautiful.	Življenje je tako lepo.
It's really nice.	Res je lepo.
I can't speak at the moment.	Trenutno ne morem govoriti.
Nothing yet, but it's still early.	Nič še, je pa še zgodaj.
I have to go back.	Moram nazaj.
And she likes it.	In ji je všeč.
You never told me that much.	Nikoli mi nisi rekel toliko.
He's that good.	Tako dober je.
But now he was here again.	Zdaj pa je bil spet tukaj.
It was a little good for my life.	Za moje življenje je bilo malo dobro.
And that would be it.	In to bi bilo.
Really good question.	Res dobro vprašanje.
I tried and tried.	Poskušal sem in poskušal.
And maybe it's okay.	In morda je v redu.
She had to.	Morala jih.
He has never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni storil.
It was big.	Bilo je veliko.
I have a question myself.	Tudi sam imam vprašanje.
He thought she was beautiful.	Imel jo je za lepo.
She would love it.	Všeč bi ji bilo.
I really started to like it.	Res mi je začel biti všeč.
I have something.	Imam nekaj.
And he's good.	In dober je.
I would die here.	Tukaj bi umrl.
I am a friend.	jaz sem prijatelj.
Money, he says.	Denar, pravi.
You don't.	Ti pa ne.
He was a father.	Bil je oče.
He simply plays everything.	Preprosto igra vse.
He heard something.	Slišal je nekaj.
He couldn't either, but he wanted to.	Tudi on ni mogel, a je hotel.
That was my thing.	To je bila moja stvar.
He wanted to be that guy.	Želel je biti ta fant.
It was hard to see.	Težko je bilo videti.
I don't think they knew anything.	Mislim, da niso vedeli ničesar.
He did not eat for several days.	Nekaj ​​dni ni jedel.
He won't go.	Noče iti.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da niso.
But it was not.	Vendar je ni bilo.
He didn't want to be.	Ni hotel biti.
I can't see you.	ne morem te videti.
I didn't like it.	Ni mi bilo všeč.
Nobody, ever.	Nihče, nikoli.
And that is exactly what is happening now.	In prav to se zdaj dogaja.
He had to get out of there.	Moral je od tam.
The reason could be the following.	Razlog bi lahko bil naslednji.
Very good.	Zelo dober.
If you like them, fine.	Če so ti všeč, v redu.
I was ready.	Bil sem pripravljen.
I’m sure there was something wrong there too.	Prepričan sem, da je bilo tudi tam nekaj narobe.
That won't be nice.	To ne bo lepo.
Or it could be something else.	Ali pa je lahko kaj drugega.
It's not your time.	Ni tvoj čas.
All this work, for nothing.	Vse to delo, za nič.
Obviously this is not the case.	Očitno temu ni tako.
He became even angrier.	Še bolj je postal jezen.
Good for us.	Dobro za nas.
Obviously this is not going to happen.	Očitno se to ne bo zgodilo.
That's all well and good.	To je vse lepo in prav.
He said she should do what she likes.	Rekel je, da naj počne, kar ji je všeč.
I thought he did a really good job there.	Mislil sem, da je tam opravil res dobro delo.
It was so fast.	Bilo je tako hitro.
He actually played very well.	Pravzaprav je igral zelo dobro.
I'll probably say yes.	Verjetno bom rekel da.
Maybe there are too many of us.	Mogoče nas je preveč.
You just aren't.	Preprosto niste.
No, he was someone.	Ne, bil je nekdo.
I didn't put it there.	Nisem ga dal tja.
You have to go.	Oditi moraš.
That was my only option.	To je bila moja edina možnost.
Not at all.	Niti malo.
You're not there yet.	Nisi še tam.
It's also true that we've been here before.	Res je tudi, da smo že bili tukaj.
He loves you very much.	Zelo te ima rad.
I have to go.	Moram iti.
I've had enough of all this!	Dovolj imam vsega tega!
We never did.	Nikoli nismo.
If it goes, it goes.	Če gre, gre.
He came to us for help.	Prišel je k nam po pomoč.
She knew he wouldn't tell her anything.	Vedela je, da ji ne bo povedal ničesar.
No, nothing tonight.	Ne, nocoj nič.
He didn't even have to play much.	Sploh mu ni bilo treba veliko igrati.
I just worked hard for him.	Samo težko sem mu delal.
It failed again.	Še enkrat ni uspelo.
This is not an option for me.	To zame ni možnost.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
We never had a lot of money.	Nikoli nismo imeli veliko denarja.
He just didn't know how much.	Samo ni vedel koliko.
That's how we should do it.	Tako bi morali to narediti.
We didn't see what we should have seen.	Nismo videli tega, kar bi morali videti.
Maybe that was all.	Morda je bilo to vse.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
What is today.	Kaj je danes.
I have to tell you this, okay.	To ti moram povedati, v redu.
I'm glad you're here with me.	Vesel sem, da si tukaj z mano.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikomur ni povedal.
Life was good again.	Življenje je bilo spet dobro.
That would be my father.	To bi bil moj oče.
I know that would not be enough.	Vem, da to ne bi bilo dovolj.
They are not now.	Zdaj niso.
i know how to know.	vem, kako vedeti.
We didn’t know what to do.	Nismo vedeli, kaj storiti.
But he knew he wasn't.	A vedel je, da ni.
It will never happen.	Nikoli se ne bo zgodilo.
I will never leave here.	Nikoli ne bom odšel od tukaj.
I have a good job.	Imam dobro službo.
What a good boy.	Kako dober fant.
He failed to do so.	Tega mu ni uspelo, da ne bi storil.
I'd really like to.	Zelo rad.
It still is.	Še vedno je.
I love the baby.	Všeč mi je otrok.
I could have told her, but she didn't.	Lahko bi ji povedal, a ni.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
We know where you've been.	Vemo, kje ste bili.
Apparently they didn't.	Očitno niso.
He was gone the day before.	Prejšnji dan ga ni bilo.
You are life to me.	Ti si zame življenje.
I do not know.	Ne vem.
I had a lot to tell him.	Veliko sem mu imel povedati.
And that's what's happening here.	In to se dogaja tukaj.
This has never actually happened.	To se pravzaprav nikoli ni zgodilo.
Not now or never.	Ne zdaj ali nikoli.
I'm done with it.	Opravil sem s tem.
it's really good.	res je dobro.
This life was no longer mine.	To življenje ni bilo več moje.
I need everything there.	Potrebujem vse tam.
That's how I'm supposed to do it.	Tako naj bi to naredil.
No, you didn't do anything wrong.	Ne, nisi naredil nič narobe.
You will do that.	To boš naredil.
We did what we could.	Naredili smo, kar smo lahko.
I will be very sorry.	Zelo mi bo žal.
Not even good.	Niti ni dobro.
I think he's ready for it.	Mislim, da je pripravljen na to.
And there is something behind it.	In nekaj je za tem.
There was no help for that.	Temu ni bilo pomoči.
So someone came and helped me.	Tako je nekdo prišel in mi pomagal.
We need to do better.	Moramo narediti bolje.
I worked for it.	Delal sem za to.
I loved going there.	Rad sem šel tja.
And you can't do anything.	In ne moreš storiti ničesar.
It's really simple.	Res je preprosto.
That's how it is here.	Tukaj je tako.
That was never true.	To nikoli ni bilo res.
Maybe it was right.	Mogoče je bilo prav.
And not so right.	In ne tako prav.
I certainly am.	zagotovo sem.
We have it.	Imamo to.
I will never forget her.	Nikoli je ne bom pozabil.
Now the question is how?	Zdaj je vprašanje, kako?
It's you for me, I for him.	To si ti zame, jaz za njega.
I was really surprised.	Bil sem res presenečen.
From you, if possible.	Od vas, če je mogoče.
I know it's only a matter of time.	Vem, da je samo vprašanje časa.
If not, that's fine too.	Če ne, je tudi to v redu.
.	.
She didn't know it was.	Ni vedela, da je to.
Okay, you met him.	Dobro, spoznal si ga.
I understand what's going on.	Razumem, kaj se dogaja.
That doesn't help.	To ne pomaga.
I just know.	Preprosto vem.
Lots of them, lots, lots.	Veliko jih, veliko, veliko.
No matter, that was enough.	Ni kaj, to je bilo dovolj.
I have to tell her.	Povedati ji moram.
Not ever.	Ne da bi kdaj.
He had been in town for three days, but he was here again.	V mestu je bil že tri dni, a spet je bil tukaj.
Apparently he's up to something.	Očitno nekaj namerava.
I said no.	Rekel sem ne.
That was not the case.	Tega ni bilo.
Now he was convinced of that.	Zdaj je bil prepričan v to.
You are so good.	Tako dober si.
She failed.	Ni ji uspelo.
Never too serious.	Nikoli preveč resno.
No one saw anything wrong with that.	Nihče ni videl nič narobe s tem.
That's why we're here.	Zato smo tukaj.
I saw myself.	Videl sem se.
And he found it.	In našel ga je.
There is no one else, nothing else.	Ni nikogar drugega, nič drugega.
That is what is so difficult.	To je tisto, kar je tako težko.
We didn't know how or why.	Nismo vedeli, kako in zakaj.
He wanted to go to school.	Želel je iti v šolo.
But 'only'.	Ali 'samo'.
I couldn't make them.	Nisem jih mogel narediti.
Until last night.	Do sinoči.
Whether you like it or not.	Ali ti je všeč ali pa ne.
And he knows me.	In on me pozna.
But they were all still alive.	A vsi so bili še živi.
Better that s.	Bolje, da je s.
He thought he could help.	Mislil je, da lahko pomaga.
I have no doubt about that.	O tem ne dvomim.
You'll get a job again.	Spet boš dobil delo.
I bought this for you.	To sem kupil zate.
We'll see about that.	To bomo še videli.
However, you didn’t see any of that.	Vendar pa niste videli ničesar od tega.
I don't know what to do.	Ne vem, kaj storiti.
I wish he wasn't there.	Želim si, da ga ni.
It will be nice to see you.	Lepo te bo videti.
You will have to work on this every day.	Vsak dan boste morali delati na tem.
I will not leave.	ne bom odšel.
They did everything wrong they could.	Naredili so vse narobe, kar so lahko storili.
What? 	Kaj?
she said.	je rekla.
I would go.	Kar šla bi.
I hope for the best.	upam na dobro.
But there was more.	Vendar je bilo več.
I mean, that's what he said he thought.	Mislim, tako je rekel, da misli.
Just like the day before.	Tako kot prejšnji dan.
I mean, a lot of money.	Mislim, veliko denarja.
maybe.	morda.
He had three children.	Imel je tri otroke.
As you wish.	Kot želiš.
And yet the way.	Pa vendar način.
That's how it's done.	Tako se to naredi.
Today they are here, tomorrow they are gone.	Danes so tukaj, jutri jih ni več.
There was nothing to do about it.	Ni bilo kaj storiti glede tega.
And maybe it is.	In morda je.
Actually just a boy.	Pravzaprav samo fant.
I should help with that.	Pri tem bi moral pomagati.
I don't want to be friends with you.	Nočem biti prijatelj s tabo.
So tired.	Tako utrujen .
I understand these people.	Razumem te ljudi.
It was very hard work.	To je bilo zelo težko delo.
They won't be there.	Ne bo jih tam.
I don't know when it will come out.	Ne vem, kdaj pride ven.
He will probably come back to get a lot more.	Verjetno se bo vrnil, da bi dobil še veliko več.
He had to do it now.	Zdaj je moral to storiti.
I've never seen him before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl.
But it was.	Vendar je bilo.
And it is now.	In to je zdaj.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nič ni narobe s tem.
I need help.	Potrebujem pomoč.
And rightly so.	In prav je tako tudi.
It wasn't nice.	Ni bilo lepo.
You don't need it anymore.	Ni ti treba več.
That's how it goes sometimes.	Tako gre včasih.
We need to play better here.	Tukaj moramo igrati bolje.
You should never have come here.	Nikoli ne bi smel priti sem.
So it was pretty nice.	Tako da je bilo kar lepo.
I know he needs me.	Vem, da me potrebuje.
It didn't seem likely.	Ni se zdelo verjetno.
I wonder when that will happen.	Sprašujem se, kdaj se bo to zgodilo.
Dad doesn’t know what he would do to help.	Oče ne ve, kaj bi storil, da bi pomagal.
it's me, you know.	jaz sem, veš.
Do what is possible.	Naredi, kar je mogoče.
He was just a boy.	Bil je samo fant.
I should do it soon.	Moral bi to storiti kmalu.
However, this is unlikely to happen.	Vendar se to verjetno ne bo zgodilo.
He never forgot her.	Nikoli je ni pozabil.
We have it now.	Zdaj ga imamo.
We had to.	Morali smo.
That doesn't help.	To ni v pomoč.
And it might be wrong.	In morda je narobe.
None of this is clearly helping him with that.	Nič od tega mu očitno pri tem ne pomaga.
He didn't do that.	Tega ni storil.
He said nothing.	Nič ni rekel.
You are absolutely right.	Imaš popolnoma prav.
I hope you are OK.	Upam da si v redu.
Not for children.	Ni za otroke.
Probably both are interested.	Verjetno oba zanima.
And that fast.	In to hitro.
Maybe not.	Mogoče pa ni.
And how much.	In koliko.
If I had him, I could have asked him myself.	Če bi ga, bi ga lahko sam vprašal.
They could do very little.	Zelo malo so lahko naredili.
Nobody has anything.	Nihče nima ničesar.
As if someone was waiting.	Kot da je nekdo čakal.
I had it.	Imel sem ga.
And on.	In naprej.
I didn't like it.	ni mi bilo všeč.
It was time for work.	Bil je čas za delo.
He lost his job.	Izgubil je službo.
I don't know what's wrong with her.	Ne vem kaj ji je.
He can't tell me where he's going.	Ne more mi povedati, kam gre.
We have to go home.	Moramo domov.
I like it even more this way.	Na ta način mi je še bolj všeč.
He doesn't need it.	Ni mu treba.
He had nothing to say about it.	O tem ni imel ničesar povedati.
I’m still pretty busy.	Še vedno sem precej zaposlen.
That was not right.	To ni bilo prav.
And like and everything.	In všeč in vse.
This is no longer true.	To ni več res.
It may not be long.	To morda ne bo dolgo.
If we only knew what it was, we would know.	Če bi le vedeli, kaj je to, bi vedeli.
You weren't here.	Nisi bil tukaj.
I realized it was true.	Spoznal sem, da je res.
It was nice to see you again.	Lepo te je bilo spet videti.
I'm not sure he's right.	Nisem prepričan, da je prav.
Now live !.	Zdaj pa živi!.
Just tell me what's going on with you.	Samo povej mi, kaj se dogaja s tabo.
That's pretty good.	To je kar dobro.
That's why we're here.	Zato smo tukaj.
You will see him again.	Še enkrat ga boš videl.
So much had to be done.	Toliko je bilo treba narediti.
Pretty much.	Kar veliko.
He told me .	Mi je povedal .
, from another.	, od drugega.
It's nothing like that.	To ni nič takega.
He looked surprised.	Videti je bil presenečen.
I called him.	poklical sem ga.
It wasn't completely.	Ni bilo popolnoma.
They get a little better every day.	Vsak dan so malo boljši.
If I weren't.	Če ne bi bil.
There is little more to say.	Še malo je za povedati.
There is no such thing.	Tega ni.
I could leave now.	Zdaj bi lahko odšel.
He realized this immediately.	To je takoj spoznal.
It often looks like nothing.	Pogosto je videti kot nič.
But I think it's me.	Mislim pa, da sem to jaz.
And she wanted to do something.	In želela je nekaj narediti.
They saw something.	Nekaj ​​so videli.
You should do it.	Moral bi to narediti.
It was tomorrow.	Bila je jutri.
I got you.	Imam te.
It's okay tonight.	Nocoj je v redu.
And why not.	In zakaj ne.
I thought they were.	Mislil sem, da so.
It's been a long time.	Je kar dolgo.
It's okay.	V redu je.
However, this cannot be done.	Vendar tega ni mogoče storiti.
There is nothing left.	Nič več ni.
You should see after that.	Po tem bi moral videti.
It's hard to see.	Težko je videti.
I've never done that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem naredil.
Now is not the time for that.	Zdaj ni časa za to.
This is not true.	To ni res.
It was never like that.	Nikoli ni bilo tako.
Being like.	Biti kot.
He had no more.	Ni imel več.
There is more to it.	Tega je še več.
I never wanted you, you know.	Nikoli te nisem želel, veš.
Maybe he doesn't even know.	Morda sploh ne ve.
There was no more work for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa ni bilo več dela.
He didn't know that.	Tega ni vedel.
So we can never know.	Tako da nikoli ne moremo vedeti.
It must be him.	To mora biti on.
What he just did was simply not possible.	Kar je pravkar naredil, preprosto ni bilo mogoče.
He didn't see me.	Ni me videl.
A lot of things happened.	Veliko stvari se je zgodilo.
That's my problem.	To je moj problem.
He never did that to me.	Tega mi ni nikoli naredil.
No, probably not.	Ne, verjetno ne.
To work.	Delati.
Then he might not play anymore.	Takrat morda ne bo več igral.
I'm glad I found you.	Vesel sem, da sem vas našel.
And you did well.	In dobro si naredil.
There was something about how they were together.	Bilo je nekaj v tem, kako sta bila skupaj.
He doesn't need you anymore.	Ne potrebuje te več.
That's who you are from today.	To si od danes naprej.
And the next, and the next.	In naslednji, in naslednji.
There is also something else.	Obstaja tudi nekaj drugega.
He wanted a house.	Hotel je hišo.
And it's actually quite difficult.	In pravzaprav je precej težko.
It's actually quite good.	Pravzaprav je kar dobro.
I was three.	Bil sem tri.
Nothing is fast enough.	Nič ni dovolj hitro.
And he won again.	In še enkrat je zmagal.
We have to do things right.	Stvari moramo narediti prav.
And it's true.	In res je.
That's how I feel.	Tako se počutim.
So it was now.	Tako je bilo zdaj.
That would not be easy.	To ne bi bilo lahko.
This has already happened.	To se je že zgodilo.
He won't tell me.	Ne bo mi povedal.
No one knows for sure where the father is.	Nihče ne ve zagotovo, kje je oče.
That's not a problem.	To ni problem.
He came from here.	Prišel je od tukaj.
I know the baby will be a baby.	Vem, da bo otrok otrok.
And we both knew why.	In oba sva vedela zakaj.
I would be happy if I could do this every day.	Vesel bi bil, če bi lahko to počel vsak dan.
For your people.	Za svoje ljudi.
It doesn't help at all.	Prav nič ne pomaga.
Maybe she really wants to see me again.	Mogoče me bo res želela spet videti.
I used to want what you had.	Včasih sem želel, kar si imel.
I'm not even sure she likes it.	Sploh nisem prepričan, da ji je všeč.
He did not ask what had happened to him.	Ni vprašal, kaj se mu je zgodilo.
And so was he.	In tudi on je bil.
This goes on and on.	To gre naprej in naprej.
Like it's the only thing that exists.	Kot da je edina stvar, ki obstaja.
That's what I told her.	Tako sem ji rekel.
I don't need you.	ne potrebujem te.
We had time then.	Takrat smo imeli čas.
How long they have been gone.	Kako dolgo jih ni bilo.
In fact, it is common.	Pravzaprav je pogosto.
Simply do it again.	Spet preprosto to.
And it's more than that.	In je več kot to.
And also in this way.	In tudi na ta način.
No, it's nothing like that.	Ne, ni nič takega.
And very many do not.	In zelo veliko jih ne.
Which is a lot.	Kar je veliko.
I learned a lot from you.	Od tebe sem se veliko naučil.
The work is not easy.	Delo ni lahko.
Mine is not.	Moj ni.
He couldn't go home.	Ni mogel domov.
He liked to do things.	Rad je počel stvari.
But she didn't know if anyone had gone with him.	A da ni vedela, ali je kdo odšel z njim.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
You know how serious.	Veste, kako resno.
I think we have a problem.	Mislim, da imamo težave.
That happened today.	To se je zgodilo danes.
He played right.	Igral je prav.
What is it? 	Kaj je to?
She liked it.	Všeč ji je bil.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
It is nothing, nor does it seem so to you.	Nič ni, niti se vam ne zdi tako.
I will buy more!.	Kupil bom več!.
I didn't even go home.	Sploh nisem šel domov.
And it wasn't nice.	In ni bilo lepo.
But now he's gone too.	Zdaj pa tudi njega ni več.
How good it is to be here.	Kako dobro je, da si tukaj.
I don’t think much goes out.	Mislim, da ne gre veliko ven.
I need to talk to you.	Moram govoriti s tabo.
I mean, you've seen it by now.	Mislim, do zdaj ste že videli.
There is nothing wrong at all.	Sploh ni nič narobe.
I know you better than that.	Poznam te bolje kot to.
I'm sure you'll succeed.	Prepričan sem, da ti bo uspelo.
It really happened.	Res se je zgodilo.
He didn't need it.	Ni ga potreboval.
He's gone.	Ni ga več.
You were really good.	Res si bil dober.
He felt good.	Počutil se je dobro.
I have no doubt about that now.	Zdaj o tem ne dvomim.
I thought.	Mislil sem.
I didn't say.	Nisem rekel.
It should be enough.	Mora biti dovolj.
They just saw things.	Samo videli so stvari.
Something must be done.	Nekaj ​​je treba narediti.
And there he was.	In tam je bil.
Was there nothing like that.	Ali ni bilo nič takega.
I played with it and I liked it.	Igral sem se z njim in mi je bilo všeč.
That would work for me.	To bi mi uspelo.
I have my own car.	Imam svoj avto.
She works for someone else.	Dela za nekoga drugega.
A long time ago.	Dolgo časa nazaj.
We don't know enough.	Ne vemo dovolj.
There was nothing there.	Tam ni bilo nič.
This is not happening now.	To se zdaj ne dogaja.
He just knows.	Samo ve.
Where and when, we don't know.	Kam in kdaj, ne vemo.
So am I.	Tudi jaz sem.
You are my friend.	Ti si moj prijatelj.
There is work.	Tam je delo.
They were alone again for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa so spet bili sami.
He doesn't know anyone.	Ne pozna nikogar.
But that was no longer the case.	A ni bilo več tako.
That's good to believe.	To je dobro verjeti.
He can do almost anything.	Lahko naredi skoraj vse.
I will do this every day forever.	To bom počel vsak dan za vedno.
I don’t even care how it happened.	Sploh me ne zanima, kako se je zgodilo.
Not anymore.	Ne več.
I didn’t need to know more than that.	Ni mi bilo treba vedeti več kot to.
It makes it even better.	Zaradi tega je še bolje.
And that was it.	In to je bilo to.
Sometimes not.	Včasih ne.
And he should be right.	In prav bi moral biti.
He would tell me a little.	Malo bi mi povedal.
I don't need anyone.	ne potrebujem nikogar.
I'm sure he will.	Prepričan sem, da bo.
Either way.	Na vsak način.
I have it here.	Tukaj ga imam.
No, that was wrong too.	Ne, tudi to je bilo narobe.
Completely without him.	Popolnoma brez njega.
I prefer him to him.	Raje ga imam kot njega.
I could tell he wasn't interested.	Lahko bi rekel, da ga ne zanima.
Do you have to go?	Ali moraš iti?
You have to tell me what's going on here.	Moraš mi povedati, kaj se tukaj dogaja.
Just to see what he has to say.	Samo da vidim, kaj bo rekel.
We have to do something.	Nekaj ​​moramo narediti.
I just started.	Pravkar sem začel.
Maybe you should.	Mogoče bi morala.
I didn't even know you were here.	Sploh nisem vedel, da si tukaj.
It was very difficult to be here.	Zelo težko je bilo biti tukaj.
I can't be.	Ne morem biti.
Enough.	Dovolj je.
That was nice.	To je bilo lepo.
We certainly are.	Zagotovo smo.
It really didn’t look too much.	Res ni bilo videti preveč.
If he had.	Če je imel.
Or failed to say.	Ali pa ni uspelo povedati.
I will call him forward now.	Zdaj ga bom poklical naprej.
In bi.	In bi.
Years.	Leta.
I see them.	vidim jih.
I liked that.	To mi je bilo všeč.
Right here.	Prav pri nas.
I wish we all had something for tomorrow.	Želim si, da bi imeli vsi nekaj za jutri.
I think it should be you.	Mislim, da bi to moral biti ti.
You will not succeed.	Ne bo ti uspelo.
I am nothing.	Jaz sem nič.
I can't believe he's gone.	Ne morem verjeti, da ga ni več.
My father was a teacher.	Moj oče je bil učitelj.
I haven't heard anything from him.	Nič nisem slišal od njega.
Please help if you have seen it.	Prosim za pomoč, če ste ga videli.
They won't know anything for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa ne bodo vedeli ničesar.
It will never happen.	Nikoli se ne bo zgodilo.
I never found it.	Nikoli ga nisem našel.
And you are.	In ste .
, no	, ne
I really didn’t know what to think.	Res nisem vedel, kaj naj si mislim.
He was still very happy.	Še vedno je bil zelo vesel.
It seems like nothing is going his way.	Zdi se, kot da mu nič ne gre.
Maybe not for you.	Zate morda ne.
He never knew.	Nikoli ni vedel.
You have to help.	Moraš pomagati.
I was there then too.	Tudi jaz sem bil takrat.
You should too.	Tudi ti bi moral.
It wasn't like that.	Ni bilo tako.
Tomorrow may not be good.	Jutri morda ne bo dobro.
It always will.	Vedno bo.
Not that he will need it.	Ne, da ga bo potreboval.
He wanted to know everything.	Želel je vedeti vse.
For some time.	Za nekaj časa.
I did it.	Uspelo mi je.
He saw everything.	Vse je videl.
He called earlier.	Poklical je prej.
But they are there.	Vendar so tam.
I would say.	Jaz bi rekel.
I waited, but he didn't come back.	Čakal sem, a se ni vrnil.
He doesn't like children.	Ne mara otrok.
I want to believe it is.	Želim verjeti, da je.
She liked him, he knew that.	Všeč ji je bil, to je vedel.
She was home.	Bila je doma.
So much more.	Toliko več.
No matter what comes.	Ne glede na to, kaj pride.
Not even that.	Tudi tega ne.
Tell me the real reason.	Povej mi pravi razlog.
He seemed to be serious.	Zdelo se je, da resno misli.
I really don't know why.	Res ne vem zakaj.
You just did it.	Pravkar si to naredil.
Nobody knew that.	Tega nihče ni vedel.
I don't think so.	Mislim ne res.
Then.	Takrat.
Just like you as a friend.	Tako kot ti kot prijatelj.
It can be much more.	Lahko je veliko več.
It's not in me to tell you no.	Ni v meni, da bi ti rekel ne.
It's simple.	To je preprosto.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
It didn't start well.	Ni dobro začel.
And so it was.	Tako je tudi bilo.
I will not say that here.	Tukaj tega ne bom rekel.
In fact, much more can be said.	Pravzaprav je mogoče povedati še veliko več.
Nice and simple.	Lepo in preprosto.
You are a child.	Ti si otrok.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Vsi so vedeli, da bo tam.
And this has now happened.	In to se je zdaj zgodilo.
They soon did.	Kmalu so to storili.
I'm here tomorrow.	jutri sem tukaj.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
I never knew.	Nikoli nisem vedel.
That's how it seemed to me.	Tako se mi je zdelo.
He's not there.	Ni ga tam.
I wasn’t sure how to play it.	Nisem bil prepričan, kako ga igrati.
It's not enough.	Ni dovolj.
Someone didn't die.	Nekdo ni umrl.
We cannot know.	Ne moremo vedeti.
Nobody came.	Nihče ni prišel.
He's heard it all before.	Vse to je že slišal.
I would never do that at home.	Doma tega ne bi nikoli naredil.
Because nobody knows me.	Ker me nihče ne pozna.
But you could.	Lahko pa bi.
Now you know where you are.	Zdaj veš kje si.
Apparently so again.	Očitno je spet tako.
I'll just tell him.	Samo povedal mu bom.
Little by little you will know about it.	Malo po malo boste vedeli o tem.
Which was obvious.	Kar je bilo očitno.
Well, it's not like that.	Pa ni kar tako.
Again, this is me.	Še enkrat, to sem jaz.
Maybe we do, maybe we don't.	Mogoče imamo, morda ne.
They didn't see me.	Niso me videli.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
He realized he was right.	Spoznal je, da ima prav.
I think you will.	Mislim, da boš.
Maybe I should go.	Mogoče bi moral iti.
But everything seemed very fine.	A vse se je zdelo zelo v redu.
If anyone can help me.	Če mi lahko kdo pomaga.
That's why he wants to come here.	Zato želi priti sem.
It’s actually pretty simple.	Pravzaprav je res precej preprosto.
I really liked it.   	Zelo mi je bilo všeč.   
He's onto you.	On je na vas.
That he doesn't know what's behind him.	Da ne ve, kaj je za njim.
I would too.	jaz bi bil tudi.
Nothing more than that.	Nič več od tega.
I hope you succeed !.	Upam, da vam bo uspelo!.
And if not.	In če ne.
No, no, no.	Ne, ne, ne.
I wouldn't ask again.	Ne bi več vprašal.
That can't be.	Tega ne more biti.
That's right.	Tako smo.
Because it is.	Ker je.
Both.	Oba.
I can and I will.	Lahko in bom.
It probably was.	Verjetno je bilo.
I'm here.	tukaj sem.
Really, we know.	Res, vemo.
Me and me and me and me.	Jaz in jaz in jaz in jaz.
He feels better now.	Zdaj se počuti bolje.
Maybe it's something else.	Morda pa gre za kaj drugega.
I ate almost nothing all day.	Ves dan sem skoraj nič jedel.
And that's absolutely right.	In to je popolnoma prav.
It was a time when they could.	Bil je čas, ko so lahko.
He has never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni storil.
And he talked about it.	In govoril je o tem.
That was the only way.	To je bil edini način.
No, it was more than that.	Ne, bilo je več kot to.
He's a good man, really.	On je dober človek, res.
He didn't know how long.	Ni vedel, kako dolgo.
I'll be back early in the morning.	Vrnil se bom zgodaj zjutraj.
This car is going fast.	Ta avto gre hitro.
He was a child.	Bil je otrok.
If that's what you want.	Če je to tisto, kar želiš.
But it is certainly nothing.	A zagotovo ni nič.
Maybe they still will.	Morda bodo še vedno.
It's actually very nice.	Pravzaprav je zelo lepo.
If they are here.	Če so tukaj.
Could I be.	Ali bi lahko bil.
This has been a problem for years.	To je problem že leta.
We didn't see any children there.	Tam nismo videli otrok.
I didn't see it at all.	Sploh nisem videl.
You should already know that.	To bi že moral vedeti.
It's getting better every week.	Vsak teden je bolje.
I do not believe you.	ne verjamem ti.
No one would say anything.	Nihče ne bi rekel ničesar.
This is not an easy job.	To ni lahko delo.
You're not there yet.	Niste še tam.
Sometimes he just left.	Včasih je preprosto odšel.
I don't know how that's possible.	Ne vem, kako je to mogoče.
No no, it can't be.	Ne ne, ne more biti.
Let him talk to me.	Naj govori z mano.
I'm good at it.	jaz sem dober v tem.
Nothing happened for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa se ni zgodilo nič.
Which we are.	Kar pa smo.
Almost no one was ready for that.	Na to skoraj nihče ni bil pripravljen.
I also began to believe.	Tudi sam sem začel verjeti.
But now I really couldn’t.	Zdaj pa res ne bi mogel.
I think maybe that’s what’s wrong with me.	Mislim, da je morda to tisto, kar je narobe z mano.
There is a lot of work now.	Zdaj je veliko dela.
But he failed.	To pa mu ni uspelo.
And that it could be.	In da bi lahko bilo.
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
And more.	In še več.
She is not afraid.	Se ne boji.
I don't want to see these things anymore.	Nočem več videti te stvari.
That's the only way to play.	Samo tako se lahko igra.
Apparently he didn't.	Očitno tega ni storil.
That's fine with me.	Meni je to v redu.
It was only a matter of time.	Bilo je samo vprašanje časa.
I'm alone now.	Zdaj sem sam.
That is.	To je.
I had it.	Imel sem ga.
Not that he expected anything.	Ne, da je kaj pričakoval.
I've never been here before.	Še nikoli nisem bil tukaj.
It's really simple.	Res je preprosto.
As it was, there wasn't much wrong.	Tako kot je bilo, ni bilo veliko narobe.
I came here.	Sem sem prišel.
It's never okay enough.	Nikoli dovolj ni v redu.
I am human and human.	Sem človek in človek.
Because she was.	Ker je bila to.
I have time.	imam čas.
I do not understand	ne razumem
Alone.	Sama.
I never heard back.	Nikoli nisem slišal nazaj.
He always talks.	Vedno govori.
Maybe better than that.	Morda bolje kot to.
I should.	Bi moral.
And he's right.	In prav je.
And you have it.	In imaš ga.
Again, I’m not happy about that.	Spet nisem vesel zaradi tega.
I was never the one to do that.	Nikoli nisem bil tisti, ki bi to naredil.
I don't know anything like that.	Ne poznam nič takega.
That's him.	To je on.
They really were.	Res so bili.
It wasn't like that.	Ni bilo tako.
I will never do that again.	Tega ne bom nikoli več storil.
This is where everything goes wrong.	Tukaj gre vse narobe.
About the money.	Glede denarja.
He did everything he could, and none of it was enough.	Naredil je vse, kar je bilo mogoče, in nič od tega ni bilo dovolj.
I would tell her something.	Nekaj ​​bi ji rekel.
Nice to see you.	Lepo te je videti.
And maybe he knows how he's doing.	In morda ve, kako mu gre.
And so you can.	In tako lahko.
It won't be okay.	Ne bo v redu.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
It doesn't do you any good.	Nič vam ne naredi.
We've done this before.	To smo storili že prej.
I see I do a lot of that.	Vidim, da to počnem veliko.
Some money is better than no money.	Nekaj ​​denarja je bolje kot nič denarja.
I feel fast.	Počutim se hitro.
I never got the money.	Nikoli nisem dobil denarja.
And heard again.	In spet slišal.
I love how he went out.	Všeč mi je, kako je šel ven.
He didn't want to be there anymore.	Ni hotel biti več tam.
You told me you were.	Rekel si mi, da si.
This has never happened before.	To se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
Today, not tomorrow.	Danes, ne jutri.
I know you've never seen me before.	Vem, da me še nikoli nisi videl.
Not even that.	Tudi tega ne.
He went after it and got it.	Šel je za njim in ga dobil.
I think it's okay.	Mislim, da je v redu.
Which I don't.	Kar jaz ne.
But it wasn’t just that.	Vendar ni bilo samo to.
She went to work quickly.	Hitro je šla v službo.
It's about me.	Gre za mene.
And we don't know why.	In ne vemo zakaj.
I think that's really the case.	Mislim, da je temu res tako.
You would love it.	Všeč bi vam bilo.
No one has ever seen it before.	Nihče ga še nikoli ni videl.
Good.	Dobro.
I actually saw too much.	Pravzaprav sem videl preveč.
Which they often did.	Kar so pogosto storili.
That would be fine.	To bi bilo v redu.
But now I can see.	Zdaj pa lahko vidim.
I don't know what's right.	Ne vem, kaj je prav.
You have to do that.	To moraš storiti.
She told me that once.	Enkrat mi je to rekla.
We have to do something.	Nekaj ​​moramo narediti.
I think it was just time.	Mislim, da je bil samo čas.
You just said that.	Pravkar si tako rekel.
He will definitely come.	Zagotovo bo prišel.
This is not my job.	To ni moje delo.
She told herself that he would be fine.	Rekla si je, da bo z njim vse v redu.
Ni.	Ni.
They are not many.	Niso veliko.
In fact, he had never seen her before.	Pravzaprav je še nikoli ni videl.
Today, it is as if this never happened.	Danes je, kot da se to nikoli ni zgodilo.
That must be the reason.	To mora biti razlog.
I heard it myself.	Sam sem slišal.
I didn't feel well.	Nisem se počutil dobro.
That's right.	Tako je.
Maybe that was my problem.	Mogoče je bil to moj problem.
You really should know that.	To bi res moral vedeti.
I was lucky to get a job.	Imel sem srečo, da sem dobil službo.
Too many people.	Preveč ljudi.
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
I believe you did it for me.	Verjamem, da si to naredil zame.
I made up my mind, the boy said.	Odločil sem se, je rekel fant.
Time always goes on.	Čas gre vedno naprej.
But he knew he was there.	Vedel pa je, da je tam.
This was my first time.	To je bilo zame prvič.
I couldn't do anything with it.	S tem nisem mogel narediti ničesar.
He heard and saw enough.	Dovolj je slišal in videl.
He often did this.	Pogosto je to počel.
Here and there and there.	To tukaj, pa tam in tam.
He made it himself.	Naredil ga je sam.
No matter the time we had.	Ne glede na čas, ki smo ga imeli.
Now was the time.	Zdaj je bil čas.
But no one went out, just sat there.	Nihče pa ni šel ven, samo je sedel tam.
That's all right.	Vse to je v redu.
I'm probably thinking of another.	Verjetno mislim na drugega.
You know it happened.	Saj veš, da se je zgodilo.
I'm sure you'll be fine.	Prepričan sem, da boš v redu.
Now that's gone.	Zdaj tega ni več.
But you have to do it for all of us.	Vendar moraš to storiti za vse nas.
There are very few people.	Zelo malo ljudi je.
They just didn't know.	Preprosto niso vedeli.
He taught me everything.	Vsega me je naučil.
He let it go for now.	Za zdaj je pustil.
Much better.	Veliko bolje.
I'm sorry about that.	Žal mi je za to.
We would do anything for you.	Za vas bi naredili vse.
I said he was fine and he was.	Rekel sem, da je v redu in je bil.
Probably never.	Verjetno ne nikoli.
That just can’t be true.	To preprosto ne more biti res.
But they had to do it.	Vendar so morali to storiti.
I almost walked out.	Skoraj sem odšel ven.
It was good then.	Takrat je bilo dobro.
I can not believe.	Ne morem verjeti.
It no longer exists, it no longer exists.	Ne obstaja več, ne obstaja več.
He is ready for you, totally ready.	Pripravljen je na vas, popolnoma pripravljen.
I don't think he ever came back after that.	Mislim, da se po tem ni nikoli vrnil.
They weren't.	Niso bili.
There is much more.	Obstaja veliko več.
It's not about you.	Ne gre zate.
Do it right and it exists.	Naredi to prav in obstaja.
He was very angry about what happened.	Bil je zelo jezen zaradi tega, kar se je zgodilo.
I think he'll like you when he meets you.	Mislim, da mu boš všeč, ko te bo spoznal.
There was not much to talk about.	Ni bilo veliko za govoriti.
We have to do that.	To moramo storiti.
It's simple.	To je preprosto.
Everyone is doing much better.	Vsem gre veliko bolje.
Also quite.	Tudi precej.
All this is not always possible.	Vse to ni vedno mogoče.
he thought.	mislil je.
I want my room.	Želim svojo sobo.
All three like that.	Vse tri tako.
She told him not to do that anymore.	Rekla mu je, naj tega ne počne več.
You have three.	Imaš tri.
That was mine now.	To je bil moj zdaj.
And there it was.	In tam je bilo.
And that doesn’t exist at the moment.	In to trenutno ne obstaja.
He may not eat.	Morda ne bo jedel.
You haven't been here in years.	Ni vas že več let.
They can be very good.	Zelo dobro so lahko.
He didn't want to do that.	Ni hotel, da to stori.
I really liked it.	Zelo mi je bil všeč.
That is not enough either.	Tudi to ni dovolj.
Not now, not yet.	Ne zdaj, ne še.
They didn't see us.	Niso nas videli.
This one is good.	Ta je dobra.
I do not know when.	ne vem kdaj.
It was so hard.	Bilo je tako težko.
Or not.	Ali pa ne.
Very very difficult.	Zelo zelo težko.
I gave it to him.	To sem mu dal.
I came back for you.	Vrnil sem se po vas.
All right, here it is.	V redu, tukaj je.
Who felt that way.	Kdo se je tako počutil.
He left me his car.	Pustil mi je svoj avto.
Just a minute.	Samo malo.
It can only be given.	Lahko se le da.
It was the same here.	Tudi tukaj je bilo tako.
It's fast.	Hitro je.
I didn’t know what happened.	Nisem vedel, kaj se je zgodilo.
The boy doesn't know what he's talking about.	Fant ne ve, kaj govori.
Or just out.	Ali pa kar ven.
He can't stay put.	Ne more ostati na mestu.
No one has done that yet.	Tega še nihče ni storil.
It seemed a long time.	Zdelo se je dolgo.
And even that may not be enough.	In tudi to morda ne bo dovolj.
There was something before that.	Pred tem je bilo nekaj.
Really, we are.	Res, smo.
I think it's a game.	Mislim, da je to igra.
Enough has already happened.	Dovolj se je že zgodilo.
He could see that.	To je lahko videl.
None of this will happen.	Nič od tega ne bo.
I would like to see more of this!.	Rad bi videl več tega!.
I wouldn't wait.	ne bi čakal.
But a.	Ali a.
No one knew where he was.	Nihče ni vedel, kje je.
I wonder when that was at all.	Sprašujem se, kdaj je to sploh bilo.
They had very little time.	Imeli so zelo malo časa.
Certainly not.	Zagotovo niso.
Because there was nothing else to do.	Ker ni bilo kaj drugega početi.
I'm not sure about that.	o tem nisem prepričan.
It should be you.	Moral bi biti ti.
There was nothing there.	Tam ni bilo ničesar.
When he is gone, he is gone.	Ko ga ni več, ga ni več.
There is nothing we can do for now.	Za zdaj ne moremo storiti ničesar.
Feel good.	Počuti se dobro.
Now you know why.	Zdaj veš zakaj.
It could be nothing.	Lahko bi bilo nič.
I have to stay put.	Moram ostati na mestu.
I wouldn't know how to proceed.	Ne bi vedela, kako naprej.
Yes, they knew about it.	Da, vedeli so za to.
He just was.	Samo je bil.
Simple as can be.	Preprosto, kot se le da.
Everything was very good.	Vse je bilo zelo dobro.
Why is he so afraid?	Zakaj se tako boji?
However, he failed to do so.	Vendar mu to ni uspelo.
More is needed immediately.	Takoj je treba več.
I would want that too.	Tudi jaz bi to želel.
That's right.	Tako je.
I shouldn't be surprised.	Ne bi smel biti presenečen.
There are too many of them.	Preveč jih je.
It seemed a long time.	Zdelo se je dolgo.
None of this happened.	Nič od tega se ni zgodilo.
Do it.	Naredi to.
That may not be enough.	To morda ne bo dovolj.
What a good time.	Kako dober čas.
She only knew she had to talk to him.	Vedela je le, da mora govoriti z njim.
I didn't want that for you.	Tega nisem hotel zate.
I was waiting for him to come home.	Čakal sem, da pride domov.
I asked for what.	Vprašal sem za kaj.
I mean, absolutely.	Mislim, popolnoma.
My father decided he would.	Moj oče se je odločil, da bo.
If you really want to, you will.	Če si res želiš, boš.
It won't be anymore.	Ne bo več.
But he wasn't the only one.	Vendar ni bil edini.
I just came to say that.	Prišel sem povedati samo to.
This is often possible.	Pogosto je to mogoče.
And so.	In tako.
That's because there weren't many of them.	To je zato, ker jih ni bilo veliko.
I was really lucky to find her.	Res sem imel srečo, da sem jo našel.
I really like it.	Res mi je všeč.
He was probably everyone.	Verjetno je bil vsem.
Sam never did.	Sam nikoli ni.
It’s hard to talk about it.	Težko je govoriti o tem.
These are problems.	To so težave.
I'm too busy today.	Danes sem preveč zaposlen.
You have to get out.	Moraš priti ven.
Something happened.	Nekaj ​​se je zgodilo.
She knew better now.	Zdaj je vedela bolje.
And someone loved him.	In nekdo ga je imel rad.
I knew it really wasn’t my thing.	Vedel sem, da to res ni moja stvar.
Because this is not an option.	Ker to ni možnost.
I can't do it.	Ne morem narediti.
What can be done?	Kaj je mogoče storiti?
Maybe not all.	Mogoče ne vsega.
You had to do this before.	To ste morali storiti že prej.
He waited for her all day.	Čakal jo je ves dan.
The boy today is simply not alone.	Fant danes preprosto ni sam.
It's not like that for everyone.	Ni za vse tako.
I kept hearing things.	Kar naprej sem slišal stvari.
There's no one there.	Nikogar ni tam.
Tell me how you are.	Povej mi, kako si.
I'm sorry about that.	Žal mi je za to.
He knew he had to leave.	Vedel je, da mora oditi.
I want something.	Rad bi nekaj.
You have to move on.	Moraš naprej.
Not so.	Ni tako.
He was truly alone now.	Zdaj je bil res sam.
No one saw him.	Nihče ga ni videl.
I'm not feeling well.	Ne počutim se dobro.
Except it was much more than that.	Le da je bilo veliko več kot to.
He knew we had him.	Vedel je, da ga imamo.
Now it is not possible to know anything for sure.	Zdaj ni mogoče vedeti ničesar zagotovo.
That's what's so beautiful about it.	To je tisto, kar je tako lepo.
Above that.	Nad tem.
I had to do it myself.	To sem moral narediti sam.
It was still an option.	Še vedno je bila možnost.
That would be the only way.	To bi bil edini način.
That was tomorrow.	To je bilo jutri.
I want to know if that was the case or not.	Rad bi vedel, ali je bilo tako ali ne.
But they are not the only ones.	Niso pa edini.
You're more.	Več si.
And a lot of work.	In veliko dela.
My father has a lot of money.	Moj oče ima veliko denarja.
He didn't come to me.	Ni prišel k meni.
Maybe he wants me to feel that way.	Mogoče želi, da se tako počutim.
Now we know why.	Zdaj vemo zakaj.
That was not a problem here.	To ni bil problem tukaj.
I loved working with him.	Všeč mi je bilo delati z njim.
He loves her very much.	Zelo jo ima rad.
That's when he said it.	Takrat je to rekel.
Not tonight.	Nocoj pa ne.
He can also speak.	Zna tudi govoriti.
We'll see what happens.	Bomo videli, kaj se bo zgodilo.
I would really like to see that.	To bi res rad videl.
We still have some time.	Imamo še nekaj časa.
I'm going now.	zdaj grem.
They were probably right.	Verjetno so imeli prav.
In this, but not in everything.	V tem, a ne v vsem.
There is something wrong here.	Tukaj je nekaj narobe.
It could be.	Lahko bi bilo.
We also have quite a few.	Imamo jih tudi kar nekaj.
Nobody actually says that.	Tega pravzaprav nihče ne pravi.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
I also don’t know why he did it.	Tudi jaz ne vem, zakaj je to storil.
He's ready to go.	Pripravljen je iti.
We did it well.	To nam je dobro uspelo.
We saw that.	To smo videli.
It doesn't work.	Ne gre.
And maybe he's right.	In morda ima prav.
Because we don't know that.	Ker tega ne vemo.
I think you're right.	Mislim, da imaš prav.
Maybe it's wrong.	Morda je narobe.
That may be okay, maybe not.	To je lahko v redu, morda ne.
I'm sure we will.	Prepričan sem, da bomo.
Like this morning.	Kot danes zjutraj.
We all know that already.	To že vsi vemo.
What could I be.	Kaj bi sploh lahko.
He had a house there.	Tam je imel hišo.
He was the only child.	Bil je edini otrok.
They will have more.	Imeli bodo več.
Not right or wrong.	Ni prav ali narobe.
And so he does.	In tako tudi počne.
I had to do good.	Moral sem narediti dobro.
If he went out.	Če je šel ven.
This is something else.	To je nekaj drugega.
And he talked about.	In govoril je o.
It was a good day.	Bil je dober dan.
It's just me.	To sem samo jaz.
He was right to do so.	Prav je bilo, da je tako storil.
This is a possibility.	To je možnost.
We would not succeed.	Ne bi nam uspelo.
I knew you would come back.	Vedel sem, da se boš vrnil.
It was just time.	Samo čas je bil.
This does not appear to be the case.	Ni videti, da je temu tako.
And that was not the question.	In to ni bilo vprašanje.
He knew everything he needed to know.	Vedel je vse, kar je moral vedeti.
I felt like a child again.	Spet sem se počutil kot otrok.
I've never seen him work, not even here.	Nikoli ga nisem videl delati, sploh ne tukaj.
I have a lot to tell you.	Veliko ti moram povedati.
It was nice to see you.	Lepo te je bilo videti.
It is very, very difficult.	Zelo, zelo težko je.
You've been with me all day.	Ves dan si bil z mano.
I know better now.	Zdaj vem bolje.
As we now know, this is not the case.	Kot zdaj vemo, temu ni tako.
And neither do you.	In tudi ti ne.
I do not doubt.	ne dvomim.
Yes, sometimes it is done.	Da, včasih se to naredi.
I can not believe.	Ne morem verjeti.
He knows he can.	Ve, da lahko.
That can't be good.	To ne more biti dobro.
In fact, he preferred it.	Pravzaprav je imel raje.
You can have something else if you want.	Lahko imaš kaj drugega, če želiš.
I should leave, and I should leave now.	Moral bi oditi in oditi bi moral takoj.
He had a chance.	Imel je priložnost.
So he returned to work the next day.	Tako se je naslednji dan vrnil na delo.
You will leave.	Odšel boš.
You met him.	Spoznal si ga.
You could be me.	Lahko bi bili jaz.
He will return home next week.	Naslednji teden se bo vrnil domov.
It's good out of this now.	Zdaj je že dobro iz tega.
I don't think you can do that.	Mislim, da tega ne moreš.
I was not happy about it.	Nisem bil vesel tega.
Probably never actually.	Verjetno pravzaprav nikoli.
Maybe too much.	Morda preveč.
This is simply not true.	To preprosto ni res.
Even if it is.	Tudi če to.
I don't know anything.	ne vem nič.
From there, I knew we were going to have trouble.	Od tam sem vedel, da bomo imeli težave.
And she liked it.	In všeč ji je bil.
There were many of them.	Bilo jih je veliko.
Without it, we would be much better off.	Brez tega bi nam bilo veliko bolje.
Apparently he couldn't eat either.	Očitno tudi jesti ni mogel.
It would be nice.	Bilo bi lepo.
I think it's there.	Mislim, da je tam.
I doubt that will happen.	Dvomim, da se bo to zgodilo.
That he had enough money that he didn’t have to work anymore.	Da je imel dovolj denarja, da mu ni bilo treba več delati.
I will be more than ready.	Bom več kot pripravljen.
He is often right.	Pogosto ima prav.
And it's true.	In res je.
There were too many of them.	Bilo jih je preveč.
We did that.	To smo storili.
A man everyone liked.	Človek, ki je bil vsem všeč.
I know we have a lot of things.	Vem, da se imamo veliko stvari.
More seriously.	Resno bolj.
There was no time to eat.	Ni bilo časa za jesti.
It's simple who he is.	Preprosto je, kdo je.
You've seen this before.	To ste že videli.
He doesn't like me.	Ne mara me.
Well, he has to.	Pa mora.
There didn't seem to be much else to say.	Ni bilo videti veliko drugega za povedati.
But that's not a problem.	Vendar to ni problem.
He wanted to do more than that.	Želel je narediti več kot to.
Not that day.	Ne tisti dan.
It was obviously not good.	Očitno ni bilo dobro.
No one expected that.	Nihče tega ni pričakoval.
But not just work.	A ne samo delo.
That's how it should be.	Tako naj bi bilo.
He knew it would be hard for him.	Vedel je, da mu bo to težko.
Someone was in me.	Nekdo je bil v meni.
And he just doesn't want to eat.	In preprosto noče jesti.
I need help with that.	Potrebujem pomoč pri tem.
I think so.	Mislim jaz.
It seemed so, too.	Zdelo se je tudi.
She had to get out.	Morala je ven.
I was just here.	Bil sem samo tukaj.
It’s early, so it’s still time.	Zgodaj je, tako da je še čas.
I know because they were there too.	Vem, ker so bili tudi tam.
I can't tell you right now.	Trenutno ti ne morem povedati.
There's something going on here.	Tukaj se nekaj dogaja.
That would not be easy.	To ne bi bilo lahko.
But he didn't tell anyone.	A nikomur ni nič rekel.
I went and did this thing again.	Šel sem in spet naredil to stvar.
I didn't have to be with him.	Ni mi bilo treba biti z njim.
He just wants to talk.	Želi samo govoriti.
He didn't know she was going to do it.	Ni vedel, da bo to storila.
I need to know how he managed that.	Moram vedeti, kako mu je to uspelo.
It was much, much more.	Bilo je veliko, veliko več.
More than that.	Več kot to.
And it can be a good life.	In lahko je dobro življenje.
We know how they are.	Vemo, kako so.
I wonder who could be giving us trouble.	Sprašujem se, kdo bi nam lahko delal težave.
From now on.	Od zdaj naprej.
He's just alone.	On je samo sam.
There is no help for that.	Ni pomoči za to.
I mean, hard.	Mislim, težko.
This one is with us.	Ta je pri nas.
That's how it really is to be me.	Tako je res biti jaz.
I would be a friend for a long time.	Še dolgo bi bil prijatelj.
I know this is wrong.	Vem, da je to narobe.
Even if I wanted to.	Tudi če bi hotel.
I like some of that.	Všeč mi je nekaj tega.
He still lives there.	Tam še vedno živi.
What is not obvious is why.	Kar ni očitno, je zakaj.
I don't think it's right.	Ne zdi se mi prav.
I'm afraid.	Bojim se.
In fact, it is so right.	Pravzaprav je tako prav.
I mean, not good at all.	Mislim, sploh ni dobro.
I see her.	vidim jo.
The question is whether this is really the case.	Vprašanje je, ali je res tako.
I don't understand how.	Ne razumem kako.
Maybe he didn't like it.	Mogoče mu ni bilo všeč.
It is right that he was.	Prav je, da je bil.
This is sometimes hard to do.	To je včasih težko narediti.
something.	nekaj.
I was trying to do something like that.	Poskušal sem narediti nekaj takega.
He didn't start talking.	Ni začel govoriti.
And yet he seems to have done so.	In vendar se zdi, da je to storil.
That's how it goes.	Tako to gre.
You can have a house.	Lahko imaš hišo.
He thought he did.	Mislil je, da je to storil.
I'm sure of so little.	Prepričan sem v tako malo.
He wanted to do what was right.	Želel je narediti, kar je prav.
It's very nice, isn't it?	Zelo lepo je, kajne?
It will happen, it will happen, it is happening.	Zgodilo se bo, zgodilo se bo, dogaja se.
It was something else.	Bilo je nekaj drugega.
That was a lot.	To je bilo veliko.
There is no need to do anything for now.	Za zdaj ni treba storiti ničesar.
Not even today.	Tudi danes ni.
He had to come back.	Moral je priti nazaj.
You have that option.	Imaš to možnost.
I learned a little more, but not much.	Naučil sem se malo več, a ne veliko.
He knew nothing more.	Nič več ni vedel.
We liked it.	Všeč nam je bilo.
When she was here, everyone was better.	Ko je bila tukaj, je bilo vsem bolje.
You should go.	Moral bi iti.
I'm ready for that.	Na to sem pripravljen.
I couldn't tell him.	Nisem mu mogel povedati.
Everything here was and is.	Vse tukaj je bilo in je.
And what does anyone need.	In kaj kdo potrebuje.
None of that.	Nič od tega.
Just in the room.	Samo v sobi.
We all have to work together.	Vsi moramo delati skupaj.
i will know how.	bom vedel kako.
Too much work.	Preveč dela.
It will be very nice.	Zelo lepo bo.
Nobody wants to stay here.	Nihče ne želi ostati tukaj.
Three years earlier.	Tri leta prej.
For years.	Že leta.
I don't understand that.	Ne razumem tega.
You came and did something.	Prišel si in nekaj naredil.
We never will.	Nikoli ne bomo.
That's why he's a good boy.	Zato je dober fant.
There is nothing wrong with me.	Nič ni narobe z mano.
Everything he expected did not happen.	Vse, kar je pričakoval, se ni zgodilo.
My father was there.	Moj oče je bil tam.
I will wait for you.	Pričakoval te bom.
It seemed to him that he could ask.	Zdelo se mu je, da bi lahko vprašal.
Life goes on.	Življenje gre naprej.
We have to go!	Moramo iti!
I hope this helps.	Upam, da to pomaga.
However, this is not enough.	Vendar to ni dovolj.
So good for you!!.	Tako dobro zate!!.
Firstly, a.	Prvič, a.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
We are not.	Nismo.
But this is no longer the case.	A temu ni več tako.
And nice enough.	In dovolj lepo.
If they did it at all.	Če so to sploh storili.
And you shouldn't.	In ne bi smel.
Because it's not true.	Ker ni res.
I do not understand.	ne razumem.
Like right now, here with you.	Kot zdaj, tukaj s tabo.
I'll say it again, just.	Še enkrat bom rekel, samo.
That was a lot.	To je bilo veliko.
I got it back.	Dobil sem ga nazaj.
They did that.	To so storili.
They had more time.	Imeli so več časa.
I want you to think about tomorrow.	Želim, da misliš na jutri.
He was a child.	Bil je otrok.
It's for me.	Zame je to.
In fact, it was pretty simple.	Pravzaprav je bilo precej preprosto.
I'm a little interested in that too.	Tudi mene to malo zanima.
He lives in the city.	Živi v mestu.
That doesn’t help make it any better.	To ne pomaga, da bi bilo nič bolje.
Almost nothing.	Skoraj nič.
And I thought she really liked me.	In mislil sem, da sem ji res všeč.
You did well.	Dobro si naredil.
In fact, he has.	Pravzaprav ima.
He liked it very much.	Zelo mu je bil všeč.
Maybe who she was.	Mogoče kdo je bila.
We should talk.	Morali bi govoriti.
He did a few things, but not many.	Naredil je nekaj stvari, a ne veliko.
He was not a good father either.	Tudi on ni bil dober oče.
I'm actually sure.	Pravzaprav sem prepričan.
Not so now.	Zdaj ni tako.
I have to be here.	Tukaj moram biti.
He wanted to do it.	Želel je to narediti.
The car was still there.	Avto je bil še vedno tam.
I played it all the time at home.	Igral sem jo ves čas doma.
No, he doesn't need it.	Ne, ni mu treba.
I still had to see how my father was.	Še vedno sem moral videti, kako je moj oče.
He knew, not me.	On je vedel, ne jaz.
Me too.	Tudi mi.
Or almost everyone.	Ali skoraj vsi.
Maybe so and maybe not.	Mogoče je tako in morda ne.
You really were.	Res si bil.
You don't mean it.	Ne misliš tega.
He didn't need it.	Ni ga potreboval.
You think you need to know.	Misliš, da moraš vedeti.
Or so it sometimes seemed.	Ali tako se je včasih zdelo.
Why would.	Zakaj bi.
The one who is not afraid of him.	Tisti, ki se ga ne boji.
There is something else.	Obstaja nekaj drugega.
Which he didn't do.	Kar pa ni storil.
I wasn't happy about that.	Nisem bil vesel tega.
You obviously like it.	Očitno ti je všeč.
I used to tell him that.	Včasih sem mu tako rekel.
Maybe not.	Mogoče pa ne.
Just work.	Samo delo.
He wants to believe, but he is afraid.	Želi verjeti, a se boji.
So glad you're home.	Tako vesel, da si doma.
And yet it is here.	In vendar je tukaj.
This is difficult.	To pa je težko.
I thought I could be.	Mislil sem, da bi lahko bil.
I think we could do that.	Mislim, da bi to lahko storili.
Now that money is gone.	Zdaj tega denarja ni več.
He was the one who would help me.	On je bil tisti, ki mi bo pomagal.
I was just a boy.	Bil sem samo fant.
So he stayed with him.	Zato je ostal z njim.
It was also true.	Tudi res je bilo.
I am sure.	Prepričan sem.
Which you know for sure.	Kar zagotovo veš.
It was never a question of if.	Nikoli ni bilo vprašanje, če.
There was no need.	Ni bilo treba.
He says he will find the money.	Pravi, da bo našel denar.
I got it right.	Dobro sem dobil.
angry.	jezen.
If I only knew what it was.	Ko bi le vedela, kaj je.
I'm so glad I found you.	Tako sem vesel, da sem te našel.
You asked for it.	Prosil si za to.
He's not here either.	Tudi on ni tukaj.
Here's what it comes down to.	Tukaj je to, na kaj gre.
I can't tell you anything else.	Ne vem vam povedati ničesar drugega.
I mean, he really knows what he's doing.	Mislim, res ve, kaj počne.
And he won't give us money.	In ne bo nam dal denarja.
And yet this is still happening to me.	Pa vendar se mi to še vedno dogaja.
You should have come earlier.	Moral bi priti prej.
She knew nothing about it.	O tem ni vedela nič.
I still have some work to do.	Imam še nekaj dela.
It's a person.	To je oseba.
Being too much.	Biti preveč.
But it was difficult.	Vendar je bilo težko.
She did it.	Uspelo ji je.
We could do it again.	Še enkrat bi to lahko storili.
And maybe we are.	In morda smo.
Not that he thought he would.	Ne da je mislil, da bo.
Something like this has never happened to me before.	Kaj takega se mi še ni zgodilo.
I don't think it's easy.	Mislim, da ni lahko.
I won't let him do that.	Ne bom mu dovolil tega.
And every reason for that.	In vsak razlog za to.
She knew that.	To je vedela.
You did it all.	Vse si naredil.
I was there when he died.	Bil sem tam, ko je umrl.
You are not alone in this.	V tem nisi sam.
And there is more to it.	In tega je še več.
I'm glad to be here.	Vesel sem, da sem tukaj.
I have no money.	Nimam denarja.
He kept talking and talking.	Kar naprej je govoril in govoril.
Someone had to do it.	Nekdo je moral to storiti.
I know he does.	Vem, da ve.
There are so many more!	Še toliko jih je!
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni več.
I have to stay.	moram ostati.
I believe you are so good.	Verjamem, da si tako dober.
He's not here.	Ni ga tukaj.
I knew it was true.	Vedel sem, da je res.
I was quite happy.	Bil sem precej vesel.
She had known for a long time that this was going to happen.	Že dolgo je vedela, da se bo to zgodilo.
And she did.	In to je storila.
So it was really nice.	Tako da je bilo res lepo.
You really won't like this one.	Ta ti res ne bo všeč.
That was true.	To je bilo res.
We are completely alone.	Popolnoma smo sami.
Obviously not.	Očitno ni tako.
I need to see you.	Moram te videti.
I asked for it.	Prosil sem za to.
Perhaps there was none of that.	Morda nič od tega ni bilo.
I don't think you were there.	Mislim, da te ni bilo tam.
She wanted to tell him a lot of things.	Veliko stvari mu je želela povedati.
Life here has never been easy.	Tukaj življenje nikoli ni bilo lahko.
He needs to know they are there.	Vedeti mora, da so tam.
It only happened once.	Zgodilo se je le enkrat.
I know too much.	Preveč vem.
I will be there for you as you were for me.	Tam bom zate, kot si bil ti zame.
And you can.	In lahko.
You won't walk away from it.	Ne boš odšel od tega.
No, you should go.	Ne, moral bi iti.
Here is what he learned.	Tukaj je tisto, kar se je naučil.
I haven't seen that before.	Tega še nisem videl.
It was nice to see him.	Lepo ga je bilo videti.
How was it before?	Kako je bilo prej?
That's more than that.	To je več kot to.
It took me a while to get out.	Potreboval sem nekaj časa, da sem prišel ven.
He worked all day.	Ves dan je delal.
They didn't see her.	Niso je videli.
A few years, maybe more.	Nekaj ​​let, morda več.
No one from there knew who that person was.	Nihče od tam ni vedel, kdo je ta oseba.
Who would we be?	Kdo bi bili mi.
She said no one was home.	Rekla je, da ni nikogar doma.
We have fun!	Imamo zabavo!
And you had it.	In ti si ga imel.
However, this is not the only option.	Vendar to ni edina možnost.
I'm going out.	grem ven.
Today, many people work from home.	Danes veliko ljudi dela doma.
He will eat.	Jedel bo.
The boy needed help.	Fant je potreboval pomoč.
Luckily she was there.	V srečo je bila, da je bila tam.
He liked the man.	Človek mu je bil všeč.
That's why it's not here anymore.	Zato tukaj ni več tega.
I will do my best to be right.	Naredil bom vse, da bo prav.
It was almost out.	Bilo je skoraj ven.
I feel good.	Počutim se dobro.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
I hope you get better soon.	Upam, da boš kmalu bolje.
He was right about that.	Glede tega je imel prav.
She succeeded.	Uspelo ji je.
He felt ready for anything.	Počutil se je pripravljen na vse.
You probably will.	Verjetno boš.
And there was a lot of that.	In tega je bilo veliko.
I would be fine now.	Zdaj bi bil v redu.
It was definitely like that for me.	Pri meni je bilo zagotovo tako.
I think so too.	Mislim tudi.
I never would.	Nikoli ne bi.
They were gone.	Ni jih bilo več.
I don't know how he found me.	Ne vem, kako me je našel.
It was a long time ago.	Bilo je dolgo nazaj.
This is my life, this is it.	To je moje življenje, to je to.
They had very little money.	Imeli so zelo malo denarja.
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
It will be here.	Tukaj bo.
And it's not easy.	In to ni lahko.
And if not, you’ll know.	In če ni, boste vedeli.
It was also at my house.	Bilo je tudi pri meni doma.
He was right about that.	Glede tega je imel prav.
He wasn't even my father.	Niti ni bil moj oče.
My question to you is this.	Moje vprašanje za vas je to.
He was glad he could help.	Vesel je bil, da je lahko pomagal.
Now you are the one who helps me.	Zdaj si ti tisti, ki mi pomaga.
I thought he was talking about me, but he’s not.	Mislil sem, da govori o meni, a ni.
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
Don't keep talking.	Ne govori naprej.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
But I'm not so sure.	Vendar nisem tako prepričan.
He does this often.	To počne pogosto.
And that would be true.	In to bi bilo res.
He can always do something.	Vedno lahko nekaj počne.
He had too much work.	Imel je preveč dela.
They used to be.	Nekoč so bili.
Maybe it would be better for a book.	Mogoče bi bilo bolje za knjigo.
But we failed.	Vendar nam ni uspelo.
I know it's none of my business.	Vem, da to ni moja stvar.
That's a lot of time.	To je veliko časa.
I never had it.	Nikoli ga nisem imel.
He had a job.	Imel je delo.
Why do I have to do this?	Zakaj moram to narediti?
He probably didn't come.	Verjetno ni prišel.
You should do it.	Moral bi narediti.
I'm not alone right now.	Trenutno nisem sam.
I didn't give it to you for fun.	Nisem ti dal za zabavo.
Now he knew he wanted something more.	Zdaj je vedel, da si želi nekaj več.
I don't know what it's about.	Ne vem, za kaj gre.
Po.	Po.
No one helped him.	Nihče mu ni pomagal.
You did very well.	Zelo dobro si naredil.
There are too many of them.	Preveč jih je.
Talk a little.	Govori malo.
All these things are so wrong, wrong wrong.	Vse te stvari so tako narobe, narobe narobe.
He said it was too much.	Rekel je, da je preveč.
Is he still in place?	Je še na mestu?
That's not why we're here.	Nismo zato tukaj.
There was nothing that I could do.	Nič nisem mogel storiti.
This is something that is already happening.	To je nekaj, kar se že dogaja.
And that's that.	In to je to.
He didn't see her.	Ni je videl.
No one spoke.	Nihče ni govoril.
I didn’t see that coming either.	Tudi tega nisem videl, da bi prišel.
No, even more so now.	Ne, zdaj še toliko bolj.
We have to do something.	Nekaj ​​moramo narediti.
Or tomorrow.	Ali pa jutri.
It's a game, my man.	To je igra, moj človek.
I can believe that.	To lahko verjamem.
I don't see you much every day.	Ne vidim te veliko vsak dan.
However, it is not.	Pa vendar ni.
We had too much.	Imeli smo preveč.
Now she will be gone.	Zdaj je ne bo več.
They are very difficult to make.	Zelo težko jih je narediti.
However, nothing seemed to do that.	Vendar se je zdelo, da nič ne naredi tega.
It happened to him.	Zgodilo se mu je.
They certainly weren't.	Zagotovo niso bili.
And he asked.	In vprašal je.
This makes it difficult.	Zaradi tega je težko.
Don't think of me.	Ne misli me.
But there is not much time for that.	A za to ni veliko časa.
In fact, much more.	Pravzaprav veliko več.
I didn't make it.	To mi ni uspelo.
And no children.	In brez otrok.
He couldn't do that for long.	Tega ni mogel početi dolgo.
He didn't need my help anyway.	Tako ali tako ni potreboval moje pomoči.
They are interested.	Zanima jih.
I said no, again.	Rekel sem ne, spet.
These are.	To so.
But he would be good.	Bi pa bil dober.
Looking tired, looking.	Videti utrujen, videti.
That's for it.	To je za to.
He knows we're here.	Ve, da smo tukaj.
I know, me neither.	Vem, jaz tudi ne.
You did it.	Ti si to naredil.
I don't like that.	to mi ni všeč.
There is a better way.	Obstaja boljši način.
I could have done better.	Lahko bi naredil bolje.
If anyone can, it's you.	Če kdo lahko, si to ti.
But that's none of my business.	Vendar to ni moja stvar.
It's time to work.	Čas je za delo.
I see nothing but good in all of this.	V vsem tem ne vidim nič drugega kot dobro.
As if he doesn't exist at all.	Kot da ga sploh ni.
He could have waited.	Lahko je čakal.
Not for the money.	Ne za denar.
I don't.	Jaz pa ne.
But I would like more than that.	Vendar bi si želela več kot to.
I didn't want that.	Tega nisem hotel.
Now he had it.	Zdaj ga je imel.
He had to know.	Moral je vedeti.
You may find this helpful.	Morda se vam bo to zdelo v pomoč.
I felt like me again.	Spet sem se počutil kot jaz.
Should not.	Ne bi smeli.
Not from him.	Ne od njega.
I never knew what.	Nikoli nisem vedel, kaj.
Who we were.	Kdo smo bili.
I like that too.	Tudi to mi je všeč.
Sometimes that's true.	Včasih je temu res tako.
It wasn't likely.	Ni bilo verjetno.
Must be.	Mora biti.
You don't have to, you know.	Ni ti treba, veš.
In front of the room	Pred sobo
I won't be here anymore.	Ne bo me več tukaj.
He said it was okay.	Rekel je, da je v redu.
Everything was fine.	Vse je bilo v redu.
All that money.	Ves ta denar.
He said he didn't even know why.	Rekel je, da niti ne ve zakaj.
He started early.	Začel je že zgodaj.
Everything was as usual.	Vse je bilo kot običajno.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nič nisem naredil narobe.
In or out.	V ali ven.
But you have to be the right person.	Vendar moraš biti pravi človek.
I've been here before.	Tukaj sem bil že prej.
Not much longer.	Ne več dolgo.
And yet no.	Pa vendar ne.
Is any of us.	Ali je kdo od nas.
There was nothing better when he got home.	Nič bolje ni bilo, ko je prišel domov.
It was really nice.	Bilo je prav lepo.
This early in the morning.	To zgodaj zjutraj.
Maybe he found something.	Mogoče je kaj našel.
For few days.	Za nekaj dni.
Or to children.	Ali do otrok.
I saw someone.	Nekoga sem videl.
It's just happening.	Samo dogaja se.
However, much remains to be done.	Vendar je treba še veliko narediti.
And he is so angry.	In tako jezen je.
This does not seem to be the case.	Zdi se, da temu ni tako.
Just like us.	Tako kot mi.
I didn’t even think about that possibility.	Sploh nisem mislil na to možnost.
They did nothing.	Nič niso storili.
Money is not everything, you know.	Denar ni vse, veste.
I just didn’t know how to do it.	Preprosto nisem vedel, kako to narediti.
Not you.	Ne ti.
Just as much.	Prav toliko.
That’s what makes them kids.	To je tisto, kar jih dela otroke.
I kept thinking that tomorrow would be better.	Ves čas sem mislil, da bo jutri bolje.
I knew it would never work.	Vedel sem, da nikoli ne bo uspelo.
But I would let him think that.	Vendar bi mu dovolil, da to misli.
Not much anymore.	Nič več veliko.
I have them.	jaz jih imam.
I seem to have a lot to say.	Zdi se, da imam veliko za povedati.
Everything was not good.	Vse ni bilo dobro.
Man cannot be all he wants.	Človek ne more biti vse, kar si želi.
He couldn't believe he heard that.	Ni mogel verjeti, da je to slišal.
And he said yes.	In rekel je da.
And we had a nice time.	In imeli smo se lepo.
It was long, but not long enough.	Bilo je dolgo, a ne dovolj dolgo.
We never knew.	Nikoli nismo vedeli.
They were fine.	Bili so v redu.
He didn't find it.	Ni ga našel.
You're not well.	Nisi dobro.
You went to your room.	Šla si v svojo sobo.
This was early in the morning.	To je bilo zgodaj zjutraj.
This is definitely happening here.	To se zagotovo dogaja tukaj.
You didn't know.	Nisi vedel.
Maybe you know.	Morda veš.
I decided to go ahead and do it.	Odločil sem se, da grem naprej in to storim.
But he didn't want to say when.	Kdaj pa ni hotel povedati.
There is an even better way.	Obstaja še boljši način.
He came to me.	Prišel je k meni.
I would like to see you.	Rad bi te videl.
I'm not even there.	Niti sem ne tam.
This is the only time.	To je edini čas.
He didn't want to tell anyone.	Nikomur ni hotel povedati.
They seemed to be interested in it.	Zdelo se je, da jih to zanima.
What was, is still.	Kar je bilo, je še.
I've never been here before.	Še nikoli nisem bil tukaj.
It's not like me.	Ni tako kot jaz.
It just has to be you.	Samo biti moraš ti.
This question has been around for a long time.	To vprašanje obstaja že dolgo časa.
I don't understand him.	Ne razumem ga.
I wanted to say more.	Hotel sem povedati več.
He has done this before.	To je storil že prej.
Maybe me.	Mogoče mi.
Nothing is ever enough.	Nikoli ni nič dovolj.
Not for me.	Zame pa ne.
I don't know how to do it.	Ne vem, kako to storiti.
A friend was very helpful to me.	Prijatelj mi je bil v veliko pomoč.
That's not it.	To ni to.
I mean, as good as.	Mislim, tako dobro kot.
He never came.	Nikoli ni prišel.
This seems difficult.	To se zdi težko.
You know you like it.	Veš, da ti je všeč.
You're better than me at this.	Ti si v tem boljši od mene.
I did it.	Uspelo mi je.
As a teacher.	Kot učitelj.
It's not going well.	Ne gre dobro.
He thinks well of me, he thinks well of you.	Z mano misli dobro, s tabo misli dobro.
No one knew we were there.	Nihče ni vedel, da smo bili tam.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
I don't like them anymore.	Ne maram jih več.
I really didn’t want anything more.	Res si nisem želel ničesar več.
I like these things too.	Tudi meni so všeč te stvari.
He comes too.	Tudi on pride.
And he got it well.	In to dobro je dobil.
Let him come.	Naj pride.
Everything is nothing.	Vse ni nič.
He made everything from scratch.	Vse je naredil iz nič.
He decided for you and for me.	Odločil se je zate in zame.
I really like it.	Res mi je všeč.
He loves us.	On nas ima rad.
He knew something was wrong with me.	Vedel je, da nekaj ni v redu z mano.
But you don't have to stay if you don't want to.	Vendar vam ni treba ostati, če tega ne želite.
You will know.	Vedel boš.
You want to do it today.	Želite to storiti danes.
Please have someone come.	Prosim, naj nekdo pride.
I won't have it.	Ne bom ga imel.
I mean seriously.	mislim resno.
Very glad I came back.	Zelo vesel, da sem se vrnil.
It was all he could do.	To je bilo vse, kar je lahko naredil.
You could do it yourself.	To bi lahko naredili sami.
He said about me.	O meni je rekel.
Only more will happen.	Samo še več se bo zgodilo.
I didn't feel that way.	Nisem se tako počutil.
You will.	Boš.
For fun.	Na zabavo.
You decided to be here.	Ti si se odločil biti tukaj.
It is and it is not.	Pa je in ni.
I haven’t gotten them in a while.	Že nekaj časa jih nisem dobil.
I could tell right away.	Lahko bi takoj povedal.
He may not say no.	Morda ne bo rekel ne.
And he won't do that.	In tega ne bo storil.
They could see him.	Lahko so ga videli.
Probably something is not so good.	Verjetno nekaj ni tako dobro.
She was the only one he found again.	Bila je edina, ki jo je spet našel.
The boy was fine.	Fant je bil v redu.
That didn't happen.	To se ni zgodilo.
And indeed it was.	In res je bilo tako.
It was all me.	To sem bil vse jaz.
Why is this happening to us?	Zakaj se nam to dogaja?
That’s still not good, but it was obviously good enough.	To še vedno ni dobro, a očitno je bilo dovolj dobro.
Just there.	Samo tam.
I have no money, I have nowhere to go.	Nimam denarja, nimam kam.
It's not hard.	Ni težko.
But it's not possible.	Vendar ni mogoče.
Which is fine.	Kar je v redu.
No one has ever seen the mind.	Nihče ni nikoli videl misli.
Someone has to.	Nekdo mora.
And he, too, knows it was wrong.	In tudi on ve, da je bilo narobe.
It just isn’t and you know why.	Preprosto ni in veš zakaj.
Everyone saw what happened, but no one helped.	Vsi so videli, kaj se je zgodilo, a nihče ni pomagal.
Maybe he was just alone.	Mogoče je bil samo sam.
He would have succeeded.	Uspelo bi mu.
I didn't even know you had a car.	Sploh nisem vedel, da imaš avto.
You are alone.	Sam si.
I have to tell you everything.	Vse ti moram povedati.
He just can't.	Preprosto ne more.
That's the way it is now.	Tako je zdaj.
It was true, just like life.	Bilo je res, tako kot življenje.
It should still be no.	Še vedno bi moral biti ne.
Everyone should know that.	To bi morali vedeti vsi.
Good to have them back.	Dobro, da jih imam nazaj.
It really is very simple.	Res je zelo preprosto.
He really didn't want to be here.	Res ni hotel biti tukaj.
Now I wonder about everything.	Zdaj se sprašujem o vsem.
I met her in the room.	Spoznal sem jo v sobi.
The thing is in our room.	Stvar je pri nas v sobi.
That you will be a teacher according to me.	Da boš ti po meni učitelj.
It must be hard.	Mora biti težko.
it's true.	res je.
I think he's the only one.	Mislim, da je edini.
If possible.	Če se le da.
I can't go there right now.	Trenutno ne morem tja.
No, no, not this man.	Ne, ne, ne ta človek.
I mean, I would never be a teacher.	Mislim, nikoli ne bi bil učitelj.
That never happened.	To se nikoli ni zgodilo.
There were so many people.	Bilo je toliko ljudi.
How are you .	Kako ste .
Everything a good man is.	Vse, kar je dober človek, je.
', bil'.	', bil'.
Just a few.	Samo nekaj.
It simply cannot be done.	Preprosto, tega ni mogoče storiti.
He didn't know about that.	Za to ni vedel.
I think he was into it.	Mislim, da je bil v to.
Maybe he's back already.	Morda se je že vrnil.
He seemed to want to tell us something.	Zdelo se je, da nam želi nekaj povedati.
There is nothing he can do now.	Zdaj ne more storiti ničesar.
In fact, they had more money to do.	Pravzaprav so imeli pri tem več denarja.
Yes, you could.	Da, lahko bi.
I felt good about it.	Ob tem sem se počutil dobro.
It really was.	Res je bilo.
He must have loved her.	Verjetno jo je imel rad.
It's not always good.	Ni vedno dobro.
I don't know what would happen.	Ne vem, kaj bi se zgodilo.
He didn't seem to hear.	Zdelo se je, da ni slišal.
The work was not easy.	Delo ni bilo lahko.
I have three children.	Imam tri otroke.
I really liked it!	Zelo mi je bilo všeč!
That's it, isn't it.	To je to, kajne.
No one has ever said that life is easy.	Nihče ni nikoli rekel, da je življenje lahko.
A lot of people do that.	Veliko ljudi to počne.
I wish I could work as well as you.	Želim si, da bi lahko delal tako dobro kot ti.
I was there and I did it.	Bil sem tam in to sem storil.
I will never see them again.	Nikoli več jih ne bom videl.
She told me she couldn't stay long.	Rekla mi je, da ne more ostati dolgo.
It just took the right time.	Potreboval je le pravi čas.
It wasn't.	Pa ni bilo.
I seem to be gone forever.	Zdi se, da sem odšel za vedno.
Do instead of say.	Naredi namesto povedati.
And so.	In so.
It's so hard.	Tako težko je.
And we are not alone.	In nismo sami.
Maybe you're right, she said.	Morda imaš prav, je rekla.
They would be nothing without us.	Brez nas bi bili nič.
I want you to know this for sure.	Želim, da to zagotovo veš.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Mogoče, morda, morda.
He continues to do so.	To počne še naprej.
I need help.	Potrebujem pomoč.
But he was sure he was right.	Vendar je bil prepričan, da ima prav.
I don't know why not.	Ne vem zakaj ni.
I can go back to school.	Lahko grem nazaj v šolo.
It's actually very simple.	Pravzaprav je zelo preprosto.
It will get better soon.	Zdaj bo kmalu bolje.
I didn't want to do that.	Tega nisem hotel narediti.
He didn't ask anyone anymore.	Nikogar ni več vprašal.
No, maybe it would be better not to.	Ne, morda bi bilo bolje, da ne.
I asked that myself.	To sem vprašal tudi sam.
We have to go back.	Moramo iti nazaj.
Maybe we will.	Morda bomo.
He knew he was right.	Vedel je, da ima prav.
And happy about it.	In vesel zaradi tega.
But there are so few of them.	A tako malo jih je.
I will probably never see her.	Verjetno je ne bom nikoli videl.
I want to see you every day.	Želim te videti vsak dan.
He almost liked her.	Skoraj všeč mu je bila.
He never comes out.	Nikoli ne pride ven.
She didn't know who she was.	Ni vedela, kdo je.
Which wasn't there.	Ki ga ni bilo.
He loved me too. 	Tudi mene je imel rad. 
There are so many things.	Toliko je stvari.
But he can't do that.	Vendar tega ne more storiti.
We don't know why.	Ne vemo zakaj.
He just doesn't know anything.	Samo ne ve ničesar.
I would give her everything.	Vse bi ji dal.
But maybe it's not as difficult as it seems.	A morda ni tako težko, kot se zdi.
It would seem wrong not to say something.	Zdelo bi se narobe, če nekaj ne bi rekel.
I'm ready to be a friend.	Pripravljen sem biti prijatelj.
No, I'm not.	Ne, nisem.
And this is not the only one.	A ta ni edini.
We are all doing well here.	Tukaj nam gre vsem dobro.
I could be better.	Lahko bi bil boljši.
And that's enough.	In to je dovolj.
he wanted to know.	je hotel vedeti.
You are very lucky.	Imaš veliko srečo.
that's what i learned.	tega sem se naučil.
Or so it seemed.	Ali pa se je tako zdelo.
You have money.	Imaš denar.
He returned to his room.	Vrnil se je v svojo sobo.
I don’t know if this has ever happened before.	Ne vem, ali se je to že kdaj zgodilo.
That's all and more.	To je vse in še več.
You can't be mine.	Ne moreš biti moj.
To the point.	Na stvar.
Apparently not.	Očitno ni.
It would be like.	Bilo bi kot.
I don't like you either.	Tudi jaz vas ne maram.
Someone good taught me.	Nekdo dober me je naučil.
Nobody knows her.	Nihče je ne pozna.
IM just.	Jaz sem samo.
They had no children.	Niso imeli otrok.
We all knew this time would come.	Vsi smo vedeli, da bo ta čas prišel.
He has no money.	Nima denarja.
It doesn't seem right.	Ne zdi se prav.
He just got back.	Pravkar se je vrnil.
However, we still know very little about this.	Vendar o tem še vedno vemo zelo malo.
I'm the only one who found anything.	Jaz sem edini, ki je kaj našel.
There is always that possibility.	Vedno obstaja ta možnost.
I'm here.	Tukaj sem.
However, this is clearly not the case.	Vendar očitno ni tako.
But it has always been so.	Vendar je bilo vedno tako.
I just had to do it.	Samo to sem moral narediti.
i didn't go either.	jaz tudi nisem šel.
You weren't there.	Niste bili tam.
I actually know that.	To pravzaprav vem.
And he doesn't know that.	In tega ne ve.
These are very difficult to buy.	Te je zelo težko kupiti.
I want to do it right.	To želim narediti prav.
I never expected that to be the case.	Nikoli nisem pričakoval, da bo tako.
I've never met anyone like you.	Še nikoli nisem srečal nikogar, kot si ti.
Seeing something is wrong.	Videti nekaj je narobe.
It was life as usual.	To je bilo življenje kot običajno.
There was nothing to do at that time.	Takrat sploh ni bilo kaj početi.
There was something else as well.	Bilo je tudi nekaj drugega.
We should too.	Tudi mi bi morali.
He tried, it's true.	Poskušal je, res je.
You probably had a job yourself.	Verjetno ste tudi sami imeli službo.
Not long.	Ne dolgo.
How long do you have to go.	Kako dolgo moraš iti.
After saying a little, he went out again.	Ko je rekel malo, je spet šel ven.
She couldn't do that now.	Zdaj ji ni bilo mogoče to storiti.
We actually know that.	Pravzaprav to vemo.
He was not a child.	Ni bil otrok.
That's how it really was.	Tako je res bilo.
If you're lucky.	Če imaš srečo.
To speak as if they were never there.	Govoriti, kot da jih sploh ni bilo.
It was a game, if you will.	Bila je igra, če želite.
Not that he had many.	Ne, da jih je imel veliko.
It won't be a problem.	Ne bo problem.
And there is no one else.	In ni nikogar drugega.
Enough.	Dovolj je.
That has been a long time.	To je bilo že dolgo časa.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe.
I know he does.	Vem, da ve.
That was still not enough.	To še vedno ni bilo dovolj.
And even if you don’t, you should buy it.	In tudi če ne, bi ga morali kupiti.
She didn't want him to see her looking like that.	Ni želela, da bi jo videl videti tako.
I didn’t even know they were there.	Sploh nisem vedel, da so tam.
They are better than that.	So boljši od tega.
But it is true.	Je pa res.
It feels better this morning.	Počuti se bolje danes zjutraj.
I've seen it before.	Sem že videl.
I don't know why and when.	Ne vem zakaj in kdaj.
I'm above you.	nad tabo sem.
I have to be there.	Moram biti tam.
This is simply not right.	To preprosto ni prav.
They really knew what to do.	Res so vedeli, kaj storiti.
These are all problems right now.	Vse to so trenutno težave.
There is a little more of that.	Tega je malo več.
You are not my father.	Ti nisi moj oče.
There are no more children.	Ni več otrok.
I haven't decided yet.	Nisem se še odločil.
That's really quite a few.	To je res kar nekaj.
She went out on her own.	Sama je šla ven.
I do not want.	Ne želim.
In fact, we now know that this is the case.	Pravzaprav zdaj vemo, da je temu tako.
He is right about that.	V tem ima prav.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ni hotel govoriti z mano.
And it was very difficult.	In bilo je zelo težko.
Nobody knows why.	Nihče ne ve zakaj.
You may not want to be.	Morda ne želite biti.
And these are for you.	In te so za vas.
Both were good.	Oba sta bila dobra.
It was better there.	Tam je bilo bolje.
I know you know how.	Vem, da veš kako.
I wouldn't ask that of you.	Tega ne bi prosil od vas.
I should have told you earlier.	Moral bi ti povedati že prej.
I hope you're right.	Upam, da imaš prav.
And no one heard anything.	In nihče ni slišal ničesar.
Maybe it feels that way.	Morda se tako počuti.
I know how a man feels.	Vem, kako se človek počuti.
He was real.	Bil je pravi.
But there will be enough time for that one day.	A za to bo nekoč dovolj časa.
I never wanted to work for anyone else.	Nikoli nisem hotel delati za koga drugega.
It could be much better.	Lahko bi bilo veliko bolje.
I don't know where we are now.	Ne vem, kje smo zdaj.
That would not be difficult to do.	To ne bi bilo težko narediti.
I don't know much about it.	Ne vem veliko o tem.
I might want one.	Mogoče bi si ga želel.
I expected to see him there.	Pričakoval sem, da ga bom tam videl.
They had none of that.	Nič od tega niso imeli.
I told him about you.	Povedal sem mu zate.
Each of you.	Vsak od vas.
And you know, it was absolutely fine.	In veste, bilo je popolnoma v redu.
He was too busy for us.	Bil je preveč zaposlen za nas.
Bo.	Bo.
It wasn't him.	To ni bil on.
I'm amazed at how you make me feel.	Presenečen sem nad tem, kako se počutim zaradi tebe.
My father knew what was going on.	Moj oče je vedel, kaj se dogaja.
What is happening to me? 	Kaj se mi dogaja?
Maybe I just need to see her.	Morda jo moram samo videti.
Or I really wouldn’t want to know.	Ali pa res ne bi želel vedeti.
There is everything.	Tam je vse.
Sometimes it wasn't like that.	Včasih ni bilo tako.
He was working.	Delal je.
You know, my kid is a good kid.	Veste, moj otrok je dober otrok.
Can anyone help me with this.	Ali mi lahko kdo pomaga pri tem.
He failed.	Ni mu uspelo.
I just wanted to know how you are today.	Hotel sem samo vedeti, kako si danes.
I heard that.	Slišal sem to.
And it happened so long ago.	In se je zgodilo tako dolgo nazaj.
This is often the case.	To je pogosto tako.
She was good.	Bila je dobra.
We always knew when it was.	Vedno smo vedeli, kdaj je bil.
I was the only one left.	Ostal sem edini jaz.
I'm not at home.	nisem doma.
But I don't know where to go from there.	Ne vem pa, kam naj grem od tam.
No, that's not true.	Ne, to ni res.
She wasn't there.	Tam je ni bilo.
Surely it could only get better.	Zagotovo bi lahko bilo samo bolje.
She had to be alone.	Morala je biti sama.
That's what I did.	To sem storil jaz.
I hope this helps.	Upam, da to pomaga.
I didn't ask for anything.	Nič nisem prosil.
I will never forget.	Nikoli ne bom pozabil.
He's been here before.	Tukaj je bil že prej.
That was nice of you.	Bilo je lepo od tebe.
I mean seriously.	mislim resno.
It happened.	Zgodilo se je to.
More on who he was.	Več o tem, kdo je bil.
And you're absolutely right.	In popolnoma prav imaš.
You have something else.	Imaš nekaj drugega.
It just takes time.	Potrebuje le čas.
I still wanted to play.	Še vedno sem hotel igrati.
That was my chance.	To je bila moja priložnost.
I do not know yet	še ne vem
We don't need to help anymore.	Ni nam treba več pomagati.
More than you want!	Več kot si želiš!
That they can.	Da so lahko.
I'm really not sure.	res nisem prepričan.
He doesn’t seem to be afraid of anything.	Zdi se, da se ničesar ne boji.
Not after what just happened.	Ne po tem, kar se je pravkar zgodilo.
I can't say more for fear of giving too much away.	Ne morem več povedati, ker se bojim, da bi dal preveč.
This is you.	To si ti.
Never again.	Nikoli več.
That's why she wants him.	Zato si ga želi.
She thought she was fine.	Zdelo se ji je v redu.
And that seems too much to me.	In to se mi zdi preveč.
However, this is only a small part.	Vendar je to le malo.
How many years? 	Koliko let?
Not that week.	Ne tisti teden.
What is a ?.	Kaj je a?.
This, however, was still difficult for her.	To pa ji je bilo še vedno težko.
Maybe it was just as well.	Morda je bilo tudi tako dobro.
Nobody wants anything.	Nihče noče ničesar.
However, it was not easy.	Vendar ni bilo lahko.
I'm better now.	Zdaj mi je bolje.
You have to do what you have to do.	Moraš narediti, kar moraš.
Work is not for tomorrow.	Delo ni za jutri.
And she continues to like it.	In še naprej ji je všeč.
That's what he did.	Tako je storil.
He had his thoughts.	Imel je svoje misli.
He has no money.	Nima denarja.
I can't tell you what's going to happen.	Ne morem ti povedati, kaj se bo zgodilo.
It can’t come soon enough for me.	Zame ne more priti dovolj kmalu.
You're good to me too.	Tudi zame si dober.
Everything looked fine.	Vse je bilo videti v redu.
You don’t have to do everything.	Ni vam treba narediti vsega.
I told everyone that.	To sem povedal vsem.
I can't do much.	Ne morem narediti veliko.
Because you're not.	Ker nisi.
He will be here.	On bo tukaj.
I should have seen him when he got home.	Moral bi ga videti, ko je prišel domov.
I would say no.	Rekla bi ne.
I would say.	Bi rekel.
He is very angry.	Zelo je jezen.
He needs his time to be a child.	Potrebuje svoj čas, da je otrok.
It wasn't there.	Ni bilo tam.
I don't think anyone really does.	Mislim, da nihče res ne.
No, not yet.	Ne, ne še.
There is a chance he will win.	Obstaja možnost, da bo zmagal.
I will do it.	to bom naredil.
Because it's true.	Ker je res.
He had a hard life.	Imel je težko življenje.
You'll probably be fine.	Verjetno boš v redu.
We didn't do that.	Tega nismo storili.
But there is more.	Vendar je še več.
Should not.	Ne bi smel.
Almost everyone.	Skoraj vsi.
That is if you really want to get home.	To je, če res želite priti domov.
He was too.	Tudi on je bil.
He decided.	Odločil se je.
good.	bom.
They had nowhere to go.	Niso imeli kam iti.
You might like it.	Morda ti bo všeč.
He tried to convince her.	Poskušal jo je prepričati.
Not mine, ever.	Ne moj, nikoli.
There was nothing like that.	Nič takega ni bilo.
Very quick.	Zelo hitro.
He will do that.	To bo storil.
Everything you want.	Vse kar želiš.
In fact, for a long time.	Pravzaprav kar dolgo.
He didn't tell anyone where he was going.	Nikomur ni povedal, kam gre.
I'm sure it is.	Prepričan sem, da je.
It's not enough.	Ni dovolj.
However, there is much more.	Vendar pa je še veliko več.
I feel good.	Počutim se dobro.
I never thought anyone would die.	Nikoli nisem mislil, da bi kdo umrl.
Just that he's at home.	Samo da je doma.
I don't know when that time will come.	Ne vem, kdaj bo prišel ta čas.
Or it used to be.	Ali pa je nekoč.
I mean, something happened to me.	Mislim, nekaj se mi je zgodilo.
He was so good tonight.	Nocoj je bil tako dober.
Yes to that.	Da temu.
He wanted to go out and do things.	Želel je iti ven in delati stvari.
And she was alone.	In bila je sama.
He didn't seem to eat at all.	Zdelo se je, da sploh ne je jedel.
He was convinced of that.	Bil je prepričan v to.
What a difficult question.	Kako težko vprašanje.
A lot of people were there for me.	Veliko ljudi je bilo tam zame.
I hope you call me.	Upam, da me boš poklical.
He's been gone since this morning.	Od danes zjutraj ga ni več.
I'm sure of that.	V to sem prepričan.
Because we really didn’t have enough money.	Ker res nismo imeli dovolj denarja.
Actually more than enough.	Pravzaprav več kot dovolj.
He says something.	Nekaj ​​pravi.
All very well.	Vse zelo dobro.
No, she didn't know where he could be.	Ne, ni vedela, kje bi lahko bil.
It's just you today.	Danes si samo ti.
You knew they were.	Vedel si, da so.
He says he can't believe it.	Pravi, da ne more verjeti.
I understand that.	to razumem.
I had to see her.	Moral sem jo videti.
I didn't see why.	Nisem videl zakaj.
I should never have gone there.	Nikoli ne bi smel iti tja.
I've had it for a long time.	že dolgo ga imam.
Nobody lives here now.	Tukaj zdaj ne živi nihče.
I mean, you can.	Mislim, lahko.
Today, however, it would be difficult.	Danes bi bilo pa težko.
the more I go out.	več bom šel ven.
It's beautiful and.	Lepo je in.
I didn’t like that I had nothing to do.	Ni mi bilo všeč, da nimam kaj početi.
This is what you want to do.	To je tisto, kar želiš narediti.
So we're still together.	Tako da sva še vedno skupaj.
This is not going to be a game.	To ne bo igra.
It was only once.	Bilo je samo enkrat.
I can't tonight.	Nocoj ne morem.
He wasn't so sure.	Ni bil tako prepričan.
He still won't talk to me.	Še vedno noče govoriti z mano.
I don't know that.	tega ne poznam.
But I wouldn’t lose today.	A danes ne bi izgubil.
I mean, no.	Mislim, ne.
That's exactly what it's for.	Prav za to je.
You can, you know.	Lahko, veš.
And so you are.	In tako si.
I was never a child.	Nikoli nisem bil otrok.
Is that all?	Je to vse?
I could do something else for life.	Za življenje bi lahko delal kaj drugega.
I liked the work.	Delo mi je bilo všeč.
No one seemed to hear anything.	Zdelo se je, da nihče ni slišal ničesar.
The question seemed simple enough.	Vprašanje se je zdelo dovolj preprosto.
Just like my father.	Tako kot moj oče.
That was a lot of money.	To je bilo veliko denarja.
We didn't know what to do.	Nismo vedeli, kaj storiti.
And is.	In je.
Or maybe.	Ali pa morda.
It's just not true.	Samo ni res.
He did a good job.	Opravil je dobro delo.
I should.	moral bi.
Dad's wrong.	Oče narobe.
I don't need anything.	nič ne potrebujem.
He never does that.	Nikoli ne naredi tega.
That's not it.	To ni tisto.
I don't know why.	Ne vem pa zakaj je tako.
Time went wrong.	Čas je šel narobe.
And that's how simple we know.	In tako preprosto vemo.
You should talk to him.	Moral bi govoriti z njim.
I always do that.	Vedno to počnem.
And really, yes.	In res, da.
We knew he wouldn't be.	Vedeli smo, da ga ne bo.
That was not possible.	To ni bilo mogoče.
Now comes the time.	Zdaj pride čas.
He was always such a good kid.	Vedno je bil tako dober otrok.
Who knows where.	Kdo ve kje.
It didn't seem to be.	Zdi se, da ni bilo.
For some time.	Za nekaj časa.
I had to leave early today.	Danes sem moral oditi zgodaj.
It worked.	To je uspelo.
I'm going home.	Grem domov.
I don't think that's true.	Mislim, da to ni res.
I wanted to talk to you.	Hotel sem govoriti s tabo.
I just want to see that he's okay.	Samo želim videti, da je v redu.
I hope you are too.	Upam, da si tudi ti.
He doesn't want to believe it.	Noče verjeti.
I'll ask you one more time.	Še enkrat te bom vprašal.
No one will help you.	Nihče ti ne bo pomagal.
Apparently she liked it.	Očitno ji je bilo všeč.
She said she was probably right.	Rekla je, da ima zelo verjetno prav.
He also had no one.	Prav tako ni imel nikogar.
It wasn't fast enough.	Ni bilo dovolj hitro.
I'm not sure what it was.	Nisem prepričan, kaj je bilo.
Wanted to say.	Hotel povedati.
We need to do something, she said.	Nekaj ​​moramo narediti, je rekla.
I think it would be very difficult.	Mislim, da bi bilo zelo težko.
And now it's here.	In zdaj je tukaj.
I've been here ever since.	Od takrat sem tukaj.
It seems simple enough.	Zdi se dovolj preprosto.
I had too much.	Imel sem preveč.
Don't tell me about it!	Ne govori mi o tem!
He never said this life would be easy.	Nikoli ni rekel, da bo to življenje lahko.
He soon lost all his money.	Kmalu je izgubil ves svoj denar.
You died to me.	Umrl si mi.
It just wasn't us.	To preprosto nismo bili mi.
I want you to be here with me.	Želim, da si tukaj z mano.
I didn't see it that way.	Nisem tako videl.
I just sat there and did nothing.	Samo sedel sem in nisem nič naredil.
I don't have much time this afternoon.	Danes popoldne nimam veliko časa.
That's always been my thing.	To je bila vedno moja stvar.
I love her very much.	Zelo jo imam rad.
I'm not into this for the money.	Nisem v tem zaradi denarja.
Failed.	Ni uspelo.
You're doing well.	Dobro ti gre.
money.	denar.
He promised to do it, but he didn't.	Obljubil je, da bo to storil, a ni.
I will not see.	ne bom videl.
I have to.	Moram.
He will almost die.	Skoraj bo umrl.
You told me.	Rekel si mi.
She knew what it was now.	Vedela je, kaj je zdaj.
You're right enough.	Imaš dovolj prav.
And it was so beautiful.	In bilo je tako lepo.
I was very surprised.	Bil sem zelo presenečen.
You will soon know.	Kmalu boste vedeli.
Not so here.	Tukaj ni tako.
He worked instead.	Namesto tega je delal.
Maybe he met someone else.	Morda je srečal koga drugega.
It was just there.	Samo tam je bilo.
My good friend.	Moj dober prijatelj.
I really don't understand this.	Tega res ne razumem.
That’s what he loves.	To je tisto, kar ima rad.
I definitely saw that.	To sem zagotovo videl.
It was that simple.	Bilo je tako preprosto.
That's how he plays.	Tako igra.
Today is not that day.	Danes ni ta dan.
What will happen to us?	Kaj bo z nami?
You got us well.	Dobro si nas dobil.
And that's true.	In to je res.
I don't understand that.	Ne razumem tega.
However, it can be.	Vendar pa je lahko.
But money is not everything.	Vendar denar ni vse.
Long time.	Dolgo časa.
He gave it his all.	Dal je vse.
Everything she was.	Vse kar je bila.
There were so many things.	Bilo je toliko stvari.
And yet it was here.	In vendar je bilo tukaj.
He said they would.	Rekel je, da bodo.
I thought she would be good at it.	Mislil sem, da bo dobra v tem.
Maybe very good.	Mogoče zelo dobro.
And little by little it was true.	In malo po malo je bilo res.
I don’t know what would have happened without it.	Ne vem, kaj bi se zgodilo brez tega.
However, it must be said.	Vendar je treba povedati.
I should be alone in the morning.	Zjutraj bi moral biti sam.
He was a good friend.	Bil je dober prijatelj.
That is what we need to do.	To je tisto, kar moramo storiti.
This goes on and on.	To gre naprej in naprej.
For all that.	Za vse to.
Not only that.	Ne samo to.
He had a book.	Imel je knjigo.
I will not this thing.	Ne bom te stvari.
He liked it very much.	Zelo mu je bil všeč.
He played all the time then.	Takrat je ves čas igral.
It wasn't easy, but it was.	Ni bilo lahko, a je.
The question is what to do next.	Vprašanje je, kaj storiti naprej.
And there is nothing more than that.	In ni nič več kot to.
It wasn't hard.	Ni bilo težko.
However, we are here.	Vendar pa smo tukaj.
I tried.	Poskušal sem.
He needs us as much as we need him.	Potrebuje nas tako kot mi njega.
And you can have them.	In lahko jih imaš.
Tell her it's me.	Povej ji, da sem jaz.
I know it was mine.	Vem, da je moja bila.
He didn't know what else she was interested in.	Ni vedel, kaj jo še zanima.
Because it is.	Ker je.
The car has become better.	Avto je postal boljši.
There is nothing to do, nothing to do.	Nič ni za narediti, nič za narediti.
I sat down.	sedel sem.
It's been a long time.	Dolgo je ni bilo.
And he would tell me.	In on bi mi povedal.
He heard her speak.	Slišal jo je govoriti.
Since he came back, we should see something else.	Ker se je vrnil, bi morali videti nekaj drugega.
Or you may not want to.	Ali pa tega morda ne želite.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Očitno temu ni tako.
It's a big job.	To je veliko delo.
It won't be a problem for me at all.	Zame to sploh ne bo problem.
Everything is possible.	Vse je mogoče.
Someone has to be a person who is not.	Nekdo mora biti oseba, ki ni.
It can also be nothing.	Lahko tudi nič.
I think I could work.	Mislim, da bi lahko delal.
Seems like that must be the problem.	Zdi se, da mora biti to problem.
You never heard.	Nikoli nisi slišal.
It may never be.	Morda nikoli ne bo.
It's true.	Res je.
I will not go out to them.	Ne bom šel ven k njim.
He learned to go alone.	Naučil se je iti sam.
I couldn't play.	Nisem mogel igrati.
It's not all good.	Ni vse dobro.
I have to do something.	nekaj moram narediti.
He was sure they wouldn't see him.	Bil je prepričan, da ga ne bodo videli.
You can't do everything.	Ne moreš narediti vsega.
It was just mine.	Bil je samo moj.
No time.	Ni časa.
It was pretty nice.	Bilo je precej lepo.
I know more than you.	Vem več kot ti.
I don't feel right about it.	Ne počutim se prav glede tega.
I haven't heard yet.	Še nisem slišal.
There were very few of them.	Le zelo malo jih je bilo.
I hope it will.	Upam, da bo.
And so are you.	In tudi ti si.
I couldn't stay.	Nisem mogel ostati.
Even if you said it was okay.	Tudi če si rekel, da je v redu.
I've never actually met her.	Pravzaprav je še nikoli nisem srečal.
It just wasn't possible.	Samo ni bilo mogoče.
He told me that no one cares.	Povedal mi je, da nikogar ne zanima.
If I did, I would.	Če bi to storil, bi.
I didn't know it was.	Nisem vedel, da je.
My father too.	Tudi moj oče.
But not for long.	Vendar ne za dolgo.
Let it be.	Naj bo to bilo.
We have to move on.	Moramo iti naprej.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
No more than usual.	Ne več kot običajno.
I know it is.	Vem, da je.
I hope you succeed again this way.	Upam, da vam bo spet uspelo na ta način.
I knew then.	Takrat sem vedel.
Who lives here?	Kdo živi tukaj?
I can't help it.	Ne morem si pomagati.
I don't understand right away.	Ne razumem takoj.
I like a lot of things.	Všeč mi je veliko stvari.
This is pretty obvious.	To je precej očitno.
He can do anything.	Lahko naredi vse.
He's seen that before.	To je že videl.
Just because you can.	Samo zato, ker lahko.
I know you didn't mean that.	Vem, da nisi mislil tako.
You need to know.	Moraš vedeti.
Just for you.	Samo zate.
That's how it's done.	Tako se dela.
For fun.	Na zabavo.
Or something like that.	Ali nekaj takega.
And what if.	A kaj če.
I don't know where he got them.	Ne vem, kje jih je dobil.
You really liked it.	Res ti je bilo všeč.
Which was nice.	Kar je bilo lepo.
You are right in your own way.	Po svoje imaš prav.
That and because he asked me.	To in ker me je vprašal.
There was no one there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar.
He thought something like this would happen.	Mislil je, da se bo nekaj takega zgodilo.
There was no need.	Ni bilo treba.
I really need help with this.	Pri tem res potrebujem pomoč.
Maybe a little.	Mogoče malo.
She had to see it for herself.	To je morala videti sama.
This man is not.	Ta človek ni.
And she wanted to.	In želela je.
I don’t know why he did it, but it looked really good.	Ne vem, zakaj je to storil, vendar je bilo videti res dobro.
Sam began to believe.	Sam je začel verjeti.
That's what I wanted to tell you.	To sem ti želel povedati.
I haven't done that yet.	Tega še nisem storil.
It didn't seem to him.	Zdelo se mu ni.
It really isn’t for kids.	Res ni za otroke.
Many people want to help everyone.	Veliko ljudi želi pomagati vsem.
I'm sure she would like it.	Prepričan sem, da bi ji bilo všeč.
You should have seen it sooner.	Moral bi ga videti že prej.
And he also knew where he lived.	In vedel je tudi, kje živi.
No, not only that.	Ne, ne samo to.
But that's not what this is about.	Vendar tukaj ne gre za to.
That's what she wanted.	To je želela.
I wish it couldn’t be.	Veliko si želim, da ne more biti.
I wish I hadn't done that.	Želim si, da tega ne bi storil.
Tell me.	Povej mi.
It would be soon.	Kmalu bi bilo.
You gave us this.	Ti si nam dal to.
He was not home last night.	Sinoči ga ni bilo domov.
A lot of work.	Veliko dela.
I found them.	sem jih našel.
You don't even know who you are.	Sploh ne veš kdo si.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
Sometimes they didn't.	Včasih niso.
I haven't even heard of it.	Sploh nisem slišal za to.
I'm not so ready.	Tako nisem pripravljen.
That they didn't.	Da niso storili.
It's just there.	Samo tam je.
I don't know what.	ne vem kaj.
I had to see her.	Moral sem jo videti.
That way we can have our own house.	Tako imamo lahko svojo hišo.
He was there again.	Spet je bil tam.
He doesn't want me there.	Noče me tam.
I didn't know why or how.	Nisem vedel, zakaj in kako.
I don't think he had much.	Mislim, da ni imel veliko.
Something like this has never happened before.	Kaj takega se še ni zgodilo.
This was not easy to do.	To ni bilo lahko storiti.
However, he did more.	Vendar pa je naredil več.
My life would no longer be mine.	Moje življenje ne bi bilo več moje.
But he is the one who did it.	Vendar je on tisti, ki je to naredil.
What did he mean? 	Kaj je mislil?
Sometimes seriously.	Včasih resno.
Because it is.	Ker je.
that's what i learned.	tega sem se naučil.
He was glad he could help her.	Vesel je bil, da ji je lahko pomagal.
I couldn't even see.	Sploh nisem mogel videti.
I don't want it, you can have it.	Nočem ga, lahko ga imaš.
Opportunity.	Priložnost.
But maybe he was right.	Morda pa je imel prav.
Not for years, if ever.	Ne več let, če sploh kdaj.
It was simply everything.	Bilo je preprosto vse.
Ni.	Ni.
I have to go now.	Moram iti zdaj.
So it can’t be much.	Tako da ne more biti veliko.
You know how it is time for kids.	Veste, kako je čas za otroke.
I wanted to move on.	Hotel sem iti naprej.
It simply isn't.	Preprosto ni.
It's good to be back.	Dobro je biti nazaj.
Maybe even more.	Morda še bolj.
That's the only reason I came back.	Samo zaradi tega sem se vrnil.
I shouldn't be here, nor should I be here.	Ne bi smel biti tukaj, niti ne bi smel biti tukaj.
I've been pretty busy.	Bil sem precej zaposlen.
I haven't seen this before.	Tega prej nisem videl.
You were always right behind me.	Vedno si bil takoj za mano.
We had a great time.	Lepo smo se imeli.
He had never had to do that before.	Še nikoli mu tega ni bilo treba storiti.
And the day after that too.	In dan za tem tudi.
And they would be right.	In imeli bi prav.
For years, it was the only game in town.	Več let je bila to edina igra v mestu.
We don't know why.	Ne vemo zakaj.
Not so.	Ni tako.
I know why you came here.	Vem zakaj si prišel sem.
Much work for nothing.	Veliko dela za nič.
He obviously didn't know what to do.	Očitno ni vedel, kaj naj naredi.
Whatever you like, you will do.	Kar ti je všeč, boš počel.
You should know.	Morali bi vedeti.
None of us will.	Nihče od nas ne bo.
This is not your child.	To ni tvoj otrok.
He went to work.	Odšel je v službo.
That is .	To je .
For once, it might not be about the money.	Za enkrat morda ne gre za denar.
Just as it is.	Tako kot je.
That's not what I was here for.	Nisem bil tukaj zaradi tega.
Which is also a very, very good thing.	Kar je tudi zelo, zelo dobra stvar.
I know, too simple again.	Vem, spet preveč preprosto.
Please tell.	Prosim, povej.
However, this is not the only option.	Vendar to ni edina možnost.
He died and also a good thing.	Umrl je in tudi dobra stvar.
My father came out.	Moj oče je prišel ven.
Nobody liked it.	Nikomur ni bilo všeč.
i really like it.	res mi je všeč.
Lots of them.	Veliko jih.
Are you sure you want to see this?	Ste prepričani, da želite to videti?
I have to go.	Moram iti.
I wanted to do it.	Hotel sem to narediti.
That was not good.	To ni bilo dobro.
Just do it.	Samo naredi.
He did nothing more.	Nič več ni storil.
Or he did it and that’s why he said it.	Ali pa je to storil in zato je to rekel.
I had this opportunity.	Imel sem to priložnost.
There was nothing to see.	Ni bilo kaj videti.
Absolutely like it.	Popolnoma všeč.
A much better way.	Veliko boljši način.
We're not there yet.	Nismo še tam.
Someone was behind him.	Nekdo je bil za njim.
I hope this helps !.	Upam, da to pomaga!.
This really can't be helped.	Temu se res ne da pomagati.
It was a lot.	Veliko je bilo.
What is wrong? 	Kaj je narobe?
I'm not sure they were ever there.	Nisem prepričan, da so bili kdaj tam.
That was the reason why.	To je bil razlog, zakaj.
Because I met here.	Ker sem se srečal tukaj.
It wouldn't be hard.	Ne bi bilo težko.
Nothing was simple.	Nič ni bilo preprosto.
In fact, this is not true.	Pravzaprav to ni res.
It's really not enough.	Res ni dovolj.
You can't talk.	Ne moreš govoriti.
I also left my car there.	Tudi moj avto sem pustil tam.
He would be right.	Imel bi prav.
And also good.	In tudi dober.
Not that way.	Ne na ta način.
I wanted to be someone.	Hotel sem biti nekdo.
Very nice, he said.	Zelo lepo, je rekel.
I believe in good works.	Verjamem v dobra dela.
I often wish we had.	Pogosto si želim, da bi imeli.
We'll just have to see.	Samo videti bomo morali.
This one here is for people only.	Ta tukaj je samo za ljudi.
He's still your child.	Še vedno je tvoj otrok.
You just would.	Ti bi samo.
Life happens.	Življenje se dogaja.
He told her he could be.	Rekel ji je, da bi lahko bil.
That needs to be done.	To je treba narediti.
Which he also wanted.	Kar je tudi sam želel.
He didn't know what to do with it all.	Ni vedel, kaj bi z vsem tem.
He has to go now.	Zdaj mora iti.
That had to be done.	To je bilo treba narediti.
Lots of them.	Veliko jih.
He was surprised that he was surprised.	Bil je presenečen, da je bil presenečen.
I never knew.	nikoli nisem vedel.
But I've never seen anyone there.	Tam pa še nikoli nisem videl nikogar.
And that is simply not true.	In to preprosto ni res.
She will want to be there.	Želela bo biti tam.
That is no more.	Tega ni več.
And so he died.	In tako je umrl.
I just wasn’t.	Preprosto nisem bil.
This is usually obvious.	To je običajno očitno.
There is nothing more to say.	Nič več ni za povedati.
I really came into my own.	Res sem prišel na svoje.
Not much.	Ne veliko.
Who wants the next one.	Kdo želi naslednji.
I asked what it was, but he never told me.	Vprašal sem, kaj je to, pa mi ni nikoli povedal.
I’m just not sure if this is wrong of me or not.	Samo nisem prepričan, ali je to narobe od mene ali ne.
If I were here.	Če bi bil tukaj.
That's not the case anymore.	Tako ni več.
And it won't.	In ne bo.
It wasn't that.	Ni bilo to.
I didn't know what.	Nisem vedela kaj.
It can't be true, it can't be true.	Ne more biti res, ne more biti res.
It does this more and more.	To počne vedno več.
If we have to.	Če moramo.
Just went out.	Pravkar odšel ven.
That wasn't all.	To še ni bilo vse.
She thought she was fine.	Zdelo se ji je v redu.
I don't know how you did it.	Ne vem, kako ti je uspelo.
Please, please, please.	Prosim, prosim, prosim.
And it all happened so fast.	In vse se je zgodilo tako hitro.
You can't help me.	Ne moreš mi pomagati.
We'll see.	Bomo videli.
Maybe all of that.	Morda vse to.
However, this cannot be the case.	Vendar temu ne more biti tako.
He can't tell us who he is.	Ne zna nam povedati, kdo je.
But it was not necessary.	Vendar ni bilo treba.
And now they would never be.	In zdaj jih nikoli ne bi bilo.
He was always good to me.	Vedno je bil dober do mene.
He heard enough.	Slišal je dovolj.
No one knew anything.	Nihče ni vedel ničesar.
Everything is as it should be.	Vse je tako, kot mora biti.
I can't do that right now.	Trenutno tega ne morem storiti.
Someone had to say that.	Nekdo je to moral povedati.
I mean, not really.	Mislim, res ne.
What is	Kaj je
I will leave everything as it is.	Pustil bom vse tako, kot je.
He knows it's the right time.	Ve, da je pravi čas.
I know him, he won't do anything without it.	Poznam ga, brez tega ne bo naredil nič.
I will be ready.	pripravljen bom.
No one can help you.	Nihče ti ne more pomagati.
Probably still.	Verjetno še vedno.
It's just my life.	To je samo moje življenje.
Did you see her today?	Ste jo danes videli?
I came after him.	Prišel sem za njim.
That's what the guy does here.	To fant dela tukaj.
You know they are in it for the money.	Veste, da so v tem zaradi denarja.
This day is here.	Ta dan je tukaj.
This is the right time.	To je pravi čas.
But it is much more than that.	Je pa veliko več kot to.
It's true, you know.	Res je, veš.
I just know it's not.	Samo vem, da ni.
You don't even know how it happened.	Sploh ne veš, kako se je zgodilo.
Why would I?	Zakaj bi?
I could promise you that.	To bi ti lahko obljubil.
How to make your own.	Kako narediti svoje.
Because I have no money.	Ker nimam denarja.
And yet.	Pa vendar.
They sure are.	Zagotovo so.
I was convinced.	Bil sem prepričan.
Very, very long.	Zelo, zelo dolgo.
He doesn't want her right now.	Trenutno je ne želi.
If I only knew.	Ko bi le vedela.
I thought it was really good.	Mislil sem, da je res dobro.
That may be true.	To je morda res.
In fact, it is everything.	Pravzaprav je vse.
This does not seem to be the case anymore.	Zdi se, da ni več tako.
But they are not there yet.	Vendar jih še ni.
As it was.	Kot je bilo.
He told us everything.	Vse nam je povedal.
There was no need to tell anyone.	Nikomur tega ni bilo treba povedati.
I think we should move on.	Mislim, da bi morali iti naprej.
who says so	kdo tako pravi?
We just didn't know anything else.	Samo nič drugega nismo vedeli.
You are mine, forever mine.	Ti si moj, za vedno moj.
You're not ready yet.	Nisi še pripravljen.
And that is exactly what happened.	In prav to se je zgodilo.
And why not.	In zakaj ne bi.
I didn't do anything about it.	Nič nisem naredil s tem.
It's just us here and nothing happened.	Tukaj smo samo mi in nič se ni zgodilo.
There was no one at home.	Doma ni bilo nikogar.
He sat back again.	Spet je sedel nazaj.
He knew who he was.	On je vedel, kdo je.
He was almost right.	Imel je skoraj prav.
Or a boy.	Ali pa fant.
It will be much, much better.	Veliko, veliko bolje bo.
He doesn't like us.	Ne mara nas.
Maybe it's true.	Mogoče res je.
There is a lot of that.	Tega je kar veliko.
I find it quite difficult to understand.	Precej težko razumem.
That's why it's so good.	Zato je tako dobro.
We really don't know much.	Res ne vemo veliko.
That was my job.	To je bilo moje delo.
He has someone else.	Ima nekoga drugega.
He almost got me back too.	Tudi mene je skoraj dobil nazaj.
So the time has come.	Zato je prišel čas.
I love it and continue to love it.	Všeč mi je in še naprej ga imam rad.
I haven't forgotten him.	Nisem ga pozabil.
Actually, we didn't.	Pravzaprav ga nismo.
And neither could you.	In tudi ti ne bi mogel.
Don't talk too much.	Ne govori preveč.
She wanted to be something else.	Želela je biti nekaj drugega.
Even to this day.	Tudi do danes.
I never had.	nikoli nisem imel.
Someone who will give it his all.	Nekdo, ki mu bo dal vse.
That's for sure.	To je zagotovo.
It will happen.	Zgodilo se bo.
I told you it wouldn't be like that.	Rekel sem ti, da ne bo tako.
I wonder how he feels about that.	Sprašujem se, kako se počuti zaradi tega.
How he found her.	Kako jo je našel.
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
I don't want that either.	Tudi tega nočem.
You had that.	Ste imeli to.
I want to know everything.	Želim vedeti vse.
It never is and it never will be.	Nikoli ni in nikoli ne bo.
That's how I played.	Tako sem igral.
If only for a while.	Če le za nekaj časa.
She did it.	To je storila.
It's better that way.	Bolje je, da je tako.
However, he failed to do so.	Vendar mu to ni uspelo.
He comes out.	On pride ven.
so will I.	tudi jaz bom.
If not, they should be.	Če ne, bi morali biti.
Just that, ”he said.	Samo to,« je rekel.
Let him live.	Naj živi.
I really have.	res imam.
I really should go for it.	Res bi moral iti po to.
That is what is right.	To je tisto, kar je prav.
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
He's right about that.	V tem ima prav.
However, he may not do so.	Vendar tega morda ne bo storil.
Here you have.	Tukaj imaš.
You are my friend.	Ti si moj prijatelj.
No one should do that.	Tega nihče ne bi smel narediti.
I did it and it's not nice.	Naredil sem to in ni lepo.
That's what she said.	Tako je rekla.
I'm glad for you to have it.	Vesel sem zate, da ga ima.
I haven't seen him here yet.	Tukaj ga še nisem videl.
She does it alone.	To počne sama.
He didn't know why.	Ni vedel zakaj.
That's really hard.	To je res težko.
I want you so badly.	Tako zelo si te želim.
Life for life.	Življenje za življenje.
And are they ever.	In ali so kdaj.
We'll see what happens.	Bomo videli, kaj bo.
You will be sorry.	Žal ti bo.
No one looked like him.	Nihče ni bil videti tako kot on.
That was my game.	To je bila moja igra.
I haven’t been and wouldn’t be for a long time.	Nisem še bil in še dolgo ne bi bil.
They went home.	Šla sta domov.
I really needed the money.	Res sem potreboval denar.
I can’t say much about it here yet.	Tukaj še ne morem povedati veliko o tem.
A lot of work needs to be done for this.	Za to je treba narediti veliko dela.
You should do something about it.	Moral bi nekaj narediti glede tega.
No one talked about it.	Nihče ni govoril o tem.
That's fine.	To je v redu.
Because now this is simply not an option.	Ker zdaj to preprosto ni možnost.
Here's the problem.	Tukaj je problem.
I'm sure he is.	Prepričan sem, da.
It's not that hard to do.	To ni tako težko narediti.
And nobody really wants that.	In tega si res nihče ne želi.
Which it seems.	Kar se zdi.
Really hard.	Res težko.
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
I wouldn't know.	Ne bi vedel.
I couldn't take it anymore.	Nisem mogel več.
Now, if only you'd come here.	Zdaj pa, če bi le prišel sem.
And they did just that.	In naredili so prav to.
They had a lot of them.	Imeli so jih veliko.
I wasn't even home yet.	Sploh nisem bil še doma.
I know it is.	Vem, da je.
Father spoke little as he went.	Oče je, ko je šel, govoril malo.
It's time to move on.	Čas je, da gre naprej.
Just a matter of time.	Samo vprašanje časa.
You must know everything.	Vse moraš vedeti.
All that was wrong was me.	Vse, kar je bilo narobe, sem bil jaz.
He got it right.	Prav je dobil.
He knew he had to do something.	Vedel je, da bi moral nekaj storiti.
We were there.	Tam smo bili.
I haven't seen her in days.	Že nekaj dni je nisem videl.
I think you should have known.	Mislim, da si moral vedeti.
We don't know how to do it.	Ne vemo, kako to narediti.
I don't need that now.	Zdaj tega ne potrebujem.
But it doesn't always work that way.	A ne gre vedno tako.
I mean it.	Mislim je.
I can have it.	lahko ga imam.
And we almost made it.	In skoraj nam je uspelo.
I wouldn't need them.	Ne bi jih potreboval.
We can't do that.	Tega ne moremo storiti.
How is this possible.	Kako je to mogoče.
I'm sure of it.	Prepričan sem o tem.
I can't say more.	Več ne morem povedati.
He couldn't be sure.	Ni mogel biti prepričan.
I hardly know her at all.	Sploh jo skoraj ne poznam.
We have him.	Imamo ga.
Probably because of the money.	Verjetno zaradi denarja.
That's why he's still here.	Zato je še vedno tukaj.
That's not right.	To ni prav.
If he wants to.	Če želi.
'from'.	'od'.
You've been gone a long time.	Dolgo te ni bilo.
And so they were.	In tako so bili.
This is something we need to do.	To je nekaj, kar moramo storiti.
She wasn't there long.	Tam je ni bilo dolgo.
Maybe you don't even care.	Morda vas pravzaprav niti ne zanima.
It was then.	Takrat je bilo.
Life must go on.	Življenje mora iti naprej.
There may be very few of them.	Morda jih bo zelo malo.
I just had to be sure.	Moral sem biti samo prepričan.
As he expected.	Kot je pričakoval.
I still am.	Še vedno sem.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
Enough about me.	Dovolj o meni.
I really liked it back then.	Takrat mi je bilo zelo všeč.
He is expected to leave soon.	Kmalu naj bi odšel.
I already found it.	Sem že našel.
My father let me go.	Oče mi je dovolil, da grem.
Too much going on, too much work.	Preveč se dogaja, preveč dela.
It will be as if you were never there.	Tako bo, kot da te nikoli ni bilo.
Have you been to this city before?	Ste že bili v tem mestu?
I really made that decision.	Res sem se tako odločil.
Nobody had.	Nihče ni imel.
He had to be fine.	Moral je biti v redu.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
Or maybe it would.	Ali pa bi morda.
It can be done.	To je mogoče storiti.
It can't be helped now.	Zdaj se ne da pomagati.
This was the first time he had done so.	To je bilo prvič, da je to storil.
None of us.	Nihče od nas.
Therefore, there is such that.	Zato obstaja tako, da .
It makes me feel good.	Zaradi tega se počutim dobro.
She had never wanted this before.	Nikoli prej si tega ni želela.
That, too, would be really difficult.	Tudi to bi bilo res težko.
He could see.	Lahko je videl.
I just didn't make it.	Samo to mi ni uspelo.
I've been trying for a really long time.	Res sem dolgo poskušal.
He did his job.	Opravil je svoje delo.
I'm serious here.	Tukaj sem resno.
I wish you could see more.	Želim si, da bi videli več.
I let her go her own way.	Pustil sem ji, da gre po svoje.
I very much doubt it.	v to zelo dvomim.
I don't have it.	Meni ni.
When you have it, you have it.	Ko ga imaš, ga imaš.
No time.	Ni časa.
That's how it is now.	Tako je zdaj.
My friend bought it for me.	Moj prijatelj mi je to kupil.
I can never tell.	Nikoli ne morem povedati.
It's not okay at all.	Sploh ni v redu.
That was really good.	To je bilo res dobro.
There was a lot of work,	Bilo je veliko dela,
It's just, it was there.	Samo, tam je bilo.
We should stay together.	Morali bi ostati skupaj.
You wouldn't tell me.	Ne bi mi povedal.
No one seems to be able to help him.	Zdi se, da mu nihče ne more pomagati.
It looked like.	Videti je bilo kot.
I'm sure, like me.	Prepričan sem, kot jaz.
Something else too.	Tudi nekaj drugega.
This is not a problem for you.	To ni problem za vas.
It was better.	Bilo je bolje.
Maybe there's an opportunity.	Mogoče je priložnost.
Now we know more about it.	Zdaj vemo več o tem.
It was hard, hard, hard.	Bilo je težko, težko, težko.
I was a little surprised.	Bil sem malo presenečen.
It's been a long time.	Dolgo je ni bilo.
He didn't seem to be.	Zdi se, da ni bil.
All in your own way.	Vse po svoje.
And so it wasn’t enough to know.	In zato ni bilo dovolj vedeti.
You are not alone.	Nisi edini.
I'll hear you.	Slišal te bom.
Apparently he was.	Očitno je bil.
But it was not good.	Vendar ni bilo dobro.
But not much.	Vendar ne veliko.
That's why I forgot.	Zaradi tega sem pozabil.
This is not a real problem.	To ni pravi problem.
He doesn't come anymore.	Ne pride več.
They would both move on.	Oba bi šla naprej.
You didn't want him.	Nisi ga želel.
And maybe he's right.	In morda je prav.
He's got you.	Ima te.
I haven't seen him in a while.	Že nekaj časa ga nisem videl.
You don't have to.	Ni vam treba.
And a child.	In otrok.
Tell her something.	Povej ji kaj.
The work is not as simple as it seems.	Delo ni tako preprosto, kot se zdi.
They didn't have time for that.	Niso imeli časa za to.
Person .	Oseba .
You had a chance.	Imel si priložnost.
He knew he shouldn't.	Vedel je, da ne bi smel.
I didn't see where you did it.	Nisem videl, kje si to naredil.
I just don't believe it.	Samo ne verjamem.
She's never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni storila.
He said he has.	Rekel je, da ima.
I totally believe you.	popolnoma ti verjamem.
And that's all.	In to je vse.
How could this have happened? 	Kako se je lahko zgodilo?
She had to know everything.	Vse je morala vedeti.
I believe in that.	verjamem v to.
Anyone can do it.	To lahko stori vsak.
And life is.	In življenje je.
It never is and never will be.	Nikoli ni in nikoli ne bo.
He had to get out quite a bit.	Moral je precej ven.
Because we have a problem.	Ker imamo problem.
He had to know.	Moral je vedeti.
Never seen so much before.	Še nikoli videl toliko.
Who he was.	Kdo je bil.
another.	drugega.
I could give you a job.	Lahko bi ti dal delo.
I didn't know where we were.	Nisem vedel, kje smo.
Maybe because he was sure she would say yes.	Mogoče zato, ker je bil prepričan, da bo rekla da.
You should know better.	Moral bi vedeti bolje.
Maybe he heard her.	Mogoče jo je slišal.
I'll tell you one more time.	Povedal vam bom še enkrat.
However, much remains to be done.	Vendar je treba še veliko narediti.
No one is doing this at the moment and things are looking fine.	Trenutno tega ne počne nihče in stvari so videti v redu.
Either way, you'll tell me.	Tako ali tako mi boš povedal.
There are so many.	Toliko jih je.
He didn't try to tell me it would be okay.	Ni mi poskušal povedati, da bi bilo v redu.
He had to know.	Moral je vedeti.
I wanted to be with you to see why.	Hotel sem biti s tabo, da vidim zakaj.
None of this seems possible.	Nič od tega se ne zdi mogoče.
Know no more than that.	Vedeti ne več kot to.
It's obvious.	Očitno je.
He says why.	Pravi zakaj.
I've never been there, not even once.	Nikoli nisem bil tam, niti enkrat.
I no longer see wrong or right.	Ne vidim več narobe ali prav.
This no longer exists.	To ne obstaja več.
Just one more time.	Samo še enkrat.
Absolutely fine with me.	Popolnoma v redu z mano.
I'm sure you are.	Prepričan sem, da si.
And actually everyone.	In pravzaprav vsi.
That's how you want it, that's how you got it.	Tako si želiš, tako si to dobil.
I just wanted to be me.	Hotel sem biti samo jaz.
Do nothing.	Ne delati ničesar.
This is so wrong.	To je tako narobe.
It's something we all have.	To je nekaj, kar imamo vsi.
There were so many people.	Tako je bilo veliko ljudi.
That's a lot for me.	To je zame veliko.
I'm going back there tomorrow morning.	Jutri zjutraj grem nazaj tja.
I just know, that's all.	Samo vem, to je vse.
She would know what to do.	Vedela bi, kaj storiti.
Will definitely be back.	Zagotovo se bo vrnil.
What you said then was nice.	Kar si takrat rekel, je bilo lepo.
He said so quickly.	Tako hitro je povedal.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
Must be.	Mora biti.
That's what you wanted, isn't it?	To si želel, kajne?
Sam is my friend.	Sam je moj prijatelj.
He gave it to me.	Dal mi je.
This is the only game in town.	To je edina igra v mestu.
They didn't even see him come.	Sploh ga niso videli, da bi prišel.
It was simply beautiful.	Bilo je preprosto lepo.
I don't believe that is enough.	Ne verjamem, da je to dovolj.
That's not happening today.	Danes se to ne dogaja.
No one seems to want to do that.	Zdi se, da tega nihče ne želi storiti.
You are the only one.	Ti si edini.
I didn't have enough time.	Nisem imel dovolj časa.
And tell him why.	In mu povej zakaj.
However, he does something for me.	Vendar pa naredi nekaj zame.
Now it was more.	Zdaj je bilo več.
I just wasn’t sure.	Samo nisem bil prepričan.
If it wasn’t serious before, it was now.	Če prej ni bilo resno, je bilo zdaj.
I don’t know why this happened.	Ne vem zakaj se je to zgodilo.
I would love to have it.	Rad bi ga imel.
Just where it will start remains to be seen.	Le kje bo začel, je treba še videti.
He sat and waited.	Sedel je in čakal.
You didn’t know how long you were going to wait.	Nisi vedel, kako dolgo boš čakal.
And it's still true.	In še vedno je res.
Because she has been gone for so long.	Ker je že tako dolgo ni bilo.
It will never be enough.	Nikoli ne bo dovolj.
It’s really pretty simple.	To je res precej preprosto.
I hope you like it!.	Upam, da vam je všeč!.
And so will you.	In tudi ti boš.
There are a few.	Nekaj ​​jih je.
Actually, nothing.	Pravzaprav nič.
They are not like us.	Niso kot mi.
No one can.	Nihče ne more.
He's not going to get that every week.	Tega ne bo dobil vsak teden.
That's what it does.	To je tisto, kar počne.
He was just trying to be helpful.	Samo poskušal je biti v pomoč.
Only, I wouldn't.	Samo, ne bi.
However, this is not the case here.	Vendar tukaj ni tako.
I'm not sorry.	Žal mi ni žal.
I'm not sure what this is about.	Nisem prepričan, za kaj gre.
Many people were out of work.	Veliko ljudi je bilo brez dela.
It always is.	Vedno je.
But I couldn't see him.	Vendar ga nisem mogel videti.
Why else could he die.	Zakaj bi lahko še umrl.
Like he would.	Kot bi on.
I think I would know that.	Mislim, da bi to vedel.
This is nice.	To je lepo.
We have to do it ourselves.	To moramo narediti sami.
I don't need this in the morning.	Tega zjutraj ne potrebujem.
That was the only reason.	To je bil edini razlog.
We were together almost all the time.	Skoraj ves čas sva bila skupaj.
That was the thing.	To je bila stvar.
This can be seen as follows.	To je mogoče videti na naslednji način.
I said.	sem rekel.
If only it weren't for us.	Samo da ni.
You have to eat now.	Zdaj moraš jesti.
He does what he wants.	Dela, kar želi.
He won't, he can't.	Ne bo, ne more.
Maybe that's why nothing happened.	Morda se zato ni zgodilo nič.
You should be there.	Moral bi biti tam.
There are a lot of people.	Veliko ljudi je.
In fact, it is true.	Pravzaprav je to res.
She wanted nothing more than that.	Nič več kot to si ni želela.
This has never happened before.	To se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
That will be just as good.	To bo prav tako dobro.
He had to say that.	Moral je to povedati.
It is a thing or it is not.	Stvar je ali pa ni.
It makes you feel good.	Zaradi tega se počuti dobro.
He went back, he couldn't do anything else.	Šel je nazaj, drugega ni mogel.
I really have nothing to do.	Res mi ni kaj narediti.
I wanted to be better than that.	Hotel sem biti boljši od tega.
In this way.	Na ta način.
This is what happened to him.	To se mu je zgodilo.
If he goes back there, he'll see.	Če se bo vrnil tja, bo videl.
Everything is better in the morning.	Zjutraj je vse bolje.
I mean, he never asked me about it.	Mislim, nikoli me ni vprašal o tem.
He could hear.	Lahko je slišal.
Tell him again.	Povej mu še enkrat.
They would be.	Bili bi.
I was behind him.	Bil sem za njim.
I have my own car.	Imam svoj avto.
He had to do what he had to do.	Moral je narediti, kar je moral.
It's so beautiful.	Tako lepo je.
So we didn’t have a lot of work to do.	Tako da nismo imeli veliko dela.
He liked it too much.	Preveč mu je bilo všeč.
It was easy to do.	Bilo je lahko narediti.
Just like next week.	Tako kot naslednji teden.
I have.	Imam.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
Now he does what he likes.	Zdaj dela, kar mu je všeč.
He doesn't know me that well.	Ne pozna me toliko.
Anything was possible.	Vse je bilo mogoče.
And they were right.	In imeli so prav.
Maybe it's true.	Mogoče je res.
He wanted to know more.	Želel je vedeti več.
Maybe that's okay.	Mogoče je pa to v redu.
No one needs him anymore.	Nihče ga več ne potrebuje.
I don't want him to know about it.	Nočem, da ve za to.
There are a few of them now.	Zdaj jih je nekaj.
He doesn't like me at all.	Sploh me ne mara.
He never knew.	Nikoli ni vedel.
It really is very good.	Res je zelo dobro.
You will die now.	Zdaj boš umrl.
But in front of him.	Ali pred njim.
I see you are very interested.	Vidim, da te zelo zanima.
They didn't know it was there.	Niso vedeli, da je tam.
There may be too many.	Morda jih je preveč.
Nice work on that !.	Lepo delo na tem!.
It would seem.	Bi se zdelo.
The question is why this is so.	Vprašanje je, zakaj je temu tako.
As good as it was then.	Tako dobro, kot je bilo takrat.
I mean,.	Mislim,.
My father wants me out.	Moj oče me želi ven.
However, this is not as difficult as you will see here.	Vendar pa to ni tako težko, kot boste videli tukaj.
But I was ready.	Vendar sem bil pripravljen.
Everything was fine.	Vse je bilo dobro.
There was nothing he could do.	Nič ni mogel storiti.
But he knew he had to do something.	A vedel je, da mora nekaj narediti.
You're right.	Pravi ti.
But he didn't want to talk about it that day.	A o tem tisti dan ni želel govoriti.
It’s about what you don’t like.	Gre za tisto, kar vam ni všeč.
Is that what you mean? 	Ali to misliš?
i feel good too.	tudi jaz se dobro počutim.
It was actually good.	Pravzaprav je bilo dobro.
Or maybe he doesn’t have more than.	Ali pa morda nima več kot.
Just like you didn't do it.	Tako kot tega nisi naredil ti.
Not if you don't like it.	Ne, če ti ni všeč.
He became quite angry.	Postal je precej jezen.
Everything in its own way.	Vse po svoje.
He was in place.	Bil je na mestu.
It is not easy.	Ne gre za preprosto.
Everyone knew who he was.	Vsi so vedeli, kdo je.
The child did not return.	Otrok se ni vrnil.
I didn’t know if anyone won or if someone died.	Nisem vedel, če je kdo zmagal, ali je kdo umrl.
She wanted him and only him.	Želela je njega in samo njega.
You did it.	Uspelo vam je.
We are in this together.	V tem smo skupaj.
Maybe not even before.	Morda niti prej ne.
Don't talk to me.	Ne govori z mano.
No, not really.	Ne, res ne.
But even without it.	A tudi brez tega.
Something happened.	Nekaj ​​se je zgodilo.
It can be.	To je lahko.
And he will do it.	In to bo naredil.
Something is definitely better than nothing.	Nekaj ​​je zagotovo bolje kot nič.
Just like him.	Tako kot on.
And you know why.	In veš zakaj.
We have to be.	Moramo biti.
They are obviously behind us.	Očitno so za nami.
It was home and always will be.	Bilo je doma in vedno bo.
He saw it and won.	To je videl in zmagal.
He wants something to eat.	Želi nekaj za jesti.
He said it was.	Rekel je, da je.
I needed some help.	Potreboval sem nekaj pomoči.
The question is not so simple.	Vprašanje ni tako preprosto.
I came.	Prišel sem.
We can't know.	Ne moremo vedeti.
She said too much.	Preveč je rekla.
I don't want to work with him anymore.	Nočem več delati z njim.
He ate nothing.	Nič ni jedel.
And he helped her.	In ji je pomagal.
It’s not often that we have a chance.	Ni pogosto, da imamo priložnost.
We were never enough for her.	Nikoli ji nismo bili dovolj.
He says he is.	Pravi, da je.
We won't be long.	Ne bomo dolgo.
This is hard.	To je težko.
I'm going really fast '.	Grem res hitro'.
He was so angry.	Bil je tako jezen.
Right.	Saj res.
Not very likely.	Ni zelo verjetno.
No, that's not right either.	Ne, tudi to ni prav.
I know he's getting better.	Vem, da mu gre na bolje.
So he called to ask.	Zato je poklical, da bi vprašal.
That was my friend.	To je bil moj prijatelj.
But it was also from someone else.	A bil je tudi od nekoga drugega.
Not so much anymore.	Ne več toliko.
Everything was possible there.	Tam je bilo vse mogoče.
You are what you want to be.	To si ti, kar želiš biti.
He’s someone you can’t help but like.	On je nekdo, ki mu ne moreš pomagati, da ne bi bil všeč.
They are here.	Tukaj so.
More than enough.	Več kot dovolj.
It helps me.	Pomaga mi.
And that's probably the problem.	In to je verjetno problem.
All of us.	Mi vsi .
And they are certainly few.	In zagotovo jih je malo.
I like to believe there is.	Rad verjamem, da obstaja.
And they should both work together.	In oba bi morala delati skupaj.
No, I shouldn't.	Ne, ne bi smel.
You had me.	Imel si me.
I used to go and sit there.	Včasih sem šel in sedel tja.
I just didn't like this one tonight.	Samo ta nocoj mi ni bil všeč.
That money was nothing.	Ta denar ni bil nič.
Everyone was still at home.	Vsi so bili še doma.
If you like someone, tell them.	Če ti je nekdo všeč, mu povej.
And so it is for you.	In tako je to za vas.
Much needs to be done.	Veliko je treba narediti.
I think you are.	Mislim, da si.
And that too.	In tudi to.
Nothing out of place, but still.	Nič na mestu, pa vendar.
I think he got it.	Mislim, da jo je dobil.
He was my father.	Bil je moj oče.
He simply knew without knowing why he knew.	Preprosto je vedel, ne da bi vedel, zakaj je vedel.
No, they are not and never have been.	Ne, niso in nikoli niso bili.
You didn't say that.	Tega nisi rekel.
I mean, sometimes.	Mislim, včasih.
I have to go, and so do you.	Jaz moram iti, ti pa tudi.
Maybe he doesn't like himself either.	Mogoče se tudi sam ne mara.
I'm sure it is.	Prepričan sem, da je.
To be or not to be, that is the question.	Biti ali ne biti, to je vprašanje.
Not so much for me.	Zame ne toliko.
Actually, I'm almost there.	Pravzaprav sem skoraj tam.
Don't tell me.	Ne povej mi.
do it.	naredi to.
They never are and never will be.	Nikoli niso in nikoli ne bodo.
That wasn't much either.	Tudi to ni bilo veliko.
I have all the problems.	Imam vse težave.
I am nobody and everyone.	Jaz sem nihče in vsi.
I see you.	vidim te.
No one really knew what was going on.	Nihče pravzaprav ni vedel, kaj se dogaja.
In fact, they were here.	Pravzaprav so bili tukaj.
I would never do that.	Tega ne bi nikoli naredil.
We are not our own.	Nismo svoji.
Now he has it.	Zdaj ga ima.
You won't be able to go out tonight.	Nocoj ne boš mogel iti ven.
I have nothing to do.	Nimam kaj početi.
I really didn't mean anything else.	Res nisem mislil nič drugega.
That's all behind me now.	To je zdaj vse za mano.
I haven't done that yet.	Tega še nisem počel.
Here it goes.	Tukaj gre.
And me.	In mi.
But they are here.	Vendar so tukaj.
This is not a game.	To ni igra.
It was the same with us.	Tako je bilo tudi pri nas.
Or so it seemed.	Ali pa se je tako zdelo.
I hope they do something about it.	Upam, da so kaj naredili glede tega.
It was the first time she had been there.	To je bilo prvič, da je bila tam.
It was good, really good.	Bilo je dobro, res dobro.
We will too for many years.	Tudi mi bomo več let.
No one left.	Nihče ni odšel.
It's not getting any better.	Ne gre na bolje.
It doesn't feel good.	Ne počuti se dobro.
I'm sorry about all that, you know.	Žal mi je za vse to, veš.
Probably not, since he's your friend.	Verjetno tudi nisi, saj je tvoj prijatelj.
I love all of that too.	Tudi meni je vse to všeč.
No one would tell me why.	Nihče mi ne bi povedal zakaj.
And we're not there.	In nismo tam.
I didn't like that.	To mi ni bilo všeč.
I'm glad it's you and not me.	Vesel sem, da si ti in ne jaz.
We can't do it alone.	Ne moremo sami.
I will meet you.	te bom spoznal.
It's too much now.	Zdaj je preveč.
Unfortunately, nothing is being done about it.	Žal se glede tega ne naredi nič.
And maybe there is still a person.	In morda še vedno obstaja oseba.
And maybe it is.	In morda je.
I have enough for both of us.	Imam dovolj za oba.
Even if that someone is me.	Tudi če sem ta nekdo jaz.
I should do something about it. 	Moral bi nekaj narediti s tem. 
This will be my job.	To bo moje delo.
I did it once and did it.	Enkrat sem to naredil in tudi naredil.
Nobody really cares.	Nikogar pravzaprav ne zanima.
As if nothing happened.	Kot da se ni nič zgodilo.
I just want to make sure that's the case.	Želim se samo prepričati, da je tako.
I would really like to see that.	To bi res rad videl.
It was forever a long time for anyone to promise.	Za vedno je bilo dolgo časa, da bi kdo obljubil.
No matter what he said.	Ne glede na to, kaj je rekel.
We'll be better.	Bolje nam bo.
She is good to us because she wants to be.	Dobra je do nas, ker sama to želi.
It seems like it should be.	Zdi se, kot da mora biti.
Surprised is good.	Presenečen je dober.
I knew that was true.	Vedel sem, da je to res.
They could be that.	Lahko bi bili to.
How could you let her do that? '	Kako si ji lahko dovolil to narediti?'.
I thought there was something.	Mislil sem, da je nekaj.
He can't help himself.	Ne more si pomagati.
Something like that.	Nekaj ​​takega.
He really likes it.	Res mu je všeč.
She went to him.	Šla je do njega.
he asked.	je vprašal.
We can't now.	Zdaj ne moremo več.
When he got home.	Ko je prišel domov.
I know you now.	Zdaj te poznam.
We know they are.	Vemo, da so.
Nothing was enough.	Nič ni bilo dovolj.
I’m not sure we don’t even know what that is.	Nisem prepričan, da sploh ne vemo, kaj je to.
If I was.	Če bi bil.
I went there.	Šel sem tja.
Everyone had something to say about it.	Vsak je imel kaj povedati o tem.
And they are.	In so.
Okay, we have a few too.	V redu, tudi mi jih imamo nekaj.
Like, more than like, like.	Všeč, več kot všeč, všeč.
He still needs some work.	Še vedno potrebuje nekaj dela.
I will go back.	šel bom nazaj.
So he failed.	Zato mu ni uspelo.
We will always know next to nothing.	Vedno bomo vedeli skoraj nič.
I may never see many of them again.	Veliko jih morda nikoli več ne bom videl.
Let there be three.	Naj bodo tri.
I can't today.	danes ne morem.
I would have a good job.	Imel bi dobro službo.
It just wasn't there.	Preprosto ga ni bilo.
It must be nice.	Mora biti lepo.
In fact, probably definitely.	Pravzaprav verjetno zagotovo.
I didn’t even know what it was.	Sploh nisem vedel, kaj je to.
Before all that, when life was simple.	Pred vsem tem, ko je bilo življenje preprosto.
I fully understand that.	To popolnoma razumem.
What a good boy.	Kako dober fant.
I did this because it was work.	To sem naredil, ker je bilo delo.
And good at that.	In pri tem dober.
He would do it.	On bi to naredil.
I've been before.	bil sem že prej.
I saw them once.	Enkrat sem jih videl.
I wish it was.	Želim si, da bi bilo.
There was simply nowhere to go from there.	Od tam preprosto ni bilo kam iti.
Because it's so much more than that.	Ker je veliko več kot to.
It seemed almost not enough.	Zdelo se je, da ni skoraj dovolj.
This is not happening.	To se ne dogaja.
You don't even know.	Sploh ne veš.
Because it is not.	Ker ni.
He needed her to know that.	Potreboval je, da to ve.
And not much if you can.	In ne veliko, če lahko.
I could be.	Lahko bi bil.
I'm the one right now.	Jaz sem trenutno tisti.
This must be wrong.	To mora biti narobe.
I do.	Jaz že.
You can never go out again.	Nikoli več ne moreš ven.
He will be in everything.	On bo v vsem.
Not someone he doesn't even know.	Ne nekoga, ki ga sploh ne pozna.
It was unlikely he would ever see her again.	Malo verjetno je bilo, da jo bo še kdaj videl.
It is now.	To je zdaj.
He had little to say.	Malo je imel povedati.
We had nothing to eat.	Nič nismo imeli za jesti.
I will say it again.	Povedal bom še enkrat.
He had no children.	Ni imel otrok.
If you are.	Če ste.
I didn't know when you would.	Nisem vedel, kdaj boš.
There is no other.	Drugega ni.
And he's right.	In prav ima.
All you can do is you.	Vse, kar si lahko, si ti.
They were.	To so bili.
Because he was and he knew it.	Ker je bil in je to vedel.
I was glad to see him.	Bil sem vesel, da sem ga videl.
That's what's happening here.	To se tukaj dogaja.
Who knows, maybe they will.	Kdo ve, mogoče bodo.
Nothing would be easy.	Nič ne bi bilo lahko.
I'm not sure about that.	Nisem prepričan o tem.
Which also worked.	Kar je tudi uspelo.
the boy asked.	je vprašal fant.
I had him and he had me.	Imel sem ga in on je imel mene.
And maybe it would be better.	In morda bi bilo bolje.
I'll tell you something.	Nekaj ​​ti bom povedal.
Really, really nice.	Res, res lepo.
He often works from home.	Pogosto dela doma.
We did this as follows.	To smo storili na naslednji način.
I am very, very good.	Zelo, zelo sem dober.
Everything is happening.	Vse se dogaja.
Now her.	Zdaj jo.
That's not true either.	Tudi to ni res.
I’m sure there will be some of that.	Prepričan sem, da bodo nekaj od tega.
And about us.	In o nas.
Something will have to be done about it tomorrow.	Jutri bo treba glede tega nekaj narediti.
And there was probably nothing.	In verjetno ni bilo nič.
Yes, I could do that.	Da, to bi lahko storil.
It's never that simple.	Nikoli ni tako preprosto.
They are just there and they are what they are.	Samo tam so in so to, kar so.
Don't tell anyone.	Ne povej tega nikomur.
We are just in this.	Mi smo samo v tem.
It was like a game.	Bilo je kot igra.
Usually.	Običajno.
You will be some of it.	Nekaj ​​od tega boste.
I wish I had more time.	Rad bi imel več časa.
I don’t even know how that’s possible.	Sploh ne vem, kako je to mogoče.
There is something wrong here.	Tukaj je nekaj narobe.
But there was no time for that either.	Vendar tudi ni bilo časa za to.
Someone will come for you.	Nekdo bo prišel po vas.
not yet.	ne še.
Too much work, man.	Preveč dela, človek.
However, it does not seem likely.	Vendar se ne zdi verjetno.
He is like a child.	On je kot otrok.
Don't tell me about being alone, man.	Ne govori mi o tem, da si sam, človek.
I really should be working on that.	Res bi moral delati na tem.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ni.
It's been so long.	Tako dolgo je bilo.
Please, no more.	Prosim, ne več.
That time is now.	Ta čas je zdaj.
You know what would happen.	Veš kaj bi se zgodilo.
Had to know.	Moral vedeti.
He couldn't tell what it was.	Ni mogel povedati, kaj je bilo.
More on that soon.	Več o tem kmalu.
He was there for several days.	Tam je bil več dni.
This is certainly right.	Zagotovo je to prav.
I know who.	vem kdo.
And maybe no one should tell you what to think.	In morda vam nihče ne bi smel povedati, kaj naj mislite.
And therefore.	In zato.
I'm doing so much better.	Toliko bolje mi gre.
I know you're not.	Vem, da nisi.
Does anyone know anything?	Ali kdo kaj ve?
I don't know who it could be.	Ne vem, kdo bi to lahko bil.
He did that.	To je storil.
No one is behind us.	Nihče ni za nami.
sorry for.	žal mi je za.
He had none of that.	Nič od tega ni imel.
That will be good.	To bo dobro.
He needs a job.	Potrebuje službo.
This, as we know, did not happen.	To se, kot vemo, ni zgodilo.
I thought it might be difficult, but it wasn't.	Mislil sem, da bo morda težko, a ni bilo.
He has a lot to say.	Ima veliko za povedati.
Please tell me what happened.	Prosim, povej mi, kaj se je zgodilo.
The money is not mine.	Denar ni moj.
We are better than that.	Boljši smo od tega.
That way we know what is supposed to happen.	Tako vemo, kaj naj bi se zgodilo.
I will stay with you.	ostal bom s tabo.
He kept doing what he was doing.	Kar naprej je delal, kar je počel.
He did see her.	Res jo je videl.
It doesn't seem that long ago.	Ne zdi se tako dolgo nazaj.
Today, that is no longer the case.	Danes ni več tako.
It looks like that too.	Tudi videti je tako.
And boy, or ever.	In fant, ali kdaj.
I'm here for you.	Tukaj sem zaradi tebe.
Ni.	Ni.
To the big house.	V veliko hišo.
I have something to say.	imam nekaj za povedati.
We have enough of it.	Dovolj ga imamo.
I never want to be friends with you!	Nikoli ne želim biti prijatelj s tabo!
you are human	ti si človek.
He thought no one knew.	Mislil je, da nihče ne ve.
And so does he.	In tudi on.
And you know, we can't do that too much.	In veste, tega ne moremo narediti preveč.
I hope you are OK.	Upam, da si v redu.
I don’t know if we ever had a chance.	Ne vem, ali smo kdaj imeli priložnost.
He still feels good.	Še vedno se počuti dobro.
He did not speak.	Govoril ni.
She didn't have to be there.	Ni ji bilo treba biti tam.
I want to see you.	Želim te videti.
I thought it was you.	Mislil sem, da si ti.
I've been doing this for years.	To počnem že leta.
It was really hard.	Bilo je res težko.
Everyone liked them.	Vsem so bili všeč.
He certainly didn’t feel well today.	Danes se zagotovo ni počutil dobro.
I would like to go.	rad bi šel.
That's how he met her.	Tako jo je spoznal.
No one ever told me.	Nihče mi ni nikoli povedal.
He won't like it, he said.	Ne bo mu všeč, je rekel.
But now he couldn't.	Zdaj pa ni mogel.
I never felt out of place there.	Tam se nikoli nisem počutil na mestu.
I went out and out.	Šla sem ven in ven.
It is to be you and to be sure.	To je biti ti in biti prepričan.
They are next.	So naslednji.
And he likes me.	In všeč sem mu.
He was over it.	Bil je nad tem.
I was fine with that.	Bilo mi je v redu s tem.
We still have that.	To še imamo.
Until then, he couldn’t do much.	Do takrat ni mogel storiti ničesar veliko.
I understand how he feels.	Razumem, kako se počuti.
I didn’t let myself work or go there.	Nisem se pustil delati ali iti tja.
They knew and they were right.	Vedeli so in imeli so prav.
He certainly didn't have time.	Zagotovo ni imel časa.
At the time, anything seemed possible.	Takrat se je zdelo vse mogoče.
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni več.
It wasn't you.	Nisi bil ti.
And luckily he said yes.	In na srečo je rekel da.
There was no money for that.	Za to ni bilo denarja.
You are still my child.	Še vedno si moj otrok.
It takes a lot of time.	Potrebuje veliko časa.
What she said is true.	Kar je rekla, je res.
All the time.	Ves čas.
That happened here tonight.	To se je nocoj zgodilo tukaj.
Just like today.	Tako kot danes.
I'm sure you'll succeed.	Prepričan sem, da ti bo uspelo.
What won't probably won't happen.	Kar ne bo verjetno ne bo.
I do not understand.	Ne razumem.
You have to go now.	Takoj moraš iti.
And so would you.	In tudi ti bi.
And if not.	In če ne.
And she was.	In bila je.
There was something to be said.	Bilo je nekaj za povedati.
That's it for today.	To je to za danes.
He wishes he hadn't.	Želi si, da ne bi.
I can not.	Ne morem.
There are many more of them than us.	Veliko več jih je kot nas.
And so they often were.	In tako so pogosto tudi bili.
I do not understand.	ne razumem.
He was good to me.	Bil je dober do mene.
I tried to make sure I thought I would.	Poskušal sem se prepričati, da bi mislil, da bo.
Now you know what you are.	Zdaj veš kaj si.
To be.	Biti.
I'm actually pretty good.	Pravzaprav sem kar dobro.
However, he did not do much work.	Vendar ni opravil veliko dela.
I know him so well.	tako dobro ga poznam.
Yes.	Je.
I’m not sure it’s anything else.	Nisem prepričan, da je kaj drugega.
To do it again.	Da to storim še enkrat.
'has'.	'ima'.
I can't do it alone.	Sam ne morem.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
I don't even know what it is.	Sploh ne vem, kaj je.
This will happen quickly.	To se bo zgodilo hitro.
You can never tell.	Nikoli ne moreš povedati.
I'd be all for it.	Jaz bi bil za to.
It may not be good, but it’s there.	Morda ni dober, vendar je tam.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
He was very angry.	Bil je zelo jezen.
It's a 'now.	Zdaj je a'.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe.
I thought not.	Mislil sem, da ne.
It is, but only a little.	Je, vendar le malo.
No one knew what to do.	Nihče ni vedel, kaj storiti.
You should stay with him.	Moral bi ostati z njim.
He has a job.	Ima službo.
It was almost not enough.	Ni bilo skoraj dovolj.
Nothing too please.	Nič preveč prosim.
You are the one who is not.	Ti si tisti, ki ni.
He called to talk to me.	Poklical je, da bi govoril z mano.
This is no longer the case.	To ni več tako.
I tried and tried.	Poskušal sem in poskušal.
To come.	Da bi prišel.
It continues to do so.	To počne še naprej.
But no.	Vendar ne.
Next to me.	Ob meni.
Before that a teacher.	Pred tem učitelj.
I went back to my room.	Vrnil sem se v svojo sobo.
And we will do that.	In to bomo storili.
That's very much.	To je zelo.
There are too many of them.	Preveč jih je.
Not enough for.	Ne dovolj za.
That's how they both went.	Tako sta šla oba.
It was still early.	Bilo je še zgodaj.
Can anyone help me in a better way.	Ali mi lahko kdo pomaga na boljši način.
Something needs to be done about this.	Glede tega je treba nekaj narediti.
You have to do it yourself.	To moraš narediti sam.
And we knew what we had to do.	In vedeli smo, kaj moramo narediti.
But it wasn't much.	A ni bilo veliko.
Not at all.	Niti malo.
I was there myself.	Sam sem bil tam.
Sometimes I think so.	Včasih tako mislim.
Nobody bought it for me.	Nihče mi ga ni kupil.
There's no one else here.	Nikogar drugega ni tukaj.
Maybe I would know something.	Mogoče bi kaj vedela.
Why is this happening?	Zakaj se to dogaja?
We've seen it happen.	Videli smo, kako se to dogaja.
This is quite common.	To je precej pogosto.
However, he does not seem to be doing so.	Vendar se zdi, da tega ne počne.
Not much, but we like it.	Ni veliko, a nam je všeč.
I could never buy what she said.	Nikoli nisem mogel kupiti tega, kar je rekla.
I don’t believe there is anyone like him.	Ne verjamem, da obstaja kdo, kot je on.
We could have a nice time.	Lahko bi se imeli lepo.
I knew that for sure.	To sem zagotovo vedel.
Maybe it was more than that.	Morda je bilo več od tega.
There is little to do.	Malo je za narediti.
It was not easy to get to work today.	Danes na delo ni bilo lahko.
He gambled and lost.	Igral je na srečo in izgubil.
Lots, lots, more.	Veliko, veliko, več.
I would very much like that.	To bi si zelo želel.
It is the right time for you.	Za vas je vsak čas pravi.
I knew all along.	Vedel sem ves čas.
There was really nothing to do at home.	Doma res ni bilo kaj početi.
And he knew I was too.	In vedel je, da sem tudi jaz.
There's not much you can do.	Ne moreš veliko narediti.
No one saw him do it.	Nihče ga ni videl narediti.
He still needs money for everything.	Še vedno potrebuje denar za vse.
I need to know who did this.	Moram vedeti, kdo je to naredil.
We had a great time.	Imeli smo se lepo.
I know you're not interested in money.	Vem, da te ne zanima denar.
It wasn't good.	Ni bilo dobro.
I said so.	Rekel sem, da je tako.
He doesn't eat much.	Ne poje veliko.
And maybe she was.	In morda je bila.
He knew immediately that it must be true.	Takoj je vedel, da mora biti res.
He was sure he had never seen this before.	Prepričan je bil, da tega še nikoli ni videl.
He decided not to do that.	Odločil se je, da tega ne bo storil.
I had my life back.	Imel sem svoje življenje nazaj.
If you don't know.	Če ne veš.
That day would be good.	Ta dan bi bil dober.
Probably too much.	Verjetno preveč.
Only.	Samo.
I don't want them here yet.	Ne želim jih še tukaj.
He had everything he could want.	Imel je vse, kar si je lahko želel.
We were .	Bili smo .
I was just a kid, nobody told me anything.	Bil sem samo otrok, nihče mi ni rekel ničesar.
This seems to be happening.	Zdi se, da se to dogaja.
He was not ready for that.	Ni bil pripravljen na to.
I had nothing else.	Nič drugega nisem imel.
in.	in.
She knew better.	Vedela je bolje.
I want to go.	Želim iti.
I saw you early in the morning.	Videl sem te zgodaj zjutraj.
Here’s a thing he’s never seen before.	Tukaj je stvar, ki je še nikoli ni videl.
It was early in the morning.	Bilo je zgodaj zjutraj.
Soon they all will.	Kmalu bodo vsi.
It's always like that.	Vedno je tako.
I've heard so much.	Toliko sem slišal.
That may be true.	To je morda res.
I don't think he was.	Mislim, da ni bil.
He told her what everyone was talking about.	Povedal ji je, za kaj gre vsak.
I wanted to know how he managed.	Želel sem vedeti, kako mu je uspelo.
Everything was good and simple again.	Vse je bilo spet dobro in preprosto.
There was nothing else.	Nič drugega ni bilo.
And this is simply wrong.	In to je preprosto narobe.
The only thing.	Edina stvar.
This is simply not the case here.	Tukaj preprosto ni tako.
We knew that.	To smo vedeli.
So little that I would return it as well.	Tako malo, da bi jo tudi vrnil.
It will be better for everyone.	Za vse bo bolje.
It's really not my thing.	To res ni moja stvar.
It's just for tonight.	Samo za nocoj bo.
I know what they did.	Vem, kaj so naredili.
I really made that decision.	Res sem se tako odločil.
Someone like us, maybe.	Nekdo, kot smo mi, morda.
This is not true.	To ni res.
You have to believe.	Moraš verjeti.
I really don’t understand why this is so.	Res ne razumem, zakaj je temu tako.
You're a busy man.	Ti si zaposlen človek.
Since then, my father has been working there every day.	Od takrat oče tam dela vsak dan.
And you would be here too.	In tudi ti bi bil tukaj.
You will see this.	To boste videli.
The boy looked tired.	Fant je bil videti utrujen.
You don't like that.	To ti ni všeč.
It was good.	Dobro je bilo.
I’m not sure how that happened.	Nisem prepričan, kako se je to zgodilo.
I just didn’t know.	Preprosto nisem vedel.
Or not.	Ali pa ne.
I don’t know if it’s true or not.	Ne vem, ali je res ali ne.
She just knew it was there.	Samo vedela je, da je tam.
He came back again and wanted more.	Spet se je vrnil in hotel še.
The time has not yet come for that.	Za to še ni prišel čas.
If you don't want to go.	Če ne želite iti.
Now he was convinced that something had happened.	Zdaj je bil prepričan, da se je nekaj zgodilo.
I understand that.	To pa razumem.
I don't want to do that.	Nočem tega storiti.
She wanted to leave.	Želela si je oditi.
I was surprised when you called.	Bil sem presenečen, ko si poklical.
He would see.	On bi videl.
I hope so.	Upam.
No, you really have to.	Ne, res moraš.
I would love to hear them.	rad bi jih slišal.
He was waiting for them.	Čakal jih je.
I arrived early, but not early enough.	Prišel sem zgodaj, a ne dovolj zgodaj.
I can see them now.	Zdaj jih lahko vidim.
What are these things?	Kaj so te stvari?
Not my friend.	Ne moj prijatelj.
None of this would be possible without you.	Brez vas nič od tega ne bi bilo mogoče.
I'm just tired.	Sem samo utrujen.
What did he say?	Kaj je rekel?
He knows why.	On ve zakaj.
We have to do it.	Moramo to storiti.
And get them.	In dobil jih.
I will still be alone.	še bom sam.
I've never seen anyone like that.	Nikoli nisem videl nikogar takega.
There were more, many more.	Bilo jih je več, veliko več.
Maybe that's possible.	Mogoče je to mogoče.
they will not.	ne bodo.
This is for you.	To je za vas.
Nothing else to say.	Nič drugega za povedati.
Tell you.	Povedati ti.
So be it.	Naj bo tako.
I didn't like it.	Ni mi bilo všeč.
I like that sometimes.	To mi je včasih všeč.
He didn't want anything.	Nič ni hotel.
This was something more.	To je bilo nekaj več.
She didn't do that.	Tega ni storila.
I have to help.	moram pomagati.
I thought I might come and do it.	Mislil sem, da bi morda prišel in to storil.
She's not very good.	Ni zelo dobra.
Here.	Tukaj.
I didn't see anything.	Ničesar nisem videl.
It won't be enough.	Ne bo dovolj.
He doesn't do that all the time.	Tega ne počne ves čas.
I can't tell you now.	Zdaj vam ne morem povedati.
for something else! 	za kaj drugega!
I will be even better.	bom še boljši.
I can go there.	lahko grem tja.
That was not what he expected.	To ni bilo tisto, kar je pričakoval.
I want to make sure.	Želim se prepričati.
Here's the thing.	Tukaj je stvar.
This man was the one.	Ta človek je bil tisti.
in.	in .
It wasn't him.	Ni bil on.
I've never seen him before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl.
Know that he must.	Vedeti, da mora.
I wish that day had not yet come.	Želim si, da ta dan še ni prišel.
If you like it.	Če ti je všeč.
Mine is not.	Moj ni.
Not the next day and not this morning.	Ne naslednji dan in ne danes zjutraj.
I'm sure he has it.	Prepričan sem, da ga ima.
Or it used to be.	Ali pa je bilo nekoč.
Unfortunately I can't.	Žal ne morem.
He ate hard.	Težko je jedel.
It is much more than that.	Je veliko več kot to.
But he doesn’t do that.	Vendar tega ne počne.
I immediately felt better.	Takoj sem se počutil bolje.
I'm so glad to see you.	Zelo sem vesel, da te vidim.
Either they will or they won't.	Ali bodo ali pa ne bodo.
They are gone now.	Zdaj jih ni več.
It was him or us.	Bil je on ali mi.
Too happy for a while.	Preveč vesel za nekaj časa.
This is a big question.	To je veliko vprašanje.
I know you're right.	Vem, da imaš prav.
This is clearly wrong.	To je očitno narobe.
He couldn't talk to me.	Ni mogel govoriti z mano.
And so for so beautiful.	In tako za tako lepo.
I was just working.	Pravkar sem delal.
I wish I was here.	Želim si, da bi bil tukaj.
You want to be there.	Tam si želiš biti.
She was not well.	Ni ji bilo dobro.
I think a lot of people can.	Mislim, da lahko veliko ljudi.
You have to	Moraš
So very true.	Tako zelo res.
I had to go for it.	Moral sem iti na to.
That's the one.	To je tisti.
I thought it was okay.	Zdelo se mi je v redu.
Because we were.	Ker smo bili mi.
We don't need to know.	Ni nam treba vedeti.
For some time.	Za nekaj časa.
Just for years.	Samo za več let.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nisem vedel, kaj je to.
Like, from everything.	Kot, od vsega.
I see this happening.	Vidim, da se to dogaja.
Luckily he didn’t know what to do.	Na srečo ni vedel, kaj naj stori.
However, this question is not about that.	Vendar to vprašanje ne govori o tem.
I really need to work on that.	Res moram delati na tem.
I hope to see them someday.	Upam, da jih kdaj vidim.
It just wasn't mine.	Samo ni bil moj.
It should be fine.	Morala bi biti v redu.
He wasn't sure how it happened.	Ni bil prepričan, kako se je zgodilo.
She obviously likes it.	Očitno ji je všeč.
Maybe, maybe more.	Mogoče, morda več.
This is a man.	To je človek.
However, this is unlikely to happen.	Vendar se to verjetno ne bo zgodilo.
I know mine.	Vem, da moja.
I asked for help.	Prosil sem za pomoč.
That's really the problem here.	To je res problem tukaj.
He just sat and waited, not knowing what to say.	Samo sedel je in čakal, ne da bi vedel, kaj bi rekel.
It doesn’t exist and probably never will.	To ne obstaja in verjetno nikoli ne bo.
None of us are.	Nihče od nas ni.
When he is right, let him be right.	Ko je prav, naj bo prav.
You think.	Misliš.
He also spoke like that.	Tudi on je tako govoril.
Nothing was ever good enough.	Nič ni bilo nikoli dovolj dobro.
That seemed wrong.	To se je zdelo narobe.
I have some money.	Imam nekaj denarja.
I never wanted a baby.	Nikoli si nisem želela otrok.
It was time too.	Tudi čas je bil.
It's not possible.	Ni mogoče.
They had three children.	Imeli so tri otroke.
Nobody asked him anything.	Nihče ga ni nič vprašal.
This is something to see.	To je nekaj za videti.
But I was good.	Vendar sem bil dober.
I know who this is.	Vem, kdo je to.
We saw her at a party	Videli smo jo na zabavi
He saw nothing.	Nič ni videl.
And there's nothing you can do about it.	In glede tega ne moreš storiti ničesar.
Not for nothing.	Ne za nič.
But it's always been that way.	Vendar je bilo vedno tako.
No one knew anything.	Nihče ni vedel ničesar.
And often they won’t.	In pogosto ne bodo.
It wasn't us.	To nismo bili mi.
But it will always be like this.	Vendar bo vedno tako.
I wish I would.	Želim si, da bi.
Maybe even today.	Morda še danes.
That was really hard for me.	To mi je bilo res težko.
And so is he.	In tudi on je.
You haven't eaten.	Nisi jedel.
It wasn't like that before.	Prej ni bilo tako.
This is a good game!.	To je dobra igra!.
He thought so.	Tako je mislil.
Does it really look that way?	Je res tako videti?
It’s hard to see him go.	Težko ga je videti, da gre.
I never wanted anyone again.	Nikoli si nisem želel nikogar več.
He didn't say.	Ni rekel.
I can go alone.	lahko grem sam.
That was once.	To je bilo kdaj.
He talked about it.	Govoril je o tem.
I see him almost every day.	Vidim ga skoraj vsak dan.
My father could not know.	Moj oče ni mogel vedeti.
Im asking for help.	prosim za pomoč.
Here's the question.	Tukaj je vprašanje.
This will not be a problem for me.	To zame ne bo problem.
I couldn't see.	nisem mogel videti.
I want to know who did it.	Želim vedeti, kdo je to storil.
He would love that.	To bi mu bilo všeč.
And you know me.	In veste mi.
Keep going.	Kar naprej gre.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I never, ever thought you would.	Nikoli, nikoli si nisem mislil, da boš.
I’m sure there’s nothing there.	Prepričan sem, da tam ni nič.
There was no need.	Ni bilo treba.
As it should be.	Kot bi tudi morala biti.
He was much more than that.	Bil je veliko več kot to.
Seriously here.	Tukaj resno.
The question is what to do about it.	Vprašanje je, kaj storiti glede tega.
I wanted to.	Želela sem si.
They both knew it.	Oba sta to vedela.
Here is mine.	Tukaj je moj.
When he got home, he never stayed long.	Ko je prišel domov, ni nikoli ostal dolgo.
This is done.	To se naredi.
I would never wish that on anyone.	Tega ne bi nikoli nikomur želel.
There is nothing he can do.	Ne more storiti ničesar.
He decided to stay.	Odločil se je ostati.
It seems pretty simple.	Zdi se precej preprosto.
Not just because it’s early.	Ne samo zato, ker je zgodaj.
And about that.	In o tem.
I would buy, buy, buy.	Kupil bi, kupil, kupil.
In fact, it is.	Pravzaprav je.
He was there for a long time.	Tam je bil dolgo časa.
Not for the first time.	Ne prvič.
We'll see more about that tomorrow.	Več o tem bomo videli jutri.
He's here with us.	Tukaj je z nami.
You could too.	Tudi ti bi lahko.
It was as if nothing had happened.	Bilo je, kot da se ni nič zgodilo.
There's a lot of them.	Veliko jih je.
No, we are alone.	Ne, sami smo.
You probably are.	Verjetno ste.
I’m sure someone will get to that.	Prepričan sem, da bo kdo prišel do tega.
You'll have some tomorrow.	Nekaj ​​jih boš imel jutri.
i am that person.	jaz sem ta oseba.
Maybe they didn't.	Mogoče niso.
If not today, tomorrow, soon.	Če ne danes, jutri, kmalu.
And no one did anything about it.	In nihče ni storil ničesar glede tega.
Only a few are interested.	Le nekaj jih zanima.
Things are not like that anymore.	Stvari niso več tako.
He didn't want to leave.	Ni hotel oditi.
That's what I said.	To sem rekel.
He does this every day.	To počne vsak dan.
Like yesterday.	Kot včeraj.
And it might be happening now.	In morda se dogaja zdaj.
You just knew.	Samo vedel si.
This is life.	To je življenje.
I wasn't tired either.	Tudi jaz nisem bil utrujen.
It wasn't just today.	Ni bilo samo danes.
I had a nice time.	Imel sem se lepo.
He doesn't want to do it.	On tega noče storiti.
It was nice.	Bilo je lepo.
He is the one.	On je tisti.
That must be it.	To mora biti to.
I returned it.	sem ga vrnil.
Nothing really happened.	Prav nič se ni zgodilo.
I didn't ask her why.	Nisem je vprašal zakaj.
You should know better.	Morala bi vedeti bolje.
There weren't enough people.	Ni bilo dovolj ljudi.
He is my friend.	On je moj prijatelj.
I feel better already.	Počutim se že bolje.
Or is it.	Ali je.
You know what they are.	Veš kaj so.
I do not understand.	Ne razumem.
That was no more.	Tega ni bilo več.
I was like.	Bil sem kot.
I haven't had it yet.	Nisem ga še imel.
This is really hard.	To je res težko.
What did you do.	Kaj si naredil.
You gave me life.	Dal si mi življenje.
I know it's not easy for any of you.	Vem, da nikomur od vas ni lahko.
I don't know him well.	Ne poznam ga dobro.
This is what happened here.	To se je zgodilo tukaj.
And so will you.	In tudi ti boš.
I really wouldn't.	res ne bi.
Dad knew that.	Oče je to vedel.
It seems he can't.	Zdi se, da ne more.
I hope he starts.	Upam, da bo začel.
Not a bit of that.	Niti malo tega.
Nothing and everything.	Nič in vse.
I think we can be much better.	Mislim, da smo lahko veliko boljši.
You were there and so were you.	Bil si tam in tudi ti.
Everyone was fine.	Vsi so bili v redu.
As it is.	Kot je stvar.
To get better.	Da bi postal boljši.
Mine was even better.	Moj je bil še boljši.
They did it for me.	To so naredili zame.
I'll just do it.	Naredil bom samo to.
But even then, it may not be enough.	Pa tudi takrat morda ne bo dovolj.
He doesn't do anything to help.	Ne naredi ničesar, da bi pomagal.
He doesn't want to do anything.	Noče storiti ničesar.
And that was it.	In to je bilo to.
He didn't do everything right.	Ni naredil vsega prav.
He could still see her.	Še vedno jo je lahko videl.
He shouldn't have come, he thinks.	Ne bi smel priti, si misli.
It was there before.	Tam je bilo že prej.
The first time you did something wrong.	Prvič, ko si naredil nekaj narobe.
She had to talk to him.	Morala je govoriti z njim.
It was an easy job.	Bilo je lahko delo.
Actually normal.	Pravzaprav običajno.
I’m not sure any of that is true.	Nisem prepričan, da je kaj od tega res.
We still have it.	Še vedno ga imamo.
I wish her all the best.	želim ji vse dobro.
I went to school.	Sem šel v šolo.
That’s good enough for me.	To je dovolj dobro zame.
I'm going to.	Grem na.
And it worked.	In je uspelo.
I told him it wouldn't happen again.	Rekel sem mu, da ne bo več.
I'm glad he found you.	Vesel sem, da te je našel.
Now the problem is that.	Zdaj je problem to.
I'm fine, really.	V redu sem, res.
But there was simply no money for it.	A denarja za to preprosto ni bilo.
I mean this very seriously.	To mislim zelo resno.
I want to help you.	Želim ti pomagati.
I shouldn't have come here.	Ne bi smel priti sem.
I had to go there.	Moral sem iti tja.
I think he will play again.	Mislim, da bo spet igral.
So we did it.	Pa smo to naredili.
We have a lot of work to do.	Imamo veliko dela.
He didn't know why he did it.	Ni vedel, zakaj si je to storil.
We had nothing to do with it.	S tem nismo imeli nič.
I was the only one who could help me.	Bil sem edini, ki mi je lahko pomagal.
I'm not sure about that either.	Tudi glede tega nisem prepričan.
But that wasn't enough.	Vendar to ni bilo dovolj.
You've eaten enough.	Dovolj si jedel.
She really, really didn't know what to tell him.	Res, res ni vedela, kaj bi mu rekla.
A lot of things.	Veliko stvari.
I just don't know where to go from here.	Samo ne vem, kam naj grem od tukaj.
He was wrong, not me.	On je bil narobe, ne jaz.
But so it seems.	Ali tako se zdi.
It would be much simpler.	Bilo bi veliko bolj preprosto.
I didn't know then.	takrat nisem vedel.
I was surprised he didn’t ask about it.	Bil sem presenečen, da ni vprašal o tem.
I still haven't bought it.	Še vedno ga nisem kupil.
Nothing is going well tonight.	Nocoj nič ne gre prav.
She didn't know what to do with it.	Ni vedela, kaj naj naredi s tem.
And it’s actually really nice.	In pravzaprav je res lepo.
I called her at home.	Poklical sem jo doma.
I heard about it.	Slišal sem za to.
That is if you want her.	To je, če jo želiš.
He doesn't think about it.	Nič o tem ne misli.
Except you never told me.	Le da mi nisi nikoli povedal.
I wanted to tell you something.	Nekaj ​​sem ti hotel povedati.
That will be difficult.	To bo težko.
She is doing very well.	Zelo dobro ji gre.
And so it was.	In prav tako je bilo.
I know it's not.	Vem, da ni.
There is no one else there.	Tam ni nikogar drugega.
You just have to be prepared for everything.	Samo na vse moraš biti pripravljen.
It will be good for you.	Dobro bo zate.
I hope it works out.	Upam, da bo uspelo.
Tell me.	Povej mi.
They had to do it.	Morali so to storiti.
Nothing but that.	Nič drugega kot to.
He wants to see you again so badly.	Tako zelo te želi spet videti.
Maybe you are.	Mogoče si.
You can't help everyone.	Ne moreš pomagati vsem.
This is what needs more.	To je tisto, kar potrebuje več.
Nothing and never.	Nič in nikoli.
She didn't like to know now.	Zdaj ji ni bilo všeč vedeti.
There is a lot of time.	Časa je veliko.
What he said is clearly not true.	Kar je rekel, očitno ni res.
He didn’t look like he thought it was beautiful.	Ni bil videti, kot da bi mislil, da je lepo.
More, more me.	Več, več mene.
But that was not the case at all.	A temu sploh ni bilo tako.
I feel like a child.	Počutim se kot otrok.
However, this is not the current issue.	Vendar to ni trenutno vprašanje.
And that’s what he learned when he was a kid.	In tega se je naučil, ko je bil otrok.
That's not your problem.	To ni tvoj problem.
He didn’t really want to talk about it.	Pravzaprav ni hotel govoriti o tem.
And so it goes.	In tako gre.
I'm just thinking.	Samo mislim.
I'm not the only one.	nisem edini.
As you wish.	Kot želiš.
It’s not like we should do this every day.	Ni tako, da bi to morali početi vsak dan.
And there he sat.	In tam je sedel.
He doesn't seem to be feeling well.	Zdi se, da se ne počuti dobro.
Obviously more.	Očitno še več.
He was not there at the moment.	Trenutno ga ni bilo tam.
We saw that.	To smo videli.
In ker.	V ker.
It probably was.	Verjetno je bilo.
He probably didn't have time to leave.	Verjetno ni imel časa oditi.
We have dinner.	Imamo večerjo.
You just have to do it.	Samo to moraš narediti.
Never.	Nikoli ne.
Just the usual.	Samo običajno.
It seemed good and right.	Zdelo se je dobro in prav.
I had a hard time talking.	Težko sem govoril.
It didn’t take long to do.	Ni bilo treba dolgo narediti.
There were so many.	Bilo je toliko.
I don't want it to be me.	Ne želim si, da bi bil to jaz.
They knew.	Vedeli so.
I don't want that.	tega nočem.
There was so much to see.	Toliko je bilo videti.
Not yet, it will be a week.	Ne še, teden bo.
They are not interested in the game.	Ne zanima jih igra.
Do you think we should go there?	Misliš, da moramo tja?
I had to leave.	Moral sem oditi.
He just thought it was.	Samo mislil je, da je.
We don't even have to stay.	Sploh nam ni treba ostati.
This was the first time.	To je bilo prvič.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
To the point.	Na stvar.
Not that I need to say that.	Ne kot da bi moral to povedati.
It wasn't perfect.	Ni bilo popolnoma.
We weren't there.	Ni nas bilo tam.
It's much better.	Je veliko bolje.
He knows something is up.	Ve, da se nekaj dogaja.
Maybe you should.	Mogoče bi bilo treba.
I was waiting for him to come.	Čakal sem, da pride.
I heard about it.	Slišal sem o tem.
I hope someone can help me move forward.	Upam, da mi bo kdo lahko pomagal, da grem naprej.
My question here and now is.	Moje vprašanje tukaj in zdaj je.
That's what I want for you.	To želim zate.
You did very well.	Zelo dobro si naredil.
And everyone knew that.	In to so vsi vedeli.
I don't know anything else.	ne vem nič drugega.
This is usually done as follows.	To se običajno naredi na naslednji način.
He came for.	Prišel je po.
And that was the thing you had for dinner.	In to je bila stvar, ki ste jo imeli za večerjo.
I told you it was a thing.	Rekel sem ti, da je bila stvar.
I know how to do it.	Vem, kako to storiti.
I mean, there's something wrong with it.	Se pravi, s tem je nekaj narobe.
They were fine.	Bili so v redu.
I just did my job.	Pravkar sem opravil svoje delo.
He would do anything for me.	Vse bi naredil zame.
I don't think she's gone anymore.	Mislim, da je ni več.
This could not be done.	Tega ni bilo mogoče storiti.
He had had enough.	Dovolj je imel.
It's been here long enough.	Tukaj je že dovolj dolgo.
Is that really all you have to say?	Je to res vse, kar imaš za povedati?
But I don't think you will.	Mislim pa, da ne boš.
The thing itself.	Sama stvar.
They simply are not.	Preprosto niso.
Now to why you are here.	Zdaj pa k temu, zakaj si tukaj.
This may not be possible.	To morda ne bo mogoče.
It is everything and nothing and a few things.	Je vse in nič in nekaj stvari.
I will work on that.	Bom delal na tem.
I do not know how.	ne vem kako.
It was so good to be home, he told us.	Tako dobro je bilo biti doma, nam je povedal.
I don't want that.	Nočem tega.
I knew it was you.	Vedel sem, da si to ti.
They were so lucky.	Imeli so tako srečo.
He was happy.	Bil je vesel.
However, this was not always possible.	Vendar to ni bilo vedno mogoče.
And so it was.	In tako je bilo.
I didn't wait for them.	Nisem jih čakal.
I could have met better.	Lahko bi se bolje srečal.
They weren't there now.	Zdaj jih ni bilo.
Just don "t.	Samo ne.
I knew what was going on.	Vedel sem, kaj se dogaja.
I knew nothing.	Nič nisem vedel.
This is done as follows.	To se naredi na naslednji način.
Probably hard for anyone.	Verjetno težko za koga.
I almost died last night.	Sinoči sem skoraj umrl.
He actually has one.	Pravzaprav ga ima.
I just don't know how.	samo ne vem kako.
He didn't think he would.	Ni si mislil, da bo.
It will not be easy.	To ne bo lahko.
I found you, did you find me?	Našel sem te, si našel mene?
They are alone, but more so.	Biti so sami, a bolj.
Or he called me.	Ali pa me je poklical.
You will do what you said.	Naredil boš, kar si rekel.
He managed not to do that.	Uspelo mu je, da tega ni storil.
Someone was.	Nekdo je bil.
He saw things.	Videl je stvari.
Keep it up, man.	Kar tako naprej, človek.
There was not much to say.	Ni bilo veliko za povedati.
I can't even eat.	Sploh ne morem jesti.
We have to go.	Moramo iti.
Or us too.	Ali tudi mi.
And this guy wasn't alone.	In ta fant ni bil sam.
I didn't tell anyone about it.	O tem nisem nikomur povedal.
He could never tell her that.	Tega ji nikoli ni mogel povedati.
And you are.	In ste.
I just needed someone to give me a chance.	Potreboval sem le nekoga, ki bi mi dal priložnost.
Not that you won't already.	Saj ne, da že ne boš.
I don't think so.	Ne mislim tako.
It seems to help.	Zdi se, da pomaga.
No, it was a long time after that.	Ne, dolgo je bilo po tem.
I mean, it was just nice.	Mislim, bilo je preprosto lepo.
This worked very well for me.	To mi je zelo dobro uspelo.
He didn't want to go.	Ni hotel iti.
Yes, that's it.	Da, to je to.
Nobody knows.	Nihče ne ve.
And much more prepared.	In veliko bolj pripravljen.
We'll see how it goes.	Bomo videli kako bo.
I'm there.	tam sem.
I wouldn't get it.	Ne bi ga dobil.
If not for me.	Če ne zame.
And who knows, maybe.	In kdo ve, mogoče je.
Or maybe ever.	Ali morda kdaj.
Not before and not now.	Ne prej in ne zdaj.
He doesn't want to see you.	Noče te videti.
And I don't know.	In ne vem.
In fact, there are a lot of people.	Pravzaprav je veliko ljudi.
That's your problem.	To je tvoj problem.
This question was difficult enough.	To vprašanje je bilo dovolj težko.
I didn't think you were.	Nisem mislil, da si.
I'm actually pretty good at it.	Pravzaprav sem precej dober v tem.
I can't stay after that.	Po tem ne morem ostati.
And is.	In je.
I will help you.	Pomagal ti bom.
I could be there for years.	Lahko bi bil tam leta.
And not just us.	In ne samo mi.
You will see him there.	Videli ga boste tam.
I will not call.	ne bom poklical.
I never liked her.	Nikoli mi ni bila všeč.
Spoke to him.	Govoril z njim.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisem mogel verjeti.
So good.	Tako dobro.
He called me the next day.	Naslednji dan me je poklical.
That may not be enough.	To morda ne bo dovolj.
Okay, you don't like it.	V redu, ni ti všeč.
This one is good.	Ta je dobra.
Why me? 	Zakaj jaz?
he thought.	mislil je.
We don't know when.	Ne vemo kdaj.
I would leave.	jaz bi odšel.
Game.	Igra.
But you should know better.	Vendar bi morala vedeti bolje.
It doesn't work anymore.	Ne gre več.
Never played again.	Nikoli več igral.
Must be.	Mora biti.
Maybe he'll be lucky.	Mogoče bo imel srečo.
None of us actually knew why.	Nihče od nas pravzaprav ni vedel zakaj.
Don't tell anyone.	Nikomur ne povej.
They may be better for you.	Morda bodo bolje za vas.
There is nothing there.	Tam ni ničesar.
No, not much going on.	Ne, ne dogaja se veliko.
And they did.	In to so storili.
And still not.	In še vedno ne.
He decided.	Ta se je odločil.
It seems to me that you would be a man who would know.	Zdi se mi, da bi ti bil človek, ki bi vedel.
I was there for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa sem bil tam.
There is something wrong with that.	Nekaj ​​je narobe s tem.
We've been there before.	Tam smo že bili.
All these things and more.	Vse te stvari in še več.
What he was doing seemed.	To, kar je počel, se je zdelo.
And the right time has come.	In prišel je pravi čas.
I see you are.	Vidim, da si.
How could he forget?	Kako je lahko pozabil?
He has it.	On ima to.
I would too.	Tudi jaz bi bil.
This could be my chance.	To bi lahko bila moja priložnost.
We succeeded.	Nam je uspelo.
I don't know what else.	ne vem kaj drugega.
He couldn't believe what he had just done.	Ni mogel verjeti, kaj je pravkar naredil.
She had to do it now.	To je morala storiti zdaj.
He also seemed to not know what was going on.	Zdelo se je tudi, da ni vedel, kaj se dogaja.
Now what? 	Kaj pa zdaj?
I will return to this.	K temu se bom vrnil.
It is now, too.	Zdaj je tudi.
he asked.	je vprašal.
I didn't know what to think.	Nisem vedel, kaj naj si mislim.
So were we.	Tudi mi smo bili.
It wasn't even pretty.	Niti ni bilo lepo.
I can't tell him.	Ne morem mu povedati.
I will ask you a lot.	Veliko vas bom prosil.
This is not easy.	To ni lahko.
And they were.	In so bili.
He was human.	Bil je človek.
Tell me, tell me.	Povej mi, povej mi.
He’s good enough and he’ll definitely be good enough.	Je dovolj dober in zagotovo bo dovolj dober.
I don't think he's there yet.	Mislim, da še ni tam.
And she wouldn't know that if she hadn't gone.	In tega ne bi vedela, če ne bi šla.
We did a little.	Malo smo naredili.
I want to be better tomorrow.	Želim biti boljši jutri.
He will not succeed in this.	Tega mu ne bo uspelo.
Just so you're right.	Samo da boš prav.
But it's serious.	Je pa resno.
He couldn't say anything else.	Nič drugega ni mogel povedati.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
Maybe I don't have much time.	Morda nimam veliko časa.
It was nice to see them again.	Lepo jih je bilo spet videti.
Probably not.	Verjetno pa ni to.
And there was nothing.	In nič ni bilo.
Should I be doing.	Ali bi moral početi.
He wanted more, much more.	Želel je več, veliko več.
No one was sure, so he said nothing.	Nihče ni bil prepričan, zato ni rekel ničesar.
That's what we did.	Tako smo naredili.
I'm so glad to meet you.	Zelo sem vesel, da sem te spoznal.
I think she was.	Mislim, da je bila.
And now we were here.	In zdaj smo bili tukaj.
He was ready for me.	Bil je pripravljen zame.
As you may know.	Kot morda veste.
And maybe he was right.	In morda je imel prav.
He told her he could do it alone.	Rekel ji je, da lahko to stori sam.
It wasn't nice to see them.	Ni jih bilo lepo videti.
He said then that everything was fine.	Takrat je rekel, da je vse v redu.
Yes.	da.
We would be at home.	Bili bi doma.
Everyone knew.	Vsi so vedeli.
That's how it was with me.	Tako je bilo pri meni.
I don't think there is anyone.	Mislim, da ni nihče.
And that's that.	In to je to.
This did not happen that way.	To se ni zgodilo tako.
Please just do it.	Prosim, samo naredi to.
.	.
You should go.	Moral bi iti.
And not anymore.	In ne več.
No one knows what happened there.	Nihče ne ve, kaj se je tam zgodilo.
There is something wrong here.	Tukaj je nekaj narobe.
Not just you.	Ne samo ti.
There really aren't any.	Res jih ni.
But it was true.	Vendar je bilo res.
I was a person.	bila sem oseba.
I did the work.	Opravil sem delo.
However, where is the question.	Vendar, kje je vprašanje.
It's all beautiful.	Vse to je lepo.
I'm sure you're tired.	Prepričan sem, da si utrujen.
I was too.	tudi jaz sem bil.
But it is much more than that.	Vendar je veliko več kot to.
No one knows, because nothing like this has happened yet.	Nihče ne ve, saj se kaj takega še ni zgodilo.
I know that.	To vem.
The time is not right.	Čas ni pravi.
But there is something more.	Je pa nekaj več.
Maybe I should stay home today.	Mogoče bi moral danes ostati doma.
If it doesn’t exist, nothing has happened.	Če ne obstaja, se ni zgodilo nič.
Maybe he wants to talk.	Mogoče želi govoriti.
You could, but you didn't.	Lahko bi, a nisi.
He thought he might die.	Mislil je, da bi lahko umrl.
Or it is.	Ali pa je.
He was very good.	Bil je zelo dober.
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
There was nobody there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar.
He didn't want to say.	Ni hotel povedati.
It’s hard to say this early.	Težko je to povedati zgodaj.
I could do all that.	Vse to bi lahko naredil.
They might see you.	Morda te bodo videli.
I know her.	Poznam jo.
The man worked on everything.	Človek je delal na vsem.
He went for it.	Šel je za to.
Would you please do that for me?	Bi prosim to naredil zame?
I just need a little.	Potrebujem samo malo.
There were few people.	Bilo je malo ljudi.
He left that to you.	To ti je pustil.
I'm just not going to do that.	Samo tega ne bom naredil.
Just me.	Samo meni.
So I’m not sure what he’s doing.	Tako da nisem prepričan, kaj počne.
I saw him today.	Danes sem ga videl.
That's how it is now.	Tako je zdaj.
He's heard it all before.	Vse to je že slišal.
What did he just say?	Kaj je pravkar rekel?
We have to get out.	Moramo priti ven.
We were right to do so.	Imeli smo prav, da smo to storili.
But it's not just that.	Vendar ni samo to.
It didn’t seem enough to me, but it was better.	Zdelo se mi ni dovolj, vendar je bilo bolje.
This has never happened before.	To se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
But he loves money.	Ali ima rad denar.
I told you where.	Povedal sem ti, kje.
Can also.	Lahko tudi.
Maybe he's busy.	Mogoče je zaposlen.
I'd like to know what she said.	Rad bi vedel, kaj je rekla.
Not so good again.	Spet ne tako dobro.
I couldn't do it.	Nisem mogel storiti.
She's just going to do it.	Pravkar bo to storila.
He thought that was a good thing.	Mislil je, da je to dobra stvar.
It wasn't serious enough.	Ni bilo dovolj resno.
They had their day with me.	Imeli so svoj dan z mano.
He will do it again.	To bo spet naredil.
Everything was as it should be.	Vse je bilo tako, kot mora biti.
I'm glad you're here.	Vesel sem, da si tukaj.
But he didn't know he was gone.	Ni pa vedel, da je odšel.
I shouldn't even be here.	Sploh ne bi smel biti tukaj.
And it really was.	In res je bilo.
Maybe really.	Mogoče res.
Someone would leave.	Nekdo bi odšel.
I would be there.	Bila bi tam.
That child was me.	Ta otrok sem bil jaz.
She probably won't.	Verjetno je ne bo.
She knew that much.	Toliko je vedela.
I thought you were for me.	Mislil sem, da si zame.
He was very busy.	Bil je zelo zaposlen.
I sat in front of him.	Sedel sem pred njim.
I know it was you.	Vem, da si bil ti.
It was just a game.	Bila je samo igra.
However, this may not be the case.	Vendar morda temu ni tako.
Now do something about it.	Zdaj pa naredi nekaj glede tega.
To work, she said.	Na delo, je rekla.
I am a teacher.	Jaz sem učitelj.
I thought that was really nice.	To se mi je zdelo res lepo.
In fact, I really liked it.	Pravzaprav mi je bilo zelo všeč.
He works there.	Tam dela.
This is in the morning.	To je zjutraj.
He sat there for a long time.	Dolgo je sedel tam.
Yes, for sure.	Da, zagotovo.
He came a long time ago.	Dolgo je prišel.
And it's time.	In čas je.
I wouldn't help her.	Ne bi ji bila v pomoč.
I really want to help.	Res bi rad pomagal.
Sometimes a little serious.	Včasih malo resno.
And something else.	In še nekaj.
He doesn't have to.	Ni mu treba.
That's how I wanted it.	Tako sem si želel.
No one says that.	Nihče tega ne pravi.
I've never been there today.	Danes še nikoli nisem bil tam.
His father said to him.	Oče mu je rekel.
Sometimes you're just lucky.	Včasih imaš samo srečo.
I don't think she likes it too much.	Mislim, da ji ni preveč všeč.
Illberightback.	Takoj bom nazaj.
He seemed to like it.	Zdelo se mu je všeč.
And this is something that cannot be.	In to je nekaj, kar ne more biti.
And there is.	In obstaja.
Really very good.	Res zelo dobro.
Where will he want to go.	Kam bo želel iti.
Nobody likes him.	Nihče ga ne mara.
They just weren’t for me.	Preprosto niso bili zame.
That's what he thinks.	Tako misli on.
Maybe not.	Morda ne.
You did well.	Naredil si dobro.
There is nothing to do now.	Zdaj ni kaj storiti.
Just like you and me.	Tako kot ti in jaz.
Not at all.	To sploh ne.
Nothing but that.	Nič drugega kot to.
It will work.	To bo uspelo.
It is not very obvious how to do this.	Ni zelo očitno, kako to storiti.
He didn't even have to say that.	Tega mu niti ni bilo treba povedati.
I've worked all my life.	Vse življenje sem delal.
Everyone can work.	Vsak lahko dela.
I went to him.	Šla sem do njega.
You know what is right and what is wrong.	Veš, kaj je prav in kaj narobe.
There was an opportunity for that.	Bila je priložnost za to.
But it never happened.	Vendar se ni nikoli zgodilo.
I asked him why he was doing this.	Vprašal sem ga, zakaj to počne.
But he knew too much.	Vedel pa je preveč.
It's that simple.	To je tako preprosto.
But at the time, they didn’t have enough money.	A takrat niso imeli dovolj denarja.
It happened again.	Spet se je zgodilo.
There was probably nothing.	Verjetno ni bilo nič.
It will definitely be soon.	To bo zagotovo kmalu.
Now you know how to do it.	Zdaj veste, kako to storiti.
As we will do now.	Kot bomo storili zdaj.
The time has come.	Prišel je čas.
You too, man.	Tudi ti, človek.
No one saw anything.	Nihče ni videl ničesar.
I don't want to talk anymore.	Nočem več govoriti.
I'm the only one who can do it.	Jaz sem edini, ki lahko to naredi.
He really wanted to be there.	Zelo si je želel biti tam.
And so it goes on.	In tako gre naprej.
It was so true.	Bilo je tako res.
He was good at that too.	Tudi pri tem je bil dober.
Nothing like this has ever happened.	Kaj takega se še ni zgodilo.
You have to do it.	Moraš to narediti.
Maybe still.	Morda še vedno.
It's happening.	To se dogaja.
I won't be back.	Ne bom se vrnil.
Very nice, she said.	Zelo lepo, je rekla.
It could be many things.	To bi lahko bilo veliko stvari.
But they are more money.	Vendar so več denarja.
And that's what I need.	In to je tisto, kar potrebujem.
He has to.	Mora.
Maybe there was really something here.	Mogoče je bilo tukaj res nekaj.
He was gone now.	Zdaj ga ni bilo več.
Really very good.	Res zelo dobro.
For some time.	Za nekaj časa.
I can not.	ne morem.
I did not know.	Nisem vedel.
I really don’t want to go out to dinner.	Res nočem iti ven na večerjo.
He doesn't want much here.	Tukaj ne želi veliko.
It won't happen again.	Ne bo se več zgodilo.
But this is not the point here.	Vendar tukaj ne gre za to.
I think that will be a very good thing.	Mislim, da bo to zelo dobra stvar.
What you want to see.	Kaj želite videti.
I want to do that too.	To želim narediti tudi jaz.
I need to know everything.	Vse moram vedeti.
We will never know.	Nikoli ne bomo vedeli.
We should do that.	To bi morali storiti.
That is probably true.	To je verjetno res.
That or maybe you did something wrong.	To ali pa ste morda naredili nekaj narobe.
What happened happened.	Zgodilo se je kar se je zgodilo.
You know he'll be right back there.	Veš, da se bo takoj vrnil tja.
This goes on and on.	To gre naprej in naprej.
Actually very good.	Pravzaprav zelo dobro.
I'm going to lose my job.	Izgubil bom službo.
But certainly not anymore.	A zagotovo ne več.
When you did a good job, he told you.	Ko si opravil dobro delo, ti je povedal.
He needed another.	Potreboval je drugega.
It would probably be right.	Verjetno bi bilo prav.
Are you with us ?.	Ste z nami?.
He plays pretty well.	Igra precej dobro.
I was as surprised as you.	Bil sem presenečen kot ti.
I mean, good enough.	Mislim, dovolj dobro.
No one can leave.	Nihče ne more oditi.
You don't mean that.	Ne misliš tega.
He didn't think so.	Ni mislil.
It’s really pretty simple.	Res je precej preprosto.
Usually, but not always.	Običajno, vendar ne vedno.
Now you know.	Zdaj veš.
It won't be long now.	Zdaj ne bo dolgo.
And so it is supposed to be.	In tako naj bi bilo.
Yours will be too.	Tudi tvoj bo.
I thought it was so beautiful.	Mislil sem, da je to tako lepo.
This does not seem to be the case anymore.	Zdi se, da temu ni več tako.
Not right now, for sure.	Trenutno ne, zagotovo.
There was none of that here.	Tukaj ni bilo nič od tega.
That's what I wanted to tell him about me.	To sem mu hotel povedati zame.
But or not.	Ali ali ne.
It's neither here nor there.	Ni ne tukaj ne tam.
I can't stay here anymore.	Ne morem več ostati tukaj.
It's just not my thing.	Samo to ni moja stvar.
If I stayed long enough.	Če bi ostal dovolj dolgo.
You have to go get some of that work.	Moraš iti po nekaj tega dela.
There would be time for that, she knew.	Za to bo še čas, vedela je.
The child can't.	Otrok ne more.
I would like to do it once.	Želela bi to narediti enkrat.
Why are you here?	Zakaj si tukaj?
Too many people.	Preveč ljudi.
To speak for me and so on.	Da govori zame in tako naprej.
I know it and you know it.	Jaz to vem in ti to veš.
His father said nothing to him.	Oče mu ni rekel ničesar.
What it is and where it is, he cannot say.	Kaj je in kje je, ne more povedati.
Nobody.	Nihče.
Forever and forever and ever.	Za vedno in vedno in vedno.
He has done this before and he has succeeded.	To je storil že prej in je uspelo.
I know we have.	Vem, da imamo.
I hope he doesn't get it.	Upam, da ga ne bo dobil.
Maybe it wasn't him.	Mogoče ni bil on.
In this way.	Na ta način.
You have them in place.	Ti jih imaš na mestu.
It's a game, he told himself.	To je igra, si je rekel.
Once again, they were clearly right.	Še enkrat so imeli očitno prav.
They were for me, maybe not for you.	Bili so zame, morda ne zate.
We both knew why.	Oba sva vedela zakaj.
Everything was as always.	Vse je bilo kot vedno.
Maybe even more.	Morda še bolj.
I want to talk about it.	Želim povedati o tem.
He obviously isn't either.	Tudi on očitno ni.
That's the only reason he's here.	To je edini razlog, da je tukaj.
And something else.	In še nekaj.
So does everyone.	Tako tudi vsi.
That you never will.	Da nikoli ne boš.
She was there.	Bila je tam.
He said he would find it.	Rekel je, da ga bo našel.
He wanted it to be.	Želel je, da bi bilo.
This is very true.	To je zelo res.
I can't no.	ne morem ne.
Everyone can.	Vsi lahko.
I didn't want to do that.	Nisem tega hotel storiti.
We don't have that here.	Pri nas tega ni.
That's the only way.	To je edini način.
However, there is a possibility.	Vendar pa obstaja možnost.
I mean, it really was.	Mislim, res je bilo.
Nothing more than that.	Nič več od tega.
He did this all his life.	To je počel vse življenje.
I tried to move on.	Poskušal sem iti naprej.
I can't help him.	Ne morem mu pomagati.
And so it is, so much.	In tega je tako, toliko.
It might not be there.	Morda ga ni tam.
Even if you're not.	Tudi če nisi.
I never thought that day would come.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da bo ta dan prišel.
This was my only chance.	To je bila moja edina priložnost.
He was completely alone.	Bil je popolnoma sam.
He could never see any of this.	Nikoli ni mogel videti ničesar od tega.
And we both knew he didn’t need me.	In oba sva vedela, da me ne potrebuje.
Like me.	Tako kot jaz.
Now everyone.	Zdaj pa vsi.
He's doing a little.	Malo mu gre.
I know too.	tudi jaz vem.
He was everything to me.	Bil mi je vse.
I only saw her once.	Videl sem jo samo enkrat.
I never wanted to see them.	Nikoli nisem želel, da bi jih videli.
It won't happen.	Ne bo se zgodilo.
He didn't like to play.	Ni mu bilo všeč igrati.
I had enough.	Imel sem dovolj.
I managed to get back.	Uspelo mi je priti nazaj.
He just left.	Preprosto je odšel.
I'm glad no one saw that.	Vesel sem, da tega nihče ni videl.
You can never be absolutely sure.	Nikoli ne moreš biti popolnoma prepričan.
It's just.	To je samo.
You always know where it is.	Vedno veš, kje je.
She's better off without him.	Bolje ji je brez njega.
I don't have to believe.	Ni mi treba verjeti.
It won't be easy.	Ne bo lahko.
I went on.	šel sem naprej.
I didn’t think it was just.	Nisem mislil, da je samo.
He needs money.	Potrebuje denar.
I got you, my friend.	Imam te, prijatelj.
They will never do that again.	Nikoli več tega ne bodo storili.
I didn't say anything more.	Nič več nisem rekel.
Neither is he.	Tudi on ni.
He had never met him before.	Še nikoli ga ni srečal.
Who did this?	Kdo je to storil?
I mean, a little, good.	Mislim, malo, dobro.
It couldn't be done, just like that.	Tega ni bilo mogoče storiti, preprosto tako.
And we should.	In morali bi.
We were not alone.	Nismo bili sami.
I have nowhere to go.	Nima kam iti.
Talk about it.	Govoriti o tem.
She wanted to know what had happened.	Želela je vedeti, kaj se je zgodilo.
This has happened a lot.	To se je zgodilo veliko.
I'm afraid he's right.	Bojim se, da ima prav.
He went to work and did his job.	Šel je v službo in opravil svoje delo.
But I want to know how to make it.	Želim pa vedeti, kako ga narediti.
All this.	Vse to.
It will be here.	Tukaj bo.
Or maybe it wasn't that at all.	Ali pa morda sploh ni bilo to.
I met him last night.	Sinoči sem ga srečal.
I won't play you anymore.	Ne bom te več igral.
I'm just wondering.	samo se sprašujem.
I need to see him right away.	Takoj ga moram videti.
If only I could tell her who she was.	Če bi ji lahko povedal, kdo je.
I liked that.	To mi je bilo všeč.
You have to stay home.	Moraš ostati doma.
It never works that way.	Nikoli ne gre tako.
I'm too tired right now.	Trenutno sem preveč utrujen.
I do not understand.	ne razumem.
We’ve had it before and we can have it again.	Imeli smo ga že prej in lahko ga imamo še enkrat.
I should leave now.	Zdaj bi moral oditi.
Is there a way to do that.	Ali obstaja način za to.
We'll be there soon!	Kmalu bomo tam!
They knew as soon as it happened.	Vedeli so takoj, ko se je zgodilo.
Probably a lot.	Verjetno veliko.
And he knows why.	In ve zakaj.
She didn't have to.	Ni ji bilo treba.
He told me today why.	Danes mi je povedal zakaj.
That's you.	Ta si ti.
She certainly knew.	Zagotovo je vedela.
Apparently he has something for it.	Očitno ima nekaj za to.
This is possible today.	Danes je to mogoče.
You will die here.	Umrl boš tukaj.
It can't be.	Ne more biti.
We had time.	Imeli smo čas.
I want to work with you.	Želim delati s tabo.
I didn’t see him and he was here.	Nisem ga videl in tukaj je bil.
I don’t have time to say much more.	Nimam časa povedati veliko več.
It won't be right away.	Ne bo takoj.
I have several.	Imam jih več.
A little.	Malo.
I learned a lot from you.	Veliko sem se naučil od tebe.
Nothing happened and nothing was ready.	Nič se ni zgodilo in nič ni bil pripravljen.
I asked you.	Vprašal sem te.
He said so much.	Toliko je rekel.
He has a lot of them.	Ima jih veliko.
I'm not well.	Nisem dobro.
But it was.	Vendar je bilo.
Tell me.	Povej mi.
This is my car.	To je moj avto.
Let it be so.	Naj bo tako.
Can I.	Ali lahko.
He really couldn't help himself.	Res si ni mogel pomagati.
I did this myself.	To sem naredil sam.
I'd love to hear all about it.	Rad bi slišal vse o tem.
She will go again tomorrow.	Jutri bo šla še enkrat.
No one knew where.	Nihče ni vedel, kje.
That was completely wrong.	To je bilo popolnoma narobe.
I didn't like anything.	Nič mi ni bilo všeč.
There is nothing to do at the moment.	Trenutno ni treba storiti ničesar.
And something else.	In še nekaj.
We both were.	Oba sva bila.
But we still don't know why or what happened.	Vendar še ne vemo, zakaj ali kaj se je zgodilo.
That time has come.	Ta čas je prišel.
He had his question.	Imel je svoje vprašanje.
You can't stay here!	Ne moreš ostati tukaj!
No, it's not happening.	Ne, ne dogaja se.
He didn't eat either.	Tudi jedel ni.
Both.	Oba.
There are too many people.	Preveč je ljudi.
It's not just about money.	Ne gre samo za denar.
He probably doesn't know about you either.	Verjetno tudi on ne ve zate.
No one came out like that.	Nihče ni prišel ven tako.
Never once.	Nikoli niti enkrat.
It was really too much.	Bilo je res preveč.
Everything he said was true.	Vse, kar je povedal, je bilo res.
Nothing could be done.	Nič ni bilo mogoče storiti.
In fact, there are many.	Pravzaprav jih je veliko.
He told you about me.	Povedal ti je o meni.
Now the time has come.	Zdaj je prišel čas.
If only I had more money.	Ko bi le imel več denarja.
I can't stay.	ne morem ostati.
You told her you wanted to help me.	Rekel si ji, da mi želiš pomagati.
And that's what we did.	In to smo storili.
It just couldn't be done.	Tega preprosto ni bilo mogoče narediti.
I saw it and didn’t let it go.	Videl sem in nisem pustil naprej.
But if I was there, I wouldn’t stay.	A če bi bil tam, ne bi ostal.
That's how he'll see it.	Tako bo to videl.
No, no, seriously.	Ne, ne, resno.
He found it.	Našel ga je.
Unfortunately, it won't happen.	Žal se ne bo zgodilo.
I like it and I believe you will.	Všeč mi je in verjamem, da ti bo.
I asked who it was.	Vprašal sem, kdo je to.
That was a really good thing.	To je bila res dobra stvar.
I've never been there.	Nikoli nisem bil tam.
I need to make sure you're serious.	Moram se prepričati, da misliš resno.
She was very helpful.	Bila je v veliko pomoč.
This is a very good thing.	To je zelo dobra stvar.
We can't go back.	Ne moremo nazaj.
That’s how my whole life has been.	Tako je bilo vse moje življenje.
You're a good boy.	Ti si dober fant.
Also.	Tudi.
I had to get home.	Moral sem priti domov.
There was nobody there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar.
He asked her.	Prosil jo je.
Nothing like this has ever been seen.	Nič takega še ni bilo videti.
I asked them.	sem jih vprašal.
That I want it.	Da si to želim.
I saw that.	To sem videl.
He had them.	Imel jih je.
He usually didn't do anything.	Običajno ni naredil nič.
I'm sorry.	žal mi je.
We have that.	To imamo.
You are more.	Ti si več.
I can't leave here.	Ne morem oditi tukaj.
Fortunately, they were alone at the time.	Na srečo sta bila takrat sama.
I won't do that again.	Tega ne bom več storil.
Just the way she liked it.	Tako kot ji je bilo všeč.
I really could.	Res bi lahko.
My father taught her.	Moj oče jo je naučil.
And heard of it.	In slišal za to.
it's true.	res je.
You shouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi smel storiti.
He decided not to do that.	Odločil se je, da tega ne bo storil.
It won't be a problem anymore.	Ne bo več problem.
I could have died because of it, but it wasn’t my time.	Lahko bi umrl zaradi tega, vendar ni bil moj čas.
I don't want you to think that.	Nočem, da to misliš.
I think that can help.	Mislim, da to lahko pomaga.
He spoke and he must be.	Govoril je in mora biti.
I wouldn't immediately.	Takoj ne bi.
Nobody likes him.	Nihče ga ne mara.
However, this is no longer the case.	Vendar pa ni več tako.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
I know you did some of that.	Vem, da si nekaj od tega naredil.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu gre.
I have to go.	Moram iti.
They will be here.	Tukaj bodo.
Not alone.	Ne sam.
Where did she go? 	Kam je šla?
I didn't, no.	Nisem, ne.
But no.	Vendar ne.
They had time.	Imeli so čas.
Yes, everything.	Da, vse.
I’m not sure why this is happening.	Nisem prepričan, zakaj se to dogaja.
I can't help him.	Ne morem mu pomagati.
Because you don't know enough.	Ker ne veš dovolj.
and I'm sorry.	in mi je žal.
We have to do something.	Nekaj ​​moramo narediti.
Or maybe it's not good.	Ali pa morda ni dobro.
I'm afraid.	bojim se.
However, this did not happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
It's not us.	To nismo mi.
I had a very good life.	Imel sem zelo dobro življenje.
And why not.	In zakaj ne.
Is this your car?	Je to tvoj avto?
He didn't say that, but he didn't have to.	Tega ni rekel, vendar mu ni bilo treba.
It was no more than a game.	Ni bilo več kot igra.
You had to be there, man.	Moral si biti tam, človek.
Are you.	Ali si.
He couldn’t or would definitely do something.	Ni mogel ali pa bi zagotovo nekaj naredil.
I would never have that much money.	Nikoli ne bi imel toliko denarja.
And he did just that.	In naredil je prav to.
You should be there.	Moral bi biti tam.
I never want to see him again.	Nočem ga videti nikoli več.
We did a lot more.	Naredili smo veliko več.
I can't do anything else.	Ne morem storiti ničesar drugega.
It wouldn't be possible.	Ne bi bilo mogoče.
I'm actually surprised.	Pravzaprav sem presenečen.
I was lucky.	Imel sem srečo.
I don't think you even want help.	Mislim, da si niti ne želiš pomoči.
Nobody knows.	Nihče ne ve.
I've been having trouble with this for a few days now.	Že nekaj dni imam težave s tem.
It's just me.	Samo jaz sem.
Today is a happy and joyful day for us.	Danes je za nas vesel in vesel dan.
It worked.	To je uspelo.
And you are.	In ste.
I really don't like it.	res mi ni všeč.
It didn’t make me feel any better.	Zaradi tega se nisem počutil bolje.
I tried again.	Poskušal sem še enkrat.
how are you	kako si
Nothing had to be done.	Nič ni bilo treba narediti.
Let them be.	Naj bodo.
He was right all along.	Ves čas je imel prav.
Either way, there was no need to say anything more.	Tako ali tako ni bilo treba ničesar več povedati.
Today he is busy, busy, busy.	Danes je zaposlen, zaposlen, zaposlen.
I hope it worked.	Upam, da je uspelo.
Without losing.	Ne da bi izgubil.
Once a week is enough.	Enkrat na teden je dovolj.
The reason you're there.	Razlog za to, da ste tam.
He is for you.	On je za vas.
That's how it goes.	Tako gre.
I asked him if he had children.	Vprašal sem ga, če ima otroke.
You're right.	Prav imaš.
You said he gave it to you.	Rekel si, da ti ga je dal.
It feels good.	Dobro se počuti.
Very good.	Zelo dober.
But they are not.	Ali jih ni.
i want to know too.	tudi jaz želim vedeti.
Everything you could want.	Vse, kar si lahko želiš.
I won't say anything more.	Ne bom rekel nič več.
It is certainly obvious.	Zagotovo je očitno.
He knew what he was going to do.	Vedel je, kaj bo naredil.
That's from me.	To je od mene.
If so, you are right.	Če je tako, imaš prav.
I was life.	Bil sem življenje.
I did something for you and you know what it is.	Nekaj ​​sem naredil zate in veš kaj je.
I have a lot of work to do today.	Danes imam veliko dela.
Nobody saw him.	Nihče ga ni videl.
This is work.	To je delo.
It is and it is not.	Je in ni.
Now tell me.	Zdaj mi povej.
It wouldn't be the first time.	Ne bi bilo prvič.
That's nice to say.	To je lepo povedati.
Maybe he didn't need to be here for that.	Mogoče mu za to ni bilo treba biti tukaj.
Already now she wanted him again.	Že zdaj si ga je spet želela.
And he came.	In prišel je.
I will decide tomorrow.	Odločil se bom jutri.
He had never said that before.	Še nikoli ni tako govoril.
I'll give it here.	dal ga bom sem.
I'm not interested in all that.	Vse to me ne zanima.
He and I.	On in jaz.
We like them very much now.	Zdaj so nam zelo všeč.
This afternoon, probably.	Danes popoldne, verjetno.
Like you.	Tako kot ti.
They knew why.	Vedeli so zakaj.
I had to work for it.	Moral sem delati za to.
I have to get there.	Moram priti tja.
He has to do it.	Mora to storiti.
There are a lot of people right now.	Trenutno je veliko ljudi.
It may not be more than it seems.	Morda ni več, kot se zdi.
You will not see him again.	Ne boste ga več videli.
No more of that.	Nič več tega.
I didn't think it was wrong.	Ni se mi zdelo narobe.
You were good to me.	Bil si dober do mene.
Everything is yes or no.	Vse je da ali ne.
Not because of that.	Zaradi tega ne,.
More on that next week.	Več o tem naslednji teden.
You didn't have to go to school.	Ni ti bilo treba v šolo.
It is obvious that this cannot be so.	Očitno je, da temu ne more biti tako.
I don't think you should.	Mislim, da ne bi smeli.
It wasn't right.	Ni bilo prav.
But it's so hard.	Vendar je tako težko.
And it happened.	In zgodilo se je.
There is a good reason for this.	Za to obstaja dober razlog.
It's work now.	Zdaj je delo.
I could go out.	Lahko bi šel ven.
I don't know how it happened.	Ne vem, kako se je zgodilo.
They may be lucky.	Morda bodo imeli srečo.
And that just won’t happen.	In to se preprosto ne bo zgodilo.
Nobody knows where you are.	Nihče ne ve, kje si.
We know better.	Vemo bolje.
He refuses to leave without it.	Brez tega noče oditi.
I was there.	Jaz sem bila tam.
This would be nice.	To bi bilo lepo.
Just like she was.	Tako kot je bila.
It wasn't serious.	Ni bilo resno.
That's wrong.	To je narobe.
The kid had to go.	Otrok je moral iti.
He wasn't good either.	Tudi on ni bil dober.
I do not like.	Ni mi všeč.
That's it.	To je to.
Yes, we were.	Da, bili smo.
We'll see.	Bomo videli.
Probably just about how you’re doing.	Verjetno samo o tem, kako vam gre.
I wish we had time.	Želim si, da bi imeli čas.
I hope not either.	Upam, da tudi ne.
No one can help me.	Nihče mi ne more pomagati.
He's alone again.	Spet je sam.
She needed to be told.	Treba ji je bilo povedati.
They are together forever.	Skupaj sta za vedno.
I needed her to know that.	Potreboval sem jo, da to ve.
He wouldn't allow it.	On tega ne bi dovolil.
Right away.	Takoj.
I'm just interested in the reason for that.	Zanima me samo razlog za to.
I want to play, but there is no one else	Rad bi igral, a ni nikogar drugega
If I had, I would have done it sooner.	Če bi bil, bi to storil že prej.
He will definitely win.	Zagotovo bo zmagal.
I wish it was me.	Želim si, da bi bil jaz.
There aren't many of them.	Ni jih veliko.
That is so true.	To je tako res.
Please if anyone can help me.	Prosim, če mi kdo pomaga.
I went.	šel sem.
He had little time.	Imel je malo časa.
If at all possible.	Če je to sploh mogoče.
And they won't know.	In ne bodo vedeli.
He would leave, they wouldn't see him for a while.	Odšel bi, nekaj časa ga ne bi videli.
You won't have it.	Ne boš je imel.
I didn't like that at all.	To mi sploh ni bilo všeč.
None of you can do anything.	Nihče od vas ne more storiti ničesar.
I never need to know that.	Tega mi nikoli ni treba vedeti.
He didn't need it.	Ni mu bilo treba.
It wasn't difficult.	Ni bilo težko.
I mean, it has to be.	Mislim, mora biti.
I don’t care who he was and who did it.	Ne zanima me kdo je bil in kdo je to storil.
We would have known for some time that this was not the case.	Že nekaj časa bi vedeli, da tega ni bilo.
I don't have to do that.	Ni mi treba storiti.
And there is a little more to be done here.	In tukaj je treba narediti še malo.
So he seemed to stay there.	Tako se je zdelo, da je ostal tam.
I don’t think that will ever happen.	Mislim, da se to nikoli ne bo zgodilo.
Here we are.	Tukaj smo.
But there was nothing there.	A tam ni bilo nič.
I couldn't do that.	Tega ne bi mogel storiti.
That's what you said.	To si rekel.
We would only see something like this.	Le kaj takega bi videli.
He did.	Naredil.
I expected too much.	Preveč sem pričakoval.
Maybe this will help you too.	Morda vam bo to tudi v pomoč.
And not only that.	In ne samo to.
I think it's for me.	Mislim, da je zame.
I couldn’t get out of there fast enough.	Nisem mogel dovolj hitro od tam.
And I want to know why.	In želim vedeti, zakaj.
We haven’t done much since.	Od takrat nismo naredili veliko.
To feel like he won.	Da se počuti, kot da je zmagal.
No matter what.	Ne glede na vse.
Everything is happening so fast.	Vse se dogaja tako hitro.
I just don't.	Samo mi ne.
They are forever.	Za vedno so.
You mean well.	Dobro misliš.
It's more than simple.	To je več kot preprosto.
He hasn't done that in years.	Tega ni storil že leta.
Everything was wrong here.	Tukaj je bilo vse narobe.
Has it ever been.	Ali je bilo kdaj.
Maybe it's right, even if it's not.	Morda je prav, tudi če temu ni tako.
A little surprised too.	Tudi malo presenečen.
Now it's happening to him again.	Zdaj se mu spet dogaja.
No, that's not true.	Ne, to ni res.
The man knew nothing.	Človek ni vedel ničesar.
I was quite happy.	Bil sem precej vesel.
We like it very much.	Zelo nam je všeč.
I hope you like it !.	Upam, da vam je všeč!.
She was still with him.	Še vedno je bila z njim.
These are mine.	To so moje.
We are here now.	Zdaj smo tukaj.
I understand better now, just a little.	Zdaj bolje razumem, le malo.
I am sure he will be fine and home soon !.	Prepričan sem, da bo kmalu v redu in doma!.
He does things.	On naredi stvari.
I don't have money now.	Zdaj nimam denarja.
I don't know anything about that.	Ne vem nič o tem.
you what ?.	ti kaj?.
You have to work for what you want.	Delati moraš za tisto, kar si želiš.
And came early.	In prišel zgodaj.
Just like that, like that.	Samo tako, tako.
It won't be hard.	Ne bo težko.
Not really.	Pravzaprav ni.
I knew nothing about it.	Nič nisem vedel o tem.
I should get more out.	Več bi moral ven.
He did it again so he could leave work early.	Spet je to storil, da je lahko zgodaj šel z dela.
I waited.	Čakal sem.
And I think he's right.	In mislim, da ima prav.
He had a problem with me.	Z mano je imel težave.
I've never seen her before.	Še nikoli je nisem videl.
And it's true.	In res je.
You're a really good friend.	Res si dober prijatelj.
Let and.	Naj in.
That's how you want to play.	Tako želite igrati.
I want to ask you something.	Rad bi te nekaj vprašal.
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
Who did this to him.	Kdo mu je to storil.
That's pretty much it.	To je precej to.
Hard to say.	Težko bi rekel.
Or if it is.	Ali če že.
Now we were in this together.	Zdaj sva bila skupaj v tem.
We'll see what happens.	Bomo videli, kaj se bo zgodilo.
I wonder who they could be.	Sprašujem se, kdo so lahko.
I felt better.	Počutil sem se bolje.
i would be a better person.	jaz bi bil boljši človek.
I'm happy for you.	vesel sem zate.
She was fine.	Bila je v redu.
And the next day, and the next.	In naslednji dan, in naslednji.
He told her he couldn't stay.	Rekel ji je, da ne more ostati.
But maybe it was true.	Morda pa je bilo res.
I still see it today.	Vidim še danes.
What is it that needs to be done.	Kaj je tisto, kar je treba narediti.
You will not do that.	Tega ne boste storili.
Nobody knows where he is.	Nihče ne ve, kje je.
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
So he did what he had to.	Tako je naredil, kar je moral.
He was glad he had it.	Bil je vesel, da ga je imel.
It's so good to be back.	Tako dobro je biti nazaj.
You are real.	Pravi ste.
Here's the problem with that.	Tukaj je problem s tem.
I saw it right away.	Takoj sem videl.
But she wasn't here.	Vendar je ni bilo tukaj.
It always is.	Vedno se je.
Actually.	Pravzaprav.
It can't go on like this.	Tako ne more iti naprej.
We used to do that.	Nekoč smo to storili.
He lost everything.	Izgubil je vse.
He's going there.	On gre tja.
There is a lot to do here.	Veliko je treba narediti tukaj.
That's very good.	To je zelo dobro.
Why not stay.	Zakaj ne bi ostal.
I don't have to believe.	Ni mi treba verjeti.
It shouldn't be a problem for you.	Zate ne bi smel biti problem.
It seems there is.	Zdi se, da obstaja.
It wouldn't be long.	Ne bi bilo dolgo.
It happened to all of us.	Vsem se nam je zgodilo.
It is very.	Je zelo.
You don't know how.	Ne veš kako.
I think we should play it.	Mislim, da bi ga morali igrati.
We'll be there soon.	Kmalu bomo tam.
I always wanted to go.	Vedno sem si želel iti.
All right, he said.	V redu, je rekel.
I felt like I knew him.	Zdelo se mi je, da ga poznam.
I have it now.	Zdaj ga imam.
It's just hard for me.	Samo težko mi je.
You did well.	Dobro si opravil.
No one spoke to him.	Nihče ni govoril z njim.
I feel really good.	Počutim se res dobro.
Which is wrong.	Kar je narobe.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
If he was right, that would happen quickly, too.	Če bi imel prav, bi se tudi to zgodilo hitro.
Not helpful.	Ni v pomoč.
You will do this immediately.	To boš storil takoj.
He's working on it.	Dela na tem.
It's not always like that.	Ni vedno tako.
He had to leave.	Moral je oditi.
He lost it.	Izgubil ga je.
What else could it be?	Kaj bi še lahko bilo?
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
I will never go back.	Nikoli se ne bom vrnil.
It is OK.	Je v redu.
he said.	rekel je.
That makes us.	To nas naredi.
It was if.	Bilo je, če.
As can be.	Tako kot je lahko.
That would not happen to us.	To se nam ne bi zgodilo.
Which was little more than nothing.	Kar je bilo malo več kot nič.
I have to go out.	ven moram.
I hope to see you soon.	Upam da te kmalu vidim.
So, not so.	Tako, ne tako.
I haven't seen that.	tega nisem videl.
I was sure.	bil sem prepričan.
Come or go.	Priti ali iti po.
He beat her.	Zmagal jo je.
Once last night, now again.	Enkrat sinoči, zdaj pa spet.
But he didn't say anything.	Vendar ni rekel ničesar.
I should go now.	Zdaj bi moral iti.
She didn't know what she was doing.	Ni vedela, kaj počne.
So much has happened since then.	Toliko se je zgodilo od takrat.
Were they right?	Ali so imeli prav?
This is no longer true.	To ni več res.
But we simply cannot do that.	A tega preprosto ne moremo storiti.
I was ready.	Bil sem pripravljen.
It could be.	Lahko bi bilo.
Nobody said much.	Nihče ni rekel veliko.
I just told her that.	Pravkar sem ji to povedal.
He became angry again.	Spet je postal jezen.
He was in this and now.	Bil je v tem in zdaj.
He is at home from .	Doma je iz .
And today it succeeded.	In danes je uspelo.
This is not a good thing.	To ni dobra stvar.
That was a while back.	To je bilo malo nazaj.
I used to know it was.	Nekoč sem vedel, da je.
I am a very good person.	Sem zelo dobra oseba.
They will know you were here.	Vedeli bodo, da ste bili tukaj.
That will be nice.	To bo lepo.
You have to be prepared for that.	Na to moraš biti pripravljen.
They weren’t sure if they ever had them.	Niso bili prepričani, ali so jih kdaj imeli.
That is not enough.	To ni dovolj.
What if there was no money?	Kaj če ne bi bilo denarja?
That’s when he knew he had succeeded.	Takrat je vedel, da mu je uspelo.
Maybe I couldn't.	Mogoče ne bi mogel.
I didn't eat.	nisem jedel.
Or maybe you.	Ali pa morda ti.
There was nothing like that.	Ni bilo nič takega.
I hope it's not you.	Upam, da to nisi ti.
Nobody ever does.	Nihče nikoli ne.
He had this one.	Ta je imel.
Here was my chance to feel at home.	Tukaj je bila moja priložnost, da se počutim kot doma.
Better without it.	Bolje brez tega.
I saw that.	To sem videl.
He said for sure.	Rekel je zagotovo.
No one spoke.	Nihče ni govoril.
That it was time.	Da je bil čas.
No one has done that.	Tega ni naredil nihče.
It was not easy to come and go.	Priti in oditi ni bilo lahko.
It was still early.	Bilo je še zgodaj.
She said nothing.	Nič ni rekla.
I know why you came.	Vem, zakaj si prišel.
I used to be that guy.	Jaz sem bil nekoč ta fant.
Nothing happened to him.	Nič se mu ni zgodilo.
Not lost for me.	Nisem izgubil zame.
Not both.	Ne oba.
This is me!	To sem jaz!
I have to help.	Moram pomagati.
He's still here.	Še vedno je tukaj.
It wasn't hard enough.	Ni bilo dovolj težko.
You weren't there.	Ni te bilo tam.
I hope you get better soon.	Upam, da boš hitro bolje.
This is very difficult to do.	To je zelo težko narediti.
Not everyone would have it.	Ne bi ga imeli vsi.
I hope you are OK.	Upam, da si v redu.
There is a reason.	Obstaja razlog.
We need to help each other and work together.	Pomagati si moramo in delati skupaj.
But at the time, that never seemed likely.	Vendar se takrat to nikoli ne zdi verjetno.
What needs to be done?	Kaj je treba storiti?
And he's still with me.	In še vedno je z mano.
I was very angry.	Bil sem zelo jezen.
I will need it.	Potreboval ga bom.
He did it, you know.	On je to storil, veš.
Was it possible.	Ali je bilo mogoče.
I can not.	ne morem.
There is nothing to see here.	Tukaj ni kaj videti.
It has now begun.	Zdaj se je začel.
I haven’t felt better in years.	Že leta se nisem počutil bolje.
There was nowhere to go then.	Takrat ni bilo kam iti.
I was so ready.	Bil sem tako pripravljen.
And it will not be easy.	In to ne bo lahko.
I was happy about that.	Bil sem vesel tega.
I played in something.	Igral sem v nekaj.
He didn't wait long.	Ni čakal dolgo.
That's fine with me.	Meni je to v redu.
He likes it.	Všeč mu je.
I bought it.	Kupil sem ga.
He is a good man.	On je dober človek.
Because he could see them too.	Ker jih je tudi on lahko videl.
Can this be done better.	Ali je to mogoče narediti bolje.
Let me know who you are.	Naj veš, da si kdo.
He seems to like it.	Zdi se, da mu je všeč.
We know what they did.	Vemo, kaj so naredili.
He will be ready to go.	Pripravljen bo iti.
Not much more to go.	Ni veliko več za iti.
They are not.	Niso.
He hasn't said enough yet.	Ni še povedal dovolj.
I don't know, not really.	Ne vem, res ne.
So are you.	Tudi ti si.
You should believe me.	Moral bi mi verjeti.
I think he has.	Mislim, da ima.
You will not be well.	Ne bo ti nič dobro.
But that's not all.	To pa še ni vse.
He had never felt so good about anything.	Še nikoli se ni zaradi ničesar počutil tako dobro.
I didn't want to leave.	Nisem hotel oditi.
We didn't know.	Nismo vedeli.
The child can't talk at all now.	Otrok zdaj sploh ne more govoriti.
There was nothing left to do.	Nič ni bilo več za narediti.
I just have to.	Samo moram.
I like that I don’t know.	Všeč mi je, da ne vem.
Good for both.	Dobro za oba.
When if not now ?.	Kdaj če ne zdaj?.
It was pretty serious, but it wasn’t hard.	Bilo je precej resno, a ni bilo težko.
She's the only one.	Ta je edini.
Which is today.	Kar je danes.
And really, it still is.	In res, še vedno je.
I'm surprised at you.	Presenečen sem nad tabo.
No one told him anything.	Nihče mu ni povedal ničesar.
It seems better to me too.	Tudi meni se zdi boljši.
You know where it all is.	Veš kje je vse.
I know that for sure.	To zagotovo vem.
I'm really sorry.	res mi je žal.
I'm so glad to meet you.	Zelo sem vesel, da sem te spoznal.
I'm a good friend.	sem dober prijatelj.
Why is no one helping us?	Zakaj nam nihče ne pomaga?
I feel good.	Počutim se dobro.
It just has to be.	Samo mora biti.
She was fine with that.	Bila je v redu s tem.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ni hotel govoriti z mano.
And there's nothing you can do about it.	In s tem ne moreš nič.
It was hard, so hard.	Bilo je težko, tako težko.
More and more people are out of work.	Vse več ljudi je brez dela.
He wasn't there.	Ni bil tam.
We are there at the moment.	Tam smo trenutno.
Do what you have to do.	Naredi, kar moraš.
He never wants that.	Tega si nikoli ne želi.
I have more than enough.	Imam več kot dovolj.
He became very angry.	Postal je zelo jezen.
It always will.	Vedno bo.
She wanted people.	Želela je ljudi.
He already knows that.	On to že ve.
How right you are.	Kako prav imaš.
She wasn't.	Ni bila.
I'm glad I had it.	Vesel sem, da sem ga imel.
Actually a lot.	Pravzaprav veliko.
I understand.	razumem.
But very nice.	Vendar zelo lepo.
Because it already happened.	Ker se je že zgodilo.
She didn't know why.	Ni vedela zakaj.
He started it.	On je začel.
I'm glad to have you.	Vesel sem, da te imam.
That can't really be done.	Tega pravzaprav ni mogoče storiti.
Because no one knows what to do with it.	Ker nihče ne ve, kaj bi s tem naredil.
That's right, so it's okay.	Tako sem, tako da je v redu.
How is this possible?	Kako je to mogoče?
I'm sorry about that.	Žal mi je za to.
We both had to.	Oba sva morala.
And say it again.	In povej še enkrat.
Obviously not.	Očitno ne bo.
He was quite busy.	Bil je precej zaposlen.
I will try for that.	Poskušal bom za to.
I like everything.	Všeč mi je vse.
I wonder what you think of that.	Zanima me, kaj si mislite o tem.
They saw nothing from there.	Od tam niso videli ničesar.
I had to leave.	Moral sem oditi.
We didn't do that.	Tega nismo storili.
Whether this will happen remains to be seen.	Ali se bo to zgodilo, je treba še videti.
There is never anything.	Nikoli ni nič.
He's really angry.	Res je jezen.
He did it.	Naredil si je.
That's it.	To je to.
you.	ti.
I knew you would need me.	Vedel sem, da me boš potreboval.
And it should stay that way.	In tako mora ostati.
It's just the way it is.	Samo tako je.
It's good to be good.	Dobro je biti dober.
This was very difficult for me to do.	To mi je bilo zelo težko narediti.
And what it doesn’t do is really not very nice.	In kar ne naredi, res ni prav lepo.
That's unlikely.	To je malo verjetno.
I would ask her if she is a father.	Vprašal bi jo, če je oče.
And he failed.	In mu ni uspelo.
How much more for me.	Koliko bolj zame.
You should see her.	Moral bi jo videti.
Which will be soon.	Kar bo kmalu.
Certainly not tonight.	Nocoj zagotovo ni.
And neither are you.	In tudi ti nisi.
They had three children.	Imeli so tri otroke.
I'm sorry for that, but there is a reason.	Žal mi je za to, vendar obstaja razlog.
we are not interested.	nas ne zanima.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
Sometimes it's good.	Včasih je dobro.
I don't know how much.	Ne vem, koliko.
It's time for me to go too.	Čas je, da grem tudi jaz.
He had what he needed.	Imel je, kar je potreboval.
It takes a lot of time.	Potrebuje veliko časa.
I believe that is the case.	Verjamem, da je temu tako.
Because it's not me.	Ker to nisem jaz.
We almost had it.	Skoraj smo ga imeli.
He was the only one he could see here.	Bil je edini, ki ga je tukaj lahko videl.
This is not life.	To ni življenje.
I really had a problem with that.	Res sem imel problem s tem.
You know it's true.	Saj veš, da je res.
He obviously loved the job.	Očitno je imel rad delo.
It looked like he had been doing this his whole life.	Videti je bilo, kot da je to počel vse življenje.
And it had to be done quickly.	In to je bilo treba narediti hitro.
Would stay there again.	Spet bi ostal tam.
What is easy for them may not be so easy for us.	Kar je njim lahko, nam morda ni tako lahko.
He's more than fine.	On je več kot v redu.
What he did was wrong.	Kar je naredil, je bilo narobe.
And you know it too.	In tudi ti to veš.
I was never good at it.	Nikoli nisem bil dober v tem.
He is nothing to me.	On mi ni nič.
Maybe I would do it.	Morda bi to naredil.
No one should be here.	Nihče ne bi smel biti tukaj.
So he can't move on.	Tako ne more naprej.
You won't stay.	Ne boš ostal.
What happened to him?	Kaj se je zgodilo z njim?
That's how it is there, too.	Tudi tako je tam.
Which often happens.	Kar se pogosto dogaja.
How long.	Kako dolgo.
I will be able to meet.	se bom lahko srečal.
Yes, they all knew very well.	Da, vsi so dobro vedeli.
Nothing will happen.	Nič se ne bo zgodilo.
No one even knew he was there.	Nihče niti ni vedel, da je tam.
But it's not true.	Vendar ni res.
Maybe he's the only one.	Morda je edini.
I don't think anyone can.	Mislim, da nihče ne more.
Has this already happened?	Se je to že zgodilo?
And now here.	In zdaj tukaj.
I didn't want to be here.	Nisem hotel biti tukaj.
You did well.	Dobro si naredil.
You need to get out of there.	Moraš ven od tam.
Nobody wants that !.	Nihče si tega ne želi!.
Keep up the good work.	Samo tako naprej.
Not enough for life.	Ni dovolj za življenje.
Yes.	Je.
No one knew.	Nihče ni vedel.
It was really nice.	Res je bilo lepo.
Keep it simple when possible, yes.	Naj bo preprosto, ko je to mogoče, da.
I never told you.	Nikoli ti nisem rekel.
She knew so little about herself.	Sama je tako malo vedela.
I won't be there.	Ne bo me tam.
And maybe not.	In morda ne bi.
I'm sure he knows who he is.	Prepričan sem, da ve, kdo je.
And that was all.	In to je bilo vse.
I met them.	srečal sem jih.
Maybe he knew.	Mogoče je vedel.
How do you think it should be done?	Kako misliš, da je treba to narediti?
That's a lot of money.	To je veliko denarja.
He will come again tonight, he said.	Nocoj bo spet prišel, je rekel.
I never was.	nikoli nisem bil.
It's still there.	Še vedno je tam.
He wanted to leave.	Želel si je oditi.
And we shouldn't.	In ne bi smeli.
I didn't want to go.	Nisem hotel iti.
I should have known it would.	Moral bi vedeti, da bo.
In the morning as usual.	Zjutraj kot običajno.
He wants to do things.	Želi delati stvari.
I see what's happening to me.	Vidim, kaj se mi dogaja.
I would never see that stuff.	Te stvari ne bi nikoli videl.
She knew what she was talking about.	Vedela je, kaj govori o tem.
And he saw nothing.	In ni videl ničesar.
What happened happened.	Kar se je zgodilo, se je zgodilo.
As you have seen.	Kot ste videli.
I really believe that to be true.	Res verjamem, da je to res.
That's how it is here.	Tako je tukaj.
I don't want that.	Nočem tega.
I know how it is.	Vem, kako je.
And he knows us.	In on nas pozna.
No one like him.	Nihče kot on.
He no longer gambled.	Ni več igral na srečo.
That was so beautiful.	To je bilo tako lepo.
I’m sure there must be a few.	Prepričan sem, da jih mora biti nekaj.
I'm glad I'm home.	Vesel sem, da sem doma.
But that's not why.	Ni pa zato.
He's doing it now.	To počne zdaj.
He did it to me.	Naredil mi je.
This is a good opportunity for me.	Zame je to dobra priložnost.
He was.	Bil je.
That would be a problem.	To bi bil problem.
He couldn't stay here.	Ni mogel ostati tukaj.
You really should know better.	Res bi morali vedeti bolje.
And when he is right, he is right.	In ko ima prav, ima prav.
He wasn't sure how he was going to do it.	Ni bil prepričan, kako bo to storil.
She didn’t know this was happening.	Ni vedela, da se to dogaja.
But it worked for me.	Vendar je zame uspelo.
Usually not.	Običajno ne.
It's not that day.	To ni tisti dan.
We have.	Imamo .
And you can.	In lahko.
We’ll see how he feels and what he’s trying to do.	Bomo videli, kako se bo počutil in kaj je poskušal narediti.
It actually happened.	Pravzaprav se je to zgodilo.
There weren’t many people that day.	Ta dan ni bilo veliko ljudi.
We should get to it.	Morali bi priti do tega.
Not here either.	Tudi tukaj ne.
I wouldn't be here without him.	Mene ne bi bilo tukaj, če ne bi bilo njega.
Nothing is going on here.	Tukaj ne gre nič.
That's what life does to us sometimes.	To nam življenje včasih naredi.
I mean people.	Mislim na ljudi.
No, no, not for me.	Ne, ne, ne zame.
And they knew when he would be there.	In vedeli so, kdaj bo tam.
No, not that one.	Ne, ne ta.
But it cannot be said.	Ni pa mogoče povedati.
Time has done it.	Čas je to naredil.
Everyone is fine.	Vsi so v redu.
But that's it.	Ali je to to.
I could say that much.	Toliko bi lahko povedal.
He's not there.	Ni ga tam.
I was not ready.	nisem bil pripravljen.
I never told anyone.	Nikoli nisem nikomur povedal.
He's doing well now.	Zdaj mu gre dobro.
He has nothing there.	Tam nima nič.
He didn't know what she said.	Ni vedel, kaj je rekla.
He won't come back at all.	Sploh se ne bo vrnil.
They are there for me.	Tam so zame.
And that's exactly what they did.	In prav to so storili.
He was over it.	Bil je nad tem.
I'll teach you myself.	Sam te bom naučil.
Someone else with him.	Še nekdo z njim.
He has a job.	Ima službo.
It's really very simple.	To je res zelo preprosto.
This really helps me.	To mi res pomaga.
It's not what it used to be.	Ni več to, kar je bilo.
No one has come yet.	Še vedno ni prišel nihče.
Everything is fine with him.	Z njim je vse v redu.
It seemed like there was nothing he could do.	Zdelo se je, kot da ne more storiti ničesar.
He died for me.	Umrl je zame.
I won't help you either.	Tudi jaz ti ne bom pomagal.
Even from you.	Tudi od tebe.
And he’s a man who really liked the game.	In on je človek, ki mu je bila igra res všeč.
Sometimes it is.	Včasih se je.
They knew what to do.	Vedeli so, kaj storiti.
Fortunately, it is.	Na srečo je.
Someone has to say something.	Nekdo mora nekaj povedati.
I never thought he would leave.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da bo odšel.
I was sorry for you.	Bilo mi je žal zate.
She really wanted that.	To si je zelo želela.
Now is the time.	Zdaj je čas.
And now this is happening at home.	In zdaj se to dogaja doma.
Maybe they are.	Morda so.
I have some.	nekaj jih imam.
I want to do so many things.	Želim narediti toliko stvari.
It was working together.	Delati je bilo skupaj.
Just don "t.	Samo ne.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
I know that's true.	Vem, da je to res.
I know for sure they are not.	Zagotovo vem, da niso.
This is not a person.	To ni oseba.
And he never forgot.	In nikoli ni pozabil.
Someone help me!	Naj mi nekdo pomaga!
He no longer had anything to go home.	Ni mu bilo več kaj iti domov.
And you were alone.	In bil si sam.
All the time.	Ves čas.
I needed that today.	Danes sem to potreboval.
However, he did not want to tell us what happened.    	Vendar nam ni hotel povedati, kaj se je zgodilo.    
s.	s.
I've never been there before.	Nikoli prej nisem bil tam.
Let him be ready.	Naj bo pripravljen.
He didn't even die.	Sploh ni umrl.
I'm glad he said.	Vesel sem, da je rekel.
Maybe for dinner.	Morda na večerjo.
She didn't have to say anything else.	Nič drugega ji ni bilo treba povedati.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Ni prvič, da se je zgodilo.
No, not again.	Ne, ne spet.
They had to talk.	Morali so govoriti.
It's hard to believe it was only a week ago.	Težko je verjeti, da je bilo le teden dni nazaj.
I knew how to do it.	Vedel sem, kako to storiti.
If anyone can do it.	Če lahko kdo to naredi.
Money had nothing to do with it, she told me.	Denar ni imel nič s tem, mi je rekla.
In fact, we know very little about it.	Pravzaprav o tem vemo le malo.
He didn't really have one.	Pravzaprav ni imel.
He was your father.	Bil je tvoj oče.
You've been alone long enough.	Dovolj dolgo si bil sam.
He knows a lot of things.	On ve veliko stvari.
Not these things.	Ne te stvari.
He's not here.	Ni ga tukaj.
This man was my everything.	Ta človek je bil moje vse.
I would go there, but not often.	Jaz bi šel tja, vendar ne pogosto.
I believe him.	jaz mu verjamem.
You are a better person.	Ti si boljši človek.
Now back to work.	Zdaj pa nazaj na delo.
I can't do it alone.	Sama ne morem.
She was still not at home.	Še vedno je ni bilo doma.
It was not possible.	Ni bilo mogoče.
He had to make sure.	Moral se je prepričati.
But there was something wrong.	Vendar je bilo nekaj narobe.
Dad was right.	Oče je imel prav.
And I liked it.	In všeč mi je bilo.
And Dad never knew.	In oče nikoli ni vedel.
He did it well.	To mu je dobro uspelo.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Prepričan sem, da veš, kaj je to.
As he says.	Kot pravi.
You don't like it?	Vam niso všeč?
I don't think that will happen for a while.	Mislim, da se to še nekaj časa ne bo zgodilo.
You should do more of this.	Moral bi narediti več tega.
He came home.	Prišel je domov.
I went back in time.	Vrnil sem se na čas.
But it was hard.	Bilo pa je težko.
We have a lot of work to do there too.	Tudi tam imamo veliko dela.
things are fine there.	tam so stvari v redu.
It's too simple.	To je preveč preprosto.
I don't want to talk to him much.	Ne želim veliko govoriti z njim.
It was fine.	Bilo je v redu.
Nothing, really.	Nič, res.
However, it is not that simple.	Vendar pa ni tako preprosto.
It really was.	Res je bilo.
I think he will succeed.	Mislim, da mu bo uspelo.
I was busy.	Bil sem zaposlen.
Have a nice life please.	Lepo življenje prosim.
She didn't know what happened.	Ni vedela, kaj se je zgodilo.
He wants to see me.	Želi me videti.
Now may be the time.	Zdaj je morda čas.
nice.	lepo.
It's really still very simple.	To je res še zelo preprosto.
It seems not.	Zdi se, da ne.
I know I wouldn't.	Vem, da ne bi.
I haven't heard it yet.	Nisem še slišal nazaj.
It’s hard to know what to believe.	Težko je vedeti, kaj verjeti.
Time for fun!	Čas za zabavo!
I really didn’t like it that way.	Res mi ni bilo všeč tako.
I was gone then.	Takrat me ni bilo več.
Like yes.	Kot da.
That doesn't work here.	To tukaj ne gre.
You will have to stay together.	Morali boste ostati skupaj.
He had several thoughts that he could hear.	Imel je več misli, ki jih je lahko slišal.
I really wanted to.	Res sem si želel.
He wanted a life without me.	Želel je življenje brez mene.
In fact, they are.	Pravzaprav so.
My thoughts are with you.	Moje misli so s tabo.
I don't need to know anything else.	Nič drugega mi ni treba vedeti.
They did this very well.	To so naredili zelo dobro.
He intends to do this every day.	To namerava početi vsak dan.
But he did not forget.	A ni pozabil.
How long it seemed.	Kako dolgo se je zdelo.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
I probably shouldn't.	Verjetno ne bi smel.
Here you are.	Tukaj si.
She was no longer human.	Ni bila več človek.
I wanted to, you know that.	Hotel sem, veš to.
We will do that next week.	To bomo storili naslednji teden.
He thought she was interested this afternoon.	Mislil je, da jo danes popoldne zanima.
This thing here, this thing there.	Ta stvar tukaj, ta stvar tam.
And you can have it.	In lahko ga imaš.
And there will be more of you.	In več vas bo.
To know.	Če želite vedeti.
I wonder what will happen?.	Zanima me, kaj se bo zgodilo?.
He has a good job.	Ima dobro službo.
They didn't even know where he lived.	Sploh niso vedeli, kje živi.
There was nothing like that.	Ni bilo nič takega.
I have to get out of here now.	Zdaj moram od tukaj.
I will find time for it.	Za to bom našel čas.
I'm not interested.	Ne zanima me.
He wasn't tired either.	Tudi utrujen ni bil.
I will stay here again.	Spet bom ostal tukaj.
No one could do anything.	Nihče ni mogel storiti ničesar.
I was there then.	Takrat sem bil tam.
This is something we know better.	To je nekaj, kar vemo bolje.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
But she wasn't with him for long.	A z njim ni bila dolgo.
But no one is right about everything.	Nihče pa nima prav glede vsega.
It wasn't always easy.	Ni bilo vedno lahko.
I never went again.	Nikoli več nisem šel.
That's a good question.	To je dobro vprašanje.
He really seems like a good, good person.	Res se zdi dobra, dobra oseba.
And it won't.	In ne bo.
There are no more children.	Ni več otrok.
We did it as usual today.	Danes smo to naredili kot običajno.
He was convinced of that.	Bil je prepričan v to.
If not, then no.	Če ne, pa ne.
And it's always for the better.	In vedno je na bolje.
Actually, I am.	Pravzaprav sem.
He was there that day.	Ta dan je bil tam.
I have to.	Moram.
He had had enough.	Dovolj je imel.
And there aren't that many of us.	In ni nas toliko.
so I doubt it.	pa dvomim.
No one told her what to do or where to be.	Nihče ji ni rekel, kaj naj počne ali kje naj bo.
He was no longer a boy.	Zdaj ni bil več fant.
You are better than me.	Ti si boljši od mene.
There were so many, maybe too many.	Bilo je toliko, morda preveč.
And that was him.	In to je bil on.
Do what?	Narediti kaj?
I don't see anything wrong with that.	V tem ne vidim nič narobe.
That's fine.	To je v redu.
I didn't see any of that.	Nič od tega nisem videl.
Even earlier.	Še prej.
I think he let me.	Mislim, da mi je dovolil.
It can't be him.	Ne more biti on.
He's good, but not so good.	Dober je, a ne tako dober.
That may be obvious.	To je morda očitno.
Can anyone help please ?.	Ali lahko kdo pomaga prosim?.
It was not easy.	To ni bilo lahko.
Like everything.	Kot vse skupaj.
So nice of you to come.	Tako lepo od tebe, da si prišel.
And now.	In zdaj.
You have to go after him.	Moraš iti za njim.
Now I can be my true self.	Zdaj sem lahko svoj pravi jaz.
Maybe he's right.	Morda ima prav.
I started talking.	Začel sem govoriti.
Everything he needed.	Vse kar je potreboval.
He doesn't hope for luck.	Ne upa na srečo.
And she definitely knew where it was.	In zagotovo je vedela, kje je.
Get there.	Priti tja.
I said.	sem rekel.
Just my thing.	Samo moja stvar.
I'm glad you're here today.	Vesel sem, da si danes tukaj.
Just not right away.	Samo ne takoj.
This is not true.	To ni res.
A lot has happened.	Veliko se je zgodilo.
And that would be him.	In to bi bil on.
Apparently not.	Očitno ni tako.
There was nothing else he could do.	Nič drugega ni mogel storiti.
He soon came to this.	Kmalu je prišel do tega.
Therefore	Zato
Or so it seemed.	Ali pa se je tako zdelo.
You were very good.	Bil si zelo dober.
I don't have time for that now.	Zdaj nimam časa za to.
I can't go on like this.	Ne morem tako naprej.
You must know this.	To moraš vedeti.
Someone will win and someone will lose.	Nekdo bo zmagal in nekdo izgubil.
There will be more.	Še več jih bo.
It used to be serious.	Včasih je bilo resno.
This is probably what you want.	To je verjetno tisto, kar želite.
No one knew much about it.	Nihče ni vedel veliko o tem.
I've been.	Bil sem.
But he didn't know.	Vendar ni vedel.
You have to do it.	Narediti moraš.
And one more thing.	Pa še nekaj.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
I just saw it.	Pravkar sem videl.
I will never succeed.	Nikoli mi ne bo uspelo.
I could talk to him.	Lahko bi govoril z njim.
And he couldn't see.	In ni mogel videti.
But even that may not be enough.	A tudi to morda ne bo dovolj.
I've been waiting for you.	Čakal sem vas.
I don't think you told me everything he said.	Mislim, da mi nisi povedal vsega, kar je rekel.
Where we've ever been.	Kje smo bili kdaj.
Your father will be expecting us home soon.	Tvoj oče nas bo kmalu pričakoval domov.
I might say more.	Morda bi povedal več.
He gave us everything we have.	Dal nam je vse, kar imamo.
Everything is fine now.	Zdaj je vse v redu.
Just to have it.	Samo da ga imam.
He wanted to go home.	Hotel je domov.
That can never be enough.	To nikoli ne more biti dovolj.
Just do it like that.	Samo naredi tako.
Help is easy.	Pomoč je lahko.
Or maybe.	Ali pa morda.
No one can tell him what to do.	Nihče mu ne more povedati, kaj naj naredi.
I am	jaz sem
And more and more and more and more and more.	In še in še in še in še.
I will promise you here and now.	Obljubil vam bom tukaj in zdaj.
He is there.	On je tam.
He will be really good.	Res bo dober.
I did not have.	nisem imel.
I would like to help you.	rad bi ti pomagal.
You have so much.	Toliko imaš.
I have so much to tell you.	Toliko ti imam za povedati.
She was not without anything.	Ni bila brez ničesar.
I won't expect too much from you.	Od tebe ne bom pričakoval preveč.
I don't care about time.	Ne zanima me čas.
What if it wasn't tomorrow?	Kaj če ne bi bilo jutri?
What would you say?	Kaj bi rekla.
That's what you said.	To si rekel.
We need to do more than that.	Več kot to moramo storiti.
But it seems they won't.	Vendar se zdi, da ne bodo.
He had never seen them before.	Nikoli prej jih ni videl.
It was good to eat.	Dobro je bilo jesti.
That was none of my business.	To ni bila moja stvar.
I am tired.	Utrujen sem.
She was next to me.	Bila je ob meni.
He expected he could die.	Pričakoval je, da bi lahko umrl.
And it really is.	In res se.
I just don’t see that happening.	Samo ne vidim, da bi se to zgodilo.
He died for us.	Umrl je za nas.
He immediately saw that she had succeeded.	Takoj je videl, da ji je uspelo.
It seemed right.	Zdelo se je prav.
We never saw him.	Nikoli ga nismo videli.
This is clearly not the case.	To očitno ni tako.
And he would.	In on bi.
It was you.	Bil si ti.
That didn't seem right.	To se ni zdelo prav.
Everything would be better for you.	Vse bi vam bilo bolje.
I think he's so happy.	Mislim, da je tako vesel.
You want to do it this way, okay with me.	Želiš to narediti tako, v redu z mano.
It is about v.	Gre za v.
If he still had it.	Če ga je še imel.
Because that's what's going to happen.	Ker to se bo zgodilo.
We all need to stay together tonight.	Nocoj moramo ostati vsi skupaj.
I would have.	Jaz bi imel.
You can have that with me.	To lahko imaš pri meni.
It's pretty hard, isn't it?	Precej težko je, kajne?
We were there.	Tam smo bili.
he knows me.	on me pozna.
I was lucky.	Imel sem srečo.
And this is more than serious.	In to je več kot resno.
She herself did not know why she did this.	Sama ni vedela, zakaj je to storila.
There are so many of them.	Toliko jih je.
And maybe more.	In morda še več.
I'll go with him.	Odšel bom z njim.
But it's okay.	Je pa v redu.
I didn't like that.	To mi ni bilo všeč.
I want to come here.	Želim priti sem.
You know how good it used to be.	Veste, kako dobro je bilo včasih.
He said so much.	Toliko je rekel.
I don't want that anymore.	Tega nočem več.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
Now he knew what that something was.	Zdaj je vedel, kaj je to nekaj.
That he is your who.	Da je on tvoj kdo.
But not all.	Vendar ne vse.
I'm sure it was you.	Prepričan sem, da si bil ti.
You're all in this together.	Vsi skupaj ste v tem.
I had nothing to say.	Nisem imel kaj povedati.
But she said nothing.	Vendar ni rekla ničesar.
He didn't need children.	Ni potreboval otrok.
I'm going to have to do something.	Nekaj ​​bom moral narediti.
We know a lot more these days.	Te dni vemo veliko več.
I'm not interested in anything.	Nič me ne zanima.
I didn't ask for that!	Tega nisem prosil!
Life is not as simple as it used to be.	Življenje ni tako preprosto, kot je bilo.
I still have a lot to say.	Še vedno imam veliko povedati.
I don't know why we're here.	Ne vem zakaj smo tukaj.
I did not know.	nisem vedel.
There are none today.	Danes jih ni.
He is absolutely right.	Ima popolnoma prav.
That was all he needed.	To je bilo vse, kar je potreboval.
So on and so forth.	Tako naprej in tako naprej.
He really is more than a father.	Res je več kot oče.
This is not true.	To ni res.
He didn’t know it was going to be something he would have to do.	Ni vedel, da bo to nekaj, kar bo moral storiti.
What were you doing last night?	Kaj si počel sinoči?
I don't have to do anything.	Ničesar mi ni treba narediti.
And this is wrong.	In to je narobe.
Your man.	Svoj človek.
i like it that way.	všeč mi je tako.
He had heard it before.	Slišal ga je že prej.
I would say so.	Tako bi rekel.
He decided to work.	Odločil se je za delo.
There is nothing we can do.	Ne moremo storiti ničesar.
I knew it well.	Dobro sem vedel.
That's what she said.	Tako je rekla.
The child has never heard of this.	Otrok tega še nikoli ni slišal.
I was expecting.	Pričakoval sem.
Tomorrow, for sure, tomorrow.	Jutri, zagotovo, jutri.
It seemed simple.	Zdelo se je preprosto.
Maybe I'll die here.	Morda bom umrl tukaj.
What was that? 	Kaj je bilo to?
I like them very much.	Zelo so mi všeč.
That's wrong.	To je narobe.
Who would have known he had it.	Kdo bi vedel, da ga ima.
There is something very wrong with this.	S tem je nekaj zelo narobe.
I wanted to talk to you about it.	Želel sem govoriti s tabo o tem.
It is very difficult.	Je zelo težko.
She had to say what she knew.	Morala je povedati, kar je vedela.
Someone like you.	Nekdo kot ti.
And now he's tired anyway.	In zdaj je tako ali tako utrujen.
I mean, maybe I should have known about it.	Mislim, mogoče naj bi vedel za to.
I want to see.	Želim videti.
What happens is happening.	Kar se dogaja, se dogaja.
You will never see me again.	Nikoli več me ne boš videl.
She had to go home.	Morala je domov.
He wasn't real.	Ni bil pravi.
This was very difficult for me.	To je bilo zame zelo težko.
It never was, it never would be.	Nikoli ni bilo, nikoli ne bi bilo.
And now it is.	In zdaj je.
If you want to be better, you can.	Če želite biti boljši, lahko.
But I like it.	Meni je pa všeč.
I preferred the car.	Raje sem se odločil za avto.
What he says is true.	Kar pravi, je tako.
I know she was.	Vem, da je bila.
I would like that.	to bi rad.
She wanted this for so long.	To si je tako dolgo želela.
I shouldn't have eaten so much last night.	Sinoči ne bi smel jesti toliko.
I am him.	jaz sem on.
I learned everything from there.	Od tam sem se vsega naučil.
Not like last night.	Ne tako kot sinoči.
Why would.	Zakaj bi.
How are you.	Kako gre.
That's really it.	Je to res tisto.
I don't think you think so.	Ne verjamem, da tako misliš.
You're the real one.	Ti si tisti pravi.
I need help fast.	Potrebujem hitro pomoč.
I would never have them.	Nikoli jih ne bi imel.
You know better.	Ti pa veš bolje.
I hope it will be sooner.	Upam, da bo prej.
We can't know.	Ne moremo vedeti.
That's nice, isn't it?	To je lepo, kajne?
It's time for the kids.	Čas je za otroke.
I asked her about it today.	Danes sem jo vprašal o tem.
But it must be soon.	Vendar mora biti kmalu.
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
They really were in it.	Res so bili v tem.
You can't leave.	Ne moreš oditi.
We probably won't.	Verjetno ne bomo.
He lives alone.	Živi sam.
But we know that sometimes it exists.	Vemo pa, da včasih obstaja.
This also needs to be done.	Tudi to je treba narediti.
So is that.	Tako je tudi to.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
Everything seemed so difficult.	Vse se je zdelo tako težko.
You have to see that.	To moraš videti.
Everything seemed to be fine.	Zdelo se je, da je vse v redu.
No one knows when.	Nihče ne ve, kdaj.
Not you either.	Tudi ti ne.
I don’t have to say what to believe.	Ni mi treba govoriti, kaj naj verjamem.
I stayed with it.	ostal sem pri tem.
He doesn't want to move on.	Noče naprej.
That's more than enough.	To je več kot dovolj.
A very good friend will probably say they are.	Zelo dober prijatelj bo verjetno povedal, da so.
I won't wait any longer.	ne bom več čakal.
But there is more.	Vendar je še več.
Tell me why.	Povej mi zakaj.
This is not the life for you.	To ni življenje zate.
I don't understand anything, she said.	Nič ne razumem, je rekla.
I don't understand what this is about.	Ne razumem, za kaj gre.
Everyone had their own.	Vsak je imel svoje.
He has his book.	Ima svojo knjigo.
I think we are right.	Mislim, da imamo prav.
But sometimes it can be a bit busy.	Včasih pa je lahko nekoliko zaposlen.
I did it wrong.	Narobe sem naredil.
I think we should do that.	Mislim, da bi to morali storiti.
I went there last week.	Prejšnji teden sem šel tja.
There are so many of them and we don’t know what they are.	Toliko jih je in ne vemo, kaj so.
None of us have done that yet.	Tega še nihče od nas ni storil.
But now we know why.	Zdaj pa vemo zakaj.
We knew we had to do something.	Vedeli smo, da moramo nekaj narediti.
We were.	Bili smo.
I wish I could.	Želim si, da bi lahko.
It's nothing.	Nič ni.
I understand why this happened.	Razumem, zakaj se je to zgodilo.
He said ‘probably not’.	Rekel je 'verjetno ne'.
That's who he is.	To je, kdo je.
He couldn't see, but he could hear her.	Ni je mogel videti, lahko pa jo je slišal.
And there was more to it than that.	In bilo je več kot to.
Because it will happen.	Ker se bo to zgodilo.
The man had none of that.	Človek ni imel nič od tega.
I like both of you.	Všeč sta mi oba.
When you left.	Ko si odšel.
Just something.	Samo nekaj.
Now he's gone too.	Zdaj je tudi on odšel.
I feel good.	Dobro se počutim.
It looked like he hadn't been around in a long time.	Videti je bilo, kot da ga že dolgo ni bilo.
I don't know what to do about it.	Ne vem, kaj naj storim glede tega.
As the following.	Kot naslednji.
That's how it seemed to me.	Tako se mi je zdelo.
That was no longer true.	To ni bilo več res.
And you have to do it.	In to moraš storiti.
He really was there.	Res je bil tam.
That's exactly the reason.	Prav to je razlog.
That's why I'm here now.	Zaradi tega sem zdaj mi.
There was so little to see.	Tako malo je bilo videti.
I just wanted you to know that's okay.	Hotel sem samo, da veš, da je to v redu.
I need to see her.	Moram jo videti.
You don't know what's going on.	Ne veš kaj se dogaja.
I don't need anything else.	Ne potrebujem ničesar drugega.
Or maybe it happened.	Ali pa se je morda zgodilo.
It's not always what seems obvious.	Ni vedno tisto, kar se zdi očitno.
It's just there.	Samo tam je.
He would need me.	Potreboval bi me.
And that's all, you know.	In to je vse, veš.
He was completely human now.	Zdaj je bil popolnoma človek.
I knew how.	Vedel sem, kako.
And he came and you know.	In prišel je in veš.
I asked who it was.	Vprašal sem, kdo je to.
It's better here.	Tukaj je boljši.
As if he was waiting for us.	Kot da nas je čakal.
He couldn't stay forever.	Ni mogel ostati za vedno.
I would never have expected this to happen.	Nikoli ne bi pričakoval, da se bo to zgodilo.
That's why it's so hard for us.	Zato nam je tako težko.
That's how he felt.	Tako se je počutil.
Actually, none of us are.	Pravzaprav nihče od nas ni.
I myself would be sorry to see him there.	Sam bi mi bilo žal, da bi ga videl tja.
And here.	In tukaj.
I could do it if you want.	Lahko bi naredil, če želiš.
I knew something was going on.	Vedel sem, da se nekaj dogaja.
We've all been here.	Tukaj smo bili vsi.
I wasn’t much of a help.	Nisem bil veliko v pomoč.
Probably me too.	Verjetno tudi jaz.
She would be fine now.	Zdaj bi bila v redu.
She needed to eat more.	Morala je jesti več.
We're not there.	Ni nas tam.
You just said as much.	Pravkar si rekel toliko.
You already know that.	To že veš.
If he is no more, he is no more.	Če ga ni več, ga ni več.
I'm almost here, sorry.	Skoraj sem tukaj, žal.
I would leave.	Odšel bi.
At the time, we were sure he hadn’t seen us.	Takrat smo bili prepričani, da nas ni videl.
You have to stay human.	Ostati moraš človek.
Now we knew why.	Zdaj smo vedeli zakaj.
I went to work.	šel sem v službo.
I didn’t mean it, he said.	Nisem mislil, je rekel.
It’s actually very nice.	Pravzaprav je zelo lepo.
How many years.	Koliko let.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar.
You can’t know for sure, can you.	Ni mogoče vedeti zagotovo, kajne.
I've never met him before.	Še nikoli ga nisem srečal.
I know it will happen.	Vem, da se bo zgodilo.
He said he was interested.	Rekel je, da ga zanima.
I’m sure it will be quick.	Prepričan sem, da bo to hitro.
I was not surprised.	nisem bil presenečen.
This is no longer the case.	Zdaj tega ni več.
I much prefer doing that.	Veliko raje to počnem.
More than happy.	Več kot vesel.
That day never came.	Ta dan ni nikoli prišel.
It was nice to see.	Lepo je bilo videti.
That was the only time we saw him.	To je bil edini čas, ko smo ga videli.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
All of this was better than nothing.	Vse to je bilo bolje kot nič.
I was a man.	bil sem človek.
He was my friend.	Bil je moj prijatelj.
I really am.	res sem.
Let me see again.	Naj še enkrat vidim.
If we're lucky, he'll help us.	Če bomo imeli srečo, nam bo pomagal.
I heard you say something.	Slišal sem, da si nekaj rekel.
All this here.	Vse to tukaj.
You won’t see many of them now.	Zdaj jih ne boste videli veliko.
This is clearly not the case here.	Tukaj očitno ni tako.
But she didn't do as he told her.	Vendar ni storila, kar ji je rekel.
from	iz
I had to do something about him.	Moral sem nekaj storiti glede njega.
I failed.	Ni mi uspelo.
These are not the only ones.	To pa niso edini.
He failed to do so.	To mu ni uspelo.
Maybe now we could just .	Mogoče bi lahko zdaj le .
I had to see you.	Moral sem te videti.
He should be here very soon.	Zelo kmalu bi moral biti tukaj.
Maybe you're right.	Mogoče pa imaš prav.
That's what I told him.	Tako sem mu rekel.
And now, my child.	In zdaj, moj otrok.
He knew that.	To je vedel.
And that's fine.	In to je v redu.
I knew it then.	Takrat sem to vedel.
And it wouldn't be easy.	In ne bi bilo lahko.
He was there.	Bil je tam.
Now we just have to go and do it.	Zdaj moramo samo iti in to narediti.
That was nice to see.	To je bilo lepo videti.
My father never told me that.	Oče mi tega ni nikoli povedal.
he said.	rekel je.
We never know what will happen.	Nikoli ne vemo, kaj se bo zgodilo.
This is not a game.	To ni igra.
So that someone can sit here.	Da bi lahko nekdo sedel tukaj.
You are alone now.	Zdaj ste sami.
I just wanted to be a kid.	Hotel sem biti samo otrok.
I didn't like that at all.	To mi sploh ni bilo všeč.
Not my father.	Ne moj oče.
He knew that for sure.	To je zagotovo vedel.
They were here, now they are gone.	Bili so tukaj, zdaj jih ni več.
He obviously has his thing.	Očitno ima svojo stvar.
The more people talking about it, the better.	Več ljudi kot govori o tem, bolje je.
It's just better.	Samo bolje je.
That's fine for that.	Za to je v redu.
He looked tired.	Videti je bil utrujen.
That's probably a good thing.	Verjetno je to dobra stvar.
It was there for three years.	Tam je bilo tri leta.
It's not about me.	Ne gre za mene.
When you leave tonight, you will have it.	Ko boš odšel nocoj, ga boš imel.
There were a lot more people there than usual.	Tam je bilo veliko več ljudi kot običajno.
Maybe I am.	Mogoče sem.
That's not a.	To ni a.
I can't talk about it.	Ne morem govoriti o tem.
I would know what was going on.	Vedel bi, kaj se dogaja.
I thought you said you wanted to help.	Mislil sem, da si rekel, da želiš pomagati.
And yet there is nothing.	Pa vendar ni nič.
I haven't seen him since.	Od takrat ga nisem več videl.
You love the book forever.	Knjigo imaš rad za vedno.
He is with us.	On je z nami.
You're such a good boy.	Tako dober fant si.
He's such a good guy.	On je tako dober fant.
I would never say never.	Nikoli ne bi rekel nikoli.
Which he regrets.	Za kar mu je žal.
As if he needed more than.	Kot da bi potreboval več kot.
I don't know what else to do.	ne vem kaj naj še.
I went back a little to see where he was.	Malo sem šel nazaj, da bi videl, kje je.
In fact, just like more.	Pravzaprav tako kot več.
He was very well.	Zelo dobro mu je bilo.
.	.
I don't even know who you are.	Sploh ne vem kdo si.
Sometimes I'm busy.	Včasih sem zaposlen.
We're sorry.	Žal nam je.
He simply did not eat at home.	Doma preprosto ni jedel.
I can’t believe it will really be mine.	Ne morem verjeti, da bo res moja.
That was enough.	Dovolj je bilo.
Or both.	Ali pa oba.
Is this happening to us now.	Ali se nam to zdaj dogaja.
That's how they could see them.	Tako so jih lahko tudi videli.
I helped him.	Pomagal sem mu.
He never came out.	Nikoli ni prišel ven.
You'll love them.	Všeč vam bodo.
I shouldn't be here.	Ne bi smel biti tukaj.
I never came back.	Nikoli se nisem vrnil.
They had me and they knew it.	Imeli so me in to so vedeli.
I would have time.	Imel bi čas.
I've never had one.	Nikoli ga nisem imel.
I will tell you the reason for this.	Povedal vam bom razlog za to.
How is this possible.	Kako je to mogoče.
That happened.	To se je zgodilo.
He can't help it.	Ne more pomagati.
When he returned, he told her everything.	Ko se je vrnil, ji je vse povedal.
You have a lot of money.	Imaš veliko denarja.
He promised to call me last night.	Sinoči mi je obljubil, da me bo poklical.
There is nothing to do.	Nič ni za narediti.
But she wanted more.	A želela je več.
We had a good time.	Imeli smo dobro.
She said she didn't know why.	Rekla je, da ne ve zakaj.
That was probably good, but it wasn't good.	To je bilo verjetno dobro, vendar ni bilo dobro.
That was nice of him too.	Tudi to je bilo lepo od njega.
No one will be tired.	Nihče ne bo utrujen.
That was before.	To je bilo prej.
He said absolutely nothing.	Rekel je popolnoma nič.
Who would want that after what he did.	Kdo bi si po tem, kar je storil, sploh želel.
That was not a problem.	To ni bil problem.
Keep it up!.	Kar tako naprej!.
As it used to be.	Kot je bilo nekoč.
I'm not so sure.	Nisem tako prepričan.
I don't know why that is.	Ne vem zakaj je tako.
This is it now.	To je zdaj to.
Now, today we know this is not true.	Zdaj, danes vemo, da to ni res.
It must be a	To mora biti a
Who still feels that way ?.	Kdo se še tako počuti?.
There was no one else there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar drugega.
And not just me.	In ne samo jaz.
He doesn't know wrong.	Ne ve narobe.
He has not worked since.	Od takrat ni več delal.
It was and is there all the time.	Bilo je in je tam ves čas.
That was the question.	To je bilo vprašanje.
It could be me.	Lahko bi bil jaz.
If so, why didn't he say so?	Če je tako, zakaj ni tako rekel?
You're coming, aren't you?	Saj boš prišel, kajne?
Money, money, money!	Denar, denar, denar!
He can't help himself.	Ne more si pomagati.
However, none of this happened.	Vendar se ni zgodilo nič od tega.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
It helps with everything.	Pomaga pri vsem.
Tell me, you'll feel better.	Povej mi, počutil se boš bolje.
This is not true.	To ni res.
You made it.	Ti si ga naredil.
It wasn’t that hard for someone like him.	Za nekoga, kot je on, ni bilo tako težko.
He is my child.	On je moj otrok.
I need both.	Potrebujem oba.
And we will succeed.	In uspelo nam bo.
I had to know who did it.	Moral sem vedeti, kdo je to storil.
And he will know where.	In vedel bo kje.
I just don't understand.	Samo ne razumem.
That was more than wrong.	To je bilo več kot ne v redu.
He knew it was time to go.	Vedel je, da je čas, da gre.
I'm not ready.	Nisem pripravljen.
She knew nothing.	Nič ni vedela.
It still is.	Še vedno je.
I don't know what this is for.	Ne vem za kaj je to.
We have you.	Imamo te.
He didn't expect them.	Ni jih pričakoval.
All that.	Vse to.
My car is fine.	Moj avto je v redu.
I did more.	Naredil sem več.
I heard about it this morning.	Danes zjutraj sem slišal za to.
And you.	In ti.
And not now.	In ne zdaj.
I’m sure you’re no longer without help.	Prepričan sem, da vam ni več brez pomoči.
Perhaps that was true.	Morda je bilo to res.
She knew that now.	Zdaj je to vedela.
That seems very true to me.	To se mi zdi zelo res.
You don’t have to do anything else.	Nič več vam ni treba storiti.
He said so himself.	Tako je rekel sam.
This is nothing.	To ni nič.
He was just too good.	Preprosto je bil preveč dober.
You would know.	Ti bi vedel.
No, that's something else.	Ne, to je nekaj drugega.
And that may be true.	In to je morda res.
It was hard.	Bilo je težko.
It felt very good to me.	Zdelo se mi je zelo dobro.
We still have to do that.	To moramo še narediti.
I mean, not really.	Mislim, ne res.
I hope this helps !.	Upam, da to pomaga!.
You are nobody.	Niste nihče.
I didn't say much.	Nisem rekel veliko.
That was hard.	To je bilo težko.
Obviously not.	Očitno ne.
Like none of us know.	Kot nihče od nas ne ve.
You weren't ready for that.	Nisi bil pripravljen na to.
I don’t really like doing that.	Pravzaprav tega ne maram početi.
It just wasn’t possible.	Preprosto ni bilo mogoče.
It could be better.	Je lahko bolje.
He will want someone there to help him.	Želel bo, da mu nekdo tam pomaga.
I don’t think it would be that hard.	Mislim, da ne bi bilo tako težko.
It will look obvious.	Videti bo očitno.
He really wanted this job.	Res si je želel to službo.
However, he was busy.	Vendar je bil zaposlen.
I don't know what to think.	Ne vem, kaj naj si mislim.
Without anything to be seen until then.	Ne da bi bilo do takrat še kaj videti.
I don't have time for everything.	Nimam časa za vse.
Where could I go?	Kam bi lahko šla?
That was my problem.	To je bil moj problem.
Nothing is known for sure.	Nič se zagotovo ne ve.
I can't go out like that.	Ne morem tako ven.
This may not be true.	To morda ni res.
You will only die with me.	Umrl boš samo z mano.
It probably has to be.	Verjetno tako mora biti.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žal.
And completely surprised to be here.	In popolnoma presenečen, da sem tukaj.
Never before.	Nikoli prej.
That didn't happen either.	Tudi to se ni zgodilo.
And that may still be the case.	In to je morda še vedno tako.
The man made a decision.	Človek se je odločil.
If only that were true.	Ko bi le bilo to res.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Nisem prepričan, kako to storiti.
They saw it too.	Videli so tudi.
I really liked the person.	Oseba mi je bila res všeč.
I see more in this than you.	V tem vidim več kot ti.
We need to do this now.	To moramo storiti zdaj.
It can be done.	To se lahko naredi.
He had this thing forever.	To stvar je imel za vedno.
Which you probably would.	Kar verjetno bi.
Very very good.	Zelo zelo dobro.
We had nothing to do with it.	Nismo imeli nič s tem.
There's a lot of them.	Veliko jih je.
We don't know yet.	Ne vemo še.
That you are not a good person.	Da nisi dobra oseba.
Where?' 	Kje?'
You're so tired.	Tako si utrujen.
And you haven't seen him in years.	In nisi ga videl že leta.
It could be better.	Lahko bi bilo bolje.
There were many of them.	Veliko jih je bilo.
We know she will go.	Vemo, da bo šla.
Not these days.	Te dni ne.
I want to go to that room.	Želim iti v tisto sobo.
You just want something more.	Samo želite nekaj več.
No one can do everything.	Nihče ne more narediti vsega.
I lost everything because of that.	Zaradi tega sem izgubil vse.
So very simple.	Tako zelo preprosto.
Why not, he said.	Zakaj pa ne, je rekel.
Instead, he worked on it.	Namesto tega je delal na tem.
There is something there now.	Tam zdaj nekaj obstaja.
They are gone.	Ni jih več.
He said they would.	Rekel je, da bodo.
That was fine.	To je bilo v redu.
But I’m not sure if that’s the reason.	Nisem pa prepričan, če je to razlog.
You will have plenty of time.	Imeli boste veliko časa.
I would never forget him.	Nikoli ga ne bi pozabil.
Maybe he was just waiting for someone.	Mogoče je samo čakal na nekoga.
And you think.	In misliš.
I will give them now.	Zdaj jih bom dal.
Do it now!	Naredi to zdaj!
I really don't want to.	res nočem.
What did you do? 	Kaj si naredil?
he asked.	je vprašal.
Or me about it.	Ali pa jaz glede tega.
He can't believe it's me.	Ne more verjeti, da sem to jaz.
I didn't get everything.	Nisem dobil vsega.
Not fast enough.	Ne dovolj hitro.
However, this was only once.	Vendar je bilo to samo enkrat.
I was ready for the party.	Bil sem pripravljen na zabavo.
And so do we.	In mi tudi.
And you better.	In ti bolje.
It's so obvious.	Toliko je očitno.
You might not.	Morda ne boste.
That's how everyone had it.	Tako so imeli vsi.
I have to be good.	Moram biti dober.
I knew how much you wanted something like that.	Vedel sem, kako zelo si želiš nekaj takega.
It just happened to her.	Pravkar se ji je zgodilo.
It's already here, always.	Tukaj je že, vedno.
That's none of my business.	To ni moja stvar.
No one was home.	Nikogar ni bilo doma.
I wish I could meet her.	Želim si, da bi jo spoznal.
I don't have time anymore.	Nimam več časa.
We'll see.	Bomo videli.
I told him my thoughts.	Povedal sem mu svoje misli.
You lost me.	Izgubil si me.
That would be .	To bi bilo .
He wants to do something else.	Želi delati nekaj drugega.
It's hard to get to him.	Težko je priti do njega.
I don't want to go back.	nočem nazaj.
It can't be anything else.	Ne more biti nič drugega.
You don't have to work for it.	Ni vam treba delati za to.
I'm not afraid of you.	ne bojim se te.
And so it happened.	In tako se je zgodilo.
It has to be done.	To je treba narediti.
Maybe it was nothing.	Mogoče ni bilo nič.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
From	Iz
This can be done, but it is not easy.	To se da narediti, vendar ni lahko.
Everything was above him.	Vse je bilo nad njim.
It still wasn't enough.	Še vedno ni bilo dovolj.
He knows that too.	Tudi on to ve.
Good job with that.	Dobro delo s tem.
I just wanted to know where he was.	Hotel sem samo vedeti, kje je.
No one would tell me anything.	Nihče mi ne bi ničesar povedal.
Life is as good as it can be.	Življenje je tako dobro, kot je lahko.
I'll leave you the car.	Pustil ti bom avto.
I'm not okay.	Nisem v redu.
It's really nice.	Res je lepo.
You were too.	Tudi ti si bil.
No, definitely not today.	Ne, danes zagotovo ne.
It can't be, he told himself.	Ne more biti, si je rekel.
And it's not good to see.	In to ni dobro videti.
You will too.	Tudi ti boš.
I didn't want to go any further.	Nisem hotel več naprej.
I think something is wrong.	Mislim, da je nekaj narobe.
That just can’t be right.	To preprosto ne more biti prav.
You want to get to this sooner.	Želiš priti do tega prej.
And you could.	In lahko bi.
Nothing else.	Nič drugega.
And there's nothing wrong with that.	In s tem ni nič narobe.
I am not sure.	Nisem prepričan.
I called right away.	Takoj sem poklical.
However, it may not.	Vendar pa morda ne.
How many more are there?.	Koliko jih je še?.
He wanted it.	Želel je to.
That was my problem.	To je bil moj problem.
I know these people.	Poznam te ljudi.
Someone would come.	Nekdo bi prišel.
so we will do.	tako bomo storili.
It certainly was.	Zagotovo je bilo tako.
And you too.	In ti tudi.
I can't help myself.	Ne morem si pomagati.
Pretty simple, really, it just has to be done.	Precej preprosto, res, samo narediti se je treba.
Man must eat to live.	Človek mora jesti, da živi.
I hope you had a nice time.	Upam, da ste se imeli lepo.
So much has happened since then.	Toliko se je zgodilo od takrat.
This was usually difficult.	To je bilo običajno težko.
I'm sorry it had to be you.	Žal mi je, da si moral biti ti.
It eats you.	Poje te.
He was obviously angry.	Očitno je bil jezen.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​ni bilo v redu.
You were there for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa si bil tam.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
You know that.	Ti to veš.
I would do anything for you.	Vse bi naredil zate.
Probably a good thing.	Verjetno dobra stvar.
And you could.	In lahko bi.
Everyone has it.	Vsak ima to.
This was often not easy to do.	To pogosto ni bilo lahko storiti.
You should be angry.	Moral bi biti jezen.
It is very.	Zelo je.
It has to be you.	Moraš biti ti.
Because there is nothing.	Ker ni ničesar.
You're right.	Prav imaš.
And they didn't.	In niso.
So, how are you.	In kako si.
It can be really hard.	Lahko je res težko.
That's how he said it.	Na ta način je rekel.
I needed more money.	Potreboval sem več denarja.
This is not true!	To ni res!
I really don't see that.	Tega res ne vidim.
I really want to see her.	Res jo želim videti.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
Now very much.	Zdaj pa zelo.
He said nothing more than that.	Nič več od tega ni rekel.
It's very nice to see you.	Zelo lepo vas je videti.
I know better.	Vem bolje.
That's how it's supposed to be.	Tako naj bi bilo.
Now he doesn't even want it.	Zdaj si tega sploh ne želi.
Something is wrong here.	Tukaj nekaj ni v redu.
You had.	Imel si.
He's not here tomorrow.	Tukaj ni jutri.
That's what I told you.	Tako sem ti rekel.
Very not good.	Zelo ne dobro.
You know you want to!.	Veš, da si želiš!.
Did something happen?	Se je kaj zgodilo?
You've probably been here before.	Verjetno ste že bili tukaj.
Not yet.	Pa še ne.
Do a good job.	Naredi dobro delo.
He didn't know where.	Ni vedel kje.
Too much here.	Preveč tukaj.
He will lose.	Izgubil bo.
And they did.	In so to storili.
I probably would.	Verjetno bi.
That's what he said.	Tako je rekel.
I would expect that.	To bi pričakoval.
I'm okay.	V redu sem.
It cannot be said for sure.	Ni mogoče zagotovo povedati.
Does not exist.	Ne obstaja.
He heard quite angry.	Slišal je precej jezen.
And none of it was true.	In nič od tega ni bilo res.
You know you have.	Veš, da imaš.
He is my friend.	On je moj prijatelj.
It's not about that.	Ne gre za to.
He probably wouldn't like it.	Verjetno mu ne bi bilo všeč.
He had to do something.	Nekaj ​​je moral narediti.
It still didn't work.	Še vedno ni uspelo.
I didn't want to see that at all.	Sploh tega nisem hotel videti.
Nothing has happened since then.	Od takrat se ni zgodilo nič.
But it is very unlikely.	Je pa zelo malo verjetno.
I was glad to see her.	Bil sem vesel, da sem jo videl.
I certainly won’t tell him how to play.	Zagotovo mu ne bom govoril, kako naj igra.
I loved this game.	Všeč mi je bila ta igra.
I'm sure you'll like this one.	Prepričan sem, da vam bo ta všeč.
As if that's not the case anymore.	Kot da tega ni več.
We did that.	To smo storili.
I needed you.	Potreboval sem te.
However, it did not seem so serious.	Vendar se ni zdelo tako resno.
I don't know what he's doing.	Ne vem, kaj počne.
Who knows where he will be next week.	Kdo ve kje bo naslednji teden.
There was nothing.	Nič ni bilo.
Someone had to help her.	Nekdo ji je moral pomagati.
All of this was probably true.	Vse to je bilo verjetno res.
It happened very quickly.	Zgodilo se je zelo hitro.
Or father.	Ali pa oče.
I just learned how to do it.	Pravkar sem se naučil, kako to narediti.
But not yet.	Vendar še ne.
That was all he said.	To je bilo vse, kar je rekel.
He couldn't see, but he didn't have to.	Ni je mogel videti, a mu ni bilo treba.
If only we could see her now.	Če bi jo zdaj lahko videli.
It doesn't seem like it.	Ne zdi se tako.
Do it for us, you know.	Naredi za nas, veš.
I felt really good.	Počutil sem se res dobro.
Let it be so.	Naj bo tako.
It's simple.	To je preprosto.
I will go.	bom šel.
It is much more than that.	Je veliko več kot to.
Now they were here.	Zdaj so bili tukaj.
I couldn't leave, not now.	Nisem mogel oditi, ne zdaj.
В.	V.
But it was so hard for him.	Vendar mu je bilo tako težko.
But no.	Vendar ne.
Maybe too much time.	Morda pa preveč časa.
I'm sorry.	Žal mi je.
We'll see how it goes tomorrow.	Bomo videli, kako bo jutri.
I'll be out soon.	Kmalu bom ven.
She thought it was good.	Dobro se ji je zdelo.
I have to go back.	Moram iti nazaj.
That we could see.	Da smo lahko videli.
You may or may not need to do this.	Morda vam bo to treba storiti ali pa ne.
It must.	Mora.
There is so much to be said and done quickly.	Toliko je treba povedati in to hitro.
I am also friends with quite a few.	Tudi sam sem prijatelj s kar nekaj.
I'll know right away.	Vedel bom takoj.
I didn't want to.	Nisem hotel.
And maybe they are nothing to you.	In morda za vas niso nič.
I don’t even know if it was a game.	Sploh ne vem, če je bila to igra.
It's not easy.	Ni lahko.
Maybe he didn’t know what it was.	Morda ni vedel, kaj je to.
There and not there.	Tam in ne tam.
Your time has come.	Tvoj čas je prišel.
That may have been difficult.	To je bilo morda težko.
I'll buy you another one.	Kupil ti bom drugega.
He's really good.	Res je dober.
And he needs something to do.	In potrebuje nekaj za početi.
You had to be ready for anything.	Moral si biti pripravljen na vse.
They had.	So imeli.
It was not good for her to be alone.	Ni ji bilo dobro biti sama.
That's why we're here.	Zato smo tukaj.
No one knows what will happen.	Nihče ne ve, kaj se bo zgodilo.
No, to be.	Ne, za biti.
Or not you now.	Ali pa ne ti zdaj.
Let's all be together.	Naj bomo vsi skupaj.
In fact, she said so.	Pravzaprav je tako rekla.
He says no one has even asked if he needs help.	Pravi, da je nihče niti vprašal, ali potrebuje pomoč.
Let him come.	Naj pride.
Everything was fine.	Vse je bilo v redu.
I wouldn't do anything like that.	Ne bi naredil nič takega.
I'll tell you about it.	Povedal vam bom o tem.
I learned something.	Nekaj ​​sem se naučil.
You know where you want to go.	Veste, kam želite iti.
I mean seriously.	mislim resno.
We will definitely have you.	Te bomo zagotovo imeli.
I expected so much.	Toliko sem pričakoval.
Seen before.	Videli že prej.
How many there are.	Koliko ima.
In fact, it was really simple.	Pravzaprav je bilo res preprosto.
He said we would not do that.	Rekel je, da tega ne bomo storili.
I’ve done this for a lot of people.	To sem naredil za veliko ljudi.
I mean, it's yours, he said.	Mislim, tvoj je, je rekel.
I asked him what was going on.	Vprašal sem ga, kaj se dogaja.
You should see me soon.	Kmalu bi me moral videti.
It's the same here.	Tudi tukaj je tako.
They never will.	Nikoli ne bodo.
He did his job well.	Svoje delo je dobro opravil.
He didn’t know how he knew that.	Ni vedel, kako je to vedel.
She didn't have to know why.	Ni ji bilo treba vedeti zakaj.
It doesn’t go out too much.	Ne gre preveč ven.
I had to do it right.	Moral sem narediti prav.
He shouldn't have to do that.	Tega mu ne bi bilo treba storiti.
Now we have to go.	Zdaj moramo iti.
It's not just about me.	Ne gre samo za mene.
This is actually very nice.	To je pravzaprav zelo lepo.
You will die.	Umrl boš.
Not next day and not next week.	Ne naslednji dan in ne naslednji teden.
You saw it.	Videli ste.
I can't be the only person here.	Ne morem biti edina oseba tukaj.
Oh no, oh no, oh no.	O ne, o ne, o ne.
There were many of them.	Veliko jih je bilo.
I am.	jaz sem.
If so, fine.	Če je, v redu.
This looks a bit more likely than before.	To je videti nekoliko bolj verjetno kot prej.
That's good for you.	To je dobro zate.
Now I am convinced of that.	Zdaj sem prepričan v to.
If you haven't, you still shouldn't.	Če niste, še vedno ne bi smeli.
He needed her to leave.	Potreboval jo je oditi.
Now my question.	Zdaj pa moje vprašanje.
Do you want it now?	Ali ga želite zdaj?
But I could find her again.	Lahko pa bi jo spet našel.
No, that was not true.	Ne, to ni bilo res.
Almost none of this happened.	Skoraj nič od tega se ni zgodilo.
He was a very busy man.	Bil je zelo zaposlen človek.
And she didn't make it.	In tega ji ni uspelo.
He told me not to go.	Rekel mi je, naj ne grem.
It was not easy.	To ni bilo lahko.
He would do it if he could.	On bi to storil, če bi lahko.
Not for anyone.	Ne za nikogar.
It’s just like something you would do.	To je tako kot nekaj, kar bi naredili.
It's not that hard.	Ni tako težko.
She said nothing.	Nič ni rekla.
He, too, apparently.	Tudi on očitno.
That is supposed to be.	To naj bi bilo.
He did a lot of that.	To je veliko počel.
Which was a very long time.	Kar je bilo zelo dolgo.
But it wasn't like that.	Vendar ni bilo tako.
If only I didn't want her so badly.	Ko bi je le ne želel tako zelo.
He knows who he is.	On ve, kdo je.
Don't talk to me like that.	Ne govori tako z mano.
He was convinced.	Bil je prepričan.
I would like to	rad bi
That he has them for his own.	Da jih ima za svoje.
A lot of that.	Veliko tega.
A few things to do.	Nekaj ​​stvari za početi.
It's okay now.	Zdaj je v redu.
Not for nothing.	Ni za nič.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
Maybe it's better.	Mogoče je bolje.
Next to me.	Ob meni.
He was here once and only once.	Enkrat in samo enkrat je bil tukaj.
It wasn't long.	Ni bilo dolgo.
Maybe not.	Morda ne.
He was already there.	Bil je že tam.
It was simple.	To je bilo preprosto.
How right they were.	Kako prav so imeli.
He knows that too.	Ve tudi to.
It might be more than that.	Morda je več kot to.
Nobody asked us to.	Nihče nas tega ni prosil.
I didn't mean to tell you.	Nisem ti hotel povedati.
The only question is when.	Samo vprašanje je kdaj.
It must be true.	Mora biti res.
Certainly never.	Zagotovo nikoli nisem.
I already knew that too.	Tudi to sem že vedel.
You will not succeed the first time.	Prvič vam ne bo uspelo.
That's why we did it for you.	Zato smo to storili za vas.
I can't talk about it, ever.	Ne morem govoriti o tem, nikoli.
Is there anyone who can, please?	Je kdo, ki lahko, prosim?
He's right again.	Spet ima prav.
He never called her back when she wanted to.	Nikoli je ni poklical nazaj, ko je želela.
I tried to convince you all.	Poskušal sem vas vse prepričati.
, in.	, in.
Just do it.	Samo naredi.
I never learned that.	Nikoli se tega nisem naučil.
We can have that.	To lahko imamo.
We have that.	To imamo.
I don’t think they knew what to do with me.	Mislim, da niso vedeli, kaj bi z mano.
He's so good.	Tako dober je.
He preferred to hear than to see.	Raje je slišal kot videl.
We are in this.	Mi smo v tem.
I want you ready for tomorrow.	Želim, da si pripravljen na jutri.
This is my whole life.	To je vse moje življenje.
In a little while.	Za malo.
And it was really hard.	In bilo je res težko.
At the moment, we can't even do that.	Trenutno niti s tem ne moremo.
It was just.	Bilo je samo.
I said that before.	To sem rekel prej.
Not for you.	Niti zate.
Out, out, out.	Ven, ven, ven.
Imam was ready to help us.	Imam nam je bil pripravljen pomagati.
Illberightback.	Takoj bom nazaj.
He didn't die.	Ni umrl.
Maybe he'll see them soon.	Mogoče jih bo kmalu videl.
The only thing was he didn't want to leave.	Edina stvar je bila, da ni hotel oditi.
That it's wrong.	Da je narobe.
When we have more, it is never enough.	Ko imamo več, ni nikoli dovolj.
He was almost there.	Bil je skoraj tam.
I don't like that.	to mi ni všeč.
I'll do this in the morning.	To bom naredil zjutraj.
No one came out.	Nihče ni prišel ven.
How can one be sure of that?	Kako je lahko človek prepričan v to?
I'm sure of it.	Prepričan sem o tem.
I felt good.	Počutil sem se dobro.
I don't know where.	ne vem kje.
I decided not to.	Odločil sem se, da ne.
Who did this?	Kdo je to naredil?
I was nothing and nobody.	Bil sem nič in nihče.
I learned a lot because of that.	Zaradi tega sem se veliko naučil.
We should talk.	Morali bi govoriti.
This is not the time.	Ni pravi čas.
I'm sorry for you.	Žal mi je za vas.
Something is going on, but we don’t know what.	Nekaj ​​se dogaja, pa ne vemo kaj.
No one ever knew why this happened.	Nihče ni nikoli vedel, zakaj se je to zgodilo.
So much was right.	Toliko je bilo prav.
I never knew why.	Nikoli nisem vedel zakaj.
It had to be done.	To je bilo treba storiti.
I am very sorry.	Zelo mi je žal.
I don't like to talk.	Ne maram govoriti.
He wanted to do it, but he wanted to be sure.	Želel je to storiti, vendar je hotel biti prepričan.
A lot of work, a lot of time.	Veliko dela, veliko časa.
It would never happen.	Nikoli se ne bi zgodilo.
It was him.	Bila je on.
Not really, no.	Ne res, ne.
I mean, here.	Mislim, tukaj.
He didn't have time before, but now he would.	Prej ni imel časa, zdaj pa bi.
You don't have to see anything.	Nič ni treba videti.
I can't tell you how it was.	Ne morem povedati, kako je bilo.
She said it herself.	Sama je to rekla.
If there is nothing, there is nothing.	Če ni nič, ni nič.
I got my chance.	Dobil sem svojo priložnost.
I never succeeded.	Nikoli mi ni uspelo.
I don't understand why he's here.	Ne razumem, zakaj je tukaj.
She didn't know what to do.	Ni vedela, kaj naj naredi.
I don't want more from you.	Nočem več od tebe.
He needs to be told he's there.	Treba mu je povedati, da je tam.
I just have to tell you.	Samo povedati ti moram.
That seems good to me.	To se mi zdi dobro.
I'll find something else.	Bom našel kaj drugega.
I don't believe it is.	Ne verjamem, da je.
Okay, you're the one.	V redu, ti si pravi.
You are lucky.	Imaš srečo.
It still exists.	Še vedno obstaja.
And he didn't even know it.	In tega sploh ni vedel.
Let it work for everyone.	Naj dela za vse.
Almost everyone.	Skoraj vsi.
Didn't you forget something?	Ali nisi kaj pozabil?
I didn't want to.	Nisem hotel.
What would you say ?.	Kaj bi rekel?.
I understand you're not ready to talk yet.	Razumem, da še nisi pripravljen govoriti.
It was never nice.	Nikoli ni bilo lepo.
Because we'll all be here anyway.	Ker bomo tako ali tako vsi tukaj.
Nothing was a problem.	Nič ni bilo problem.
We like these.	Te so nam všeč.
It was so nice to see her last night.	Tako lepo jo je bilo videti sinoči.
She didn't have to talk, nor did she.	Ni ji bilo treba govoriti, ne meni tudi.
He knows me now.	Zdaj me pozna.
He can't do that.	Tega ne more storiti.
I heard.	slišal sem.
I have to tell you.	Moram ti povedati.
Just who you are.	Samo kdo si.
She said she hopes to feel better soon.	Rekla je, da upa, da se bo kmalu počutil bolje.
is that you? 	si to ti?
It's a little good.	Malo je dobro.
The one you have right now.	Tisti, ki ga imaš trenutno.
We have to do so much together.	Skupaj moramo narediti toliko.
We saw each other.	Videli smo se.
He's been here ever since.	Od takrat je tukaj.
I'm so tired of it.	Tako sem utrujen od tega.
Now she went and did it.	Zdaj je šla in to storila.
Obviously not.	Očitno ne.
There was no need to talk to him yet.	Z njim še ni bilo treba govoriti.
We had our chance.	Imeli smo svojo priložnost.
I wouldn’t expect to know if he did something wrong.	Ne bi pričakoval, da bom vedel, če je naredil narobe.
He didn't want to see that.	Tega ni hotel videti.
And because of that, she wanted more.	In zaradi tega je želela več.
I decided to play it.	Odločil sem se, da ga bom igral.
Certainly not to me.	Do mene zagotovo ne.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
I really don't know.	res ne vem.
That's what my father taught me.	To me je naučil oče.
She wanted to leave.	Želela si je oditi.
I know what I see.	Vem, kaj vidim.
You will meet more people.	Spoznal boš več ljudi.
It wasn't that long ago.	Ni bilo tako dolgo nazaj.
That's what makes it what it is.	Zaradi tega je to, kar je.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
When it's not, it's not.	Ko tega ni, tega ni.
Tell me that.	Povej mi to.
Not here.	Ne tukaj.
You're nothing to me.	Nisi mi nič.
In fact, there was no one.	Pravzaprav ni bilo nikogar.
Maybe we should see that, but we didn’t.	Mogoče bi morali to videti, a nismo.
That’s actually what happened.	To se je pravzaprav zgodilo.
It wasn't much.	Ni bilo veliko.
I never asked.	nikoli nisem vprašal.
That's all about what happened the other day.	To je vse o tem, kar se je zgodilo prejšnji dan.
I mean it.	mislim to.
I want to say.	Želim povedati.
Nothing comes out.	Nič ne pride ven.
I needed you there.	Potreboval sem te tam.
To do this after is.	Če želite to narediti po je.
We did it once and that was enough.	Enkrat smo to naredili in to je bilo dovolj.
Nice to see you again.	Lepo te je spet videti.
But you will.	Vendar boš.
Maybe it's not true.	Mogoče pa ni res.
What would someone who has never been there think?	Kaj bi si mislil nekdo, ki še nikoli ni bil tam?
He just thought it was.	Samo mislil je, da je.
And the man left.	In človek je odšel.
It definitely happened to me.	Zagotovo se mi je zgodilo.
I would always stay there as a hotel.	Vedno bi ostal tam kot hotel.
Not like him.	Ne kot on.
He can really play.	Res zna igrati.
That's what they were for.	Za to so bili.
I know so much.	Toliko vem.
He knew what needed to be done.	Vedel je, kaj je treba storiti.
And tomorrow.	In jutri.
He didn't let her.	Ni ji dovolil.
I started it today.	Danes sem začel s tem.
No one could have told you that at the time.	Tega vam takrat nihče ne bi mogel povedati.
Don't you think we should go?	Se ti ne zdi, da bi morali iti?
No matter what.	Ne glede na vse.
He had three children.	Imel je tri otroke.
Not so.	Ne tako.
I think maybe more than that.	Mislim, da je morda več od tega.
I'm not your father.	nisem tvoj oče.
I thought it was you.	Mislil sem, da si ti.
They are now.	Zdaj so.
He still was.	Še vedno je bil.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
I'm sorry about that.	Žal mi je za to.
I think it's the way it should be done.	Mislim, da je tako, kot je treba narediti.
I didn't really like it.	Ni mi bilo zelo všeč.
And, in fact, for some time.	In pravzaprav že nekaj časa.
He speaks instead.	Namesto tega govori.
Life goes on .	Življenje gre naprej .
I left alone.	Odšel sem sam.
They had to believe me.	Morali so mi verjeti.
It was as if there was no work for him.	Bilo je, kot da dela njega ni bilo.
Where do you think I could be a child?	Kje mislite, da bi lahko bil otrok?
I was a boy, I couldn't do that.	Bil sem fant, tega nisem mogel.
He wasn't himself.	Ni bil on sam.
And he didn't go to his room.	In ni šel v svojo sobo.
And it was right.	In bilo je prav.
I wouldn't go with that anymore.	Ne bi šla več s tem.
I will not meet them again.	Ne bom jih več srečal.
She followed him.	Šla je za njim.
We are together all day.	Ves dan sva skupaj.
But even that wasn't enough.	A niti to ni bilo dovolj.
And you are absolutely right.	In imaš popolnoma prav.
Don't tell anyone about us.	Nikomur ne povej o nas.
And we had a great time.	In imeli smo se lepo.
He preferred her.	Raje mu je bila všeč.
Something else is going on here.	Tukaj se dogaja nekaj drugega.
It would be just for.	Bilo bi samo za.
He is no longer alive.	Ne živi več.
I don't care.	Mene to ne zanima.
I was expecting	Pričakoval sem
Go ahead.	Takoj naprej.
Behind him, above him.	Za njim, nad njim.
Not many.	Ni jih veliko.
Not forever.	Ni za vedno.
.	.
He got the money himself.	Sam je prišel do denarja.
He knows too much.	Preveč ve.
He sat alone at the party.	Na zabavi je sedel sam.
The timing just wasn't right.	Samo čas ni bil pravi.
I hope this helps.	Upam, da to pomaga.
That's the only problem.	Samo v tem je problem.
He was there.	Bil je tam.
I'm too busy to go.	Preveč sem zaposlen, da bi šel.
I'm here for you too.	Tukaj sem tudi zate.
To be or not to be.	Biti ali ne biti.
This is not my life.	To ni moje življenje.
Here we are.	Tukaj smo.
But he did.	Vendar je to storil.
He needs to know.	Mora vedeti.
He wouldn't make it.	Ne bi mu uspelo.
I just wanted to make sure he was there.	Hotel sem se samo prepričati, da je tam.
Who knows why.	Kdo ve zakaj.
He didn't know when enough was enough.	Ni vedel, kdaj je dovolj.
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni.
He didn't know what else to do.	Ni vedel, kaj naj še naredi.
She knew it was true.	Vedela je, da je res.
We were there for a long time.	Tam smo bili dolgo časa.
If you want to stay here, good and good.	Če želite ostati tukaj, dobro in dobro.
I am tired.	Utrujen sem.
He's still here.	Še vedno je tukaj.
In fact, we should go for it.	Pravzaprav bi morali iti k temu.
I never thought he would do something like that.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da bo naredil kaj takega.
I don't believe that anymore.	tega ne verjamem več.
I didn’t even know he was still there.	Sploh nisem vedel, da je še vedno tam.
Everything happened very quickly.	Vse se je zgodilo zelo hitro.
There is nothing else.	Nič drugega ni.
I thought you might know.	Mislil sem, da morda veš.
However, she did so and he allowed her.	Vendar je to storila in on ji je dovolil.
He didn't find anyone.	Nikogar ni našel.
He was absolutely right about that.	To je imel popolnoma prav.
And you know that too.	In tudi ti to veš.
We did very little.	Naredili smo zelo malo.
And you are on.	In ti si na.
He saw us, he saw something.	Videl nas je, nekaj videl.
But it worked once.	Vendar je enkrat uspelo.
But he could tell she didn't feel alone.	Lahko pa je rekel, da se ne počuti sama.
I am not sure.	Nisem prepričan.
That's what I said.	To sem rekel.
I need to know that he really always loved me.	Vedeti moram, da me je res vedno imel rad.
That could be a lot.	To bi lahko bilo veliko.
Just the way he wanted.	Tako kot je želel.
I thought we were.	Mislil sem, da smo.
Nobody goes there.	Nihče ne gre tja.
This is much earlier than usual.	To je veliko prej kot običajno.
Nothing happened last week.	Prejšnji teden se ni zgodilo nič.
Life has not been easy for me.	Življenje mi ni bilo lahko.
There is no one there.	Tam ni nikogar.
She knew how it felt.	Vedela je, kako se to počuti.
Maybe there is.	Mogoče obstaja.
And he thought that was exactly what he wanted.	In mislil je, da je prav to želel.
I do not.	Jaz ne.
I will never tell anyone.	Nikoli ne bom nikomur povedal.
Tell me what you think of the room!	Povej mi, kaj misliš o sobi!
Just, here you are.	Samo, tukaj si.
Everyone knew.	Vsi so vedeli.
I could say it isn't.	Lahko bi rekel, da ni.
She wasn't much help.	Ni bila v veliko pomoč.
I'm not too sure about that and.	O tem nisem preveč prepričan in.
We know that for sure now.	To zdaj zagotovo vemo.
But it just wasn't.	A preprosto ni bilo.
And now you.	In zdaj ti.
They had him.	Imeli so ga.
Tell me more about this place.	Povej mi več o tem mestu.
Sam never had it.	Sam ga nikoli ni imel.
Almost what happened to me.	Skoraj to, kar se mi je zgodilo.
That's what she told him.	To mu je rekla.
We didn't do anything wrong.	Nismo naredili nič narobe.
He always felt good.	Vedno se je počutil dobro.
It was really good.	Res je bilo dobro.
Can also.	Lahko tudi.
I don't know how I could leave.	Ne vem, kako bi lahko odšel.
That's how he does it here.	Tako to dela tukaj.
And there was nothing he could do about it.	In glede tega ni mogel storiti ničesar.
And yet we are here, she said.	In vendar smo tukaj, je rekla.
It worked.	To je uspelo.
He will leave.	Odšel bo.
And sometimes.	In včasih.
But you can.	Lahko pa.
It is also not true.	Prav tako ni res.
So very, very right.	Tako zelo, zelo prav.
I didn't see him come.	Nisem videl, da bi prišel.
My father died.	Moj oče je umrl.
This is not true.	To pa ni res.
There were quite a few.	Bilo jih je kar nekaj.
I think every day should be yours.	Mislim, da bi moral biti vsak dan tvoj.
He has his own way of doing it.	Ima svoj način za to.
I'm sorry.	Žal mi je.
Like, a lot.	Kot, veliko.
That probably won't happen.	To se verjetno ne bo zgodilo.
No, it's for you.	Ne, zate je.
And you could.	In lahko bi.
That may be fine with you.	To vam je morda v redu.
He thinks of nothing but work.	Ne misli na nič drugega kot na delo.
That's how it seems to me.	Tako se mi zdi.
I knew he was playing, but I never heard him.	Vedel sem, da je igral, a ga nikoli nisem slišal.
I hope so.	Upam, da bo.
is this possible.	je to mogoče.
He had some money.	Imel je nekaj denarja.
I'm not him.	jaz nisem on.
And you don't like the boy.	In fant ti ni všeč.
Soon my friend.	Kmalu moj prijatelj.
So much.	Toliko.
Now is not the time for that.	Zdaj ni časa za to.
It wasn't nice.	Ni bilo lepo.
You're doing well.	Dobro ti gre.
That was not the question.	To ni bilo vprašanje.
All this together.	Vse to skupaj.
He still has a lot of time.	Ima še veliko časa.
He is not interested in anything.	Nič ga ne zanima.
And we didn't.	In nismo.
He's the only guy in the room.	On je edini fant v sobi.
I never met her.	Nikoli je nisem srečal.
I haven't heard from him in a while.	Že nekaj časa ga nisem slišal.
And he would go too.	In tudi on bi šel.
We will be nothing again.	Spet ne bomo nič.
And they have been for a while.	In nekaj časa so bili.
He played well.	Dobro je igral.
There is obviously something wrong here.	Očitno je tukaj nekaj narobe.
Which is not!	Kar pa ni!
He was glad he left the job.	Vesel je bil, da je pustil službo.
It never is and never will be.	Nikoli ni in nikoli ne bo.
I just wanted to see.	Hotel sem samo videti.
And just, you know.	In samo, veš.
He thought it was something.	Mislil je, da je nekaj.
Here is what you will do.	Tukaj je tisto, kar boste storili.
But she didn't go any further.	Vendar ni šla naprej.
That's a good thing.	To je dobro delo.
I would be here again tomorrow.	Jutri bi bil spet tukaj.
I’m a good guy who finds it hard.	Sem dober fant, ki mi je težko.
And it really is pretty simple.	In res je precej preprosto.
If so, fine.	Če je tako, v redu.
That was my job.	To je bilo moje delo.
I will continue to help you there.	Tam vam bom še naprej pomagal.
I didn't know he would do that.	Nisem vedel, da bo to storil.
Everything would be better than that.	Vse bi bilo bolje od tega.
No one has done that to him yet.	Tega mu še nihče ni storil.
Which he already heard.	Kar je že slišal.
You can never tell.	Nikoli ne moreš povedati.
I didn't want to do that now.	Zdaj tega nisem hotel storiti.
We didn't know what it was.	Kaj je bilo, nismo vedeli.
I didn't like that.	Tega mi ni bilo všeč.
And it was good.	In bilo je dobro.
And there are a lot of them.	In veliko jih je.
life.	življenje.
Not much of that.	Ni veliko tega.
She is doing better now, but not all is well.	Zdaj ji gre na bolje, vendar še ni vse dobro.
I just met him.	Pravkar sem ga srečal.
A friend is absolutely right.	Prijatelj ima popolnoma prav.
I don't know who you are.	Ne vem kdo si.
There are probably many of them.	Verjetno jih je veliko.
We were right.	Imeli smo prav.
I'm not good at finding anything on my own.	Nisem dober, da bi kaj našel sam.
Currently.	Trenutno.
You're fine too.	Tudi ti si v redu.
Quite a few actually.	Pravzaprav kar nekaj.
But it may not be as difficult as it seems.	Morda pa ni tako težko, kot se zdi.
If this is a question.	Če je to vprašanje.
He got me good.	Dobro me je dobil.
You have to do what you have to do.	Moraš narediti, kar moraš.
We don’t know enough about what’s going on.	Ne vemo dovolj o tem, kaj se dogaja.
He won't tell you.	Ne bo ti povedal.
Well, it's us.	Pa nam je.
I need it fast.	Potrebujem hitro.
Maybe I started it.	Mogoče sem to jaz začel.
Nobody goes anymore.	Nihče več ne gre.
He never saw it.	Nikoli ga ni videl.
They are not.	Niso.
There is almost nothing to do.	Skoraj nič ni za narediti.
Which I could.	Kar bi lahko.
I will do it.	Bom naredil.
This is clearly not the case.	To očitno ni tako.
So good.	Tako dobro.
He was convinced of that.	V to je bil prepričan.
It's not that simple.	Ni tako preprosto.
He can't do that.	Tega ne more storiti.
I want to be on it.	Želim biti na tem.
That's what I'm asking you.	To te prosim.
Not right or wrong, really.	Ni prav ali narobe, res.
I will leave.	odšel bom.
You know they are supposed to be there for you.	Veste, da naj bi bili tam za vas.
That he needed her more.	Da jo je bolj potreboval.
Or I thought you were.	Ali pa sem mislil, da si.
I just didn't know.	Samo nisem vedel.
And he didn't.	In ni se.
I still couldn’t tell what it was about.	Še vedno nisem mogel povedati, za kaj gre.
Only now is the question about it.	Samo zdaj je vprašanje o tem.
It's not like that.	Ni tako.
I didn't want to.	Nisem hotel.
There is no one here.	Tukaj ni nikogar.
This may have been the first time.	To je bilo morda prvič.
He wants me to go out with him.	Želi, da grem ven z njim.
I have something to tell you.	Nekaj ​​ti moram povedati.
He was gone in the morning.	Zjutraj ga ni bilo.
But he succeeded.	Vendar mu je uspelo.
Only time will tell.	Samo čas bo povedal.
Really, there's nothing to it.	Res, ni nič na tem.
That's how I was from here.	Tako sem bil od tukaj.
A lot of work.	Veliko dela.
To your village.	V svojo vas.
Or she just wanted to know.	Ali je samo želela vedeti.
It's not just about money.	Ne gre samo za denar.
Unfortunately, this is no longer possible.	Žal to ni več mogoče.
Nothing before that.	Pred tem pa nič.
He didn't have much to say.	Ni imel veliko za povedati.
I was fine.	Dobro mi je bilo.
Just come.	Samo pride.
I wanted to, but I didn’t know what it was going to look like.	Želela sem, a nisem vedela, kako bo to videti.
Nobody did anything.	Nihče ni naredil ničesar.
I’ve never felt better.	Nikoli se nisem počutil bolje.
When was it.	Kdaj je bilo.
Even if the work has nothing to say.	Tudi če delo nima ničesar za povedati.
I saw it happening.	Videl sem, da se to dogaja.
Are you okay.	Ali si v redu.
And maybe there was more.	In morda je bilo še več.
so.	so.
I fully understand that.	To popolnoma razumem.
It can come or it never comes.	Lahko pride ali pa nikoli ne pride.
I felt very good about it.	Glede tega sem se počutil zelo dobro.
He had a lot of money and nothing to do.	Imel je veliko denarja in nič za početi.
I wanted to have more.	Želel sem, da bi imeli več.
I could very well stay there forever.	Zelo dobro bi lahko ostal tam za vedno.
You don’t need to know now.	Zdaj vam ni treba vedeti.
Everything just happened.	Vse se je preprosto zgodilo.
I really need them.	Zelo jih potrebujem.
Maybe really.	Mogoče res.
You almost can't believe it.	Skoraj ne moreš verjeti.
There wasn't much to it.	V tem ni bilo veliko.
He needs someone like you.	Potrebuje nekoga, kot si ti.
Nobody told me that.	Tega mi nihče ni rekel.
But it is something else.	Je pa nekaj drugega.
It can't be nice.	Ne more biti lepo.
It’s not just about you and what you want.	Ne gre samo za vas in kaj želite.
I would like to know what happened to me.	Rad bi vedel, kaj se mi je zgodilo.
I hope you succeed.	Upam, da ti bo uspelo.
I mean, it's not just me.	Mislim, nisem samo jaz.
You didn't do anything to me.	Nič mi nisi naredil.
She certainly doesn't know.	Sama zagotovo ne ve.
Let it be right.	Naj bo prav.
As you should.	Kot bi moral.
I really want him.	Zelo si ga želim.
Dad got the job.	Oče je dobil službo.
You were a friend.	Bil si prijatelj.
I needed someone.	Potreboval sem nekoga.
You can be a boy.	Lahko si fant.
He also doesn't seem to like me anymore.	Zdi se, da me tudi ne mara več.
This does not appear to be the case.	Zdi se, da temu ni tako.
He never said what he intended to do.	Nikoli ni povedal, kaj namerava narediti.
Here you have.	Tukaj imaš.
Very.	Zelo.
Never was and never will be.	Nikoli ni bil in nikoli ne bo.
I didn't leave him like that.	Nisem ga pustil tako.
That is the real reason we need to do it right.	To je pravi razlog, da moramo to narediti prav.
It's not nice.	Ni lepo.
We have to go there.	Moramo iti tja.
I liked him immediately.	Takoj mi je bil všeč.
Her father called her.	Oče jo je poklical.
You'll be fine.	V redu boš.
Not the way you think, he says.	Ne tako, kot si mislite, pravi.
He doesn't want to leave.	Noče oditi.
And is.	In je.
This is no longer the case.	To ni več tako.
You went home.	Šla si domov.
I hope you will too.	Upam, da boš tudi ti.
Never.	Nikoli.
No one will ever see them.	Nihče jih ne bo nikoli videl.
I don't know what's going on.	Ne vem kaj se dogaja.
said the teacher.	je rekel učitelj.
However, it appears that you have not done so.	Vendar se zdi, da tega niste storili.
You need to talk to him.	Moraš govoriti z njim.
And the next.	In naslednji.
Many people.	Veliko ljudi.
I hope it helps.	Upam, da pomaga.
He did it now.	To je zdaj storil.
Each in his own way.	Vsak po svoje.
I just don't know what.	Samo ne vem kaj.
He's a good guy, I'd love to have him.	Dober fant je, rad bi ga imel.
I let you stay.	Pustil sem ti ostati.
Also, you know.	Tudi, veš.
Everything happened.	Vse se je zgodilo.
I don't know about you, boy.	Ne vem zate, fant.
Not so right.	Ne tako prav.
So good in me.	Tako dobro v meni.
And you asked so nicely.	In tako lepo si vprašal.
Who would have known you had so many.	Kdo bi vedel, da jih imaš toliko.
That's not it.	To ni to.
I'm here and you're there.	Jaz sem tukaj in ti si tam.
I got that.	To sem dobil.
I do this at home.	To počnem doma.
He didn't just talk.	Ni samo govoril.
I certainly don't.	Jaz zagotovo ne.
How nice to see him.	Kako lepo ga je videti.
I thought he would be back here by now.	Mislil sem, da se bo že vrnil sem.
This, however, was no better.	To pa ni bilo nič bolje.
It seemed to me that this needed to be done.	Zdelo se mi je, da je to treba narediti.
Everything was as he left it.	Vse je bilo tako, kot je pustil.
We had nowhere to go.	Nismo imeli kam.
That's the question.	To je vprašanje.
This was my life.	To je bilo moje življenje.
I mean, that's fine.	Mislim, to je v redu.
That's the way it is now.	Tako je zdaj.
Nobody knows much about it.	Nihče ne ve veliko o tem.
You have to help me.	Moraš mi pomagati.
And no one expected him to be human.	In nihče ni pričakoval, da bo človek.
I understand now.	zdaj razumem.
You are the father.	Ti si oče.
It doesn't have to be you or me anymore.	Ni treba več biti ti ali jaz.
In fact, he may be the only one.	Pravzaprav je morda edini.
In fact, this may already be happening.	Pravzaprav se to morda že dogaja.
Just talk, you said.	Samo govori, si rekel.
He had to tell her.	Moral ji je povedati.
Moreover, there are many of them.	Še več, veliko jih je.
Maybe no one knew.	Mogoče nihče ni vedel.
He doesn't want money.	Noče denarja.
She has been alone for a very long time.	Že zelo dolgo je sama.
And no.	In ni.
He wanted to have it all.	Želel je, da ima vse.
He doesn't do any of that.	Nič od tega ne počne.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
And don't ever do that again.	In tega ne stori nikoli več.
We've never been here before.	Še nikoli nismo bili tukaj.
But he didn't hear her.	Vendar je ni slišal.
I didn't hear anything he said.	Nisem slišal ničesar, kar je rekel.
This can be a problem.	To je lahko problem.
I need that.	Potrebujem to.
This is not going to happen.	To se ne bo zgodilo.
I’m not sure how he managed that.	Nisem prepričan, kako mu je to uspelo.
He wanted something more, he wanted something else.	Želel je nekaj več, hotel je nekaj drugega.
I think he just didn’t know what to do.	Mislim, da preprosto ni vedel, kaj naj naredi.
It’s hard, fast and not very nice.	Je težko, hitro in ni zelo lepo.
Maybe I'm wrong.	Morda nimam prav.
I just know it's nice here.	Samo vem, da je tukaj lepo.
We will now.	Zdaj bomo.
He expected.	Pričakoval je.
It should be fine.	Moral bi biti v redu.
Only this.	Samo to.
he asked.	je vprašal.
In fact, let it be no one.	Pravzaprav naj to ni nihče.
She was a bit fine.	Bila je malo v redu.
You will do.	Naredil boš.
Tell me what happened.	Povej mi, kaj se je zgodilo.
There for a long time.	Tam že dolgo časa.
He became a father.	Postal je oče.
But he was not there.	Vendar ga ni bilo.
He came when he felt like it.	Prišel je, ko se mu je zdelo.
I was not well.	Ni mi bilo dobro.
It was common to eat together.	Običajno je bilo jesti skupaj.
He was here last night.	Sinoči je bil tukaj.
They are no longer here.	Ni jih več tukaj.
That was really hard to do.	To je bilo res težko narediti.
We know what it's like.	Vemo, kako je to.
That you will do everything that is right for you.	Da boš naredil vse, kar je prav zate.
I wanted to do better.	Hotel sem narediti bolje.
He is there.	Tam je.
I think that might be the problem for this.	Mislim, da je to lahko problem za to.
Maybe we never did.	Mogoče nismo nikoli.
He loves school.	Rad ima šolo.
You brought me back to life.	Vrnil si me v življenje.
And a little.	In malo.
I can not believe.	Ne morem verjeti.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
Maybe he really didn't want to know.	Mogoče res ni hotel vedeti.
I think you will like it there.	Mislim, da vam bo tam všeč.
We should do better.	Morali bi narediti bolje.
I don't think he wants to tell me.	Mislim, da mi noče povedati.
But this is clearly not the case.	A očitno temu ni tako.
I couldn't work.	Nisem mogel delati.
They will not know how to proceed.	Ne bodo vedeli, kako naprej.
Just like everything you want.	Tako kot vse, kar želite.
I don’t quite understand what’s going on here.	Popolnoma ne razumem, kaj se tukaj dogaja.
Here you are.	Tukaj si.
And the only reason is so.	In edini razlog je tako.
It wasn't much.	Ni bilo veliko.
It would be wrong not to.	Narobe bi bilo, da ne bi.
You can't believe what he says.	Ne moreš verjeti, kaj pravi.
It doesn't come every day.	Ne pride vsak dan.
I have to go soon.	Kmalu moram iti.
He wanted to.	Želel je.
But not fast enough.	Vendar ne dovolj hitro.
He just.	On samo.
I felt almost at home.	Počutil sem se skoraj kot doma.
As it was.	Kot je bilo.
Because it happened.	Ker se je zgodilo.
She will never be there again.	Nikoli več je ne bo tam.
I just didn’t like it.	Preprosto mi ni bilo všeč.
I was gone.	Mene ni bilo več.
But it can be.	Lahko pa je.
You may be interested.	Morda vas zanima.
They really were.	Res so bili.
I wish you everything.	želim ti vse.
He wanted to do it himself.	Želel je narediti sam.
I know things.	poznam stvari.
I couldn't do it.	Tega nisem mogel narediti.
You really like it and want more.	To vam je res všeč in želite več.
I'm glad to have you both.	Vesel sem, da vas imam oba.
He knew better than himself.	Vedel je bolje kot sam.
He knows that.	On to ve.
I have enough to eat.	Imam jih dovolj jesti.
And maybe never.	In morda nikoli.
He lives in the city.	Živi v mestu.
We have to.	Moramo.
I'll find the money.	Bom našel denar.
You don't have to do anything else.	Ničesar več ti ni treba narediti.
I do not know him.	Ne poznam ga.
Not so fast.	Ne, tako hitro.
In fact, that was not true.	Pravzaprav to ni bilo res.
How did he get this job?	Kako je dobil to službo?
They should be.	Morali bi biti.
I am human.	jaz sem človek.
This is simply not the case.	To preprosto ni tako.
She knows she's not the only one.	Ve, da ni edina.
He had it when he was a child.	Imel ga je, ko je bil otrok.
I thought so too.	Tudi jaz sem tako mislil.
It was very serious, really.	Bilo je zelo resno, res.
What, if anything, is wrong?	Kaj, če je kaj, je narobe?
I didn't need to.	Nisem potreboval.
He said he really liked it.	Rekel je, da mu je bilo zelo všeč.
He thought he had been there for some time.	Mislil je, da je bil tam že nekaj časa.
That's the question.	Za to je vprašanje.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
It is true and it must.	Res je in mora.
If you can.	Če lahko.
I have to leave immediately.	Takoj moram oditi.
He couldn't work.	Ni mogel delati.
Do your thing.	Naredi svoje.
Whether we like it or not.	Če nam je všeč ali ne.
And even then.	In tudi takrat.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
I've been here for so long.	Tako dolgo sem prišel.
But he said there was more.	Vendar je rekel, da je bilo še več.
There is a lot of work.	Veliko je dela.
Never more serious.	Nikoli bolj resno.
He met her.	Spoznal jo je.
Everyone he loved.	Vsi, ki jih je imel rad.
He told me no.	Rekel mi je ne.
And not just here.	In ne samo tukaj.
It must have been difficult for everyone.	Verjetno je bilo vsem težko.
This is a difficult question.	To je težko vprašanje.
It was really good.	Bilo je res dobro.
He seemed to know everything.	Zdelo se je, da pozna vse.
It's not about someone else.	Ne gre, za drugega.
I probably was then too.	Verjetno sem bil tudi takrat.
If he found you here, he will find you there.	Če te je našel tukaj, te bo tam.
I hope you are all together for many more years.	Upam, da ste vsi skupaj še veliko let.
I'm glad you came.	Vesel sem, da si prišel.
What we will have.	Kar bomo imeli.
Nothing comes.	Nič ne pride.
It was hard for him and he will soon lose everything.	Bilo mu je težko in bo kmalu izgubil vse.
Things around town.	Stvari po mestu.
He was quite surprised.	Bil je precej presenečen.
I like this.	To mi je všeč.
That didn’t look too good.	To ni bilo videti preveč dobro.
Just the way she liked it.	Tako, kot ji je bilo všeč.
We know where we stand on this.	Vemo, kje smo glede tega.
Except he didn't say that.	Le da tega ni rekel.
All the time actually.	Pravzaprav ves čas.
Because it is not.	Ker ni.
I have a job for you.	Imam službo zate.
Sometimes it is.	Včasih je tako.
I don't know why myself.	Sam ne vem zakaj.
He had nothing to say.	Ni imel kaj povedati.
And do it.	In to stori.
That's all.	Samo to je.
You are my only true friend.	Ti si moj edini pravi prijatelj.
I've known all my life.	Vem že vse življenje.
I think that was it.	Mislim, da je bilo to.
Nothing.	Nič.
This is not good for anyone.	To ni dobro za nikogar.
Would you come with me?	Bi šel z mano?
once.	enkrat.
You can't be much better than that.	Ne moreš biti veliko boljši od tega.
It feels better.	To se počuti bolje.
Now and now and now what is actually here.	Zdaj in zdaj in zdaj, kaj je pravzaprav tukaj.
And left.	In odšel.
Not too much.	Ne preveč.
It was hard work.	Bilo je težko delo.
I wouldn't want to.	Ne bi hotel.
That's how it's done.	Tako se to dela.
Wrong wrong wrong.	Narobe narobe narobe.
No one came with him.	Nihče ni prišel z njim.
I was just like him.	Bil sem tako kot on.
They had their time.	Imeli so svoj čas.
Like he didn't want to say.	Kot ni hotel povedati.
I was alone again.	Spet sem bil sam.
Actually, he wasn't there.	Pravzaprav ga ni bilo.
He will go to school.	Šel bo v šolo.
Or, you know, really early.	Ali, veste, res zgodaj.
I like this one much better.	Ta mi je veliko bolj všeč.
You have to believe me about that.	O tem mi moraš verjeti.
Not yet.	Še ne.
It's all you.	To si vse ti.
I don't see him.	ne vidim ga.
I love people.	Rad imam ljudi.
Very good indeed.	Res zelo dobro.
He looked surprised.	Videti je bil presenečen.
Today, everyone needs a car!	Danes vsak potrebuje avto!
He will want to go.	Bo želel iti.
But there was nothing left to do now.	Vendar zdaj ni bilo več kaj storiti.
However, let it go.	Vendar pa naj gre.
He told us everything he did that day.	Povedal nam je vse, kar je storil tisti dan.
In fact, I should do it now.	Pravzaprav bi to moral storiti zdaj.
No one could have been there then.	Nihče takrat že ni mogel biti tam.
I'm not interested.	ne zanima me.
I'm sorry for everything.	Žal mi je za vse.
This is very common.	To je zelo pogosto.
I hope it's just me.	Upam, da sem to samo jaz.
I have to tell her.	Moram ji povedati.
In fact, I think he expected it.	Pravzaprav mislim, da je pričakoval.
We haven't seen each other for a long time.	Dolgo časa se nismo videli.
This is hard work.	To je težko delo.
And money helps with that.	In denar pomaga pri tem.
We can't stay here.	Ne moremo ostati tukaj.
You never saw me.	Nikoli me nisi videl.
That was completely wrong.	To je bilo popolnoma narobe.
It was better that you never met.	Bolje je bilo, da se nikoli nisi srečal.
She was so good to me.	Bila je tako dobra do mene.
That can't be right!	To ne more biti prav!
I think it's true.	Mislim, da je res.
You probably will too.	Verjetno boš tudi ti.
I do not have time	nimam časa
One can do this for quite a long time.	Človek lahko to počne precej dolgo.
I would be fine with that.	Jaz bi bil v redu s tem.
That he could see.	Da je lahko videl.
How he died.	Kako je umrl.
But there was something else.	Bilo pa je še nekaj.
He does this to everyone.	To počne vsem.
Maybe I could find her.	Mogoče bi jo lahko našel.
I don't see that.	Tega ne vidim.
Not today.	Danes pa ne.
Obviously not.	Očitno niso.
I'm too busy to sit here.	Preveč sem zaposlen, da bi sedel tukaj.
The next day I went.	Naslednji dan sem šel.
He has to do everything himself.	Vse mora narediti sam.
And he came again tomorrow.	In spet je prišel jutri.
There was nothing, really.	Ni bilo nič, res.
This may have been the first time.	To je bilo morda prvič.
I am a person.	jaz sem oseba.
He wasn't happy, but he didn't say anything.	Ni bil vesel, vendar ni rekel ničesar.
Let him sing them.	Naj jih poje.
I lost money.	Izgubil sem denar.
He looked angry.	Videti je bil jezen.
It was nice here.	Tukaj je bilo lepo.
I decided to leave.	Odločil sem se oditi.
I'm still at it.	Še vedno sem pri tem.
The problem is that they never are.	Problem je v tem, da nikoli niso.
Now he knew what it was.	Zdaj je vedel, kaj je to.
If they were.	Če bi bili.
I do that too.	Tudi jaz to počnem.
And you're right.	In prav imaš.
He knows it isn't.	Ve, da ni.
There was no need.	Ni bilo treba.
I've never heard of it.	Nikoli nisem slišal za to.
He had something to say about that.	Za to je imel nekaj povedati.
It's as simple as that.	Preprosto je to.
I never forgot.	nikoli nisem pozabil.
Maybe a lot of things.	Mogoče veliko stvari.
Because there was nothing to do.	Ker ni bilo kaj narediti.
However, it is possible that it is not.	Vendar pa je mogoče, da ga ni.
That's all.	To je popolnoma vse.
Has anyone seen her?	Jo je kdo videl?
All this was true.	Vse to je bilo res.
We only have today.	Imamo samo danes.
Nowhere to go.	Ni kam iti.
I just know it’s going to be hard sometimes.	Vem le, da bo včasih težko.
But they didn't do that.	Vendar tega niso storili.
They would see us.	Videli bi nas.
She loved it here.	Tukaj ji je bilo všeč.
That may or may not be true.	To je lahko res in morda ne.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
I really don't like it.	res mi ni všeč.
But he didn't come back.	A se ni vrnil.
I could do a little more now.	Zdaj bi lahko naredil malo več.
I'm supposed to talk.	Jaz naj bi govoril.
We, you and me.	Mi, ti in jaz.
There is something wrong here.	Tukaj je nekaj narobe.
And it was.	In bilo je.
That could be it.	To bi lahko bilo.
You may have seen it.	Morda ste to videli.
You don't have to do anything.	Nič ti ni treba narediti.
But now it never will.	Zdaj pa nikoli ne bo.
I already told you that.	To sem ti že povedal.
We have to move on.	Moramo naprej.
And for me.	In zame.
We can't know that it's definitely not okay.	Ne moremo vedeti, da zagotovo ni v redu.
I knew better.	Vedel sem bolje.
My father worked all his life.	Moj oče je delal vse življenje.
You're really mad now.	Zdaj si res jezen.
Actually he had.	Pravzaprav je imel.
I never played again.	Nikoli več nisem igral.
You should see that.	To bi morala videti.
Nothing really goes better than that.	Nič res ne gre bolje kot to.
Great job.	Veliko delo.
That's when it's .	Takrat je .
what will you	kaj boš.
It is not	To ni
But something else happened.	A zgodilo se je nekaj drugega.
Maybe we all should be.	Morda bi morali biti vsi.
Like that day.	Kot tudi ta dan.
If that were possible, it would probably happen.	Če bi bilo to mogoče, bi se verjetno zgodilo.
Now there is a problem.	Zdaj je problem.
For your work.	Za svoje delo.
It happened here.	Zgodilo se je tukaj.
As it really could be.	Kot bi res lahko bilo.
We never will either.	Tudi ne bomo nikoli.
It's much better now.	Zdaj je veliko bolje.
I love you.	Rad sem jaz.
There is no time now.	Zdaj pa ni časa.
These are my things.	To so moje stvari.
I understand now.	Zdaj razumem.
Today was the day.	Danes je bil dan.
Obviously a lot needs to be said.	Očitno je treba veliko govoriti.
Only in the afternoon.	Samo popoldne.
And now or never.	In zdaj ali nikoli.
Now was my chance.	Zdaj je bila moja priložnost.
Something must be wrong.	Nekaj ​​mora biti narobe.
She always does well.	Vedno ji gre dobro.
In fact, no one can.	Pravzaprav nihče ne more.
We will never do this again.	Tega ne bomo nikoli več storili.
Now we have to go.	Zdaj moramo iti.
We can be here.	Lahko smo tukaj.
We saw it last night.	Videli smo sinoči.
But maybe it was enough.	Morda pa je bilo dovolj.
When my father died, he came to us.	Ko je oče umrl, je prišel k nam.
But there aren't any.	Vendar jih ni.
I knew it would.	Vedel sem, da bo.
Very good of him.	Zelo dobro od njega.
Right now, it seems right.	Prav zdaj se zdi prav.
I wish you were here.	Želim si, da bi bil tukaj.
I don't usually do that.	Tega običajno ne počnem.
She wanted to do everything.	Želela je narediti vse.
I was not.	nisem bil.
You will love it !.	Všeč ti bo!.
And that seems right.	In to se zdi prav.
Who said what.	Kdo je kaj rekel.
I'll call him.	ga bom poklical.
I think we are.	Mislim, da smo.
I know he's right.	Vem, da ima prav.
That will be nice.	To bo lepo.
There were enough of them.	Dovolj jih je bilo.
So here too.	Tako tudi tukaj.
Life here is not easy.	Življenje tukaj ni lahko.
I'm not sorry.	Ni mi žal.
I'm not like anyone here.	Nisem kot nihče tukaj.
The reason for this is as follows.	Razlog za to je naslednji.
There's money.	Tam je denar.
There will probably be more.	Verjetno bo več.
This was no longer possible.	To ni bilo več mogoče.
I need to talk to him.	Moram govoriti z njim.
This has never happened to me before.	To se mi še nikoli ni zgodilo.
They never had children.	Nikoli niso imeli otrok.
Tell me where you are.	Povej mi, kje si.
We had a nice time today.	Danes smo se imeli lepo.
It never was.	Nikoli ni bilo.
Nobody likes her.	Nihče je ne mara.
No, it's not good enough.	Ne, ni dovolj dobro.
It really was a lot of him to make it happen.	Res je bilo veliko od njega, da mu je to uspelo.
A friend came to the house.	V hišo je prišel prijatelj.
More than enough.	Več kot dovolj.
He wouldn't have to.	Ne bi mu bilo treba.
Now is the time.	Zdaj je čas.
I never bought it for you.	Nikoli ti je nisem kupil.
In fact, there was nothing more he could do.	Pravzaprav ni mogel storiti ničesar več.
I managed to do that then.	To mi je takrat uspelo.
No one has ever seen her before.	Nihče je še nikoli ni videl.
And he doesn't regret it.	In za to mu ni žal.
He needed money.	Potreboval je denar.
My father is always right.	Moj oče ima vedno prav.
He was penniless, penniless.	Bil je brez denarja, brez denarja.
When you know you found him.	Ko veš, da si ga našel.
It's just money.	To je samo denar.
I was ready for it.	Bil sem pripravljen na to.
I felt very angry.	Počutil sem se zelo jezen.
I loved that.	Všeč mi je bilo to.
I hope it will be good.	upam, da bo dobro.
I want you to know that.	Želim, da to veš.
There will be many of them in this.	V tem jih bo veliko.
He didn't want to say anything.	Ni hotel ničesar povedati.
It's just that.	To je samo to.
He didn’t feel good about anyone or anything.	Ni se počutil dobro glede nikogar in ničesar.
It's in me.	V meni je.
He knows it won't be easy.	Ve, da ne bo lahko.
should not.	ne bi smeli.
I see that now.	To zdaj vidim.
That's how he worked.	Tako je delal.
They were just there.	Pravkar so bili tam.
I believe he has.	Verjamem, da ima.
I think that's it.	Mislim, da je to to.
We can never.	Nikoli ne moremo.
He wasn't ready, he wasn't ready.	Ni bil pripravljen, ni bil pripravljen.
They knew what he had done.	Vedeli so, kaj je storil.
I believe in everything he says.	Verjamem v vse, kar govori.
That's just what you have to do.	To je samo tisto, kar moraš narediti.
Because everything is fine with you.	Ker je s tabo vse v redu.
You should go to the house.	Moral bi iti v hišo.
I've heard a lot of this.	Slišal sem veliko tega.
I shouldn't have come to work today.	Danes ne bi smel priti v službo.
Still not.	Še vedno ne.
I would buy this book.	Kupil bi to knjigo.
No one has done that yet.	Tega še nihče ni storil.
They were because of me.	Zaradi mene so bili.
Because it is.	Ker je.
You will know things that will not.	Vedeli boste stvari, ki jih ne bodo.
Maybe it never would have been.	Mogoče ga nikoli ne bi bilo.
And the boy looked good.	In fant je bil videti dobro.
She wanted more for us.	Želela je več za nas.
The man who died was not my father.	Človek, ki je umrl, to ni bil moj oče.
Not for me at all, really.	Sploh ni zame, res.
He won't come here.	Ne bo prišel sem.
Like .	Kot .
Maybe he didn't hear her right.	Morda je ni slišal prav.
I can't stay here with you.	Ne morem ostati tukaj s tabo.
We were here.	Bili smo tukaj.
Life is very, very good !.	Življenje je zelo, zelo dobro!.
Please live a few more days.	Prosim, živi še nekaj dni.
I wouldn't have anything now.	Zdaj ne bi imel nič.
I can not believe.	Ne morem verjeti.
Maybe I couldn't.	Morda ne bi mogel.
He also puts money there.	Tja tudi da denar.
He was very angry.	Bil je zelo jezen.
There are so many.	Toliko jih je.
She certainly hasn't been there yet.	Zagotovo še ni bila tam.
Probably him too.	Verjetno je tudi on.
And you are.	In ti si.
And here it is.	In tukaj je.
When all goes well, there is nothing like it.	Ko gre vse dobro, ni nič takega.
I know what is right and true.	Vem, kaj je prav in res.
asked the father.	je vprašal oče.
Something or someone.	Nekaj ​​ali nekdo.
This one was for me.	Ta je bil zame.
I have no one to help me.	nimam nikogar, ki bi mi pomagal.
I want to say that we know what to do.	Želim povedati, da vemo, kaj storiti.
I can go with that.	Lahko grem s tem.
We're fine.	V redu smo.
You will get better, you will.	Bolje ti bo, boš.
Keep it simple.	Naj bo preprosto.
Something should be done about this as well.	Tudi glede tega bi bilo treba nekaj narediti.
This guy was good.	Ta fant je bil dober.
I thought so.	Mislil sem, da.
I came back.	Prišel sem nazaj.
I'm sure that's it.	Prepričan sem, da je to to.
They did things to him.	Naredili so mu stvari.
Even if she was.	Tudi če bi bila.
However, this is not enough.	Vendar to ni dovolj.
There seemed to be something wrong there.	Tam se je zdelo nekaj narobe.
First time.	Prvič.
Sometimes it is very difficult.	Včasih je zelo težko.
It happened very quickly.	To se je zgodilo zelo hitro.
And maybe a little angry.	In morda malo jezen.
He couldn't do that.	Tega ni mogel storiti.
Not so now.	Zdaj ni tako.
I've never seen him today.	Danes ga še nikoli nisem videl.
I wouldn't help you.	Ne bi ti pomagal.
They had three children.	Imeli so tri otroke.
A little better now.	Zdaj malo bolje.
It was hard, it was hard.	Bilo je težko, bilo je težko.
That's not what I want.	To ni tisto, kar želim.

I can't go out.	Ne morem ven.
That’s what makes things.	To je tisto, kar naredi stvari.
He knows something is wrong.	Ve, da nekaj ni v redu.
No, that's not right.	Ne, to ni prav.
I wouldn't leave.	Ne bi odšel.
I’ve been waiting so long to do that.	Tako dolgo sem čakal, da to storim.
Yes, you are the right man for this.	Da, ti si pravi človek za to.
Just like I was at home.	Tako kot bi bil doma.
That's it! 	To je to!
I feel better knowing that.	Bolje se počutim, ko to vem.
That would be the case here.	Tukaj bi bilo tako.
I don't believe that.	Tega ne verjamem.
It wasn't right away.	Ni bilo takoj.
It was all too true.	Vse je bilo preveč res.
He's a really good guy.	On je res dober fant.
Something like that and that.	Nekaj ​​takega in tega.
I don't know her that well.	Ne poznam je tako dobro.
I don't like that.	to mi ni všeč.
The game does it for you.	Igra to naredi namesto vas.
I will make something out of it.	Nekaj ​​bom naredil iz njega.
I learned a lot from him.	Od njega sem se veliko naučil.
I have to do something.	nekaj moram narediti.
And so here.	In tako tukaj.
We are in place.	Smo na mestu.
I would like to buy a house.	rad bi kupil hišo.
When the time comes, he will need you.	Ko bo prišel čas, te bo potreboval.
In and in.	In in in.
That was serious.	To je bilo resno.
I didn't mean any of that.	Nič od tega nisem mislil.
I still believe that was wrong.	Še vedno verjamem, da je bilo to narobe.
It's just normal.	To je preprosto običajno.
Did you hear that?	Ali si slišal to?
I'm afraid of her.	bojim se je.
In this city.	V tem mestu.
I loved working on it.	Rad sem delal na tem.
And so on and so forth.	In tako naprej in tako naprej.
It was in me.	Bilo je v meni.
He was nothing to her.	On ji ni bil nič.
That's all he should do.	Samo to bi moral narediti.
It's just you and me now.	Zdaj sva samo ti in jaz.
There was more.	Bilo je več.
But he didn’t ask me about it.	Vendar me ni vprašal o tem.
Still not.	Še vedno ne.
Is anyone there?	Je kdo tam?
Something happened to me that day.	Tisti dan se mi je nekaj zgodilo.
I don't want to see that.	Tega nočem videti.
They were alone.	Bili so sami.
We really shouldn't do that.	Tega res ne bi smeli storiti.
He returned to his hotel.	Vrnil se je v svoj hotel.
I thought it had to be done that way.	Mislil sem, da je treba tako narediti.
These are	To so
She was with me even when she was gone.	Bila je z mano, tudi ko je ni bilo.
And maybe they did.	In morda so to storili.
Maybe a little too much.	Mogoče malo preveč.
And maybe he wasn't.	In morda ni bil.
This is something to see.	To je nekaj videti.
I told you what happened.	Povedal sem ti, kaj se je zgodilo.
It seems almost obvious that it doesn't work.	Zdi se skoraj očitno, da ne dela.
And when will it be.	In kdaj bo.
You have to go.	Moraš iti.
Here is my question.	Tukaj je moje vprašanje.
Jobs should be for people.	Dela bi morala biti za ljudi.
What does he have to do.	Kaj ima to narediti.
It's none of my business.	To ni moja stvar.
We didn't have time.	Nismo imeli časa.
He waited for more.	Čakal je na več.
He will stay here, with me.	Ostal bo tukaj, z mano.
There's nothing you can do.	Ničesar ne moreš narediti.
He liked that.	To mu je bilo všeč.
First, not immediately.	Prvič, ni takoj.
If so, so be it.	Če je tako, tako je.
She doesn't need to be told anymore.	Ni ji treba več povedati.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikomur ni povedal.
I wanted you.	hotel sem te.
They did that.	To so storili.
Everyone has a car.	Vsak ima avto.
And that's not happening.	In to se ne dogaja.
We'll see what happens next for me.	Bomo videli, kaj se mi bo zgodilo naprej.
I thought they were gone.	Mislil sem, da jih ni več.
This will never happen to you again.	Kaj takega se vam ne bo nikoli več zgodilo.
I didn't like it there.	Tam mi ni bilo všeč.
It really happened.	Res se je zgodilo.
Very little about it.	Zelo malo o tem.
She said she was fine.	Rekla je, da je dobro.
I can not do it anymore.	Ne morem več.
He was a really good man.	Res je bil dober človek.
He had to do something.	Nekaj ​​je moral narediti.
This has never happened to me before.	To se mi še nikoli ni zgodilo.
And she didn't know you knew.	In ni vedela, da ti veš.
Not so long.	Ne tako dolgo.
You have to stay.	Moraš ostati.
Because he will do it.	Ker bo to naredil.
All in all very nice.	Vse skupaj zelo lepo.
They are simply not an option.	Preprosto niso možnost.
You never met him.	Nikoli ga nisi srečal.
Do not speak.	Ne govori.
Much more than that.	Veliko več kot to.
It seemed so obvious now.	Zdaj se je zdelo tako očitno.
That's what I want to say.	To pa želim povedati.
I thought about all these things.	Mislil sem na vse te stvari.
I have nothing, man.	Nič nimam, človek.
Here it is.	Tukaj je tako.
It feels that way.	To se počuti tako.
I am very happy to be here.	Zelo sem vesel, da sem tukaj.

It was the first time.	Bilo je prvič.
It is wrong that he must be here.	Narobe je, da mora biti tukaj.
Is that what you want?	Ali si to želiš.
You never did.	Nikoli niste.
It was wrong.	Bilo je narobe.
For the right time.	Za pravi čas.
This would certainly not be easy.	To zagotovo ne bi bilo lahko.
Much to say, but very little done.	Veliko za povedati, vendar naredil zelo malo.
I am simply very happy to have the opportunity.	Preprosto sem zelo vesel, da imam priložnost.
That's what it is.	To je tisto, kar je.
It was big.	Bilo je veliko.
It seemed right.	Zdelo se je prav.
I have a lot of money.	imam veliko denarja.
Not yet.	Ne še.
And not for good.	In ne na dobro.
Which was the thing.	Kar je bila stvar.
I haven't seen you in a while and.	že nekaj časa te nisem videl in.
They saw each other on the spot.	Videli so se na mestu.
Maybe he's really good.	Mogoče je res dober.
The time for that has not yet come.	Čas za to še ni prišel.
Everything would be fine.	Vse bi bilo v redu.
No, more than nice.	Ne, več kot lepo.
This has happened before.	To se je zgodilo že prej.
He was not there.	Tam ga ni bilo.
He was very good at it.	Bil je zelo dober v tem.
In their own way.	Po svoje.
I see him.	vidim ga.
He didn't have time.	Ni imel časa.
He left us there.	Tam nas je pustil.
That was enough for me.	To mi je bilo dovolj.
I might as well not be there.	Lahko bi tudi ne bil tam.
He said a lot is true.	Rekel je, da je veliko res.
I know you there.	Tam poznam vas.
To be there for me.	Da bi bil tam zame.
Nobody told me that like you.	Tega mi nihče ni rekel kot ti.
You should go if you can.	Moral bi iti, če lahko.
We should not do that.	Tega ne bi smeli storiti.
He knew what needed to be done.	Vedel je, kaj je treba storiti.
I don't mean to be.	ne mislim biti.
She knew why he had come.	Vedela je, zakaj je prišel.
He went there.	Šel je tja.
But we probably already know that too.	A verjetno tudi to že vemo.
There's not much we can do.	Prav veliko ne moremo narediti.
He asked me for money.	Prosil me je za denar.
We have it and here we are.	Imamo ga in tukaj smo.
Maybe there was something wrong with me.	Mogoče je bilo z mano kaj narobe.
It was hard for her to say that.	Težko ji je bilo to povedati.
Everyone liked her.	Vsem je bila všeč.
My father will be angry.	Moj oče bo jezen.
We know how it is.	Vemo, kako je.
It wouldn't be for a few more days.	Še nekaj dni ne bi bilo.
Now a friend.	Zdaj pa prijatelj.
And indeed for a long time.	In res že dolgo.
I would die.	jaz bi umrl.
He is.	on je.
He told us himself.	Povedal nam je sam.
He just wasn’t ready to see it.	Preprosto ni bil pripravljen tega videti.
Make it quick my friend.	Naredi to hitro, prijatelj.
It's not.	Ni se.
He wasn't like that anymore.	Tako ni bil več.
He wouldn't let me go.	Ni me pustil oditi.
I'm really happy about that.	Res sem vesel tega.
He started talking.	Začel je govoriti.
No one ate.	Nihče ni jedel.
Because it's about me.	Ker gre zame.
He realized he had come.	Spoznal je, da je prišel.
It's only here this week.	Tukaj je samo ta teden.
I really liked it.	Zelo mi je bil všeč.
There is not much to say about this.	Ni veliko za povedati o tem.
When he died.	Ko je umrl.
There was very little time to do something.	Časa za nekaj narediti je bilo zelo malo.
We don't know what will happen.	Ne vemo, kaj se bo zgodilo.
It has everything there is to know.	Ima vse, kar je treba vedeti.
And so simple.	In tako preprosto.
Nothing like that, I wouldn't.	Nič takega, ne bi.
It is good that something is going right.	Dobro je, da gre nekaj prav.
Apparently he was fine.	Očitno je bil v redu.
He'll be here tomorrow.	Jutri bo tukaj.
The work was like nothing we hadn’t seen before.	Delo je bilo kot nič, kar še nismo videli.
I heard her.	slišal sem jo.
I am me.	jaz sem jaz.
And you don't just want him.	In ne želiš samo njega.
That was enough.	To je bilo dovolj.
It’s ready as soon as you are.	Pripravljen je takoj, ko ste.
But I could have a lot more.	Lahko pa bi imel še veliko več.
Because they are.	Ker so.
You like it.	Všeč ti je.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
You wanted her.	Želel si je.
It was still there.	Še vedno je bilo tam.
I don't know what they are.	Ne vem pa kaj so.
You're one of them.	Od tega si.
There were a lot of people there.	Tam je bilo veliko ljudi.
None of us know each other.	Nihče od nas se ne pozna.
He liked her.	Všeč mu je bila.
That was fine.	To je bilo v redu.
He was sitting there.	Tam je sedel.
I was there once.	Enkrat sem bil tam.
It hardly seems like it happened today.	Težko se zdi, da se je to zgodilo danes.
He didn't tell me much at all.	Sploh mi ni veliko povedal.
It wasn't that long ago.	Ni bilo tako dolgo nazaj.
They had to do what they had to.	Morali so narediti, kar so morali.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
How are you again.	Še enkrat kako si.
No one could know about it.	Nihče ni mogel vedeti za to.
I'll call her.	jo bom poklical.
That was enough.	Dovolj je bilo.
He won't do anything.	On ne bo naredil ničesar.
This is simply not true.	To preprosto ni res.
That's so beautiful.	To je tako lepo.
It took him a while to get back.	Potreboval je nekaj časa, da se je vrnil.
There will be something.	Nekaj ​​bo.
I would be very happy if I would.	Zelo bi bil vesel, če bi.
If he's going to die, so be it.	Če bo umrl, naj bo tako.
He never had anyone stay here alone.	Nikoli ni imel nikogar, ki bi ostal tukaj sam.
He didn't speak for long.	Ni dolgo govoril.
But he still didn't succeed.	A še vedno mu ni uspelo.
I thought you were there.	Mislil sem, da si tam.
That was too much for me.	To je bilo zame preveč.
No one heard anything.	Nihče ni slišal ničesar.
He came here yesterday.	Včeraj je prišel sem.
I really don't want to know.	Res nočem vedeti.
You should be with him now.	Zdaj bi morala biti z njim.
She was for it now.	Zdaj je bila za to.
He didn't know what.	Ni vedel kaj.
I really wanted to go with him.	Res sem želela iti z njim.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Ali ste prepričani, da želite to storiti?
I was the only one.	Bil sem edini.
Anyone could do that.	To bi lahko storil vsak.
He played it very simply.	Igral ga je zelo preprosto.
It won't be hard.	Ne bo težko.
Nothing is wrong.	Nič ni narobe.
Maybe he wasn't my real father.	Mogoče ni bil moj pravi oče.
Who he was.	Kdo je bil.
I want to talk to him.	Želim govoriti z njim.
I had to talk to him.	Moral sem govoriti z njim.
However, not all.	Vendar pa niso vsi.
I said now.	sem rekel zdaj.
She didn't know why he would do something like that.	Ni vedela, zakaj bi naredil kaj takega.
I don't know anymore.	ne vem več.
I’m sure there’s more.	Prepričan sem, da je še več.
It wasn't good.	Ni bilo dobro.
I've seen something like this before.	Nekaj ​​takega sem že videl.
He was on it now.	Zdaj je bil na tem.
He gave her a book.	Dal ji je knjigo.
I understand why you couldn't.	Razumem, zakaj nisi mogel.
He just wanted to get home.	Hotel je le priti domov.
You should be home.	Moral bi biti doma.
There may be more.	Morda jih bo še več.
Because it was no longer him.	Ker ni bil več on.
I was surprised by that.	Bil sem presenečen nad tem.
She was today.	Danes je bila.
Like he said, it wasn't.	Kot je rekel, to ni bil.
He once said.	Nekoč je rekel.
Now he knew why.	Zdaj je vedel zakaj.
But I'm serious.	Mislim pa resno.
We don't have to see anymore.	Ni nam treba več videti.
He is such a good man.	On je tako dober človek.
Do it your way.	Naredi po svoje.
He wasn't so sure.	Ni bil tako prepričan.
How much money do you have?	Koliko denarja imaš?
I was sorry for that.	bilo mi je žal za to.
I was trying to get here.	Poskušal sem priti sem.
Which was probably a good thing.	Kar je bilo verjetno dobro.
Tell me.	Povej mi.
It couldn't be simpler than that.	Bolj preprosto od tega ni bilo.
I don't think she knew any better.	Mislim, da ni vedela nič bolje.
The only thing that continues to be played is time.	Edina stvar, ki se še naprej igra, je čas.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu gre.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
He said he would come tomorrow.	Rekel je, da bo prišel jutri.
I loved everything about it.	Všeč mi je bilo vse na tem.
I haven't seen them.	Nisem jih videl.
You know how it goes.	Saj veš kako gre.
It has never been like that before.	Še nikoli ni bilo tako.
And not for the first time.	In ne prvič.
I didn't go.	Nisem šel.
Not my boyfriend.	Ne moj fant.
I asked her what she liked.	Vprašal sem jo, kaj ji je všeč.
You know who he is.	Veš kdo je.
I saw him once when he came back.	Enkrat sem ga videl, ko se je vrnil.
This is the man you met yesterday.	To je človek, ki si ga srečal včeraj.
It also does fast.	Naredi tudi hitro.
But I really didn't have time.	Res pa nisem imel časa.
That made me happy.	To sem bil vesel.
I think that could be it for me.	Mislim, da bi to lahko bilo zame.
Never this.	Nikoli tega.
There was a teacher.	Tam je bil učitelj.
Nothing comes from there.	Nič ne pride od tam.
You didn’t do things the right way.	Nisi naredil stvari na pravi način.
She said she wanted to talk.	Rekla je, da želi govoriti.
I know more of them.	Poznam jih več.
But it wasn't always easy.	A to ni bilo vedno lahko.
It's always been that way.	Vedno je bilo tako.
Or so he feels.	Ali pa se tako počuti.
It didn't help him.	Ni mu bil v pomoč.
Not as good as ever.	Ni tako dober kot vedno.
I would come tomorrow.	Jutri bi prišel.
I saw him here.	Videl sem ga tukaj.
There was a reason for that.	Za to je bil razlog.
This is highly unlikely.	To je zelo malo verjetno.
Everything would be fine now.	Zdaj bi bilo vse v redu.
I would ask.	bi vprašal.
I don't think he even knows.	Mislim, da niti ne ve.
That's what you said.	To si rekel.
That was the reason.	To je bil razlog.
I wish they weren't.	Želim si, da niso.
In fact, a long time ago.	Pravzaprav že dolgo nazaj.
Something actually.	Pravzaprav nekaj.
To do it just because.	Da bi to naredil samo zato, ker.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nič nisem naredil narobe.
What could have happened has often happened.	Kar se je lahko zgodilo, se je pogosto zgodilo.
She knew from him.	Vedela je od njega.
But he was not alone.	A ni bil sam.
I don’t know what will happen next.	Ne vem, kaj se bo zgodilo naprej.
No one said it was.	Nihče ni rekel, da je tako.
You won't see it.	Ne boš tega videl.
Not good enough.	Ni dovolj dobro.
I believe you, man.	Verjamem ti, človek.
I really wish I was here.	Res si želim, da bi bila tukaj.
Maybe something else.	Mogoče je kaj drugega.
I know it will.	Vem, da bo.
.	.
The man obviously couldn’t do much about it.	Človek očitno ni mogel veliko narediti glede tega.
And there will be more.	In še več jih bo.
He thought he would succeed.	Mislil je, da mu bo uspelo.
But she went back.	Vendar je šla nazaj.
I would like to say something here.	Tukaj bi rad nekaj povedal.
And we did.	In smo to storili.
I think that's good.	Mislim, da je to dobro.
I did that.	To sem počel.
Just not now.	Samo ne zdaj.
We have to help.	Pomagati moramo.
And it seemed so.	In zdelo se je tako.
We still had work to do.	Imeli smo še delo.
We are not the only ones.	Nismo edini.
Really nice job.	Res lepo delo.
Nothing seemed wrong.	Nič se ni zdelo narobe.
A friend was with me.	Prijatelj je bil z mano.
That's the way things are.	Tako so stvari.
We could do so much more.	Lahko bi naredili veliko več.
My child lost everything.	Moj otrok je izgubil vse.
This one is good.	Ta je dobra.
No, that's not it.	Ne, to ni to.
I need some money fast.	Hitro potrebujem nekaj denarja.
It will be there.	Tam bo.
Maybe it was still possible.	Mogoče je bilo to še mogoče.
I am not a person.	nisem oseba.
No one should buy this.	Nihče ne bi smel kupiti tega.
I felt good.	Dobro sem se počutil.
On the day this happened.	Na dan, ko se je to zgodilo.
I really didn't like this man.	Ta človek mi res ni bil všeč.
That was not the job.	To ni bilo delo.
You know how that would be.	Veš, kako bi to bilo.
He left.	Odšel je.
We need to be together.	Moramo biti skupaj.
Not just this one.	Ne samo ta.
That was much better.	To je bilo veliko bolje.
It has something.	Nekaj ​​ima.
I was too much to say no.	Preveč sem bil, da bi rekel ne.
Not everything.	Ne vsega.
This game knows too much about me.	Ta igra ve preveč o meni.
However, he did not try to do so.	Vendar tega ni poskušal storiti.
I'm not going with you anymore.	Zdaj ne bom šel več s tabo.
Or so it would seem.	Ali pa bi se tako zdelo.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
He was still not sure about that.	O tem še vedno ni bil prepričan.
it was hard for me.	bilo mi je težko.
I don't understand any of that.	Nič od tega ne razumem.
She still didn't know.	Še vedno ni vedela.
He can't swim.	Ne zna plavati.
I only have you.	imam samo tebe.
Maybe not, ”she said.	Mogoče ne,« je rekla.
It's just not here.	Tukaj preprosto ni.
i won't do anything like that.	ne bom naredil kaj takega.
As good as	Tako dobro, kot
I'm doing very well.	mi gre zelo dobro.
Are you okay now?	Ste zdaj v redu?
I have to leave.	Moram oditi.
He will never be with me.	Nikoli ne bo z mano.
But he had nothing to do.	A ni imel kaj početi.
You have it all out.	Vse imaš ven.
Forward and onward.	Naprej in naprej.
There is nothing you can do wrong.	Ne moreš narediti nič narobe.
That seems fine.	Zdi se, da je to v redu.
I never wanted you.	Nikoli te nisem želel.
you asked.	si vprašal.
I hope so.	Upam, da bo.
Why is that so?	Zakaj je temu tako.
It's becoming more and more obvious.	Vse bolj je očitno.
I hope you will.	upam, da boš.
I'm sure it is.	Prepričan sem, da je tako.
But there was something to do.	Vendar je bilo nekaj za početi.
I'll go out.	šel jih bom ven.
I called them out.	Poklical sem jih ven.
I knew it was him.	Vedel sem, da je on.
I don’t see how that’s possible.	Ne vidim, kako je to mogoče.
We will all be there.	Vsi bomo tam.
And that was hard enough.	In to je bilo dovolj težko.
My father was that now.	Moj oče je bil zdaj to.
And you should.	In moral bi.
Someone is talking.	Nekdo govori.
Instead, something else happened.	Namesto tega se je zgodilo nekaj drugega.
Some of us.	Nekaj ​​nas.
I didn't want to go.	Nisem hotel iti.
You are good.	Dober si.
I'm tired of it.	Utrujen sem od tega.
My father is no longer alive.	Moj oče ne živi več.
Nothing to do about it.	Nič storiti glede tega.
That's a lot of money.	To je veliko denarja.
He knows that too.	Tudi on to ve.
As soon as he could, he saw him again.	Takoj ko je lahko, ga je spet videl.
We never did.	Nikoli nismo.
I'm sure it could be so.	Prepričan sem, da bi lahko bilo tako.
They knew, too.	Vedeli so tudi.
And I think it will.	In mislim, da bo.
He will continue to work on this.	Bo še naprej delal na tem.
There was nothing left to see now.	Zdaj ni bilo več kaj videti.
And he did.	In to je storil.
I've met that before.	To sem že srečal.
Now she knew what was going to happen.	Zdaj je vedela, kaj se bo zgodilo.
Maybe I'm going to play now.	Mogoče grem zdaj igrati.
Who had it.	Kdo ga je imel.
Everything is still here.	Vse je še tukaj.
I don’t understand what the problem might be.	Ne razumem, kaj bi lahko bil problem.
I believe there is a better way.	Verjamem, da obstaja boljši način.
I have a lot of them.	Imam jih veliko.
It was really nice.	Bilo je res lepo.
I could never do anything right.	Nikoli nisem mogel narediti ničesar prav.
This one is good too.	Tudi ta je dobra.
So he never told us anything.	Tako nam ni nikoli ničesar povedal.
But there was more.	A bilo je še več.
He was a good boy.	Bil je dober fant.
It's not about that.	Ne gre za to.
But there is something.	Je pa nekaj.
I’m tired of being the only one.	Utrujen sem od tega, da sem edini.
She never said anything.	Nikoli ni rekla ničesar.
You will tell me.	Ti mi boš povedal.
I don't want any of that.	Nočem nič od tega.
He hadn't been seen in a long time.	Že dolgo ga ni bilo videti.
he asked.	je vprašal.
It often seems hard to believe it has been that long.	Pogosto se zdi težko verjeti, da je bilo tako dolgo.
This would not be the first time this has happened to us.	To se nam ne bi zgodilo prvič.
This happens every day.	To se dogaja vsak dan.
I'm right, again.	Prav imam, še enkrat.
That would never happen today, he told me.	Danes se to ne bi nikoli zgodilo, mi je rekel.
He's still doing it.	Še vedno to počne.
Where are you.	Kje si.
I think it is as it should be.	Mislim, da je tako, kot mora biti.
it really is true.	res je res.
He said good.	Je rekel dobro.
It's not about me.	Ne gre za mene.
But no one seemed to be able to tell me.	A zdelo se je, da mi nihče ne zna povedati.
That was also the case.	Tudi to je bilo tako.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ni hotel govoriti z mano.
Who will you meet tonight?	Koga se boš srečal nocoj?
He said it was better not to.	Rekel je, da je bolje, da ne.
I see her ahead.	Vidim jo naprej.
I seriously doubt he’ll be back, but who knows.	Resno dvomim, da se bo vrnil, a kdo ve.
Probably nothing.	Verjetno ni nič.
I could not.	nisem mogel.
Or you have before.	Ali pa si že prej.
He didn't know.	Ni vedel.
It's a hotel.	To je hotel.
He doesn't get out much.	Ne pride veliko ven.
I am very sorry.	Zelo mi je žal.
I was busy.	Bil sem zaposlen.
Every man does that.	Vsak človek to počne.
Well, we'll see.	Pa bomo videli.
I wanted to be liked by everyone.	Hotel sem biti vsem všeč.
I was surprised.	Bil sem presenečen.
He likes me.	Všeč sem mu.
Real.	Pravi.
There is almost nothing we can do.	Skoraj nič ne moremo narediti.
Maybe that wasn't his question.	Mogoče mu to ni bilo vprašanje.
But I wanted to do more.	Vendar sem želel narediti več.
There are very few of them now.	Zdaj jih je zelo malo.
I followed him.	Šel sem za njim.
He doesn't care about me.	Zame se ne zanima.
He talked to me.	Govoril je z mano.
I'll talk to him.	govoril bom z njim.
Must be.	Mora biti.
If he doesn't know, he won't.	Če ne ve, ne bo.
Tell me more.	Povej mi več.
For the day.	Za dan.
I didn't think so.	Nisem mislil, da je tako.
You'll have it by tomorrow.	Imel ga boš do jutri.
Maybe that’s why it’s so hard.	Mogoče je to razlog, da je tako težko.
Just your money and that's it.	Samo tvoj denar in to je to.
We are still not sure what will happen to us.	Še vedno nismo prepričani, kaj se bo z nami zgodilo.
I didn't like that so much.	To mi ni bilo tako všeč.
You have to do everything.	Vse moraš narediti.
No, not that.	Ne, ne to.
I know how to do it.	Vem, kako to storiti.
He told me a lot.	Veliko mi je povedal.
And so it was for me.	In tako je bilo zame.
Maybe he just doesn't know.	Mogoče pa samo ne ve.
There was no one in front of him.	Nikogar ni bilo pred njim.
There was something that didn’t happen.	Bilo je nekaj, kar se ni zgodilo.
I will not.	ne bom.
I became such a man.	Postal sem tako človek.
Everything is going well for us here.	Tukaj nam gre vse v redu.
I used to want that.	Včasih sem si želel tega.
You have to work with me.	Moraš delati z mano.
I couldn't do that.	Tega nisem mogel storiti.
None of us were prepared for this.	Nihče od nas ni bil pripravljen na to.
I didn't work with him.	Nisem delal z njim.
He was only home for a few days.	Doma je bil le nekaj dni.
You will need it.	Potreboval ga boš.
I don't believe him.	Ne verjamem mu.
That's right.	Tako je.
It needs to be talked about.	O tem je treba govoriti.
And no one knows where he is.	In nihče ne ve, kje je.
This is true.	To je res.
That was never good.	To ni bilo nikoli dobro.
He seems to be having a hard time.	Zdi se, da mu je težko.
I think you can.	Mislim, da lahko.
What you thought it was.	Kar si mislil, da je.
Everyone said that.	Vsak je to rekel.
It's about opportunity.	Gre za priložnost.
They had a chance that afternoon.	Tisto popoldne so imeli priložnost.
And everything will be better.	In vse bo bolje.
That may be true.	To je morda res.
Why did he have to come?	Zakaj je moral priti?
Is he talking about me? 	Ali govori o meni?
Looks like a good guy.	Videti kot dober fant.
We like it very much.	Zelo nam je všeč.
I never knew that.	Tega nisem nikoli vedel.
Maybe no one can help you.	Mogoče ti nihče ne more pomagati.
That was quite a few years ago.	To je bilo kar nekaj let nazaj.
I hope you like it.	Upam, da vam je všeč.
Is that true?	Ali je to res?
Also, really.	Prav tako, res.
Tell us that.	Povej nam to.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
And he came.	In prišel.
He lost his job and he should have.	Izgubil je službo in moral bi jo.
And it really is.	In res se je.
He can't tell anyone about it.	Nikomur ne more povedati o tem.
This man knows how to work.	Ta človek zna delati.
I just couldn’t take it anymore.	Preprosto nisem mogel več.
I started to help myself.	Začel sem si pomagati.
He didn't come.	Ni prišel.
It's not you.	Nisi ti.
Not doing much right now.	Trenutno ne počne veliko.
Or something like that.	Ali nekaj takega.
That's what he has.	To je tisto, kar ima.
I don't care what you think.	Ne zanima me, kaj misliš.
You don't care.	Ne zanima te.
I like it so much.	Toliko mi je všeč.
i need it now.	zdaj ga potrebujem.
But not for long, because she knew what it was.	A ne za dolgo, saj je vedela, kaj je.
You know what needs to be done.	Veš, kaj je treba narediti.
It's just that we haven't been here for so long.	Samo tako dolgo nas ni bilo tukaj.
It really is that simple.	Res je tako preprosto.
I don't have it.	jaz ga nimam.
He couldn't believe it.	Ni mogel verjeti.
And I.	In jaz.
I'm fine with that.	V redu sem s tem.
But it wasn't the first time.	A ni bilo prvič.
He doesn't do that right now.	Trenutno tega ne počne.
He was completely surprised.	Bil je popolnoma presenečen.
There is nothing here for me.	Tukaj ni nič zame.
I’m glad what happened happened.	Vesel sem, da se je zgodilo, kar se je zgodilo.
I'm glad to meet you.	Vesel sem, da sem te spoznal.
But it is not.	Vendar ni.
I don't want to leave.	nočem oditi.
We didn't do anything to him.	Nič mu nismo naredili.
You will go home soon.	Kmalu boš šel domov.
However, you do not know this and you will not do it.	Vendar tega ne veste in tega ne boste storili.
I didn't say I could.	Nisem rekel, da lahko.
My boyfriend.	Moj fant.
I think so	Mislim, da
I always had something to tell her.	Vedno sem ji imel kaj povedati.
I have enough.	Imam dovolj.
I was talking.	Govoril sem.
This is hard.	To je težko.
We are the ones.	Mi smo tisti.
Once she just didn’t like working.	Enkrat ji preprosto ni bilo všeč delati.
Still.	Še vedno.
You are my good friend.	Ti si moj dober prijatelj.
We're fine.	V redu smo.
You should be too.	Tudi ti bi moral biti.
It has and it certainly exists.	Ima in zagotovo obstaja.
They are what they are and will continue to be.	So to, kar so in bodo še naprej.
He never told me.	Nikoli mi ni povedal.
This is very serious for me.	To je zame zelo resno.
I never did that.	Nikoli tega nisem storil.
He may know himself, but he doesn’t talk about it.	Morda se pozna, a o tem ne govori.
I wish you could help me.	Želim si, da bi mi lahko pomagal.
That's why everything is wrong.	Zato je vse narobe.
That's the question here.	To je vprašanje tukaj.
I didn't know what to think.	Nisem vedel, kaj naj si mislim.
You got me there.	Dobil si me tam.
It seemed like it was, but maybe not.	Zdelo se je, kot da je, a morda ne.
That was enough.	To je bilo dovolj.
I taught you well.	Dobro sem te naučil.
If.	Če je.
That he helped me.	Da mi je pomagal.
He says he won't.	Pravi, da ne bo.
That's your reason !.	To je tvoj razlog!.
I don't want it to go.	Nočem, da gre.
I didn’t feel like myself.	Nisem se počutil kot sam.
There is no one there.	Tam ni nikogar.
It seems so to me.	Tako se mi zdi.
Because he was waiting for something.	Ker je nekaj čakal.
I couldn't be sure.	Nisem mogel biti prepričan.
You've done enough and you should go home to them.	Dovolj si naredil in domov bi moral iti k njim.
Like you said, that's the way it is.	Tako kot si rekel, tako je stvari.
How long ago was that.	Koliko časa nazaj je bilo to.
I was ready.	Bil sem pripravljen.
But you will not succeed.	Vendar vam ne bo uspelo.
I just have to believe.	Samo verjeti moram.
Life was as usual.	Življenje je bilo kot običajno.
He knows and yet he doesn't know.	Ve in vendar ne ve.
You'll be home soon.	Kmalu boš doma.
They didn't seem to see us.	Videti je bilo, da nas niso videli.
I have to do this.	To moram narediti.
And that is exactly what happened.	In prav to se je zgodilo.
It was so hard.	Bilo je tako težko.
You could see that.	To si lahko videl.
I'm sorry for you.	žal mi je zate.
Nothing a man should know.	Nič, kar človek ne bi smel vedeti.
And you should do that.	In to bi morali storiti.
I worked a lot.	veliko sem delal.
This is not a big question.	To ni veliko vprašanje.
I will return the money.	denar bom vrnil.
I wish he never would.	Želim si, da ga nikoli ne bo.
I don’t think he really thinks that.	Mislim, da res ne misli tega.
Unfortunately, everything was fine.	Žal je bilo vse v redu.
I saw it here, here and here.	Videl sem to tukaj, tukaj in tukaj.
He did and saw nothing.	Naredil je in ni videl ničesar.
These things can be seen.	Te stvari je mogoče videti.
He was very happy to become one.	Bil je zelo vesel, da je to postal.
No, it wasn't.	Ne, ni bilo.
I don't want to talk about it.	Nočem govoriti o tem.
And once he didn't come back.	In enkrat se ni vrnil.
But it wasn't good.	Ali ni bilo dobro.
They should be very good.	Zelo dobro bi morali biti.
I know I did it.	Vem, da mi je uspelo.
We will now.	Zdaj bomo.
I know you are.	Vem, da si.
No one died then.	Takrat nihče ni umrl.
It wasn't right.	Ni bilo prav.
Do it for yourself.	Naredi to za svoje.
It's not very long.	To ni zelo dolgo.
However, this is not so simple.	Vendar to ni tako preprosto.
We need to know what's going on there.	Vedeti moramo, kaj se tam dogaja.
My.	Moj.
I just knew it was time to move on.	Vedel sem le, da je čas, da grem naprej.
I still feel that way.	Še vedno se tako počutim.
You could see why.	Lahko bi videli zakaj.
Almost never.	Skoraj nikoli.
There was nothing.	Nič ni bilo.
I understand, I understand.	Razumem, razumem.
I'm not a father.	Nisem oče.
I am interested in.	Zanima me.
Because he is the one.	Ker je on tisti.
He just couldn't help himself. 	Preprosto si ni mogel pomagati. 
You have to see that.	To moraš videti.
That's what he says.	Tako pravi.
Nothing is ever right and nothing is enough.	Nič ni nikoli prav in nič ni dovolj.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
It actually was for us.	Pravzaprav je bilo za nas.
I could go.	Lahko bi šel.
I understand that my father died.	Razumem, da je moj oče umrl.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
It may as well not even have one.	Prav tako ga lahko niti nima.
I got more of them too.	Tudi jaz sem jih dobil več.
We have the money for that.	Imamo denar za to.
If money is not an issue,	Če denar ni problem,
There is still an opportunity for you.	Še vedno obstaja priložnost za vas.
I actually love doing it.	Pravzaprav to rad počnem.
That's why he doesn't come.	Zato ne pride.
Really, really fast.	Res, res hitro.
I tried to tell you that.	Poskušal sem ti to povedati.
No one saw it as life.	Nihče tega ni videl kot življenje.
I hope to see you soon.	Upam da te kmalu vidim.
Life was so hard at times.	Življenje je bilo včasih tako težko.
I think he will succeed again.	Mislim, da mu bo spet uspelo.
I heard her.	slišal sem jo.
You should leave.	Moral bi oditi.
I heard her.	Slišal sem jo.
I said it could go.	Rekel sem, da lahko gre.
I understand now.	Zdaj razumem.
I can't see her well.	Ne vidim je dobro.
It really doesn't work that way.	To res ne gre tako.
Maybe they look just like us.	Mogoče so videti tako kot mi.
Maybe not ever.	Morda ne nikoli.
I felt sorry for both of them.	Žal mi je bilo za oba.
I just always am.	Samo vedno sem.
Sometimes this was very difficult.	Včasih je bilo to zelo težko.
He likes it.	Všeč mu je.
You are not my real father and you never will be.	Ti nisi moj pravi oče in nikoli ne boš.
No, they didn't.	Ne, niso.
In fact, they were.	Pravzaprav so bili.
For a long time.	Za dolgo časa.
It looked fine.	Videti je bilo v redu.
It's a simple job.	To je preprosto delo.
It was probably okay, but he really didn’t want to leave.	Verjetno je bilo v redu, a res ni hotel, da bi odšel.
However, he never returned.	Vendar se ni nikoli vrnil.
Either he wasn’t here or he was and he was no more.	Ali ga ni bilo tukaj ali pa je bil in ga ni bilo več.
I knew what he liked.	Vedel sem, kaj mu je všeč.
I never wanted to be.	Nikoli nisem hotel biti.
It happened just like it always does.	Zgodilo se je tako kot vedno.
Here is!	Tukaj je!
These are fine.	Te pa so v redu.
That's not it.	To ni to.
He told me that.	To mi je povedal.
Not that he ever did.	Ne da je kdaj storil.
I want more of that.	Želim si več tega.
And he didn't do what she told him.	In ni storil, kar mu je rekla.
Maybe he knows.	Mogoče ve.
Where we have to go.	Kam moramo iti.
I don't understand why it wasn't.	Ne razumem, zakaj ni bilo.
It's too much for you.	Preveč je za vas.
But there was no time for that.	A časa za to ni bilo.
All by myself.	Vse sam.
This is very good.	To je zelo dobro.
I've said my piece.	Povedal sem svoje.
Why is this so?	Zakaj je temu tako?
Nice work.	Lepo delo.
I don't do that.	tega ne počnem.
He was right about you.	Imel je prav glede tebe.
Not on this one.	Ne na tem.
She knew why not.	Vedela je, zakaj ni.
It's more than that.	To je več kot to.
He sings every day.	Vsak dan poje.
He's probably already there.	Verjetno je že tam.
He has nowhere to go.	Nima kam iti.
He was tired all the time.	Ves čas je bil utrujen.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Nisem prepričan, kako to delati.
Today it is.	Danes je to.
I got it from someone else.	Dobil sem ga od nekoga drugega.
I tried to be.	Poskušal sem biti.
That's why it's okay.	Zaradi tega je v redu.
Not so good.	Ne tako dobro.
For nothing, no one, never.	Za nič, nihče, nikoli.
Nobody knows what he's doing.	Nihče ne ve, kaj počne.
I am your teacher.	Jaz sem tvoj učitelj.
I have to do this for myself.	To moram narediti zame.
I don't think anyone should.	Mislim, da nihče ne bi smel.
I could do without it.	Lahko bi naredil brez tega.
It has to stay that way.	Tako mora ostati.
Everything is fine, really.	Vse je v redu, res.
That was mine.	To je bilo moje.
It's all because you want them there.	Vse je zato, ker jih želiš tam.
However, it is not nice.	Vendar pa ni lepo.
This has never happened and it cannot.	To se nikoli ni zgodilo in ne more.
It seemed difficult.	Zdelo se je težko.
So much else had to be done.	Toliko drugega je bilo treba narediti.
This was not easy for her.	To ji ni bilo lahko.
This did not happen immediately.	To se ni zgodilo takoj.
I don’t even know what that was.	Sploh ne vem, kaj je to bilo.
He didn't like it.	Ni mu bil všeč.
Nobody about.	Nihče o.
Are they.	Ali so.
I will never meet him again.	Nikoli več ga ne bom srečal.
Maybe you should.	Mogoče bi moral.
Maybe she'll know.	Mogoče bo vedela.
Now he knew.	Zdaj je vedel.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
Maybe yes, maybe no.	Morda da, morda ne.
I don't know what's wrong with you.	Ne vem, kaj je narobe s tabo.
The day did not go very well.	Dan ni šel prav dobro.
No, he had to stay.	Ne, moral je ostati.
What do you think?	Kaj mislite?
you are.	ti si.
She liked that.	To ji je bilo všeč.
It was never a problem.	Nikoli ni bil problem.
This is my life.	To je moje življenje.
I will ask him.	ga bom vprašal.
There's a lot going on with this one.	Veliko se dogaja s tem.
And that makes him.	In to ga naredi.
Or something like that.	Ali pa kaj takega.
It could be so much better.	Lahko bi bilo veliko bolje.
That happened.	To se je zgodilo.
Keep talking to yourself.	Kar naprej si to govori.
Just .	Samo .
I never wanted him.	Nikoli si ga nisem želela.
I know he will succeed.	Vem, da mu bo uspelo.
I had it.	Imel sem ga.
In fact, it is possible.	Pravzaprav je to mogoče.
Just too.	Samo tudi.
We'll see something like that.	Bomo videli kaj takega.
And now he has succeeded.	In zdaj mu je to uspelo.
Better than nothing, for sure.	Bolje kot nič, zagotovo.
That's if he wants help.	To je, če želi pomoč.
I don't know what else to do here.	Ne vem, kaj še narediti tukaj.
Could that be it?	Ali bi lahko bilo to?
Sometimes, but for a little while.	Včasih se, vendar za malo.
It shouldn't be.	Ne bi smel biti.
He was happy	Bil je vesel
He has no one to love him.	Nima nikogar, ki bi ga imel rad.
I heard it myself last night.	Sam sem jo slišal sinoči.
It was hard, but you will succeed.	Bilo je težko, vendar vam bo uspelo.
.	.
It wasn't much.	Ni bilo veliko.
This is not difficult.	To ni težko.
Nothing happened that seemed a long time ago.	Nič se ni zgodilo, kar se je zdelo dolgo časa.
He is also my friend.	On je tudi moj prijatelj.
I have a lot of them.	Imam jih veliko.
He asked me to see him.	Prosil me je, naj ga vidim.
How can this be?	Kako je to lahko?
He began to see the problem.	Začel je videti problem.
Or a day.	Ali dan.
That's the only thing with it.	To je edina stvar s tem.
You have time.	Čas imaš.
I thought so much.	Toliko sem mislil.
If not, you won't.	Če ne, ne boš.
O child,.	O otrok,.
This is the person you are interested in.	To je oseba, ki vas zanima.
She is more interested in the question.	Vprašanje jo bolj zanima.
I have no money.	Nimam denarja.
He knew something was very wrong.	Vedel je, da je nekaj zelo narobe.
I can't tell you anything else.	Ne morem vam povedati ničesar drugega.
For a while, things look good.	Nekaj ​​časa so stvari videti dobro.
He did his job well.	Svoje delo je dobro opravil.
I just felt it.	Počutil sem se le.
No one will see us.	Nihče nas ne bo videl.
I tried, but I failed.	Poskušal sem, a mi ni uspelo.
And I succeeded.	In uspelo mi je.
I didn't have time for that.	Nisem imel časa za to.
I'm really going for it.	Res grem na to.
But it happened.	Vendar se je zgodilo.
That was him.	To je bil on.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
It just exists.	Samo obstaja.
He doesn't like me.	Ne mara me.
They are also a lot of work.	Prav tako so veliko dela.
I never had it.	Nikoli ga nisem imel.
I could lose my job.	Lahko bi izgubil službo.
No, that was not enough.	Ne, to ni bilo dovolj.
It wasn't true.	Ni bilo res.
I knew they wouldn't.	Vedel sem, da ne bodo.
I will definitely succeed again.	Zagotovo mi bo uspelo še enkrat.
He may never speak to me again.	Morda ne bo nikoli več govoril z mano.
I think that remains to be seen.	Mislim, da je to treba še videti.
That is how it should be done.	Tako je treba narediti.
I know you have.	Vem, da imaš.
That could be here too.	To bi lahko bilo tudi tukaj.
You have to believe me.	Moraš mi verjeti.
The question is, why and why now ?.	Vprašanje je, zakaj in zakaj zdaj?.
You saw how they are when they are together.	Videli ste, kako sta, ko sta skupaj.
We had a good time.	Imeli smo se dobro.
All in your own way.	Vse po svoje.
Fortunately, that's not the case here.	Na srečo tukaj ni tako.
And we had a very nice time.	In imeli smo se zelo lepo.
There was no time to get to know anyone else.	Ni bilo časa, da bi spoznal koga drugega.
A lot of that.	Veliko tega.
I saw.	Videl sem.
It's simple.	To je preprosto.
There is no one to see here.	Tukaj ni nikogar za videti.
Why he did it, no one knows now.	Zakaj je to storil, zdaj nihče ne ve.
Much needs to be done.	Veliko je treba narediti.
I want to do what is right.	Želim narediti, kar je prav.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
When do you want this?	Kdaj želite to?
Keep it all right.	Naj bo vse v redu.
You probably know that.	To verjetno veš.
For now, this is clearly the case.	Za zdaj je očitno tako.
Life is hard.	Življenje je težko.
She sure liked him.	Zagotovo ji je bil všeč.
It should be something.	Moral bi biti nekaj.
No one was waiting for us there.	Tam nas ni čakal nihče.
There is no such thing.	Nič takega ni.
I did go to school.	Res sem šel v šolo.
You'll see.	Boš videl.
I hope he was wrong about that.	Upam, da glede tega ni imel prav.
I had no money.	Nisem imel denarja.
None of us have anything left.	Nihče od nas nima ničesar več.
But she was.	Ali je bila.
The time was mine.	Čas je bil moj.
Everyone wants something different.	Vsak si želi nekaj drugega.
Something says.	Nekaj ​​govori.
I've seen that before.	To sem že videl.
I waited a while.	Čakal sem nekaj časa.
Not so much with us.	Pri nas ne toliko.
Like you always were.	Kot da si vedno bil.
You really can.	Res lahko.
JAZ '.	JAZ '.
I like it now.	Zdaj sem všeč.
All this together.	Vse to skupaj.
I may have done some of this myself.	Nekaj ​​od tega sem morda naredil sam.
My friend.	Moj prijatelj.
And no one knows why.	In nihče ne ve zakaj.
.	.
I didn't know whether to hope or not.	Nisem vedel, ali naj upam ali ne.
That's what I told myself.	To sem si rekel.
That's why we are.	Zato smo.
Or maybe it's you.	Ali pa si to morda ti.
I like them all.	vsi so mi všeč.
I would go to my room.	Šel bi v svojo sobo.
I was a child then.	Takrat sem bil otrok.
We don't know anything for sure yet.	Ne vemo še ničesar zagotovo.
I liked the boy.	Všeč mi je bil fant.
No it's not.	Ne je ne.
She simply did.	Preprosto je storila.
One really has to.	Človek res mora.
Something needs to be done.	Nekaj ​​je treba narediti.
They would do it, he knew.	To bodo storili, je vedel.
I know it's not.	Vem, da ni.
I hope not, because he thinks well.	Upam, da ne, saj misli dobro.
They knew what to do.	Vedeli so, kaj storiti.
Which is true.	Kar je res.
You're only human whether you like it or not.	Samo človek si, če ti je to všeč ali ne.
I don't want them.	nočem jih.
Make it as good as possible.	Naj bo kar se da dobro.
It wasn't hard.	Ni bilo težko.
So we can have our own house.	Tako imamo lahko svojo hišo.
It wasn't easy.	Ni bilo lahko.
He still didn't know why he asked.	Še vedno ni vedel, zakaj je vprašal.
Make it all right.	Naredi vse v redu.
It's nothing to me.	Zame ni nič.
In fact, I wish we could do it better.	Pravzaprav bi si želel, da bi to naredili bolje.
I saw him do that.	Videl sem ga, da to počne.
And he got there quickly.	In hitro je prišel tja.
This is an option.	To je možnost.
Yes, she said.	Lahko, je rekla.
I said he started to believe me.	Rekel sem, da mi je začel verjeti.
Sometimes it was, sometimes it wasn’t.	Včasih je bilo, včasih pa ne.
He never told us about it!	O tem nam ni nikoli povedal!
And we should leave immediately.	In morali bi takoj oditi.
In fact, it did.	Pravzaprav se je.
There is a reason for this.	Za to obstaja razlog.
I would expect that.	To bi pričakoval.
It never will.	Nikoli ne bo.
It was a matter of time.	Bilo je vprašanje časa.
I'm still afraid of him.	Še vedno se ga bojim.
Never back.	Nikoli nazaj.
They didn't do that.	Tega niso storili.
They certainly aren't.	Te zagotovo niso.
That it happened.	Da se je to zgodilo.
He knew, too.	Tudi on je vedel.
I can't even.	niti ne morem.
I don't understand why any of you did that.	Ne razumem, zakaj je kdo od vas to storil.
He does everything he says he does.	Dela vse, kar pravi, da dela.
I wish he would come.	Želim si, da bi prišel.
I was surprised it was still so early.	Bil sem presenečen, da je še tako zgodaj.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
I'm the one who needs it.	Jaz sem tisti, ki ga potrebuje.
And so on.	In tako naprej.
He did things.	Opravil je stvari.
This one is for everyone.	Ta je za vse.
And he sings.	In poje.
I really don't need that.	Tega res ne potrebujem.
I don't want to talk to you.	Nočem govoriti s tabo.
No can't.	Ne more ne.
I'm sure of that.	Prepričan sem o tem.
Who can help me?	Kdo mi lahko pomaga?
He was after me.	Bil za mano.
But now was not the time.	Zdaj pa ni bil čas.
You're actually fine.	Pravzaprav si v redu.
If I wanted to see.	Če bi hotel videti.
We had to talk about what happened.	Morali smo govoriti o tem, kaj se je zgodilo.
I must have been really mad at someone.	Moral sem biti res jezen na nekoga.
He thought not.	Mislil je, da ne.
No, it was definitely him.	Ne, zagotovo je bil on.
We know what to do.	Vemo, kaj storiti.
So we have.	Tako imamo.
You're not well.	Nisi dobro.
Never enough to know.	Nikoli dovolj vedeti.
Everyone would ask that.	To bi vsak vprašal.
He did that.	To je storil.
Now and forever.	Zdaj in za vedno.
That's what he said to himself.	To si je rekel.
Okay, go ahead.	V redu, kar naprej.
I really don’t know how to get into this.	Res ne vem, kako naj grem v to.
I believe.	jaz verjamem.
Something would happen tomorrow.	Nekaj ​​bi se zgodilo jutri.
Unfortunately, this is quite common.	To je žal precej pogosto.
I saw that.	To sem videl.
Things like.	Stvari, kot so.
I asked him if he had to speak.	Vprašal sem ga, če mora govoriti.
If you have one, this is for you.	Če ga imaš, je to zate.
There was no time for more.	Za več ni bilo časa.
I had a nice time.	Imel sem se lepo.
That was it.	To je bilo tako.
It took me a while to learn.	Potreboval sem nekaj časa, da sem se naučil.
Quite my thoughts.	Precej moje misli.
You know you want it.	Veš, da si ga želiš.
I'll give him that much.	Toliko mu bom dal.
I was just sitting there.	Samo sedel sem tam.
I can believe it.	lahko verjamem.
I don’t know anyone else who could, but maybe can.	Ne poznam nikogar drugega, ki bi lahko, a morda lahko.
She wanted to help him get better.	Želela mu je pomagati, da bo bolje.
But there is an opportunity.	Vendar je priložnost.
But maybe there’s more to it.	Morda pa je na tem še več.
The game is everything.	Igra je vse.
I came to tell you something.	Prišel sem ti nekaj povedati.
It almost seems like it's not there.	Skoraj se zdi, kot da ga ni.
Never.	Nikoli ne.
I wouldn't let him.	Ne bi mu dovolil.
I'll try to get to it tonight.	Nocoj bom poskušal priti do tega.
No, more than that.	Ne, več kot to.
The question is, is it always true.	Vprašanje je, da je vedno res.
I think you're right about that.	Mislim, da imaš v tem prav.
Which is not happening.	Kar se ne dogaja.
I never did anything to her.	Nikoli ji nisem naredil ničesar.
However, this is not an issue.	Vendar to ni vprašanje.
If he wants something, he will find it.	Če nekaj želi, bo to našel.
I've never been there before either.	Tudi nikoli prej nisem bil tam.
There was nothing here, nothing.	Tukaj ni bilo nič, nič.
I knew you would come back.	Vedel sem, da se boš vrnil.
That was my job.	To je bilo moje delo.
I will tell you now.	zdaj vam bom povedal.
I called everyone.	Vse sem poklical.
We will do that.	To bomo naredili.
All if it is.	Vse če je.
I asked how long he had been there.	Vprašal sem, koliko časa je bil tam.
I didn't do any of this alone.	Nič od tega nisem naredil sam.
Don't be too interested.	Naj vas ne zanima veliko.
I'm not so sure.	nisem tako prepričan.
He will help us.	Pomagal nam bo.
What we knew to be true was not true.	Kar smo vedeli, da je res, ni bilo res.
Time goes on.	Čas gre naprej.
This is not likely here.	To tukaj ni verjetno.
Who knows how to do it.	Kdo ve, kako je treba to narediti.
I can't do that.	Ne morem narediti tega.
You too.	Tudi ti.
That may be it.	To je lahko to.
Definitely.	Zagotovo.
He has to keep working.	Še naprej mora delati.
I don't understand anything that happened tonight.	Ne razumem ničesar, kar se je zgodilo nocoj.
If you've been once, you'll be back.	Če si bil enkrat, se boš vrnil.
What would anyone want.	Kaj bi kdo želel.
It was very likely.	Zelo verjetno je bilo.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
It will get better from there.	Od tam bo bolje.
He tried and failed.	Poskušal je in mu ni uspelo.
I just had you.	Pravkar sem te imel.
Was it true.	Ali je bilo res.
It is what it is.	Kar je, je.
Where he did not say.	Kam pa ni povedal.
No one has come to the house yet.	Nihče še ni prišel v hišo.
You should go with him.	Moral bi iti z njim.
You love your job.	Rad imaš svoje delo.
He was still good.	Še vedno je bil dober.
She didn't know.	Ni vedela.
And we have to.	In moramo.
I would like to know.	rad bi vedel.
That is very good.	To je zelo dobro.
But I don't know if it will.	Ne vem pa, če bo.
He could never tell her that.	Tega ji nikoli ni mogel povedati.
I think we will.	Mislim, da bomo.
I was there.	Bil sem tam.
He was just a boy.	Bil je samo fant.
This and much more.	To in še veliko več.
I didn't want it.	Nisem si ga želel.
He knows how to do that, so many things.	To zna narediti, toliko stvari.
We had a really, really nice time.	Imeli smo se res, res lepo.
And I don't believe I will succeed.	In ne verjamem, da mi bo uspelo.
No one said anything, she told herself.	Nihče ni nič rekel, si je rekla.
It may not be.	To morda ne bo.
In fact, it was.	Pravzaprav je bilo.
You don't have to do anything.	Nič vam ni treba narediti.
I didn't mean what you thought.	Nisem mislil, kar si mislil.
They had to stay together.	Morali so ostati skupaj.
Doing is my thing.	Delati je moja stvar.
And I will help you if you help me.	Ti pa bom pomagal, če mi boš pomagal.
I kept waiting.	Čakal sem naprej.
You should go.	Morala bi iti.
They are in me.	V meni so.
It will be difficult for a long time.	Še dolgo bo težko.
That could be it.	To bi lahko bilo.
Now we are back together.	Zdaj smo spet skupaj.
You won't die.	Ne boš umrl.
It will be fine.	V redu bo.
That's what he thought.	To je tudi mislil.
There was no need to talk much.	Ni bilo treba veliko govoriti.
It's just something else.	Samo še nekaj je.
He really didn't stay long.	Res ni ostal dolgo.
And she didn't know why.	In ni vedela zakaj.
This has not happened to us for a long time.	To se pri nas že dolgo ni zgodilo.
He did so much for me.	Toliko je naredil zame.
That way he will feel better.	Tako se bo počutil bolje.
They went home.	Šla sta domov.
I couldn't tell.	nisem mogel povedati.
I knew it would be fine.	Vedel sem, da bo v redu.
She said she was.	Rekla je, da je.
He wanted you.	Želel te je.
You said it yourself.	Sam si rekel.
Something is very wrong.	Nekaj ​​je zelo narobe.
I don't know, something more.	Ne vem, nekaj več.
So it was.	Tako je bilo tako.
She liked him immediately.	Takoj ji je bil všeč.
I wouldn't give that to anyone.	Tega ne bi dal nikomur.
Me neither.	Jaz tudi ne.
Nobody knows anything.	Nihče ne ve ničesar.
We saw that.	To smo videli.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
I did not expect.	nisem pričakoval.
He needs money.	Potrebuje denar.
You had.	Imeli ste.
Good enough to eat.	Dovolj dobro za jesti.
I didn't work at all.	Sploh nisem delal.
And if that were the case, it could be true.	In če bi bilo tako, bi lahko bilo res.
He probably thought he was, too.	Verjetno je tudi sam mislil, da je.
I feel like a child again.	Spet se počutim kot otrok.
You know how it is.	Saj veš kako je.
I don't think anyone will.	Mislim, da nihče ne bo.
They soon knew something was wrong.	Kmalu so vedeli, da je nekaj narobe.
I didn't buy anything.	Nič nisem kupil.
And that's okay too.	In tudi to je v redu.
Was that really you?	Si bil to res ti?
He couldn't help himself.	Ni si mogel pomagati.
He left and never came back.	Odšel je in se ni več vrnil.
I won't see you tonight.	Nocoj te ne bom videl.
Much remains to be done.	Še veliko je treba narediti.
I had a lot of work to do.	Imel sem veliko dela.
He tried to get home tonight, but failed.	Nocoj je poskušal priti domov, a mu ni uspelo.
It's actually about time.	Pravzaprav je pravi čas.
It was nice to see you.	Lepo te je bilo videti.
No one can tell.	Nihče ne more povedati.
She said she was sorry.	Rekla je, da ji je žal.
I've seen something like this before.	Nekaj ​​takega sem že videl.
And came back.	In prišel nazaj.
She's not afraid of him anymore.	Ne boji se ga več.
No one knew there was a child in the room.	Nihče ni vedel, da je otrok v sobi.
And he still had his life.	In še vedno je imel svoje življenje.
You never know.	Nikoli se ne ve.
I already have the money.	Denar že imam.
Let him do it himself.	Naj to naredi sam.
Or maybe before.	Ali pa morda že prej.
What's going on here.	Kar se tukaj dogaja.
That's what we did.	Tako smo naredili.
Probably not.	Verjetno ne.
He's still here.	Še vedno je tukaj.
What if .	Kaj če .
I shouldn't go alone.	Ne bi smel iti sam.
However, this is not the case this week.	Vendar ta teden ni tako.
It's a game.	To je igra.
Someone was home.	Nekdo je bil doma.
It was probably good.	Verjetno je bilo dobro.
I gave it back to him.	Vrnil sem mu ga.
A week, maybe.	Teden, morda.
I'm not even sure.	Sploh nisem prepričan.
He was right, too.	Tudi on je imel prav.
It's about what he does.	Gre za to, kar počne.
She was alone.	Bila je sama.
I haven't seen that either.	Tudi jaz tega nisem videl.
Like this day.	Kot ta dan.
One does not really need it.	Človek tega pravzaprav ne potrebuje.
I’m afraid of what might happen next, even if it doesn’t.	Bojim se, kaj bi se lahko zgodilo naprej, tudi če ni.
If you haven’t had it in a while, it’s really good.	Če ga že nekaj časa niste imeli, je res dober.
I just did.	Pravkar sem naredil.
Everything, everything mine.	Vse, vse moje.
I got this this morning.	To sem dobil zjutraj.
He just went to the house.	Pravkar je šel v hišo.
I’m not sure if much else.	Nisem prepričan, če veliko drugega.
I could forget about it.	Lahko bi pozabil na to.
It all seems to interest me.	Zdi se, da to vse zanima.
Just told.	Pravkar povedal.
Who knows, it probably is.	Kdo bi vedel, verjetno je.
I've been.	Sem bil.
I knew everything.	vse sem vedel.
She said that couldn't be true.	Rekla je, da to ne more biti res.
He doesn't actually sing.	Pravzaprav ne poje.
Not like us.	Ne kot mi.
Maybe it would be good.	Mogoče bi bilo dobro.
There was nothing else he could do.	Nič drugega ni mogel storiti.
Nobody comes out.	Nihče ne pride ven.
I can't do this alone.	Tega ne morem storiti sam.
You called.	Ti si poklical.
She has done this before and could do it again.	To je storila že prej in lahko bi to storila še enkrat.
There are a few of them.	Nekaj ​​pa jih.
But it's hard with us.	Težko pa je z nami.
And my own.	In svojo.
And it never will be.	In nikoli ne bo.
Very good looking.	Zelo dobro videti.
It was a long time ago.	Bilo je že dolgo nazaj.
I already know who he is	že vem kdo je
I didn't hear you come and.	Nisem te slišal priti in.
This is my chance.	To je moja priložnost.
He said instead.	Namesto tega je rekel.
I think it was just me.	Mislim, da sem bil samo jaz.
I could talk.	Lahko bi govoril.
They didn't do that.	Tega niso storili.
There was something in what happened.	Nekaj ​​je bilo v tem, kar se je zgodilo.
We have time.	Imamo čas.
He didn't even see me there.	Tam me sploh ni videl.
Because it's really true.	Ker je res res.
That's what he said.	Tako je rekel.
That's not right.	To ni prav.
Maybe he was.	Mogoče je bil.
I think he thought not.	Mislim, da je mislil, da ni.
And so it is.	In tako je.
They are interested in that.	To jih zanima.
Not much time, but maybe enough.	Ni veliko časa, a morda dovolj.
I decided not to.	Odločil sem se, da ne.
It's too much, too much.	Preveč je, preveč.
So we have to leave now.	Zato moramo zdaj oditi.
That doesn't help.	To nič ne pomaga.
I think this kid has come into his own.	Mislim, da je ta otrok prišel na svoje.
I already felt better.	Počutil sem se že bolje.
I don't want him either.	Tudi jaz ga nočem.
Please, just don't.	Prosim, samo ne.
I will never say ‘maybe’.	Nikoli ne bom rekel 'morda'.
Everything is completely simple and obvious.	Vse je popolnoma preprosto in očitno.
And there are many.	In veliko jih je.
You are completely alone.	Popolnoma ste sami.
That was.	To je bilo.
I'm nothing anymore.	nisem več nič.
I did a good job.	Opravil sem dobro delo.
I'm there.	Tam sem.
However, this is no longer the case.	Vendar temu ni več tako.
It's like that again.	Spet je tako.
I just wanted to eat something.	Samo nekaj sem hotel jesti.
Both.	Oba.
I wouldn't know.	ne bi vedel.
I believe it will.	Verjamem, da bo.
And that was fine.	In to je bilo v redu.
I’m not sure that would be possible.	Nisem prepričan, da bi bilo to mogoče.
I know what you're going to say.	Vem, kaj boš rekel.
But I told her a lot.	Vendar sem ji povedal veliko.
It would be nice not to see her.	Prav dobro bi bilo, da je ne bi videl.
And there were many.	In bilo jih je veliko.
I could be here.	Lahko bi bil tukaj.
He wanted what he wanted.	Želel je, kar je hotel.
I mean nothing.	Mislim nič.
None of this is right.	Nič od tega ni prav.
Which was not always possible.	Kar pa ni bilo vedno mogoče.
Now she knew she would have to.	Zdaj je vedela, da bo morala.
That seems to help a little.	Zdi se, da to malo pomaga.
This is not true.	To ni res.
It was a little back.	Bilo je malo nazaj.
I wanted to go there too.	Tudi jaz sem želel iti tja.
I got there.	sem prišel tja.
I understand too.	Tudi jaz razumem.
He tried to see.	Poskušal je videti.
She said she had no money.	Rekla je, da nima denarja.
I can't go back home.	Ne morem nazaj domov.
Why not?	Zakaj pa ne bi.
I hope you like it!!!!.	Upam, da vam je všeč!!!!.
I hope you have a nice time.	Upam, da se boste imeli lepo.
I could leave.	Lahko bi odšel.
Yes, it's that simple.	Da, tako preprosto je.
It will be fine.	Dobro bo.
You know, it's that simple.	Veste, tako preprosto je.
I really like it.	Zelo všeč meni.
We should talk about that.	O tem bi morali govoriti.
He really knows me.	Res me pozna.
He will be back.	Vrnil se bo.
No, we can't do that.	Ne, tega ne moremo storiti.
I would never forget him.	Nikoli ga ne bi pozabil.
Now it’s like he never was.	Zdaj je, kot da ga nikoli ni bilo.
Like it's never enough.	Kot da nikoli ni dovolj.
In fact, it still is.	Pravzaprav je še vedno.
Nothing was as it seemed.	Nič ni bilo tako, kot se je zdelo.
This is simply not true.	To preprosto ni res.
This is nothing.	To ni nič.
You did well.	Dobro si naredil.
It seemed highly unlikely.	Zdelo se je zelo malo verjetno.
I didn't get it.	Nisem ga dobil.
No one spoke.	Nihče ni govoril.
Just nice for tonight.	Samo lepo za nocoj.
It was back and forth.	Bilo je naprej in nazaj.
Sometimes life is beautiful.	Včasih je življenje lepo.
I really needed that.	To sem res potreboval.
He went out there.	Šel je tja ven.
It just felt too good.	Preprosto sem se počutil preveč dobro.
Mine won't look like that.	Moj ne bo videti tako.
He helped me a lot.	Zelo mi je pomagal.
He just needs help.	Preprosto potrebuje pomoč.
I can't see her right now.	Trenutno je ne morem videti.
There is nothing here.	Tukaj ni ničesar.
Maybe he already has one.	Mogoče ga že ima.
That was just a few days ago.	To je bilo le nekaj dni nazaj.
No one had it.	Nihče ga ni imel.
That's how he got me.	Tako me je dobil.
He had to know that.	To je moral vedeti.
This has never happened to me before.	To se mi še nikoli ni zgodilo.
He could stay with us tonight.	Lahko bi ostal pri nas nocoj.
I'm not sure that will happen.	Nisem prepričan, da se bo to zgodilo.
It was as he expected.	Bilo je tako, kot je pričakoval.
You will have to do everything.	Narediti boste morali vse.
But it was true.	Vendar je bilo res.
If you have me, this is it.	Če me boš imel, je to.
That's what he's doing here.	To je tisto, kar počne tukaj.
He wanted to go home.	Rad je hotel domov.
You should do a lot of things.	Moral bi narediti veliko stvari.
That doesn't help either.	Tudi to ne pomaga.
We have a lot of work ahead of us.	Pred nami je veliko dela.
Maybe someone died.	Mogoče je kdo umrl.
Maybe really.	Mogoče res.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
What if it's just.	Kaj pa, če je samo.
That's not enough.	Tega ni dovolj.
That's a lot more.	To je veliko več.
You have to do it no matter what.	To moraš storiti, ne glede na vse.
I can't go back.	ne morem nazaj.
It's true.	Res je.
He knows what he's doing.	Ve kaj dela.
Because she had to.	Ker je morala.
He waited no more.	Nič več ni čakal.
I know it, you know it.	Jaz to vem, ti veš to.
Every one of us.	Vsak od nas.
And now me.	In zdaj jaz.
Him! ' 	Njega!'
he said.	rekel je.
I would too.	tudi jaz bi bil.
She wanted him then, too.	Takrat si ga je tudi želela.
No, that's enough!	Ne, dovolj je!
He wanted to be very often.	Zelo pogosto je hotel biti.
I told him it was a game.	Rekel sem mu, da je to igra.
It seemed out of place.	Zdelo se mu je na mestu.
The day before.	Dan prej.
I'm glad of that.	Vesel sem tega.
It's really nice to see you here again.	Res lepo vas je spet videti tukaj.
I just made up my mind.	Pravkar sem se odločil.
I don't even know you.	Sploh te ne poznam.
I will work and you will go to school.	Jaz bom delal, ti pa v šolo.
I'm totally on it.	Popolnoma sem na tem.
There was just nothing.	Samo nič ni bilo.
It's just not there.	Preprosto ga ni.
She liked him then.	Takrat ji je bil všeč.
Maybe he saw, maybe not.	Mogoče je videl, morda ne.
You saw what was going on.	Videli ste, kaj se dogaja.
We have to move on.	Moramo naprej.
It's still true.	Še vedno je res.
I know where he went.	Vem, kam je šel.
I don't want to stay here.	Nočem ostati tukaj.
I know that's true.	Vem, da je to res.
Something like that.	Nekaj ​​takega.
No one wanted to talk to me anymore.	Nihče več ni hotel govoriti z mano.
And so they did.	In tako so tudi storili.
That may not be the case.	To morda ni tako.
I didn't think it was good.	Ni se mi zdelo dobro.
He knew where he was.	Vedel je, kje je.
As fast as possible now.	Tako hitro, kot je mogoče zdaj.
First, they haven’t done anything yet.	Prvič, še niso naredili ničesar.
I was never really home.	Nikoli res nisem bil doma.
He’s a good guy, but he also likes to talk.	Je dober fant, a tudi rad govori.
Something else.	Nekaj ​​drugega.
It's not enough.	Ni dovolj.
I wasn't around the room that much.	Nisem bil toliko po sobi.
I don't know if that's still the case.	Ne vem, ali je še vedno tako.
I didn't need it.	Ni mi bilo treba.
I was tired that day.	Tisti dan sem bil utrujen.
He wouldn't hear from me again.	Ne bi več slišal zame.
No one can be sure.	Nihče ne more biti prepričan.
Apparently not here.	Očitno ne tukaj.
Everyone had their work to do.	Vsak je imel svoje delo.
It was all over.	Vse je bilo.
Long enough for both.	Dovolj dolgo za oba.
As if it were mine.	Kot bi bil moj.
He got what he wanted.	Dobil je, kar je hotel.
He needed a job.	Potreboval je službo.
it's true.	res je.
He came and went.	Prišel je in odšel.
He succeeded because he knew he would succeed.	Uspelo mu je, ker je vedel, da mu bo uspelo.
Not anymore.	Ne več.
He looks like he's up to something.	Videti je, kot da nekaj namerava.
He wanted to get out.	Hotel je priti ven.
I didn't do anything else.	Nič drugega nisem storil.
They had a good time.	Lepo so se imeli.
Three in the morning.	Tri zjutraj.
I don't see that as a problem.	To ne vidim kot problem.
Also in this.	Tudi v tem.
He wasn't sure what he intended to do.	Ni bil prepričan, kaj namerava narediti.
Maybe I would.	Mogoče bi.
No one told me how to do it.	Nihče mi ni povedal, kako to storiti.
It wasn't the first time.	Ni bilo prvič.
I didn’t want to know if he could do it.	Nisem hotel vedeti, ali lahko to stori.
Everyone who knows something knows that.	To ve vsak, ki kaj ve.
You know you have a day.	Veš, da imaš dan.
Or about that.	Ali pa o tem.
Now that's gone too.	Zdaj tudi tega ni več.
This has never happened before.	To se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
He really was.	Res je bil.
I just want to be alone today.	Samo želim biti sam, danes.
We have to go now.	Takoj moramo iti.
And that's how I would play it.	In tako bi to igral.
She certainly knew about it.	Zagotovo je vedela za to.
That is absolutely right.	To je popolnoma prav.
Who put him there?	Kdo ga je dal tja?
Nothing to say.	Nič za povedati.
However, this had to be done.	Vendar je bilo to treba storiti.
I'm doing very well.	Zelo dobro mi gre.
You will know better than I do.	Ti boš vedel bolje kot jaz.
Can anyone help me with this?	Mi lahko kdo pomaga pri tem?
Which is.	Kar je.
That's fine.	To je v redu.
I wonder what he thinks.	Zanima me, kaj si misli.
Obviously you will have to do more.	Očitno boste morali narediti več.
I didn’t ask how long he’s been there or what he wants.	Nisem vprašal, koliko časa je že tam ali kaj želi.
And so was that.	Pa je bilo tudi to.
Some of it.	Nekaj ​​od tega.
If she wasn't already.	Če že ni bila.
He went home.	Odšel je domov.
This is not a question.	To ni vprašanje.
She didn't do anything wrong herself.	Sama ni storila nič narobe.
This needs to be done sooner.	To je treba storiti prej.
He was a good man and he was my friend.	Bil je dober človek in bil je moj prijatelj.
I didn't really like it.	Ni mi bilo zelo všeč.
He didn’t expect to find much.	Ni pričakoval, da bo našel veliko.
She might like that.	To bi ji lahko bilo všeč.
Sam didn't want to go out.	Sam pa ni hotel iti ven.
It's not right here.	Tukaj ni prav.
Nothing else needs to be done.	Nič drugega ni treba storiti.
He says there will be work for me.	Pravi, da bo tam delo zame.
No, she wasn't.	Ne, ni bila.
Maybe that’s what he thinks, and maybe it’s true.	Morda je to tisto, kar misli, in morda je res.
Nobody would buy it.	Nihče ga ne bi kupil.
He promised help.	Obljubil je pomoč.
Good time.	Dober čas.
She was what it seemed.	Bila je to, kar se je zdelo.
It is anything but.	Je vse prej kot.
This is very difficult for me.	To mi je zelo težko.
And now this.	In zdaj to.
It seemed like there was no time.	Zdelo se je, kot da ni časa.
You can't make it at home.	Doma ga ne moreš narediti.
I don't know what you mean.	Ne vem, kaj mislite.
It doesn't do anything.	Nič ne dela.
Maybe everything is fine now.	Mogoče je zdaj vse v redu.
There always seemed to be more to know.	Zdelo se je, da je vedno treba vedeti več.
Without knowing it.	Ne da bi to vedel.
This is what you are all here for.	To je tisto, za kar ste vsi tukaj.
He expected.	Pričakoval je.
It was difficult.	Bilo je težko.
He could never even see him.	Nikoli ga ni mogel niti videti.
I will never do anything.	Nikoli ne bom ničesar naredil.
You would never know it.	Tega nikoli ne bi vedeli.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikomur ni povedal ničesar.
You are my father.	Ti si moj oče.
It looks almost perfectly fine.	Videti je skoraj popolnoma dobro.
I don't really know why.	Ne vem pa res zakaj.
She knew what she was thinking.	Vedela je, kaj misli.
You know nothing about why you're here.	Nič ne veš zakaj si tukaj.
Little or no one knew what he thought or who he was.	Le malo ali nihče ni vedel, kaj misli ali kdo je.
I was.	Bilo je.
She didn't feel well enough.	Zdelo se ji ni dovolj dobro.
And that's not it.	In to ni to.
I think you should come with me.	Mislim, da bi moral iti z mano.
If that's what you want.	Če je to tisto, kar želite.
That's not right.	To ni prav.
I wonder how it was.	Sprašujem se, kako je bilo to.
I don't think anyone can!.	Mislim, da nihče ne more!.
I could be here too.	Lahko bi bil tudi tukaj.
I do not understand that.	Tega ne razumem.
It's nice to be back.	Lepo je biti nazaj.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
This is hard work.	To je težko delo.
We just did that.	Pravkar smo to naredili.
I am alone sometimes.	Sama sem včasih.
It just happened.	Pravkar se je zgodilo.
If only it were that simple.	Ko bi le bilo tako preprosto.
It's pretty simple.	To je precej preprosto.
Or for life, it seems.	Ali za življenje, se zdi.
seriously.	resno.
So very simple.	Tako zelo preprosto.
Really, really good thing.	Res, res dobra stvar.
He was so happy and rightly so.	Bil je tako vesel in prav je tako.
He said no to many things.	Za veliko stvari je rekel ne.
But he did none of these things.	Vendar ni storil nič od tega.
He will always be with us.	Vedno bo z nami.
I did it earlier today.	Danes sem ga naredil prej.
He had never felt this way before.	Še nikoli se ni tako počutil.
But I didn't say when.	Nisem pa rekel kdaj.
This is a long question.	To je dolgo vprašanje.
True friend.	Pravi prijatelj.
That's how it happened.	Tako se je zgodilo.
This is almost not true.	To skoraj ni res.
These are mine.	Te so moje.
I was really lucky.	Res sem imel srečo.
That would be a.	To bi bil a.
This may seem true, but it is not.	To se morda zdi res, vendar ni.
And don't be sorry.	In naj ti ne bo žal.
But we know they're not.	Vendar vemo, da niso.
Nothing else.	Nič drugega.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​ni bilo v redu.
He has a hard job and needs help.	Ima težko delo in potrebuje pomoč.
It used to be a problem.	Včasih je bil problem.
It's nothing.	Nič ni.
I am something else.	jaz sem nekaj drugega.
She was good to me.	Bila je dobra do mene.
I am very busy.	Zelo sem zaposlen.
I think so.	Mislim, da je tako.
I'm sorry for nothing.	Žal mi je za nič.
We will have children.	Imeli bomo otroke.
No no.	Ne, ne.
He said nothing about what he saw.	Nič ni rekel o tem, kar je videl.
Once upon a time, just not today.	Nekoč, samo ne danes.
But they didn't know enough.	A niso vedeli dovolj.
He knows how.	On ve kako.
That's how it always has been and probably always will be.	Tako je bilo vedno in verjetno vedno bo.
when.	kdaj.
Not the next day, not the next day.	Ne naslednji dan, ne naslednji dan.
I had to tell her.	Moral sem ji povedati.
The reason is this.	Razlog je ta.
It is all that, but so much more.	To je vse to, a še veliko več.
It can't be.	To ne more biti.
Or they can be.	Ali pa so lahko.
If he went anywhere at all.	Če je sploh kam šel.
But that was not all.	A tudi to ni bilo vse.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ne vem kaj mi je.
But it wasn't always like that.	Vendar ni bilo vedno tako.
If he did, he succeeded.	Če je to storil, mu je uspelo.
Right, she told herself.	Prav, si je rekla.
I heard all that.	Vse to sem slišal.
He had never wanted anything so badly.	Še nikoli si ni ničesar tako zelo želel.
I know you will be angry.	Vem, da boš jezen.
I think we were right back.	Mislim, da smo bili takoj nazaj.
How to play it.	Kako ga igrati.
You never saw me.	Nikoli me nisi videl.
Maybe it was.	Mogoče je bilo tako.
I know there is a possibility for that.	Vem, da obstaja možnost za to.
Here's how it plays.	Tukaj je, kako se igra.
You can't see him.	Ne moreš ga videti.
The boy is angry at everything.	Fant je jezen na vse.
He knew they were.	Vedel je, da so.
We just have to.	Samo moramo.
And he needed me.	In potreboval me je.
If I wanted to.	Če bi hotel.
I'm glad it worked.	Vesel sem, da je uspelo.
I had to.	Moral sem.
It was my village again.	Spet je bila moja vas.
He didn't want to leave.	Ni hotel oditi.
I can't do anything.	nič ne morem.
And that will definitely be a problem.	In to bo zagotovo problem.
My dad just likes to talk.	Moj oče preprosto rad govori.
He didn't expect that.	Tega ni pričakoval.
I didn't know where to go now.	Nisem vedel, kam naj zdaj.
Should not.	Ne bi smel.
There was nothing to eat for many, many days.	Veliko, veliko dni ni bilo ničesar za jesti.
He didn't need to know, he told himself.	Ni mu bilo treba vedeti, si je rekel.
Before him.	Pred njim.
A lot of someone.	Veliko nekoga.
And sometimes not.	In včasih ne.
But that simply hasn't happened yet.	A to se preprosto še ni zgodilo.
Something is right.	Nekaj ​​ima prav.
This is a well.	To je dobro.
She was alone.	Bila je sama.
So much can go wrong.	Toliko gre lahko narobe.
I haven't heard anything about it.	Nič nisem slišal o tem.
Not so long ago.	Ne tako dolgo nazaj.
He won a lot.	Zmagal je veliko.
I totally failed at that.	Tega mi popolnoma ni uspelo.
There's a lot of them.	Veliko jih je.
It's time to work.	Čas je za delo.
I started well enough.	Začel sem dovolj dobro.
None of us would.	Nihče od nas ne bi.
Now or never.	Zdaj ali nikoli.
I know it will be hard to talk about it.	Vem, da bo težko govoriti o tem.
This is usually not the case.	To običajno ni tako.
We do not know.	Ne vemo.
There was a lot of that.	Tega je bilo kar veliko.
I just thought you meant someone else.	Samo mislil sem, da misliš nekoga drugega.
Just do it.	Samo naredi.
We are lucky to have him there.	Imamo srečo, da ga imamo tam.
After that, he's out.	Po tem je ven.
I hope you like it.	Upam, da vam je všeč.
We only have a few more years.	Samo še nekaj let imamo.
No one is there.	Nihče ni tam.
Obviously, that's not true yet.	Očitno to še ni res.
This is not normal.	To ni običajno.
Where have we been?	Kje smo bili?
Tell me what you think.	Povej mi, kaj misliš.
My father gave it to me in the morning.	Oče mi ga je dal zjutraj.
You know this is wrong.	Veš, da je to narobe.
I have enough.	Dovolj mi je.
He told me.	Povedal mi je.
Good question!	Dobro vprašanje!
This is no longer the case.	To ni več tako.
Yes, he had.	Da, imel je.
I moved on.	Šel sem naprej.
I tried to do everything myself.	Vse sem poskušal narediti sam.
And there was something.	In nekaj je bilo.
This can be done as follows.	To je mogoče storiti na naslednji način.
Someone has to do it.	Nekdo mora to narediti.
I will have a nice time.	Imel se bom lepo.
Because he wants to see her.	Ker jo želi videti.
He looked tired.	Videti je bil utrujen.
I think he came here because of you.	Mislim, da je prišel sem zaradi tebe.
Can anyone help me.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga.
He immediately felt better.	Takoj se je počutil bolje.
It's obvious he has it.	Očitno je, da ima to.
I think that could be fine too.	Mislim, da bi tudi to lahko bilo v redu.
I do not know when.	Ne vem kdaj.
I think he's there.	Mislim, da je tam.
And that's all he wanted to say.	In toliko je hotel povedati.
I always am.	Vedno sem.
It could be.	Lahko bi bilo.
Please, you have to believe me.	Prosim, moraš mi verjeti.
He certainly didn't have it.	Zagotovo ga ni imel.
And the day after that.	In dan po tem.
So glad you're with us today.	Tako vesel, da si danes z nami.
And I know a lot about that.	In o tem vem veliko.
I can't go back, I can't go forward.	Ne morem nazaj, ne morem naprej.
I felt much better after that.	Po tem sem se počutil veliko bolje.
It just seemed.	Samo zdelo se je.
We had a nice time.	Bilo nam je lepo.
He didn't know how he got there.	Ni vedel, kako je prišel tja.
He spoke only when he wanted to.	Govoril je samo takrat, ko je hotel.
And after that, that was it for me.	In po tem je bilo zame to to.
It's always been that way.	Vedno je bilo tako.
I didn't ask for a job.	Nisem prosil za delo.
And you saw what happened to that.	In videli ste, kaj se je s tem zgodilo.
It was nice.	Bilo je lepo.
I told him a lot that I knew was true.	Povedal sem mu veliko, za kar bi vedel, da je res.
There was little to say.	Malo je bilo za povedati.
But I would go out in a hurry.	Vendar bi šla ven na hitro.
I understand that.	Razumem, da.
I wouldn't have known that at the time.	Tega takrat ne bi vedel.
I don't believe that will be the case.	Ne verjamem, da bo tako.
He decided to work from home.	Odločil se je za delo doma.
For the first time, I felt like a human being.	Prvič sem se počutil kot človek.
I came here alone.	Sem sem prišel sam.
He said nothing.	Nič ni rekel.
I don't know how many days it was.	Ne vem koliko dni je bilo.
But it will happen.	Vendar se bo to zgodilo.
It's been there for years.	Tam je že leta.
He probably has almost none.	Verjetno jih skoraj nima.
We won't do anything.	Nič ne bomo storili.
It was like going back in time.	Bilo je, kot bi se vrnil v čas.
He had a chance.	Imel je možnost.
Soon after.	Kmalu za tem.
I don't see anything else.	Ne vidim nič drugega.
We know he loves his job.	Vemo, da ima rad svoje delo.
I've never seen her.	Nikoli je nisem videl.
There is nothing left.	Nič ni več.
Just more.	Samo bolj.
For a long time, nothing happened.	Dolgo časa se ni nič zgodilo.
I heard that	To sem slišal
I knew he would come.	Vedel sem, da bo prišel.
Nothing seemed to happen.	Zdelo se je, da se ni nič zgodilo.
I really like them.	Zelo so mi všeč.
You can't see them.	Ne moreš jih videti.
I said he was gone.	Rekel sem, da ga ni več.
I wouldn't like it.	Ne bi mi bilo všeč.
You can't stay here.	Ne moreš ostati tukaj.
I really liked that.	To mi je bilo zelo všeč.
At the moment, no one is either.	Trenutno tudi nihče ne.
It's hard to believe.	Težko je verjeti.
He didn't ask if she was alone.	Ni vprašal, ali je sama.
Sometimes I do that.	Včasih to počnem.
Maybe not.	Morda pa ne.
And really, more than not.	In res, bolj kot ne.
And they saw nothing wrong with that.	In v tem niso videli nič narobe.
But he did not find him.	Vendar ga ni našel.
I saw him at a party.	Videl sem ga na zabavi.
That's what you said.	Tako si rekel.
He didn't feel well.	Ni se počutil dobro.
They were on us.	Bili so na nas.
It would be very difficult.	Bilo bi zelo težko.
I wish everyone here had some of that.	Želim si, da bi vsi tukaj imeli nekaj od tega.
I have to play better in the future.	Za naprej moram igrati bolje.
But I don't understand that.	Jaz pa tega ne razumem.
Please, you have to believe me now.	Prosim, zdaj mi moraš verjeti.
It's so good.	Tako je dobro.
He had nothing to do with it.	Ni imel nič s tem.
It's good to see you again.	Dobro te je spet videti.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
We were too.	Tudi mi smo bili.
Yes, that might be it.	Da, morda je prav to.
I used to ask.	Včasih sem vprašal.
I would love to.	Zelo rad bi.
I could buy that.	To bi lahko kupil.
He didn't ask her once.	Ni je enkrat vprašal.
He never told.	Nikoli ni povedal.
He spoke very, very well.	Govoril je zelo, zelo dobro.
Which is normal.	Kar običajno je.
She had to work in the morning.	Zjutraj je morala delati.
There will be a lot of people there.	Tam bo veliko ljudi.
It's been since then.	Od takrat je.
Maybe it was that simple.	Mogoče je bilo tako preprosto.
Now that would never happen.	Zdaj se to ne bi nikoli zgodilo.
I don't think it could be simpler than that.	Mislim, da bolj preprosto od tega ne more biti.
Just one more time.	Samo še enkrat.
And maybe it was.	In morda je bilo tako.
And he has way too much money.	In ima veliko preveč denarja.
I didn't want anyone else.	Nikogar drugega nisem hotel.
None of us would have.	Nihče od nas ne bi imel.
He should be home now.	Zdaj bi moral biti doma.
It's just that.	To je preprosto to.
I don't believe that anymore.	Tega ne verjamem več.
That you don’t know what it is that you know.	Da ne veš, kaj je tisto, kar veš.
It was that.	Je bilo to.
I believe you are right.	Verjamem, da imaš prav.
Certainly not us.	Zagotovo nismo.
She didn't know what to tell him.	Ni vedela, kaj bi mu rekla.
I just did something wrong.	Pravkar sem naredil nekaj narobe.
Maybe there was something to it.	Mogoče je bilo kaj na tem.
I did something.	Nekaj ​​sem naredil.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Več ni mogel.
Very nice for the first time.	Zelo lepo za prvič.
It was really really hard.	Bilo je res res težko.
It's hard to talk.	Govoriti je težko.
I was very.	bil sem zelo.
If you do, you'll be in trouble.	Če boš, boš imel težave.
I didn't want to believe it.	Temu nisem hotel verjeti.
She didn't tell me anything about it.	Nič mi ni rekla o tem.
I want you.	Želim si te.
I really didn't.	res nisem.
I did more than that.	Naredil sem več kot to.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
Why are you always angry?	Zakaj si vedno jezen?
After that, he was alone.	Po tem je bil sam.
I'm not there yet.	Nisem še tam.
I'm glad to see you.	Vesel sem, da te vidim.
I will leave.	odšel bom.
That's why we're here tonight.	Zato smo nocoj tukaj.
I would get there.	Prišel bi tja.
He just didn't know.	Samo ni vedel.
He's your friend.	On je tvoj prijatelj.
More than he wants.	Več, kot si želi.
Everyone had it.	Vsi so ga imeli.
I don't know what to do with him.	Ne vem kaj naj z njim.
I was home.	bil sem doma.
Nothing like this has ever happened.	Kaj takega se še ni zgodilo.
It's true.	Res je.
He has his whole life ahead of him.	Vse življenje je pred njim.
I understand the time.	Razumem čas.
He lost his job and he should have.	Izgubil je službo in moral bi jo.
Maybe it interests me and you too.	Morda zanima mene in tudi tebe.
You're tired.	Utrujen si.
And so I did.	In tako sem tudi storil.
Who would it be.	Ko bi bilo.
This is very common.	To je zelo pogosto.
But he didn't know everything.	Ni pa vedel vsega.
Not sure if it is.	Nisem prepričan, če je.
It's nice to play.	Lepo je igrati.
That’s why I saw them for the first time.	Zaradi tega sem jih prvič videl.
It is, but it is not.	Je, pa vendar ni.
Here we are.	Tukaj smo.
He wouldn't tell me what he found.	Ne bi mi povedal, kaj je našel.
We are in this together.	Skupaj smo v tem.
Just like you would make it at home.	Tako kot bi ga naredili doma.
I’m a little tired and I don’t feel too well.	Malo sem utrujen in se ne počutim preveč dobro.
You never have to go out.	Nikoli ti ni treba ven.
Just this week !.	Samo ta teden!.
I don't want to know.	nočem vedeti.
It's not like you.	To ni kot ti.
That's what I did.	Tako sem storil.
And something is better than nothing.	In nekaj je bolje kot nič.
It will never be again.	Nikoli več ne bo.
It seemed so.	Tako se je zdelo.
He sat and waited.	Sedel je in čakal.
I'm still not sure how.	Še vedno nisem prepričan, kako.
Maybe there is nothing here.	Mogoče tukaj ni ničesar.
Because he has no children.	Ker nima otrok.
That could work.	To bi lahko uspelo.
No one can leave.	Nihče ne more oditi.
I have to go back to school.	Moram nazaj v šolo.
It wouldn't be much.	Ne bi bilo veliko.
Maybe that was okay.	Mogoče je bilo to v redu.
I'm going out.	jaz grem ven.
I have to play.	Moram igrati.
But there was something.	Nekaj ​​pa je bilo.
he said.	rekel je.
He is very good.	Zelo dober je.
Only me can be felt.	Počuti se samo jaz.
In fact, they already are.	Pravzaprav so že.
I didn't think it would be like that.	Nisem si mislil, da bo tako.
What he knew was true.	Kar je vedel je, da je res.
That's not why you're here.	Nisi zato tukaj.
Why would .	Zakaj bi .
But it's not what you think it is.	Vendar ni to, kar mislite, da je.
And this is quite common.	In to je precej pogosto.
That's what it's for.	Za to je.
You didn't want her to be alone.	Nisi želel, da bi bila sama.
Nothing but trouble.	Nič drugega kot težave.
If only we were.	Samo da smo.
No, they really are.	Ne, res jih.
I'm sorry.	Žal mi je.
It was very difficult to leave.	Zelo težko je bilo oditi.
I already told you.	Sem ti že povedal.
I will never wish, you will see for yourself.	Nikoli si ne bom želel, to boš videl sam.
I do this every day.	To počnem vsak dan.
Back to work.	Nazaj na delo.
After that, he left.	Po tem je odšel.
I just couldn't.	Preprosto nisem mogel.
That happened.	To se je zgodilo.
Not a problem at all.	Sploh ni problem.
He always says that.	To vedno pravi.
I asked her.	sem jo vprašal.
I would need that kind of help.	Potreboval bi tako pomoč.
You can be better than me.	Lahko si boljši od mene.
Because she should do it.	Ker bi to morala storiti.
But sometimes it’s not that simple.	Vendar včasih ni tako preprosto.
You don't have to tell anyone.	Ni ti treba nikomur povedati.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nič nisem naredil narobe.
We succeeded.	Nam je uspelo.
He's back again.	Spet je nazaj.
I wish you knew that then.	Želim si, da bi to takrat vedeli.
Good for you.	Dobro zate.
But she never told him anything.	Vendar mu ni nikoli ničesar rekla.
And yet you are here.	In vendar ste tukaj.
Whether it will continue to be so remains to be seen.	Ali bo tako še naprej, bomo še videli.
I don't want to do anything.	Ničesar ne želim delati.
I thought he could play.	Mislil sem, da zna igrati.
We will be there.	Mi bomo tam.
I see what cannot be there.	Vidim, kar tam ne more biti.
He just went to do it.	Samo šel je to narediti.
Know.	Veš.
I couldn't even.	Niti ne bi mogel.
In this way .	Na ta način .
He comes to me.	Pride k meni.
There are many things to see.	Veliko stvari je za videti.
And always will be.	In vedno bo.
I was here.	Bil sem tukaj.
I don't know if I would even try to help her.	Ne vem, ali bi ji sploh poskušal pomagati.
I don't think I should be here.	Mislim, da ne bi smel biti tukaj.
Which would be better.	Kar bi bilo bolje.
And so he said.	In tako rekel.
So they are gone.	Tako da jih ni več.
He was just a child.	Bil je le otrok.
Also a good thing.	Tudi dobra stvar.
I couldn’t tell who he was.	Nisem mogel povedati, kdo je bil.
It was simple.	Bilo je preprosto to.
I have a car.	Imam avto.
If I did, I would work.	Če bi, bi delal.
And also good.	In tudi dobro.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
But he didn't say anything.	Nič pa ni rekel.
I know how it comes to him.	Vem, kako mu pride.
You have to be better.	Moraš biti boljši.
But I wanted more.	Vendar sem hotel več.
Ker	Ker
They were nothing like that.	Niso bili nič takega.
No one who was there ever forgot it.	Nihče, ki je bil tam, tega ni nikoli pozabil.
They had to get out.	Morali so ven.
Too many things.	Preveč stvari.
There was no one to be seen.	Videti ni bilo nikogar.
And it makes it better.	In to naredi bolje.
We are nobody anymore.	Nismo več nihče.
I really don’t know how a man does that.	Res ne vem, kako to počne človek.
He would always love me very much.	Vedno bi me imel zelo rad.
Why not do it.	Zakaj tega ne bi storil.
I don't think we ever will.	Mislim, da nikoli ne bomo.
He could not go to school for a few days after that.	Nekaj ​​dni po tem ni mogel v šolo.
That's not it.	Ta ni.
I love seeing him like that.	Rad ga vidim takega.
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
The boy had obviously eaten enough.	Fant je očitno dovolj jedel.
It was time for someone to know.	Čas je bil, da nekdo ve.
I asked if she knew you and she said she knew.	Vprašal sem, če te pozna in je rekla, da pozna.
There was no one else then.	Takrat ni bilo nikogar drugega.
He knew why he was doing this.	Vedel je, zakaj to počne.
He wanted to know what was going on.	Želel je vedeti, kaj se dogaja.
There was nothing I could do to help her at that time.	Takrat ji nisem mogel nič pomagati.
But it has to be really good.	Mora pa biti res dobro.
The child was not well.	Otrok ni bil dobro.
Because you were.	Ker si bil.
I heard about you.	Slišal sem zate.
You can know without knowing.	Lahko veš, ne da bi vedel.
He did well.	Dobro mu je uspelo.
I don't care.	Ne zanima me to.
I know he can't.	Vem, da ne more.
You are not me.	Ti nisi jaz.
Because this is life.	Ker to je življenje.
But he had to stay in the city.	Vendar je moral ostati v mestu.
I learned from that.	Iz tega sem se naučil.
There are a few things money can’t buy.	Obstaja nekaj stvari, ki jih denar ne more kupiti.
Not that I don't want to, I don't want to.	Saj ne, da nočem, nočem.
He was a great help.	Bil je v veliko pomoč.
I have to move on.	Moram naprej.
I would like to know.	rad bi vedel.
I came too.	Prišel sem tudi jaz.
It's just you.	Samo ti si.
That’s how I felt then and now.	Tako sem se počutil tako takrat kot zdaj.
But I would never know that.	Vendar tega nikoli ne bi vedel.
You don't know everything.	Ne veš vsega.
There were a lot of kids.	Bilo je veliko otrok.
It was so much for me.	Bilo mi je tako veliko.
I had to eat.	Moral sem jesti.
I've seen that before.	To sem že videl.
Forward and onward.	Naprej in naprej.
I'm glad you came.	Vesel sem, da si prišel.
We're just.	Samo smo.
He loved the book.	Knjigo je imel rad.
He was there for three years.	Tam je bil tri leta.
Sometimes you want that.	Včasih si to želiš.
There were many of them.	Bilo jih je veliko.
He did this as soon as he got home.	To je storil takoj, ko je prišel domov.
So on and so forth.	Tako naprej in tako naprej.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
It was something.	Je bilo to kaj.
Because, he thought, this is life.	Ker, je mislil, to je življenje.
He wanted to do everything.	Želel je narediti vse.
I still have them just like before.	Še vedno jih imam tako kot prej.
You have to go, friend.	Moraš iti, prijatelj.
What do you want to eat today?	Kaj želite jesti danes?
That's likely, he decided.	To je verjetno, se je odločil.
I really like this one.	Ta mi je zelo všeč.
I didn’t know why this was happening.	Nisem vedel, zakaj se to dogaja.
He got a few at the time, but wanted to do more.	Takrat jih je nekaj dobil, vendar je želel narediti več.
It's so very.	To je tako zelo.
We are here for you.	Tukaj smo za vas.
That was wrong.	To je bilo narobe.
We really can't.	Res ne moremo.
But that's what he decided to do.	Vendar se je tako odločil.
We don’t know why this man did it.	Ne vemo, zakaj je ta človek to storil.
He always goes out to dinner.	Vedno gre ven na večerjo.
I never found them.	Nikoli jih nisem našel.
She probably was.	Verjetno je bila.
He doesn't know what to say.	Ne ve, kaj bi rekel.
You don't have to do that, she said.	Tega ti ni treba storiti, je rekla.
I wouldn't have any of that.	Nič od tega ne bi imel.
She said yes.	Rekla je da.
We probably will.	Verjetno bomo.
And what is it? 	In kaj je to?
he asked.	je vprašal.
I already said.	Sem že rekel.
There should be more.	Naj bi jih bilo več.
I don't feel that way today.	Danes se ne počutim tako.
I don't even know how.	Sploh ne vem kako.
That's my father.	To je moj oče.
I know he knows about us.	Vem, da ve za nas.
I hope you like them.	Upam, da so vam všeč.
That would never work.	To nikoli ne bi uspelo.
And there are so many things we can do for people.	In toliko stvari smo lahko naredili za ljudi.
That was the whole problem.	To je bil ves problem.
Too many people liked it.	Preveč ljudi je bilo všeč.
I won't have anything like that.	Ne bom imel nič takega.
Even the next day or the next day, that didn’t happen.	Tudi naslednji dan ali naslednji dan se to ni zgodilo.
No one knew where he lived.	Nihče ni vedel, kje živi.
And that's why she's with him.	In zato je z njim.
It's true.	Res je.
Neither is he.	Tudi on ni.
I don't want to go home.	Nočem domov.
It's too much.	Preveč je.
Do you know.	Ali veš.
I didn't expect it from him.	Nisem pričakoval od njega.
That's right.	Tako je.
One never knows.	Človek nikoli ne ve.
You did the right thing.	Prav ste naredili.
I tried to do too much.	Poskušal sem narediti preveč.
That's everyone.	To so vsi.
He likes everything.	Vse ima rad.
Tell me where he is.	Povej mi, kje je.
Let me know you a little.	Da te malo poznam.
I will leave.	odšel bom.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
Only you weren't in it.	Samo tebe v tem ni bilo.
There are very, very few of them.	Zelo, zelo malo jih je.
You should do it yourself.	To bi moral narediti sam.
That's how it goes.	Tako gre.
He doesn't have much money.	Nima veliko denarja.
I wouldn't need it anymore.	Ne bi ga več potreboval.
Right! 	Prav!
This is going to happen.	To se bo zgodilo.
I didn't mean anything.	Nič nisem mislil.
he asked.	je vprašal.
Maybe that's the reason.	Mogoče je to razlog.
Someone knew about the money.	Nekdo je vedel za denar.
She had to go there.	Tam je morala iti.
You never knew when you might have to go out.	Nikoli niste vedeli, kdaj boste morda morali iti ven.
I worked here, you know.	Tukaj sem delal, veš.
We don't think so.	Nam se ne zdi tako.
Man, it was nice.	Človek, bilo je lepo.
He had nothing more to say.	Ni imel več kaj povedati.
He is supposed to return home.	Domov naj bi se vrnil.
I know everything you have to say.	Vem vse, kar imaš za povedati.
It wasn't for us.	To ni bilo za nas.
There is obviously something wrong.	Očitno je nekaj narobe.
Tell us what you think.	Povej nam kaj misliš.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
That was just as good.	To je bilo prav tako dobro.
That's it for us.	To je to za nas.
That's what I've always said.	To sem vedno govoril.
But no one knows what would happen.	Vendar nihče ne ve, kaj bi se zgodilo.
I love these people very much.	Zelo rad imam te ljudi.
I mean really everything.	Mislim res vse.
I'm quite surprised.	Prav presenečen sem.
So it was tonight.	Tako je bilo nocoj.
He had to help.	Moral je pomagati.
He has already talked about this.	O tem je že govoril.
He had never seen her before and had never seen her again.	Še nikoli je ni videl in nikoli več je ni videl.
He didn't know.	Ni vedel.
We are not interested in that.	To nas ne zanima.
Which obviously doesn't exist.	Kar očitno ne obstaja.
Or here.	Ali tukaj.
It's just beautiful.	Samo lepo je.
Why did they do that?	Zakaj so to storili?
And if you want, your father could stay here.	In če želiš, bi tvoj oče lahko ostal tukaj.
And she wanted him.	In želela ga je.
There was more to it.	V več je bil ta.
You are a good friend.	Ti si dober prijatelj.
It's not difficult.	Ni težko.
He knows you're here.	On ve, da si tukaj.
But they wouldn't do that either.	A tudi tega ne bi storili.
But he was right.	Vendar je imel prav.
Nothing about that.	Nič o tem.
She seems to need it.	Videti je, da ga potrebuje.
A man who knows you.	Človek, ki te pozna.
Maybe I was good.	Mogoče sem bil dober.
He is angry about it.	Jezen je zaradi tega.
And that's fine.	In to je v redu.
We should not do that.	Tega ne bi smeli storiti.
Not so much and not so fast.	Ne tako veliko in ne tako hitro.
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
He will not succeed!	Ne bo mu uspelo!
She'll be fine.	Bila bo v redu.
I already have enough money.	Imam že dovolj denarja.
They did.	So naredili .
I haven't seen him in a long time.	Dolgo ga nisem videl.
We will not be here forever.	Ne bomo tukaj za vedno.
No one has given me as much as you.	Nihče mi ni dal toliko kot ti.
We have to do something right.	Nekaj ​​moramo delati prav.
You're not mine.	Nisi moj.
Only he wasn't in his room.	Samo da ga ni bilo v svoji sobi.
Right now.	Takoj zdaj.
There is so much to talk about.	Toliko je za govoriti.
They are not all.	Niso vse.
Right or wrong,	Prav ali ne,
I'm going too.	tudi jaz grem.
No one will know it exists.	Nihče ne bo vedel, da obstaja.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ni hotel govoriti z mano.
Or a lot.	Ali pa veliko.
Not for anyone.	Ne za nikogar.
You never know with me.	Pri meni nikoli ne veš.
We can't see.	Ne moremo videti.
It wasn't enough.	Ni bilo dovolj.
Over and over and over.	Še in še in naprej.
He speaks very fast.	Govori zelo hitro.
I couldn't find a way forward.	Nisem našel, kako naprej.
He couldn't see.	Ni mogel videti.
I do not want to.	Nočem.
Because he's done it before.	Ker je to počel že prej.
He was very surprised.	Bil je zelo presenečen.
It was quick to do.	Narediti to hitro je bilo.
You have to play with what you have.	Igrati se moraš s tem, kar imaš.
I don't know how he felt.	Ne vem, kako mu je bilo.
In fact, he said so.	Pravzaprav je tako rekel.
Must be.	Mora biti.
It seemed like it might not be.	Zdelo se je, da morda ni.
he asked.	je vprašal.
Only there is more of it here.	Samo tukaj ga je več.
He felt lost.	Zdelo se mu je, da se je izgubil.
From as you know.	Od kot veste.
He was so good to me.	Bil je tako dober do mene.
If anything, it was even more so.	Če kaj, je bilo še bolj.
You don't have to be angry.	Ni treba biti jezen.
They're not even alone.	Niti niso sami.
I'm not yours.	nisem tvoj.
We have to talk.	Moramo govoriti.
These are the things you should always do.	To so stvari, ki bi jih morali vedno početi.
Nobody has to go.	Nikomur ni treba iti.
Or nothing else.	Ali pa nič drugega.
Good.	Dobra.
I didn't expect to see you again.	Nisem pričakoval, da te bom spet videl.
This has its problems.	To ima svoje težave.
I will give him so much.	Toliko mu bom dal.
He can't believe it.	Ne more verjeti.
I will definitely be back.	Zagotovo bom spet.
You don't have to come here.	Ni ti treba priti sem.
We have three children.	Imamo tri otroke.
He loved me too.	Tudi mene je imel rad.
He will come and play.	Prišel bo in igral.
My dad couldn't either and was into it.	Tudi moj oče ni mogel in je bil v tem.
I’ve seen it and it still feels good to me.	Videl sem in še vedno se mi zdi dober.
He is so much better.	On je toliko boljši.
She's right to want to see him again.	Prav ima, da ga želi videti še enkrat.
If anyone helps, help.	Če kdo pomaga, pomaga.
He won't do anything.	Ničesar ne bo naredil.
He would not be that person.	On ne bi bil ta oseba.
I know what you mean.	Vem kaj si mislil.
I always seem to do that.	Zdi se mi, da to vedno počnem.
He was there and doing his thing.	Bil je tam in delal svoje.
I almost certainly will.	Skoraj zagotovo bom.
Quick.	Hitro.
This is a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
I'll just say that.	Rekel bom samo to.
He was not alone.	Ni bil sam.
We are very sorry.	Zelo nam je žal.
I don't need anyone else.	Ne potrebujem nikogar drugega.
We can't do that yet.	Tega še ne moremo.
Or expected, for that matter.	Ali pa pričakoval, glede na to.
And it will happen very soon.	In to se bo zgodilo zelo kmalu.
Everyone could see that.	To so lahko videli vsi.
Nobody wanted to believe me.	Nihče mi ni hotel verjeti.
He told me he could definitely help.	Rekel mi je, da lahko zagotovo pomaga.
Let me see that.	Naj to vidim.
That's good.	To je dober.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
Nothing and no one.	Nič in nihče.
I didn't leave.	Nisem odšel.
She was there.	Tam je bila.
Maybe we never will.	Mogoče nikoli ne bomo.
But there is more.	Je pa še več.
It was wrong then and it is wrong now.	Takrat je bilo narobe in je narobe zdaj.
What he was trying to do.	Kaj je poskušal narediti.
What's going on?	Se kaj dogaja?
You know a lot.	Veš veliko.
I have to go.	Moram iti.
The thing is, it's not.	Stvar je v tem, da ni.
That is to be a father.	To je biti oče.
He is so happy.	Tako je vesel.
No, we can't help you.	Ne, ne moremo vam pomagati.
And he almost succeeded.	In skoraj mu je uspelo.
I should tell you something.	Moral bi ti nekaj povedati.
That's what I did.	Tako sem naredil.
It all happened very quickly.	Vse se je zgodilo zelo hitro.
I just got them back, you know.	Pravkar sem jih dobil nazaj, veš.
There is no money.	Tam ni denarja.
I tried this way but it didn't work.	Poskušal sem tako, vendar mi ni uspelo.
I do not want to.	nočem.
No one even spoke.	Nihče ni niti govoril.
And why should !.	In zakaj bi!.
I knew it was.	Vedela sem, da je.
Why would you do such a thing.	Zakaj bi naredil kaj takega.
There is nothing you can do.	Nič ne moreš storiti.
It's good at everything.	Dobro je na vsem.
It's not just about me.	Ne gre samo zame.
How nice to see you again!	Kako lepo te je spet videti!
I can't believe it either!	Tudi jaz tega ne morem verjeti!
He's not coming home.	Ne pride domov.
Nothing like that happened.	Kaj takega se ni zgodilo.
I really don’t know what’s happening to me.	Res ne vem, kaj se mi dogaja.
There was nothing to be seen that he did not like.	Ničesar ni bilo videti, kar mu ne bi bilo všeč.
I didn't start working with you for the money.	Nisem začel delati s tabo zaradi denarja.
We didn't know.	Nismo vedeli.
Maybe this will never happen.	Mogoče se to nikoli ne bo zgodilo.
That was not right for me.	Zame to ni bilo prav.
It is not a question of money.	Ni vprašanje denarja.
He was there.	Bil je tam.
He is a teacher.	On je učitelj.
I'm moving on.	grem naprej.
I don't know how to do it.	Ne vem, kako to narediti.
Which is to say good.	Kar se pravi dober.
We were quickly alone.	Hitro smo bili sami.
This is so beautiful.	To je tako lepo.
He still was, if you want to know.	Še vedno je bil, če želite vedeti.
It is what it is.	Je kar je.
I mean, would you?	Mislim, bi?
He will get a chance to do a good job.	Dobil bo priložnost za dobro delo.
He doesn't have much money.	Nima veliko denarja.
I'm really sorry.	Res mi je žal.
He wasn't sure what he was ready for.	Ni bil prepričan, na kaj je pripravljen.
This man has no money.	Ta človek nima denarja.
I didn't tell you.	Nisem vam povedal.
The question is what.	Vprašanje je, kaj.
Now I see.	Zdaj vidim.
And yet he doesn't like it.	In vendar mu ni všeč.
There was so much money.	Toliko denarja je bilo.
Don't tell her.	Ne povej ji.
You would see him all the time.	Videli bi ga ves čas.
I like to see her.	Rad jo vidim.
Not now, maybe not anymore.	Ne zdaj, morda ne več.
He is a good boy, such a good boy.	On je dober fant, tako dober fant.
And this is the right time.	In to je pravi čas.
I still can't believe it.	Še vedno ne morem verjeti.
It was very difficult for me.	Bilo mi je zelo težko.
Not very much.	Ni zelo veliko.
This is actually not true.	To pravzaprav ni res.
I didn't see him.	Nisem ga videl.
Instead, he seemed to be afraid of me.	Namesto tega se je zdelo, da se me boji.
He had no money.	Ni imel denarja.
It's so nice to see you again.	Tako lepo te je spet videti.
I wouldn't do that, would I?	Tega ne bi naredil, kajne?
And what he did for me.	In kaj je naredil zame.
And she was with him.	In bila je z njim.
He thought wrong.	Mislil je narobe.
We would have more work to do.	Imeli bi več dela.
You were lucky.	Imel si srečo.
You asked for it.	Prosil si za to.
Good, it's good he's here.	Dobro, dobro je, da je tukaj.
Not anymore '.	Nič več '.
Please, no!	Prosim, ne!
He is nothing.	On ni nič.
I wish it was me.	Želim si, da bi bil to jaz.
None of us expected him to play.	Nihče od nas ni pričakoval, da bo igral.
And my friend was right.	In moj prijatelj je imel prav.
He knows you're a very busy man.	Ve, da si zelo zaposlen človek.
Not very often.	Ne zelo pogosto.
He thought it was possible.	Mislil je, da je to mogoče.
What he knows, he knows.	Kar zna, zna.
I hope it's okay.	Upam, da je v redu.
But she didn't know anything about it herself.	A sama o tem ni vedela ničesar.
He won't forget you.	Ne bo te pozabil.
No, that's true.	Ne, to je res.
Just the way it is.	Tako kot je.
I can't talk for long.	Ne morem dolgo govoriti.
It's not just about money.	Ne gre samo za denar.
Let's have money.	Naj imamo denar.
This is too simple a question.	To je preveč preprosto vprašanje.
You could be right.	Lahko bi imel prav.
It is simple yes or no.	Preprosto je da ali ne.
No, it can't be.	Ne, ne more biti.
No one knows for sure.	Nihče ne ve zagotovo.
He came, he saw, he died.	Prišel je, videl, umrl je.
And he was.	In bil je.
Yes.	Je.
He was right.	Imel je prav.
A lot has happened.	Veliko se je zgodilo.
There seemed to be no choice but to move on.	Zdelo se je, da ni drugega kot iti naprej.
I didn't get anything.	Nič nisem dobil.
And that's not good.	In to ni dobro.
And you won't either.	In tudi ne boš.
I would succeed.	bi mi uspelo.
I told you next week.	Povedal sem ti naslednji teden.
She will say yes.	Rekla bo da.
I hope you liked it.	Upam, da vam je bilo všeč.
That's the only way.	To je edini način.
I could do that.	To bi lahko naredil.
Very spot on.	Zelo na mestu.
I’m glad it worked out.	Vesel sem, da je to uspelo.
Nothing else happened.	Nič kaj drugega se ni zgodilo.
How many people live their lives.	Koliko ljudi živi svoje življenje.
I am.	Jaz sem.
I still don't understand.	Še vedno ne razumem.
I think you will succeed.	Mislim, da vam bo uspelo.
Those.	Tisti.
They did that and much more.	To so storili in še veliko več.
That was all they were anyway.	To je bilo tako ali tako vse, kar so bili.
He's out of money.	Je brez denarja.
I don't want to be again.	Nočem biti spet.
It must.	Mora.
I can do that, you know.	To lahko storim, veš.
That's right, man.	Tako je, človek.
If you can.	Če lahko.
Tell me what.	Povej ti kaj.
He was good enough to say so much.	Bil je dovolj dober, da je povedal toliko.
They certainly had it. 	Zagotovo so ga imeli. 
Everyone is better.	Vsem je bolje.
And you're in it.	In ti si v tem.
He wanted to come.	Hotel je priti.
No people.	Ni ljudi.
And maybe you can.	In morda lahko.
That's for sure.	To zagotovo.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Nič mi ni bilo narobe s tem.
Still not.	Še vedno ne.
I'll be back.	Vrnil se bom.
I was only there for three days.	Tam sem bil samo tri dni.
And yet he could not.	Pa vendar ni mogel.
I can't know.	Ne morem vedeti.
They could see me.	Lahko so me videli.
He's not too sure.	Ni preveč prepričan.
And it also looks very good.	In prav tako je videti zelo dobro.
Or you.	Ali pa ti.
Because it's normal.	Ker je to običajno.
And so it will be.	In tako bo.
No one can know.	Nihče ne more vedeti.
We may not do that.	Tega morda ne bomo storili.
I won't be around for dinner then.	Takrat me ne bo več na večerjo.
It could be me too.	Lahko bi bil tudi jaz.
Nothing.	Nič.
But he didn't have it.	Vendar ga ni imel.
He wouldn't say that.	On tega ne bi rekel.
He speaks better.	Bolje govori.
We could just be lucky.	Lahko bi imeli samo srečo.
I understand that was it.	Razumem, da je bilo to.
It's not just here.	Ni samo tukaj.
This has never happened before.	To se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
He just has to play.	Samo igrati mora.
He's gone.	Odšel je.
We can't be sure.	Ne moremo biti prepričani.
Not the only way.	Ne edini način.
Or maybe sooner.	Ali pa morda prej.
He said he would come, but he didn't.	Rekel je, da bo prišel, a ni.
How it seemed possible to her for a while.	Kako se ji je nekaj časa zdelo mogoče.
That's why we have a job.	Zato imamo službo.
You should know better.	Moral bi vedeti bolje.
That was absolutely true.	To je bilo popolnoma res.
I'll get it back.	Dobil ga bom nazaj.
No more than we know when you will die.	Nič več kot vemo, kdaj boš umrl.
She said it was something she had to do.	Rekla je, da je to nekaj, kar mora storiti.
It didn't happen.	Ni se zgodilo.
I see so much.	Toliko vidim.
I never talked about it.	Nikoli nisem govoril o tem.
He liked that.	To mu je bilo všeč.
But he didn't leave things there.	A stvari ni pustil tam.
She didn't even know why she did it.	Sploh ni vedela, zakaj je to storila.
He didn't have that.	Tega ni imel.
That's wrong.	To je narobe.
And she was still there.	In še vedno je bila tam.
It really was.	Res je bilo.
Very good thing.	Zelo dobra stvar.
Who is	Kdo je
Because we were so sure.	Ker smo bili tako prepričani.
I want to know what they are.	Želim vedeti, kaj so.
I didn't feel.	Nisem se počutil.
If I left now, I'd be alone.	Če bi zdaj odšel, bi bila sama.
You need to see someone else.	Še nekoga moraš videti.
Just soon, please.	Samo kmalu, prosim.
I couldn't do that.	Tega nisem mogel storiti.
It's just a matter of time.	To je samo vprašanje časa.
This is what is happening.	To je tisto, kar se dogaja.
I just wanted to see what would happen.	Hotel sem samo videti, kaj se bo zgodilo.
If it were anything to you.	Če bi bilo kaj ti.
It might be true.	Morda je res.
That was the reason, but not the only one.	To je bil razlog, a ne edini.
You told me very little.	Zelo malo si mi povedal.
He did it himself.	To je naredil sam.
No one could do that anymore.	Tega nihče več ni mogel storiti.
I would never allow that.	Tega ne bi nikoli dovolil.
He won't tell us anything.	Nič nam ne bo povedal.
We have to go.	Moramo iti.
There was a lot of work.	Bilo je veliko dela.
I won't be back.	Ne bom se vrnil.
She's lucky.	Ta ima srečo.
Yes, we are.	Da, smo.
He didn't say anything either.	Tudi rekel ni nič.
You know what you did.	Veš kaj si naredil.
There is nothing else in the city.	V mestu ni nič drugega.
You know it's not possible.	Veš, da ni mogoče.
I think it is.	Mislim, da je.
This man just did something to him.	Ta človek mu je pravkar nekaj naredil.
We should be able to help you.	Morali bi vam lahko pomagati.
I wish you well.	Želim ti dobro.
I don't think it will.	Mislim, da ne bo.
i really like that.	to mi je res všeč.
It will be difficult for her.	Težko ji bo.
I'll be with you again.	Bom spet pri vas.
He has his work to do.	Ima svoje delo.
You never knew with him.	Z njim nikoli nisi vedel.
He didn't say that.	Ni rekel tega.
Just one more time.	Samo še enkrat.
I can see that now.	To zdaj vidim.
I'm okay.	Sem v redu.
I'm glad to see you.	Vesel sem, da te vidim.
Even today.	Še danes.
It does good.	To naredi dobro.
No, he didn't tell anyone.	Ne, nikomur ni povedal.
And maybe you could.	In morda bi lahko.
We didn't have to do anything.	Ničesar nam ni bilo treba narediti.
I just didn’t hear them.	Preprosto jih nisem slišal.
They would never do anything.	Nikoli ne bi naredili ničesar.
This is completely wrong.	To je popolnoma narobe.
Which he didn't know why.	Kar ni vedel, zakaj.
He says now is not the time.	Pravi, da zdaj ni pravi čas.
I'll call him today.	danes ga bom poklical.
I don’t think it was right for that.	Mislim, da ni bilo prav za to.
I went to work that day.	Tisti dan sem šel v službo.
I never wanted to tell anyone.	Nikoli nisem hotel nikomur povedati.
I would sit and do nothing.	Sedel bi in nič ne delal.
But no one.	Nihče pa ne.
He died this morning.	Umrl je danes zjutraj.
Maybe it's not just money.	Mogoče pa ni samo denar.
He knew he wanted to say more.	Vedel je, da želi povedati več.
Everyone knew that.	To so vsi vedeli.
Right.	Prav.
He's just with me.	On je samo pri meni.
Not because it was him.	Ne zato, ker je bil on.
You knew better.	Vedel si bolje.
I could do something like that.	Lahko bi naredil nekaj takega.
She certainly wouldn't be for long.	Zagotovo ne bi bila dolgo.
Nothing really happened.	Prav nič se ni zgodilo.
You definitely know about it.	Zagotovo veste za to.
He talks very little about it.	Zelo malo govori o tem.
Life.	Življenje.
They may be helpful.	Morda so v pomoč.
I just didn’t know how and why.	Samo nisem vedel, kako in zakaj.
One would also say he was surprised.	Človek bi tudi rekel, da je bil presenečen.
And nothing will happen.	In nič ne bo.
Not the only one.	Ni edina.
There is no work for you there.	Tam zate ni dela.
This is your money.	To je tvoj denar.
I really don't understand myself anymore.	Res se ne razumem več.
However, he seemed to have been here before.	Vendar se je zdelo, da je bil tukaj že prej.
It was nice.	Bilo je lepo.
I really liked it.	Zelo mi je bilo všeč.
You never know what you’re going to get!	Nikoli ne veš, kaj boš dobil!
He will hear you.	Slišal te bo.
I still looked like a kid.	Še vedno sem bil videti kot otrok.
So are we.	Tudi mi smo.
I know it is.	Vem, da je.
I didn't expect us to.	Nisem pričakoval, da bomo.
It's right there.	To je prav tam.
We will do just that.	Naredili bomo samo to.
And now they knew it wouldn’t.	In zdaj so vedeli, da ne bo.
It’s actually very, very difficult.	Pravzaprav je zelo, zelo težko.
I have to do everything right.	Vse moram narediti prav.
He knew what he had to do.	Vedel je, kaj mora narediti.
I thought you just came here.	Mislil sem, da si pravkar prišel sem.
I was fine.	v redu sem bil.
But he heard a lot.	Slišal pa je veliko.
This is an option.	To je možnost.
And not just because of what he does to her.	In ne samo zaradi tega, kar ji naredi.
You think he's a good boy.	Misliš, da je dober fant.
It was never easy to leave.	Nikoli ni bilo lahko oditi.
Maybe nothing will happen yet.	Morda še ne bo nič.
Okay, a few things.	V redu, nekaj stvari.
I wonder if he will succeed.	Zanima me, ali mu bo uspelo.
You can't help yourself.	Ne moreš si pomagati.
I'm asking you for something.	prosim te za nekaj.
There was never anything.	Nikoli nič ni bilo.
I came to talk to you.	Prišel sem govoriti s tabo.
I couldn't work.	nisem mogel delati.
He got it.	Dobil ga je.
And much more.	In še veliko več.
In fact, you don't know what it's about yet.	Pravzaprav še ne veš, za kaj gre.
I believe it is true.	Verjamem, da je res.
someone asked.	je nekdo vprašal.
I found him.	Našel sem ga.
He does that too.	Tudi on to počne.
I just wouldn't do that.	Samo tega ne bi storil.
I didn’t know what the thing was.	Nisem vedel, kaj je stvar.
He knows everything.	On ve vse.
That's how we can be better.	Tako smo lahko boljši.
They saw each other there.	Tam so se videli.
And there's still plenty of time for more.	In še vedno je dovolj časa za več.
Where is he when he's not with you.	Kje je, ko ni s tabo.
It was just as difficult.	Bilo je prav tako težko.
I don't understand why they would do that.	Ne razumem, zakaj bi to storili.
He is too.	Tudi on je.
I hope it helps.	Upam, da je v pomoč.
They were all very, very helpful.	Vsi so bili zelo zelo v pomoč.
He just wants to play with me.	Samo igrati se želi z mano.
It's more than a car.	Je več kot avto.
He did them all.	Naredil jih je vse.
And we're still here.	In še vedno smo tukaj.
I hope you're doing well.	Upam, da ti gre dobro.
Which was actually good for me.	Kar je bilo zame pravzaprav dobro.
It was still hard to believe she was gone.	Še vedno je bilo težko verjeti, da je ni več.
It's not hard to see.	Tega ni težko videti.
And that's that.	In to je to.
He probably was.	Verjetno je bil.
I bought a few things.	Kupil sem nekaj stvari.
It wasn't there.	Ni bilo tam.
So hard.	Tako težko.
He did not know why he spoke.	Zakaj je govoril, ni vedel.
We were here.	Bili smo tukaj.
Maybe he didn't have to do anything.	Morda mu ni bilo treba storiti ničesar.
However, this can be done.	Vendar je to mogoče storiti.
This is very common.	To je zelo pogosto.
You will return.	Vrnil se boš.
Where were they?	Kje so bili?
I can't tell you anything.	Ne morem ti povedati ničesar.
I wonder who sings it.	Zanima me kdo to poje.
He will definitely succeed.	Zagotovo mu bo uspelo.
I think you are too.	Mislim, da si tudi ti.
He didn't say anything about it.	O tem ni rekel ničesar.
Tell her everything you have to say.	Povej ji vse, kar moraš povedati.
It wasn't very serious.	Ni bilo zelo resno.
He didn't have much time.	Ni imel veliko časa.
When he was gone, he worked.	Ko ga ni bilo, je delal.
And it is not.	In to ni.
And maybe they were right to do so.	In morda so imeli prav, da so to storili.
We should do that.	To bi morali narediti.
Why was she Mrs.	Zakaj je bila ga.
And they did.	In to so tudi storili.
Like you.	Tako kot ti.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe.
It was hard work.	Bilo je težko delo.
He had to move on.	Moral je iti naprej.
You should stay with me.	Moral bi ostati pri meni.
If you have to.	Če moraš.
That's fine with me.	To je v redu z mano.
Nothing more than that.	Nič več kot to.
It was too true.	Bilo je preveč res.
However, this is also a problem.	Vendar je tudi to problem.
I've never seen her before.	Še nikoli je nisem videl.
A good friend at all.	Sploh dober prijatelj.
We know much more today.	Danes vemo veliko več.
And she knew who they were.	In vedela je, kdo so.
Not after what they did to me.	Ne po tem, kar so mi naredili.
I wasn't that.	nisem bil to.
And it’s not because it can be.	In to ni zato, ker je lahko.
You should go home.	Morala bi iti domov.
It's too much tonight.	Nocoj je preveč.
This is not good for anyone, for any of us.	To ni dobro za nikogar, za nikogar od nas.
They all had problems.	Vsi so imeli težave.
He's not good enough.	Ni dovolj dober.
I haven’t seen her since and I wouldn’t want to.	Od takrat je nisem več videl in ne bi želel.
I did it myself.	Sam sem tako naredil.
None of us can say anything to any of us.	Nihče nikomur od nas ne more ničesar povedati.
You talked to him.	Govoril si z njim.
I didn’t think it would be possible for me.	Nisem si mislil, da bo to zame mogoče.
I wouldn’t ask for help or stuff.	Ne bi prosil za pomoč ali stvari.
He was alone in the room at the time.	Takrat je bil v sobi sam.
You know why.	Veš zakaj.
She had to go to work.	Morala je v službo.
She was fine.	Bila je v redu.
You didn't call me.	Nisi me poklical.
Can not.	Ne more.
We both like it.	Oba sta nam všeč.
I do it.	jaz to počnem.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Nič ne moremo storiti glede tega.
I wasn't there alone.	Sama nisem bila tam.
If I only knew, I wouldn’t say so.	Če bi le vedel, ne bi tako rekel.
I was good.	bil sem dober.
I think a lot of people.	Mislim, da je veliko ljudi.
I'm not going back with you.	Ne grem nazaj s tabo.
The question was what to do about it.	Vprašanje je bilo, kaj storiti glede tega.
It may not be easy, but it is possible.	Morda ni lahko, vendar se da.
You promised me.	Obljubil si mi.
Maybe more time.	Mogoče več časa.
I don't really like it.	Ni mi zelo všeč.
He's not there.	Ni ga tam.
However, it has happened before.	Vendar se je zgodilo že prej.
I can't see them.	Ne morem jih videti.
I had to be the one who stayed.	Moral sem biti tisti, ki je ostal.
No problem.	Ni problem.
Nobody talks about it anymore.	Nihče več ne govori o tem.
There will probably be more.	Verjetno jih bo več.
me and him.	jaz in on.
And so it will be tomorrow.	In tako bo tudi jutri.
I'm okay.	V redu sem.
Sit down.	Sedel.
This is actually true.	To je pravzaprav res.
In this regard, it also seemed so to me.	Glede tega se je tudi meni zdelo tako.
As a kid.	Kot otrok.
I'll be right behind you.	Takoj za tabo bom.
Just like now.	Tako kot zdaj.
It cannot be purchased.	Ni ga mogoče kupiti.
He is a friend.	On je prijatelj.
I know what it's like.	Vem kako je to.
And it's still here.	In še vedno je tukaj.
He wished he knew that.	Želel si je, da bi to vedel.
And yet she wasn't.	Pa vendar ni bila.
How many people live here?	Koliko ljudi živi tukaj?
What happened.	Kaj se je zgodilo.
I saw something.	Nekaj ​​sem videl.
I don't think so at all.	Mislim sploh ne.
I would just continue to be alone.	Samo še naprej bi bila sama.
Everything.	Vse.
He never knew.	Še nikoli ni vedel.
Either way, we didn’t have much work to do.	Tako ali tako nam ni bilo veliko dela.
Where he had to be, what he had to do.	Kje je moral biti, kaj je moral narediti.
Nothing and no one was seen.	Ničesar in nikogar ni bilo videti.
This kid was about to win.	Ta otrok je bil v tem, da bi zmagal.
She said she never did.	Rekla je, da nikoli ni.
Do you want to buy here?	Ali želite kupiti tukaj?
He needs to know everything.	Vse mora vedeti.
You're in place.	Na mestu ste.
And he almost got it.	In skoraj ga je dobil.
I did so much.	Toliko sem naredil.
He's gone.	Odšel je.
She liked it very much.	Zelo ji je bilo všeč.
Almost forever.	Skoraj za vedno.
I'm going to work.	Grem na delo.
It's just who you are.	To je samo to, kdo si.
It must.	Mora.
When you first came into the room.	Ko si prvič prišel v sobo.
Nobody wants to.	Nihče noče.
You said it sure will.	Rekel si, zagotovo bo.
I'm a boy.	Jaz sem fant.
The reason for this is as follows.	Razlog za to je naslednji.
We have to get out.	Moramo ven.
Not me, no.	Ne jaz, ne.
not really.	res ne.
We can't get there fast.	Tja ne moremo hitro.
Just like I sometimes find it hard to believe.	Tako kot mi je včasih težko verjeti.
And you will be there.	In ti boš tam.
It is hard.	Težko je.
Now it's after that.	Zdaj je po tem.
But he didn't do anything like that.	Vendar ni storil nič takega.
My only chance.	Moja edina priložnost.
It obviously wasn't when he was playing.	Očitno ni bilo, ko je igral.
We were lucky.	Imeli smo srečo.
The good thing is that we can still have children.	Dobra stvar je, da lahko še vedno imamo otroke.
Gambling.	Igra na srečo.
At the time, that seemed to be it.	Takrat se je zdelo, da je to to.
Because they are not.	Ker niso.
That would happen.	To bi se zgodilo.
How did it work?	Kako je to uspelo?
He didn't let us go home.	Ni nas pustil domov.
He was so good.	Bil je tako dober.
It still could be.	Še vedno bi lahko bilo.
I actually like to think I don’t.	Pravzaprav rad mislim, da ne.
He loves his children.	Svoje otroke ima rad.
One can never be sure with him.	Z njim človek nikoli ne more biti prepričan.
It's really quite simple.	Res je precej preprosto.
This is not a problem here.	Tukaj to ni problem.
He should be here too.	Tudi on bi moral biti tukaj.
Not what you wanted at all.	Sploh ni tisto, kar si želel.
Everything was beautiful.	Vse je bilo lepo.
I never had the money.	Nikoli nisem imel denarja.
We did quite well.	Kar dobro nam je uspelo.
That is a lot!	To je veliko!
And it probably will.	In verjetno bo.
I don't think he ever did.	Mislim, da nikoli ni storil.
A man who is very good.	Človek, ki je zelo dober.
I need to know.	Moram vedeti.
My whole life was for you.	Vse moje življenje je bilo zate.
He knew it was.	Vedel je, da je.
He had children.	Imel je otroke.
Maybe just that day.	Morda prav ta dan.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
They will be here.	Tukaj bodo.
I had to go to work tomorrow.	Jutri sem moral v službo.
He didn't know what to think about it.	Ni vedel, kaj naj si o tem misli.
You have to tell me what's wrong.	Moraš mi povedati, kaj je narobe.
And he did.	In to je storil.
It just so happened.	Samo tako se je zgodilo.
it was a question now.	je bilo zdaj vprašanje.
I think you can.	Mislim, da lahko.
Everyone always wants more, never enough.	Vsak si vedno želi več, nikoli dovolj.
A good way.	Dober način.
And to me.	In meni.
More on that soon.	Več o tem kmalu.
She’s really good at what she does.	Res je dobra v tem, kar počne.
As you wish.	Kot želiš.
Here we are.	Tukaj smo.
Do you know who this man is?	Ali veste, kdo je ta človek?
I don't want to do that at all.	Sploh tega nočem narediti.
He knew all this before.	Vse to je vedel že prej.
I know that myself.	Sam to vem.
Someone has it.	Nekdo ga ima.
I'm not good at it.	Nisem dober v tem.
Everyone knew everything.	Vsi so vedeli vse.
First, she said.	Prvič, je rekla.
I don’t know what’s going on here anymore, she said.	Ne vem več, kaj se dogaja tukaj, je rekla.
He knew it was much more than that.	Vedel je, da je veliko več kot to.
Enough is enough.	Dovolj je dovolj.
There are more of us.	Več nas je.
That was fine with me.	To mi je bilo v redu.
He knows what happened.	On ve, kaj se je zgodilo.
That doesn't seem to be the case now.	Zdi se, da tega zdaj ni več.
Really, we were.	Res, bili smo.
Actually a lot.	Pravzaprav veliko.
That is not what we have today.	To ni tisto, kar imamo danes.
It doesn't seem right.	Ne zdi se prav.
I had to go out.	Moral sem iti ven.
He just didn’t want to do it anymore.	Preprosto tega ni hotel storiti več.
No, it was all there.	Ne, vse je bilo tam.
They are just alone.	Samo so sami.
I'm glad to see you.	Vesel sem da te vidim.
I need to know that.	To moram vedeti.
I don't mean anything.	ne mislim nič.
I know you're busy.	Vem, da si zaposlen.
He couldn't see it now.	Zdaj tega ni mogel videti.
He just wants them to be.	Samo želi, da so.
I'm glad not to.	Vesel sem, da ne.
He's not here.	Tukaj ni.
That's us.	To smo mi.
The question was how.	Vprašanje je bilo, kako.
What we did.	Kaj smo storili.
I wanted to believe her.	Hotel sem ji verjeti.
She's never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni storila.
I know where I could be.	Vem, kje bi lahko bil.
With his book.	S svojo knjigo.
And we're fine.	In mi smo v redu.
I really don't know.	res ne vem.
It really was never good.	Res nikoli ni bilo dobro.
And it almost did.	In skoraj se je.
We feel better when we are together.	Bolje nam je, ko smo skupaj.
There is nothing like that at home.	Doma ni nič takega.
I had this hard enough.	Dovolj težko sem imel to.
I think he has a good life.	Mislim, da ima dobro življenje.
Can be.	Je mogoče.
I have no doubt that it is.	Ne dvomim, da je tako.
For me, I did it simply because I wanted to.	Zame sem to preprosto storil, ker sem želel.
It does this from time to time.	To počne od časa do časa.
He is a child.	On je otrok.
You all know who you are.	Vsi veste, kdo ste.
It was never okay.	Nikoli ni bilo v redu.
I was happy to see him.	Vesel sem bil, ko sem ga videl.
However, it is not that simple.	Vendar pa ni tako preprosto.
And we're sorry.	In žal nam je.
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
He didn't like that.	To mu ni bilo všeč.
However, this is not enough.	Vendar to ni dovolj.
I came for everything.	Prišel sem po vse.
We are not.	Nismo.
It was possible.	Bilo je mogoče.
That is, it would still be.	Se pravi, še bi bilo.
I didn't need it.	Ni mi bilo treba.
I am very sorry for these problems.	Zelo mi je žal za te težave.
I'm not sure if that's even possible.	Nisem prepričan, če je to sploh mogoče.
You will never tell anyone about what happened here.	Nikoli nikomur ne boš govoril o tem, kar se je tukaj zgodilo.
It was actually yesterday.	Pravzaprav je bilo včeraj.
I like this one too.	Tudi ta mi je všeč.
I'll be fine.	jaz bom v redu.
I couldn't go there yet.	Tja še nisem mogel.
They were never seen.	Nikoli jih niso videli.
He always told me that.	Vedno mi je tako govoril.
Which will be the case here as well.	Kar bo tudi tukaj tako.
Probably more than once.	Verjetno več kot enkrat.
I would love to hear from you about this !.	Rad bi slišal od vas o tem!.
I don't want to see him.	nočem ga videti.
out of the house.	ven od doma.
Maybe because of that.	Morda zaradi tega.
And he's right.	In ima prav.
I mean really good.	Mislim res dobro.
I saw last night what he can do.	Sinoči sem videl, kaj lahko naredi.
I told her yes and told him.	Rekel sem ji da in mu povedal.
And you can't do anything.	In nič ne moreš.
Perhaps he is no longer with us either.	Morda ga tudi pri nas ni več.
We need to know.	Moramo vedeti.
If it was, it wouldn't be.	Če bi bil, ne bi bilo.
And he wanted me.	In želel me je.
Long time ago.	Dolgo nazaj.
It's just happening.	Samo dogaja se.
We don't know about tomorrow.	Ne vemo za jutri.
Maybe it's all of that.	Mogoče je to vse od tega.
We will always be here for you.	Vedno bomo tukaj za vas.
It was the way it was.	Bilo je tako, kot je bilo.
And probably more.	In verjetno še več.
Or for a long time.	Ali že dolgo.
Obviously, they won’t anymore.	Očitno je, da ne bodo več.
I have to too.	tudi jaz moram.
She didn't really know anything.	Pravzaprav ni vedela ničesar.
Can anyone help me.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga.
And as she says herself.	In kot sama pravi.
But he was not seen.	Vendar ga ni bilo videti.
You think he'd be happy about that.	Misliš, da bi bil vesel tega.
She knew immediately what it was about.	Takoj je vedela, za kaj gre.
For what seems like forever.	Za tisto, kar se zdi za vedno.
So much so that you can't.	Toliko, da ne moreš.
Now.	Zdaj.
If I could.	Če bi lahko.
All he would do was die.	Vse, kar bi naredil, je umrl.
No one is coming after us.	Nihče ne pride za nami.
And that's fine with me.	In to mi je v redu.
I can '.	Lahko'.
But he didn't do that.	Tega pa ni storil.
I did that.	To sem naredil.
And you don't.	In ti ne.
There was very little time.	Časa je bilo zelo malo.
I don't understand that.	Ne razumem tega.
We both knew that.	To sva oba vedela.
He never asked.	Nikoli ni vprašal.
I will be right.	Imel bom prav.
I’m not sure that’s true.	Nisem prepričan, da je to res.
You have to do that.	To moraš narediti.
Or there are many.	Ali pa jih je veliko.
He helped a lot.	Veliko je pomagal.
There are very few of them.	Zelo malo jih je.
But they are not enough.	Vendar niso dovolj.
How did we do it?	Kako nam je uspelo?
Just for.	Samo za.
Keep it up!.	Kar tako naprej!.
That is a lot.	To je veliko.
He came back.	Vrnil se je.
Which we did.	Kar smo storili.
I have things to start.	Imam stvari za početi.
This was quite difficult for me.	To je bilo zame precej težko.
But there was no helping it.	Vendar temu ni bilo pomoči.
I’m not sure how that helps.	Nisem prepričan, kako to pomaga.
The sooner it comes, the better for us.	Prej ko pride, bolje je za nas.
So good.	Tako dobro.
However, this did not happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
And so did he.	In tako tudi on.
And he has nothing.	In nič nima.
I wonder.	sprašujem se.
I will say that.	to bom rekel.
You know nothing about it.	Nič ne veš o tem.
I saw what he does for you.	Videl sem, kaj naredi zate.
Many people live in this city.	V tem mestu živi veliko ljudi.
I like it here.	Všeč mi je tukaj.
He wanted to be alone.	Želel je ostati sam.
We've been together ever since.	Od takrat sva skupaj.
I waited a very long time.	Čakal sem zelo dolgo.
And this is wrong.	In to je narobe.
Or the next one.	Ali pa naslednji.
No one saw or heard anything.	Nihče ni ničesar videl ali slišal.
I had to see him.	Moral sem ga videti.
That someone was right.	Da je imel nekdo prav.
He lives it.	On to živi.
You didn't see him.	Niste ga videli.
I'll be on it.	jaz bom na tem.
And when.	In kdaj.
I was so surprised.	Bil sem tako presenečen.
We like it very much.	Zelo nam je všeč.
She will not succeed.	Ne bo ji uspelo.
This will be difficult for her.	To ji bo težko.
And there's nothing wrong with that.	In s tem ni nič narobe.
There is no other than us.	Ni drugega kot mi.
And neither do you.	In tudi ti ne.
Where are they ever ?.	Kje so kdaj?.
Tell me how you like them.	Povej mi, kako so ti všeč.
Every week is better.	Vsak teden je boljši.
I was good at that.	V tem sem bil dober.
i will see what happens.	bom videl kaj se bo zgodilo.
It often seems that this is no longer the case.	Pogosto se zdi, da temu ni več tako.
Maybe she still was.	Mogoče je še bila.
It would be much better if we had several years together.	Veliko bolje bi bilo, če bi imeli več let skupaj.
He loves being there.	Rad je tam.
He was very angry about it.	Bil je zelo jezen zaradi tega.
This cannot be done.	Tega ni mogoče storiti.
She didn't have to talk.	Ni ji bilo treba govoriti.
Can you please help me.	Mi lahko prosim kdo pomaga.
Nobody likes him.	Nihče ga ne mara.
He's doing pretty well right now.	Trenutno mu gre kar dobro.
You were not a child.	Nisi bil otrok.
It happened to me once.	Enkrat se mi je zgodilo.
There's a lot of them.	Veliko jih je.
She usually liked it.	Običajno ji je bilo všeč.
That and nothing more.	To in nič več.
I was tired too.	Tudi jaz sem bil utrujen.
And you didn’t seem to have much time for people who didn’t.	In zdelo se je, da nisi imel veliko časa za ljudi, ki ga niso.
He was not happy to see me.	Ni bil vesel, da me je videl.
You know, he played well when he had to.	Veste, dobro je igral, ko je bilo treba.
I thought he could play.	Mislil sem, da zna igrati.
Or not.	Ali pa ne.
No, not really.	Ne, res ne.
I've never felt this way before.	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil.
He would go.	On bi šel.
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
Probably long before that.	Verjetno že dolgo pred tem.
And more work.	In še več dela.
Again, this is not a problem.	Še enkrat, to ni problem.
We cannot and should not do this.	Tega ne moremo in ni treba narediti.
I got someone right away.	Takoj sem dobil nekoga.
I thought that was it.	Mislil sem, da je to.
I like it, a lot.	Všeč mi je, zelo.
He won't talk to me.	Noče govoriti z mano.
Ready to go?	Pripravljen da grem?
I believe it exists.	Verjamem, da obstaja.
That was what he was waiting for.	To je bilo tisto, kar je čakal.
None of us can.	Nihče od nas ne more.
Apparently there was a problem.	Očitno je bil problem.
Not so.	Ne tako.
Did you see.	Si videl.
It's almost like you're really there.	Skoraj, kot da si res tam.
Not so.	Ne tako.
But it seemed to her.	A zdelo se ji je.
I wouldn't make the money.	Denar ne bi naredil.
Unfortunately, you will not succeed.	Žal vam ne bo uspelo.
What he wanted was always right.	Kar je hotel, je bilo vedno prav.
You will tell me yours.	Povedal mi boš svoje.
either way I thought.	tako ali tako sem mislil.
This week and next.	Ta teden in naslednji.
What really happened.	Kaj se je res zgodilo.
I never said no.	Nikoli nisem rekel ne.
I don't really want anyone to know.	Pravzaprav nočem, da bi kdo vedel.
As we well know.	Kot dobro vemo.
We can only be here.	Lahko smo samo tukaj.
What is he up to now? 	Kaj namerava zdaj?
He couldn't believe he was going to do it, a.	Ni mogel verjeti, da bo to storil, a.
I quickly saw that he was my father.	Hitro sem videl, da je moj oče.
Life here is hard.	Življenje tukaj je težko.
Because I'm here.	Ker sem tukaj.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
It's just a matter of time.	Samo vprašanje časa je.
A long time ago.	Dolgo časa nazaj .
I see him every day.	Vidim ga vsak dan.
I am too happy to be able to help.	Preveč sem vesel, da sem lahko v pomoč.
He promised me not to tell.	Obljubil me je, da ne bom povedal.
Do what you can.	Naredi, kar lahko.
I wish him luck.	Želim mu srečo.
It may not even exist.	Morda sploh ne obstaja.
I'm alone, you know.	Sam sem, da veš.
Maybe a little too much.	Mogoče malo preveč.
If it seems fast enough, it’s fast enough.	Če se zdi dovolj hitro, je dovolj hitro.
And so it has.	In tako ima.
And something else.	In še nekaj.
Apparently this was my life.	Očitno je bilo to moje življenje.
I've been doing this for years.	To sem delal leta.
I will do that if you want me to do it.	To bom storil, če želite, da to storim.
Someone must know something.	Nekdo mora nekaj vedeti.
This has never happened to me before.	To se mi še nikoli ni zgodilo.
And he didn't do that.	In tega ni storil.
I told you about it myself.	Sam sem ti povedal o tem.
You know when.	Saj veš kdaj.
We don't need to talk about it.	O tem nam ni treba govoriti.
Or it was.	Ali pa je bilo.
I hope you like it !.	Upam, da vam je všeč!.
He can't or won't.	Ne more ali noče.
Or a car.	Ali avto.
Who is.	kdo je.
Something is wrong.	Nekaj ​​je narobe.
That was about me.	To je bilo o meni.
They were both really good.	Oba sta bila res dobra.
It doesn’t seem to me that I was the one who did this.	Ne zdi se mi, da sem jaz tisti, ki je to počel.
There must be more.	Mora biti več.
This is not usually the case.	Običajno ne gre tako.
Even for a long time.	Tudi za dolgo časa.
I don't want to be here.	Nočem biti tukaj.
Almost everyone.	Skoraj vsi.
I am glad that we are above this and for the better.	Vesel sem, da smo nad tem in na bolje.
I don't know anything else.	drugega ne vem.
They had theirs.	Imeli so svoje.
We need to know what happened.	Vedeti moramo, kaj se je zgodilo.
I'm going right now.	Takoj grem.
I will definitely do that.	To bom zagotovo storil.
And what she just said is true.	In to, kar je pravkar rekla, je res.
It never was and never will be.	Nikoli ni bilo in nikoli ne bo.
So soon.	Tako kmalu.
And also once more.	In tudi še enkrat.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
What you did is wrong.	Kar si naredil, je narobe.
He let go.	Pustil je.
If there is, how is that possible.	Če je tam, kako je to mogoče.
I'm sure he is	Prepričan sem, da
She was for me.	Bila je zame.
He is here with us.	Tukaj je z nami.
I know how it is.	Vem kako je.
Don't talk like that.	Ne govori tako.
Everything is possible right now.	Trenutno je vse mogoče.
More.	Več.
But there was more to it than that.	Vendar je bilo več kot to.
No one ever seems to do that.	Zdi se, da tega nikoli nihče ne počne.
Even more.	Še bolj.
You can have them.	Lahko jih imaš.
We don't know what to do about it.	Ne vemo, kaj storiti glede tega.
And he eats it.	In ga poje.
And yet he is not afraid of it.	In vendar se zaradi tega ne boji.
That's what she told me.	Tako mi je rekla.
You're for you now.	Zdaj si zate.
A little more needs to be said.	Še malo je treba povedati.
That was my question.	To je bilo moje vprašanje.
I wasn’t sure what that was.	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj je to.
He never wanted to be.	Nikoli ni hotel biti.
It's true.	Res je.
It's simply not possible.	Preprosto ni mogoče.
He is nothing to me anymore.	On zame ni več nič.
That's how we should be.	Tako bi morali.
We had to say what we didn’t like.	Morali smo povedati, kaj nam ni bilo všeč.
I could never tell.	Nikoli ne bi mogel povedati.
When we did.	Ko smo to storili.
It was always there.	Vedno je bilo tam.
I am human.	jaz sem človek.
I didn't want to.	nisem hotel.
I need to see you.	Moram te videti.
He never left.	Nikoli odšel.
Better that way.	Bolje tako.
If possible, alone today.	Če je mogoče, danes sam.
I didn't expect to be here in the morning.	Nisem pričakoval, da bom zjutraj tukaj.
It can be better.	Bolje je mogoče.
And that was just it.	In to je bilo samo to.
And they are not the only ones.	In niso edini.
He saw her for the first time.	Prvič jo je videl.
Maybe not.	Mogoče ni.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
I only came once.	Prišel sem samo enkrat.
I totally bought them.	Popolnoma sem jih kupil.
Everything is wrong.	Vse je narobe.
That's almost all.	To je skoraj vse.
You can't do that.	Tega ne moreš.
I’m not so sure about everything.	Nisem tako prepričan o vsem.
Obviously they will.	Očitno bodo.
He won't come.	Noče priti.
She needs to get out.	Treba je ven.
Maybe someone called us for help.	Mogoče nas je kdo poklical na pomoč.
It's easy.	Lahko je.
That is certainly true.	To je zagotovo res.
You don’t have to do that.	Tega vam ni treba storiti.
It could be, but it's not.	Lahko bi, pa ni.
I saw something more.	Videl sem nekaj več.
I myself will come here very often and work.	Sam bom zelo pogosto prišel sem in delal.
This way I felt much better.	Na ta način sem se počutil veliko bolje.
I think that would be a problem.	Mislim, da bi bil to problem.
But there are none.	Vendar jih ni.
I understand what you mean.	Razumem kaj misliš.
He didn't need to be told.	Ni mu bilo treba povedati.
There's a lot of them.	Veliko jih je.
She always wanted me then.	Takrat si me je vedno želela.
I can't talk anymore.	Ne morem več govoriti.
I didn't think he would tell me.	Nisem si mislil, da mi bo povedal.
If we don't, we'll be here a long time.	Če ne bomo, bomo še dolgo tukaj.
I actually know that.	To pravzaprav vem.
I think it is.	Mislim, da je.
I was serious too.	Tudi jaz sem resno mislil.
Because it can help you.	Ker vam je lahko v pomoč.
It was like having you.	Bilo je, kot da bi te imeli.
He had a few.	Imel jih je nekaj.
I just want to leave.	Samo želim oditi.
In fact, more than a few.	Pravzaprav več kot nekaj.
We will do it that day.	To bomo storili tisti dan.
Everything he needs.	Vse, kar potrebuje.
There is no money, she said.	Denarja ni, je rekla.
Or really not.	Ali pa res ne.
There is simply nothing you can do about it.	S tem preprosto ne moreš storiti ničesar.
He’s doing something he wants to do.	Dela nekaj, kar želi početi.
He will probably come back to get more.	Verjetno se bo vrnil, da bi dobil več.
It will be difficult.	Težko bo.
That's what I wanted with him.	To sem želel z njim.
That's right.	Tako je.
It was good to know.	Dobro je bilo vedeti.
I was happy about that.	Tega sem bil vesel.
I'll be fine now.	Zdaj bom v redu.
Until then.	Do takrat.
I'm afraid that's the problem.	Bojim se, da je to problem.
Just keep going and you'll come.	Kar tako naprej in prišel boš.
I'm not sorry.	Žal mi ni žal.
Someone wanted to know something.	Nekdo je hotel nekaj vedeti.
I still have a lot to say.	Imam še veliko za povedati.
So I wasn’t ready for it.	Tako nisem bil pripravljen na to.
You didn't come.	Nisi prišel.
It's really simple.	Res je preprosto.
One can hope !.	Človek lahko upa!.
You will not die.	Ne boš umrl.
Tell him how it goes.	Povej mu, kako gre.
I really didn’t do much.	Res nisem naredil veliko.
It wasn’t as hard as he thought it would be.	Ni bilo tako težko, kot je mislil, da bo.
He says he doesn't want her to feel that way.	Pravi, da ne želi, da se tako počuti.
That happened last week.	To se je zgodilo prejšnji teden.
It's so hard for me.	To mi je tako težko.
Every week.	Vsak teden.
I am very happy.	Zelo sem vesel.
I'm not you	jaz nisem ti
I'm not very good.	nisem zelo dober.
Everyone.	Vsak.
He didn't even call.	Niti poklical ni.
We liked it, but it wasn’t us.	Bilo nam je všeč, a nismo bili mi.
Probably not.	Verjetno ne.
I don't think we're there yet.	Mislim, da še nismo tam.
And we did.	In to smo storili.
You know how they are.	Saj veš kako so.
I heard her too.	Tudi jaz sem jo slišal.
Which I wouldn't.	Kar pa ne bi.
Just a few more.	Samo še nekaj.
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
To be with him.	Biti z njim.
He succeeded.	Uspelo mu je.
It looks nice.	Zdi se lepo.
I told her she would.	Rekel sem ji, da bo.
I was very good at it.	Bil sem zelo dober pri tem.
That is absolutely true.	To je popolnoma res.
There was nothing back then.	Takrat še ni bilo nič.
He came a little early.	Prišel je nekoliko zgodaj.
What he says cannot be true.	Kar pravi, ne more biti res.
I wonder if it will be me soon.	Zanima me, če bom to kmalu jaz.
We will do this because it needs to be done.	To bomo storili, ker je to treba narediti.
I would never eat it.	Nikoli ga ne bi jedel.
Obviously you don't want that.	Očitno si tega ne želiš.
This is so wrong.	To je tako narobe.
This day is not today.	Ta dan pa ni danes.
He does not wish us well.	Ne želi nam dobro.
He's here right now.	Trenutno je tukaj.
Maybe it’s still not enough.	Morda še vedno ni dovolj.
I told him all this.	Vse to sem mu povedal.
I had such a good time.	Imel sem se tako dobro.
You weren't talking about me.	Nisi govoril zame.
He says he would like to see them if he could.	Pravi, da bi jih rad videl, če bi lahko.
but I don't know.	pa ne vem.
This is pretty obvious.	To je precej očitno.
Even if it's not so nice to see me.	Tudi če me ni tako lepo videti.
He was, he is.	Bil je, je.
He probably saw us leave.	Verjetno nas je videl oditi.
I understand her.	razumem jo.
i don't know how to do it.	ne vem, kako to narediti.
That's good enough for me.	To je zame dovolj dobro.
He just said.	Pravkar je rekel.
You already said that.	To si že rekel.
Let me see her.	Naj jo vidim.
We didn't have.	Nismo imeli.
He's probably living his own life.	Verjetno živi svoje.
He didn't mean to.	Ni hotel, da bi.
He is not interested in the question.	Vprašanje ga ne zanima.
This could be done quickly.	To bi bilo mogoče hitro narediti.
She knew nothing of what had happened to him.	Nič ni vedela, kaj se mu je zgodilo.
I didn't do anything.	Ničesar nisem naredil.
And it does.	In to počne.
I never told you.	nikoli ti nisem povedal.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
Like yes, this is going to happen.	Kot da, to se bo zgodilo.
He heard.	Slišal je.
Nothing is happening.	Nič se ne dogaja.
Because you are not.	Ker nisi.
I really don't care.	res me ne zanima.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nič nisem naredil narobe.
There's little he can't do.	Malo je tega, kar ne more storiti.
Everyone likes it!.	Vsem je všeč!.
I could do more and more.	Lahko bi še in še.
We need to get to this.	Moramo priti do tega.
You've been here a long time.	Dolgo si prišel.
If only a few.	Če le nekaj.
How long has this been.	Kako dolgo je bilo to.
He never was.	Nikoli ni bil.
There was nothing more to do.	Nič več ni bilo za narediti.
I'm the one who should leave.	Jaz sem tisti, ki bi moral oditi.
Never again.	Nikoli več.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
And we had it all, you know.	In imeli smo vse, veš.
We wouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi storili.
He will know.	On bo vedel.
Instead, he went to them.	Namesto tega je šel k njim.
But he likes to talk a lot.	Vendar rad veliko govori.
It is forever.	To je za vedno.
Whether it is or nothing.	Ali je to ali nič.
But there was no time.	Vendar ni bilo časa.
I heard him.	slišal sem ga.
We're almost here.	Skoraj smo tukaj.
Obviously not.	Očitno ni.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
I saw the things you did.	Videl sem stvari, ki si jih naredil.
And it's not easy.	In ni lahko.
So am I.	Tudi jaz sem.
I think we have a problem here.	Mislim, da imamo tukaj problem.
This is an opportunity.	To je priložnost.
He can go with me.	Lahko gre z mano.
If it is there.	Če je tam.
And we really don’t know much about that yet.	In res še ne vemo veliko o tem.
He will return.	Vrnil se bo.
We have a lot of money.	Imamo veliko denarja.
More sometimes, what would my father say?	Bolj včasih, kaj bi rekel moj oče?
I couldn't do it without you.	Brez tebe ne bi mogel.
Boy did they make it.	Fant, naredili so ga.
I will.	Še bom.
Very good for you.	Zelo dobro zate.
Like me, today.	Kot jaz, danes.
He's just like you and me.	On je tako kot ti in jaz.
I needed to know more.	Moral sem vedeti več.
Who knows where he was the day before.	Kdo ve, kje je bil dan prej.
Must be.	Mora biti.
Hard as usual.	Težko kot običajno.
I know all of you.	Poznam vse te.
But I didn't think it was enough.	Vendar se mi ni zdelo dovolj.
For some time.	Za nekaj časa.
It was almost not enough.	Skoraj ni bilo dovolj.
It was yes or no.	Bilo je da ali ne.
We are so good together.	Tako dobro sva skupaj.
No, no, friend.	Ne, ne, prijatelj.
For money.	Za denar.
I wouldn't stay.	Ne bi ostal.
The child seemed to know what he was doing.	Zdelo se je, da je otrok vedel, kaj počne.
I don't want to see what's in there.	Nočem videti, kaj je tam.
It's plain and simple.	To je preprosto in preprosto.
None of this is wrong.	Nič od tega ni narobe.
Tell me why you're here.	Povej mi zakaj si tukaj.
He used to love this house.	Nekoč je imel rad to hišo.
I saw that when he was working.	To sem videl, ko je delal.
It's not like that there.	Tam ni tako.
What is it?	Kaj je to?
She wanted him to.	Želela je, da bi.
We know.	Vemo.
Everything was fine.	Vse je bilo v redu.
Maybe that's what happened here.	Mogoče se je to zgodilo tukaj.
Everyone.	Vsi.
I don't like him.	ne maram ga.
He didn't want to come.	Ni hotel priti.
please? 	prosim?
I need you.	potrebujem te.
He never came home.	Nikoli ni prišel domov.
I want to know what you think.	Rad bi vedel, kaj misliš.
You shouldn't know.	Ne bi smeli vedeti.
For what, he didn't know.	Za kaj, ni vedel.
he said.	rekel je.
They had no other.	Drugega niso imeli.
He doesn't want to talk.	Ne želi govoriti.
You know nothing.	Nič ne veš.
You don't like it.	Nisi všeč.
That seems wrong, doesn't it?	To se zdi narobe, kajne?
He doesn't feel well.	Ne počuti se dobro.
I still never understand this part.	Še vedno nikoli ne razumem tega dela.
I'm not feeling well.	Ne počutim se dobro.
So she had to not be there.	Tako je morala ne biti tam.
He felt like a child.	Počutil se je kot otrok.
I should have known you would think that.	Moral bi vedeti, da boš to mislil.
I believe this is a problem.	Verjamem, da je to problem.
Those who are here are here.	Tisti, ki so tukaj, so tukaj.
That's what she said.	To je rekla.
He still has to go to work.	Še vedno mora na delo.
I mean, he was my father.	Mislim, bil je moj oče.
I've never seen him.	Nikoli ga nisem videl.
I didn’t know how he knew that.	Nisem vedel, kako je to vedel.
I will never forget her.	Nikoli je ne bom pozabil.
No, you don't have to work.	Ne, ni ti treba delati.
He was there last night.	Sinoči je bil tam.
It can be difficult.	Lahko je težko.
And before.	In prej.
I saw that.	To sem videl.
I don't even see what it is.	Sploh ne vidim, kaj je.
In fact, I love you very much.	Pravzaprav te imam zelo rad.
That was the only time.	To je bil edini čas.
It only took me a while to get there.	Samo nekaj časa sem potreboval, da sem prišel tja.
He doesn't know them.	Ne pozna jih.
He also had more.	Imel je tudi več.
It's not like that.	Ni tako.
I need to know.	moram vedeti.
You said it yourself.	Sam si rekel.
I will return to this.	vrnil se bom k temu.
He will never do that again.	Tega ne bo nikoli več storil.
That would be better.	To bi bilo bolje.
It was time for me to go too.	Čas je bil, da grem tudi jaz.
None of us knew what to do about it.	Nihče od nas ni vedel, kaj storiti glede tega.
But I'm not sure what.	Nisem pa prepričan, kaj.
And why not.	In zakaj ne.
Something is going on.	Nekaj ​​se dogaja.
And so it should.	In tako bi moral.
I was surprised to see her.	Bil sem presenečen, ko sem jo videl.
Not only that.	Ne samo to.
I have nothing.	Nič nimam.
He's just a boy.	On je samo fant.
Either way, I'm fine.	Tako ali tako mi je v redu.
He knew something was wrong, but he didn’t know what it was.	Vedel je, da nekaj ni v redu, ni pa vedel, kaj je.
If at all possible, you need to move on.	Če je le mogoče, moraš iti naprej.
But not for long.	Vendar ne za dolgo časa.
This is also happening.	Tudi to se dogaja.
No one did.	Nihče ni storil.
Much better than I would have thought.	Veliko bolje, kot bi si mislil.
I don't know when that is.	Ne vem kdaj je to.
And so it will be with us forever.	In tako bo za vedno z nami.
I am tired.	Utrujen sem.
I didn’t know they were there.	Nisem vedel, da so tam.
I didn't know I was doing this all the time.	Nisem vedel, da to počnem ves čas.
You know what will happen.	Veš kaj se bo zgodilo.
Time was short.	Časa je bilo malo.
This is hard.	To je težko.
You don't have to now.	Zdaj ni treba.
To have his money.	Da bi imel svoj denar.
It was right.	Bilo je prav.
I could lose too much if I didn't.	Preveč bi lahko izgubil, če ne bi.
I'm with you.	Pri tem sem s tabo.
I love the way it feels.	Všeč mi je, kako se počuti.
It's hard for so many people.	To je težko za toliko ljudi.
I have a lot of things for you today.	Danes imam zate veliko stvari.
There is.	Ima.
Or not, that’s not right.	Ali pa ne, to ni prav.
Can also.	Lahko tudi.
It is from v.	Je iz v.
Why would.	Zakaj bi.
This is a man.	Ta je človek.
But it still wasn't enough.	A še vedno ni bilo dovolj.
I don't want to see anything.	Nočem videti ničesar.
Nothing really happened.	Prav nič se ni zgodilo.
I am much better now.	Zdaj sem veliko bolje.
My friend, he says he knows you.	Moj prijatelj, pravi, da te pozna.
And yet you have now become nothing.	In vendar si zdaj postal nič.
I'll tell you that.	To vam bom povedal.
You are my problem.	Ti si moj problem.
Who won?	Kdo je zmagal?
It will be here.	Tukaj bo.
I think we need to do this together.	Mislim, da moramo to narediti skupaj.
He is something else.	On je nekaj drugega.
I just don't know.	Samo ne vem.
She wanted to know how you were.	Želela je vedeti, kako si.
It was nice to see.	Lepo je bilo videti.
Don't tell me.	Ne povej mi.
I left both there.	Oba sem pustil tam.
Not a good thing.	Ni dobra stvar.
And it's good.	In je dobro.
you are absolutely right.	popolnoma prav imaš.
Tell him what you told me!	Povej mu, kar si mi povedal!
Maybe not much.	Morda ne veliko.
We will not do anything like that.	Ne bomo naredili nič takega.
As they were.	Kot so bili.
I have my work.	Imam svoje delo.
You like it.	Všeč vam je.
The boy was mine.	Fant je bil moj.
the boy asked.	je vprašal fant.
If I came here, I wouldn't be able to see her.	Če bi prišel sem, je ne bi mogel videti.
He is a good friend.	On je dober prijatelj.
And he did.	In to je storil.
That's all.	To je vse.
It's really like that for me.	Zame je res tako.
It's a boy.	Fant je.
Maybe it was then.	Mogoče je bilo takrat.
I didn't see them.	Nisem jih videl.
But we could be better.	A lahko bi bili boljši.
It's not me.	To nisem jaz.
Not here.	Tukaj jih ne.
He did not return to work.	Ni se vrnil na delo.
And now they are gone again.	In zdaj jih spet ni več.
So it is with this.	Tako je tudi s tem.
So I wanted to believe.	Tako sem želel verjeti.
I said for sure.	Sem rekel zagotovo.
And still nothing.	In še vedno nič.
Dad will call me.	Oče me bo poklical.
Lots, lots of stuff.	Veliko, veliko stvari.
How did he do it?	Kako mu je to uspelo?
It's just definitely not for me.	Samo zagotovo ni zame.
You can't come.	Ne moreš priti.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mogoče je to dobro.
I mean absolutely.	Mislim popolnoma.
I don't know why this is happening.	Ne vem zakaj se to dogaja.
I got to know her very well.	Zelo dobro sem jo spoznal.
We made it ourselves.	Naredili smo si sami.
Not the way it should be.	Ne tako, kot bi morala.
That's what he said.	Tako je rekel.
But that doesn't help me.	Vendar mi to nič ne da.
And probably not.	In verjetno ne.
She is with him.	Je z njim.
But I keep thinking.	Še naprej pa mislim.
I couldn't even believe it.	Sploh nisem mogel verjeti.
My working time.	Moj čas dela.
That's life.	Tako je življenje.
Ni.	Ni.
I wish I wouldn't.	Želim si, da ne bi.
Tomorrow won't be good for anyone.	Jutri ne bo dobro za nikogar.
When you have that, you have a lot.	Ko imaš to, imaš veliko.
I like this.	To mi je všeč.
We did that.	To smo storili.
As if it were true.	Kot da je res.
I can't then.	Takrat ne morem.
Even more than that.	Še več kot to je.
I was surprised to see you here.	Bil sem presenečen, ko sem te videl tukaj.
Just because they are here.	Samo zato, ker so tukaj.
For years.	Že leta.
There has to be something.	Nekaj ​​mora biti.
He said he didn’t know why he did it.	Rekel je, da ne ve, zakaj je to storil.
You're good for me, you know.	Dober si zame, veš.
Will he win, not really.	Ali bo zmagal, res ne.
I knew where he was going.	Vedel sem, kam gre.
He called me.	Poklical me.
Everyone knew what needed to be done.	Vsi so vedeli, kaj je treba storiti.
And maybe more.	In morda še.
I think this is a very good option.	Mislim, da je to zelo dobra možnost.
He says he'll probably never see me again.	Pravi, da me verjetno ne bo nikoli več videl.
I won't go out.	Ne bom šel ven.
No one ever told me.	Nihče mi ni nikoli povedal.
So it just goes on and on.	Tako gre samo naprej in naprej.
I left her alone.	Pustil sem jo samo.
He found me the next day.	Našel me je naslednji dan.
I didn't expect that.	Tega nisem pričakoval.
Doing good has never been so good!.	Delati dobro še nikoli ni bilo tako dobro!.
He might have died instantly.	Morda bi takoj umrl.
He spoke for a long time.	Dolgo je govoril.
That's what it does.	To je tisto, kar počne.
Why not?	Zakaj ne?
Good thing.	Dobra stvar.
Right with me.	Prav pri meni.
I wouldn't tell anyone.	Nikomur ne bi povedal ničesar.
No one needs that kind of money.	Nihče ne potrebuje takega denarja.
He better be ready.	Bolje, da je pripravljen.
We know that for sure.	To zagotovo vemo.
Why would you think anything else.	Zakaj bi si mislil kaj drugega.
You're not like me.	Nisi kot jaz.
A lot of money.	Veliko denarja.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
He wasn't sure why he had come.	Ni bil prepričan, zakaj je prišel.
Nothing more to say.	Nič več za povedati.
Almost that happened.	Skoraj to se je zgodilo.
I was never angry.	Nikoli nisem bil jezen.
Because we're not.	Ker nismo.
If she failed.	Če ji ni uspelo.
No one found her.	Nihče je ni našel.
Almost everyone is.	Skoraj vsi so.
I have nothing to do.	Ničesar nimam za početi.
You should know what's going on.	Vedeti naj bi, kaj se dogaja.
We knew it wouldn’t be easy.	Vedeli smo, da ne bo lahko.
It was more how she said it.	Bolj je bilo to, kako je rekla.
And now it was here.	In zdaj je bilo tukaj.
I felt so good.	Počutil sem se tako dobro.
I'm afraid it isn't.	Bojim se, da ni.
And we have work to do.	In dela imamo.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
It wasn't there either.	Tudi tam ni bilo.
She looked like a good person.	Videti je bila kot dobra oseba.
There can be no other.	Drugega ne more biti.
But he knows he has to stay home.	Vendar ve, da mora ostati doma.
Very nice of him.	Zelo lepo od njega.
He doesn't have much money.	Nima veliko denarja.
I had to work.	Moral sem delati.
This is not wrong.	To ni narobe.
You have what you wanted.	Imaš, kar si želel.
He was very kind to me.	Bil je zelo dober do mene.
And he knew it was true.	In vedel je, da je res.
I will die forever.	Umrl bom za vedno.
She's not sorry.	Ni ji žal.
I'm ready, he said.	Pripravljen sem, je rekel.
She was just.	Bila je samo.
I should do something.	Nekaj ​​bi moral narediti.
I hope you succeed.	Upam, da ti bo uspelo.
He couldn't believe what she said, he said.	Ni mogel verjeti, kaj je rekla, je rekel.
That's how she could go.	Tako je lahko šla.
You should know better than that.	Moral bi vedeti bolje kot to.
And that's what it's about.	In za to gre.
Not even that.	Tudi to ne.
He doesn't do anything.	On ne naredi ničesar.
I think you'll like it.	Mislim, da ti bo všeč.
But it's not that simple.	Vendar ni tako preprosto.
He obviously wanted to continue talking.	Očitno je želel govoriti naprej.
So little time for that.	Tako malo časa za to.
I wouldn’t try to do anything.	Ne bi poskušal narediti ničesar.
Good day.	Dober dan.
How could it not be.	Kako ni bilo.
There would not be enough of them soon.	Kmalu jih ne bi bilo dovolj.
To be with him.	Biti z njim.
It really will happen no matter what.	Res se bo zgodilo ne glede na vse.
Not that !.	Ne ta!.
I think this can be a problem.	Mislim, da je to lahko problem.
Now the problem.	Zdaj pa problem.
But he was.	Vendar je bil on.
This may be the only opportunity you will have.	Morda je to edina priložnost, ki jo boste imeli pri tem.
He's already done that.	To je že počel.
We've been here before.	Tukaj smo že bili.
I said that.	to sem rekel.
What about this?	Kaj pa to?
That would be right.	To bi bilo prav.
He just got home.	Pravkar se vrnil domov.
Unfortunately, this is not true.	Žal to ni res.
After that, he worked.	Po tem je delal.
We didn’t see anything of them the next day.	Naslednji dan jih nismo videli ničesar.
I don't know how to do it.	Ne vem, kako to storiti.
She didn't know how she knew that.	Ni vedela, kako je to vedela.
He seemed to have it all.	Zdelo se je, da ima vse.
I don't think so.	mislim ne.
It's small.	Malo je.
So very sorry.	Tako zelo žal.
He is not well today.	Danes mu ni dobro.
There aren't many of them.	Ni jih prav veliko.
Fortunately, it's simple.	Na srečo je to preprosto.
She liked them both.	Oba sta ji bila všeč.
You just have to tell him what to do.	Samo vedeti mu moraš povedati, kaj naj naredi.
There was enough time for us to be together.	Bilo je dovolj časa, da smo bili skupaj.
And it was completely wrong.	In bilo je popolnoma narobe.
He did what he did.	Naredil je, kar je naredil.
And he didn't know.	In ni vedel.
That was not the question.	To ni bilo vprašanje.
Nor should anyone.	Prav tako ne bi smel nihče.
Can anyone help me?	Mi lahko kdo pomaga?
And now he is gone forever.	In zdaj je za vedno odšel.
He had a lot.	Imel je veliko.
We've seen that before.	To smo že videli.
And boy, did he let me have it.	In fant, ali mi ga je pustil.
However, more can be done.	Vendar se da narediti več.
She feels much better now.	Zdaj se počuti veliko bolje.
We have a problem here.	Tukaj imamo problem.
He thought it might be the way she said it.	Mislil je, da je morda tako, kot je rekla.
To know her.	Da jo poznam.
It's you and you know it.	To si ti in to veš.
They are not for me.	Niso zame.
I'm fine with that.	V redu sem s tem.
He was not sorry.	Ni mu bilo žal.
He couldn't tell you anything like that.	Nič takega ti ni mogel povedati.
My father saw them too.	Tudi oče jih je videl.
He didn't like that at all.	To mu sploh ni bilo všeč.
Maybe he had to go there and do it.	Mogoče je moral iti tja in to narediti.
That's your friend.	To je tvoj prijatelj.
I was already fine.	Bil sem že v redu.
I could do that.	To bi lahko storil.
Now you know who we are.	Zdaj veste, kdo smo.
I'll be here.	Tukaj bom.
I am your father.	jaz sem tvoj oče.
Talk and talk.	Govori in govori.
Something still wasn't right.	Nekaj ​​še vedno ni bilo v redu.
Soon.	Kmalu bo.
How little they knew.	Kako malo so vedeli.
I see he's gone.	Vidim, da ga ni več.
You will like it.	Všeč ti bo.
And he went on.	Pa je šel naprej.
It's not just about that.	Ne gre samo za to.
He felt better now.	Zdaj se je počutil bolje.
This happened once.	To se je zgodilo enkrat.
She knew she was wrong.	Vedela je, da je narobe.
What is it.	Kaj je to.
He asked her why.	Vprašal jo je zakaj.
She wasn't once.	Nekoč ni bila.
It’s actually very nice.	Pravzaprav je zelo lepo.
We didn’t really know that.	Tega pravzaprav nismo vedeli.
The day did not start well.	Dan se ni začel dobro.
I've been here before.	Bil sem že tukaj.
For people, for me.	Za ljudi, zame.
I will come.	Jaz bom prišel.
I do not have to.	Ni mi treba.
They are nothing.	Niso nič.
My job is not hard.	Moje delo ni težko.
I'll tell you.	povedal ti bom.
I wouldn't hear of him doing anything else now.	Zdaj ne bi več slišal, da bi počel kaj drugega.
Obviously it doesn't exist.	Očitno ne obstaja.
Either tonight, or just then.	Ali nocoj, ali prav takrat.
It's like they don't exist.	Kot da jih ni.
He wanted to say more.	Želel je povedati več.
Not a good look.	Ni dobro videti.
I understand more than you think.	Razumem več, kot si mislite.
I've had enough.	Dovolj mi je bilo.
Because of him.	Zaradi njega.
He would help me.	On bi mi pomagal.
There was nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni bilo nič narobe.
It was really good.	Res je bilo dobro.
I need you more and more.	Vedno bolj te potrebujem.
I can hope!.	Lahko upam!.
Boy oh boy.	Fant, o fant.
Maybe the only good one.	Mogoče edina dobra.
I see him there.	Vidim ga tam.
Time does it.	Čas to naredi.
It's hard to believe she's not here.	Težko je verjeti, da je ni tukaj.
He should be his true self.	On bi moral biti svoj pravi jaz.
For the things you want.	Za stvari, ki jih želite.
We would have a lot of that.	Tega bi imeli veliko.
He called me.	Poklical me je.
But it didn't feel right.	Vendar se mi ni zdelo prav.
.	.
I'm going to do this thing.	To stvar bom naredil.
Tell me.	Povej za mano.
But what if it was me.	A kaj ko bi bil jaz.
We shouldn't have told him.	Ne bi mu smeli povedati.
If that.	Če to.
Everyone had that.	To so imeli vsi.
To this day, I have never heard him again.	Do danes ga nisem nikoli več slišal.
Like never.	Kot nikoli.
There was not much else to say.	Ni bilo veliko drugega za povedati.
He was too alone.	Bil je preveč sam.
And yet he saw both.	In vendar je videl oba.
She said no, no, she can't do that.	Rekla je ne, ne, tega ne more storiti.
They are a way to be completely human.	So način, kako biti popolnoma človek.
Often her.	Pogosto jo.
And I'm really sorry for you.	In res mi je žal zate.
Everything was fine.	Vse je bilo dobro.
He can swim very fast.	Zelo hitro zna plavati.
I still don't fully understand why.	Še vedno ne razumem popolnoma, zakaj.
Life was very difficult.	Življenje je bilo zelo težko.
That's how it goes sometimes.	Tako to gre včasih.
If we are here, we are here.	Če smo tukaj, smo tukaj.
We don't know how.	Ne vemo kako.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nič nisem naredil narobe.
This has never happened before.	To se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
He would love it.	Všeč bi mu bilo.
I have a few for work.	Nekaj ​​jih imam za delo.
You know you want to.	Veš, da želiš.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
Nothing is right, nothing is as it seems.	Nič ni prav, nič ni tako, kot je videti.
I will never be ready.	Nikoli ne bom pripravljen.
I’m not sure what’s going wrong.	Nisem prepričan, kaj gre narobe.
I won't be long.	Ne bom dolgo odšel.
I just liked it.	Preprosto mi je bilo všeč.
I will not do that.	Tega ne bom storil.
That's about it.	To že gre za to.
I don't have one.	Nimam.
It's just a game, he told himself again.	To je samo igra, si je spet rekel.
He will find something to do.	Našel bo kaj početi.
However, this is not true.	Vendar to ni res.
I heard about it almost every day.	O tem sem slišal skoraj vsak dan.
Okay, just a little more.	V redu, samo še malo.
He didn't really say all that much.	Pravzaprav ni povedal vsega tako veliko.
Everyone has them.	Vsak jih ima.
I have to play.	Moram se igrati.
I will not be here.	ne bom tukaj.
At the time, everything seemed so simple.	Takrat se je vse zdelo tako preprosto.
You never knew how and when you would die.	Nikoli nisi vedel, kako in kdaj boš umrl.
Maybe tomorrow or the next day.	Morda bo jutri ali naslednji dan.
Even after everything that happened.	Tudi po vsem, kar se je zgodilo.
That's what it's about.	Za kar gre.
I came to talk to you.	Prišel sem, da bi govoril s tabo.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Nisem prepričan, kaj se dogaja.
It could, but it isn't.	Lahko bi, a ni.
Everything was fine.	Vse je bilo v redu.
I have to work fast.	Moram hitro delati.
Fast forward!	Hitro, naprej!
So it was really good.	Tako da je bilo res dobro.
Maybe he was a.	Mogoče je bil a.
Hard to believe.	Težko verjeti.
No one has seen her since.	Od takrat je nihče ni videl.
I learned on my own.	Naučil sem se sam.
However, it was not.	Vendar pa ni bilo.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
He's not for you.	On ni zate.
I'm just there like.	Jaz sem samo tam kot.
It wasn't before.	Prej ni bilo.
You might want to keep playing with this.	Morda bi želel, da se še naprej igra s tem.
This man is.	Ta človek je.
I've had enough of that.	Tega sem imel dovolj.
He won't ask and you won't tell him.	Ne bo vprašal in ti mu ne boš povedal.
I always think so and you will too.	Vedno tako mislim in tudi ti boš.
It's not about me.	Ne gre za mene.
And she was not well.	In ji ni bilo dobro.
He also works there.	Tam tudi dela.
Do it well.	Naredi to dobro.
I never went there.	Nikoli nisem šel tja.
They shouldn't be.	Ne bi smeli biti.
He was very happy to be back home.	Bil je zelo vesel, da se je vrnil domov.
He didn't talk much.	Ni veliko govoril.
It won't be fast.	Ne bo hitro.
You have done so much for me.	Toliko si naredil zame.
I didn't think it was.	Nisem mislil, da je.
Not anymore.	Ne več.
It was hard, but it was right.	Bilo je težko, vendar je bilo prav.
Together.	Vsi skupaj.
You know what you got there.	Veš kaj imaš tam.
I don't know anyone like that.	Ne poznam nikogar takega.
It hasn't been here before.	Prej ni bilo tukaj.
I'll hear you talk.	Slišal bom, če si govoril.
He worked out problems quickly.	Hitro je delal težave.
Time is short, but it can be done.	Časa je malo, a se da.
It would be good tonight.	Nocoj bi bilo dobro.
He was every day.	Vsak dan je bil.
He probably has.	Verjetno ima.
She liked it better that way.	Tako ji je bilo bolj všeč.
I can't believe how well you're doing all together.	Ne morem verjeti, kako dobro ti gre vse skupaj.
Nobody wanted that thing.	Te stvari nihče ni želel.
I better have something '.	Bolje, da imam nekaj'.
Without it, you simply will not succeed.	Brez tega vam preprosto ne bo uspelo.
He could have told her that.	To ji je lahko povedal.
I only know a few things you obviously don't.	Vem le nekaj stvari, ki ti očitno ne.
I don't know why really.	Ne vem zakaj res.
Probably just me.	Verjetno samo jaz.
And it's true.	In res je.
However, it did not seem right to me.	Vendar se mi ni zdelo prav.
I'll call you early.	Poklical te bom zgodaj.
In tired now.	V utrujen zdaj.
Not even a little.	Niti malo.
I don't know anyone here.	Ne poznam nikogar tukaj.
He's here tonight.	Nocoj je tukaj.
Do something.	Naredi kaj.
In fact, it's not even that obvious.	Pravzaprav niti to ni tako očitno.
He wouldn't say why.	Ni hotel povedati, zakaj.
No, you shouldn't.	Ne, ne bi smel.
Tomorrow morning, boy.	Jutri zjutraj, fant.
I don't have that.	jaz tega nimam.
Money helped, but he wasn’t the only one.	Denar je pomagal, a ni bil edini.
Everything would be fine.	Vse bi bilo v redu.
I have to do this for everyone.	To moram narediti za vse.
Seeing you and not being with you.	Videti te in ne biti s tabo.
What's happening? 	Kaj se dogaja?
he thought.	mislil je.
I think that's true.	Mislim, da je to res.
No one will know.	Nihče ne bo vedel.
A friend is absolutely right about that.	Prijatelj ima glede tega popolnoma prav.
I knew better now.	Zdaj sem vedel bolje.
She has three children.	Ima tri otroke.
I have enough time.	Imam dovolj časa.
I never had to.	Nikoli mi ni bilo treba.
He’s too busy today to go out.	Danes je preveč zaposlen, da bi šel ven.
He was ready for it.	Bil je pripravljen na to.
I would like to help her.	Želel bi ji pomagati.
But it was not enough.	Vendar ni bilo dovolj.
I know I can.	Vem, da lahko.
I asked a few people.	Vprašal sem nekaj ljudi.
He'd rather have it and I'd like it.	Raje bi ga imel on in jaz bi ga rad.
That was it, really.	To je bilo to, res.
He knows it's right.	Ve, da je prav.
And that was really hard for me.	In to mi je bilo res težko.
I see a problem.	vidim problem.
I was convinced of that.	V to sem bil prepričan.
Really very good.	Res zelo dobro.
Everything looked very nice.	Vse je bilo videti zelo lepo.
Now it is a question of right and wrong.	Zdaj gre za vprašanje prav in narobe.
Really, really good.	Res, res dobro.
Before.	Pred tem.
I learned a lot from him.	Od njega sem se veliko naučil.
I know what you mean	vem kaj misliš
It wasn't easy either.	Tudi to ni bilo lahko.
I don't question that.	O tem se ne sprašujem.
No, it was better.	Ne, bilo je bolje.
There will be a lot.	Veliko bo.
You're right to be angry.	Prav imaš, da si jezen.
really?	res?
More like three.	Bolj tri.
I didn’t know what happened.	Nisem vedel, kaj se je zgodilo.
I do this often.	To počnem pogosto.
We won't even know what happened to you.	Niti mi ne bomo vedeli, kaj se vam je zgodilo.
That was my life.	To je bilo moje življenje.
No, that's wrong.	Ne, to je narobe.
He should be home now.	Zdaj bi moral biti doma.
It won't be long now.	Zdaj ne bo več dolgo.
He was a man like me.	Bil je človek kot jaz.
No more children for us.	Za nas ni več otrok.
I did not see.	nisem videl.
He will do it himself.	Naredil bo sam.
I know each other.	se poznam.
It wasn't us.	To nismo bili mi.
I have a house.	Imam hišo.
That should be all.	To naj bi bilo vse.
Okay, he said again.	Dobro, je še enkrat rekel.
Who knows what happened.	Kdo ve, kaj se je zgodilo.
There was nothing there.	Tam ni bilo nič.
Some are beautiful, some are not.	Nekaj ​​je lepo, nekaj ne.
I was very tired.	Bil sem zelo utrujen.
It won't be easy.	Ne bo lahko.
I probably never will.	Verjetno nikoli ne bom.
In fact, they are.	Pravzaprav so.
And we certainly are.	In zagotovo smo.
You were the one you wanted.	Ti si bil tisti, ki si ga je želel.
But even then he didn't give up.	A tudi takrat se ni dal.
To be human.	Biti človek.
Nobody wanted her.	Nihče je ni hotel.
I don't want it to be me.	Nočem, da sem to jaz.
We have a lot of work to do.	Imamo veliko dela.
I never came after him.	Nikoli nisem prišel za njim.
Now this has happened.	Zdaj se je to zgodilo.
I wasn’t sure if it would.	Nisem bil prepričan, če bo.
Maybe for you, maybe him.	Morda zate, morda on.
He wants to talk to you.	Želi govoriti s tabo.
This is actually quite difficult.	To je pravzaprav precej težko.
That's why he's here.	Zato je tukaj.
I can't tell you how it happened.	Ne morem vam povedati, kako se je zgodilo.
You had to know.	Moral si vedeti.
But that was not the case once.	A tega nekoč ni bilo.
That will be better.	Tako bo bolje.
However, he did not say that.	Vendar tega ni rekel.
He succeeded.	Uspelo mu je.
I totally do.	Popolnoma to počnem.
Without being able to do much.	Ne da bi lahko naredil veliko.
I couldn't.	Ne bi mogel.
Just like that and.	Samo tako in.
I saw him for the first time.	Prvič sem ga videl.
This is no longer a question.	To ni več vprašanje.
If not, it will.	Če ne, bo.
He couldn't believe what he heard.	Ni mogel verjeti, kaj je slišal.
And there was no one else there.	In tam ni bilo nikogar drugega.
I think this is a very good thing.	Mislim, da je to zelo dobra stvar.
Just not today.	Samo ne danes.
I know, neither do I.	Vem, jaz tudi ne.
It is never enough.	Nikoli ni dovolj.
I wonder if I could come here.	Sprašujem se, ali bi lahko prišel sem.
Still the same.	Še vedno pa prav tako.
I hope that's not the case with you.	Upam, da pri vas ni tako.
No one seems to.	Zdi se, da nihče ne.
I really have nothing else to do.	Res nimam kaj drugega početi.
I thought maybe.	Mislil sem mogoče.
There are many things we do not know.	Veliko je stvari, ki jih ne vemo.
You for that.	Ti za to.
He looked very angry.	Videti je bil zelo jezen.
Every child can speak.	Vsak otrok lahko govori.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
Everything seems so serious.	Vse se zdi tako resno.
you are you	ti si ti.
Let it be good.	Naj bo dobro.
I really am.	res sem.
Just like you have to.	Tako kot moraš.
I had to know for sure.	Moral sem vedeti zagotovo.
He came to me.	Prišel je k meni.
Never.	Nikoli ne.
However, this is not enough.	Vendar to ni dovolj.
I tried to help.	Poskušal sem pomagati.
There's nothing you can do.	Nič ne moreš narediti.
I hope this is better.	Upam, da je to bolje.
He lost it.	Izgubil ga je.
He left shortly after that.	Kmalu za tem je odšel.
We should be here.	Morali bi biti tukaj.
He knows me and something in me knows it.	Pozna me in nekaj v meni to ve.
She had to be there.	Morala je biti tam.
Nothing can go wrong now.	Zdaj ne more iti nič narobe.
She did very well.	Zelo dobro ji je uspelo.
This has never happened before.	To se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
In fact, quite a few.	Pravzaprav kar nekaj.
He says he knows.	Pravi, da ve.
We knew that day would come.	Vedeli smo, da bo prišel ta dan.
I am completely alone.	Popolnoma sam.
That was a lot.	To je bilo veliko.
I think this life.	Mislim, da to življenje.
The child was wrong.	Otrok je bil narobe.
That didn't happen.	To se ni zgodilo.
I mean, seriously.	Mislim, resno.
It's true, it's true.	Res, res je.
She had to be with him, help him.	Morala je biti z njim, mu pomagati.
He really wanted that.	To si je zelo želel.
That's the way it is now.	Tako je zdaj.
It still goes, too.	Tudi še vedno gre.
And that's supposed to be it.	In to naj bi bilo to.
That was him now.	To je bil zdaj on.
He left too.	Tudi on je odšel.
And he has nothing else.	In nima nič drugega.
I don’t want to see him do that.	Nočem ga videti, da to počne.
The boy doesn't know what to say.	Fant ne ve, kaj bi rekel.
All the best.	Vse dobro.
No, you didn't.	Ne, nisi.
Or maybe you could.	Ali pa bi morda lahko.
I am your very good friend.	Jaz sem tvoj zelo dober prijatelj.
I would say it can be a problem sometimes.	Rekel bi, da je včasih lahko problem.
We were alone in the room.	Bili smo sami v sobi.
I want to see him.	Želim ga videti.
He doesn’t want that to ever happen again.	Ne želi si, da bi se to zgodilo še kdaj.
Like mine.	Kot je moj.
Which interests me.	Kar me zanima.
There was a reason for that, too.	V tem je bil tudi razlog.
He likes that.	To mu je všeč.
And soon we will make it right.	In kmalu bomo naredili prav.
That's how he would like it.	Tako bi mu bilo všeč.
I mean when he was there.	Mislim, ko je bil tam.
He was not surprised at all.	Sploh ni bil presenečen.
That's why he's here.	Zato je tukaj.
Maybe that's what she wanted.	Mogoče je to želela.
Or maybe it was this one.	Ali pa je bil morda ta.
It was like being a child again.	Bilo je, kot da bi bil spet otrok.
I'm pretty much the only one who does.	Sem skoraj edini, ki to počne.
Just tell me.	Samo povej mi.
I sure want to know.	Zagotovo želim vedeti.
I want to go there, she said.	Želim iti tja, je rekla.
A lot of that.	Veliko tega.
She had to say something.	Nekaj ​​je morala povedati.
They never did.	Nikoli niso.
I feel fine.	Počutim se v redu.
He did it himself, as a child.	To je storil sam, kot otrok.
And that's what it's about.	In za to gre.
No, she didn't know what she was doing in town.	Ne, ni vedela, kaj počne v mestu.
I am not that person.	Jaz nisem ta oseba.
I can see him now.	Zdaj ga lahko vidim.
It didn't happen.	Ni se zgodilo.
Man is a teacher.	Človek je učitelj.
There are many of us.	Veliko nas je.
You are here now.	Zdaj si tukaj.
He did nothing more.	Nič več ni storil.
Or who talked to him.	Ali kdo je govoril z njim.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
It can't be.	Ne more biti.
I will not lose anything.	Ne bom izgubil ničesar.
What he meant was obvious.	Kar je mislil, je bilo očitno.
Not that we should.	Ne, da bi morali.
That's not what this is about at all.	Tukaj sploh ne gre za to.
I don’t know how this could have happened.	Ne vem, kako se je to lahko zgodilo.
I think we'll see what happens.	Mislim, da bomo videli, kaj se bo zgodilo.
Without expecting anything.	Ne da bi pričakoval kaj.
Life is Beautiful!	Življenje je lepo!
When he returned, she was gone.	Ko se je vrnil, je šla.
Apparently he doesn't either.	Očitno tudi on ne.
But I hope not.	Upam pa, da ne bo.
Maybe more than that.	Morda več kot to.
Okay, you said.	Prav, si rekel.
She was always there for us.	Vedno je bila tam za nas.
He'll give you everything he's got.	Dal ti bo vse, kar ima.
We have a lot to eat.	Imamo veliko za jesti.
To be sure.	Biti prepričan.
No, it just is.	Ne, samo je.
I know it wasn't easy.	Vem, da ni bilo lahko.
I couldn't do without it.	Brez tega ne bi mogel.
Probably not.	Verjetno niso.
I want to see him right away.	Želim ga videti takoj.
I thought he needed help.	Mislil sem, da potrebuje pomoč.
I'm going to work.	Grem v službo.
So much had to be done.	Toliko je bilo treba narediti.
But he doesn’t do any of that here.	Vendar tukaj ne počne ničesar od tega.
Could.	Bi lahko.
This is what ‘I’ do.	To počnem 'jaz'.
He knows that.	On to ve.
He never succeeded.	Nikoli mu ni uspelo.
Tired, it's mine.	Utrujen, moj je.
They were all there.	Vsi so bili tam.
But she needed to know more.	Vendar je morala vedeti več.
I really didn't.	res nisem.
I think he is too.	Mislim, da je tudi on.
Maybe she's interested.	Mogoče jo zanima.
Now you know the reason.	Zdaj veste razlog.
Sometimes it can be difficult.	Včasih je lahko težko.
Tell her what happened.	Povej ji, kaj se je zgodilo.
I don’t know how long that will be.	Ne vem, kako dolgo bo to.
Maybe they were there.	Morda so bili tam.
And it's still like that today.	In tako je še danes.
They did just that.	Naredili so prav to.
Just come back and see what he can do.	Samo prišel nazaj in videl, kaj lahko naredi.
I really wasn’t sure.	Res nisem bil prepričan.
And that's okay.	In to je v redu.
No one would tell me why.	Nihče mi ne bi povedal zakaj.
It's just not that simple.	Samo to ni tako preprosto.
No one was here.	Nihče ni bil tukaj.
He is a good man.	On je dober človek.
Anything that could be.	Vse, kar bi lahko bilo.
Now we have succeeded.	Zdaj nam je uspelo.
He told her it happened.	Povedal ji je, da se je zgodilo.
I'm coming here.	grem sem.
But it wasn't just him.	A ni bil samo on.
He did it well.	To je dobro opravil.
I don't understand that at all.	Tega niti malo ne razumem.
I didn't think so.	Nisem mislil tako.
You know how it was.	Veš, kako je bilo.
Do you want to come?	Želiš priti?.
In fact, all before.	Pravzaprav vse prej kot.
This is something else.	To je nekaj drugega.
I won't be here in the morning.	Zjutraj me ne bo.
We have to leave soon.	Kmalu moramo oditi.
I was surprised.	Bil sem presenečen.
I only heard what you heard.	Slišal sem samo to, kar si slišal ti.
For you, boy.	Zate, fant.
Nobody knows where he is.	Nihče ne ve, kje je.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
Or they were.	Ali pa so bili.
Someone better do something soon.	Bolje, da nekdo kmalu nekaj naredi.
I wanted to tell you.	Hotel sem ti povedati.
I wasn't happy about that.	Nisem bil vesel tega.
However, there are many of them.	Vendar jih je zelo veliko.
You can know where it is, not where it is going.	Lahko veš, kje je, ne pa kam gre.
I wouldn't get it.	Ne bi ga dobil.
We did wrong.	Naredili smo narobe.
I felt very confident.	Počutil sem se zelo prepričan.
He felt better.	Počutil se je bolje.
Even better for us.	Še toliko bolje za nas.
It seemed fine.	Zdelo se je v redu.
It's really not that hard.	Res ni tako težko.
I'll leave that at that.	To bom pustil pri tem.
He also admitted that.	To je tudi priznal.
I should have told her that.	To bi ji morala povedati.
I'm not asking.	ne sprašujem.
I really needed him back then.	Takrat sem ga res potreboval.
What is what needs to be done.	Kaj je tisto, kar je treba storiti.
I'll see him tomorrow.	ga bom videl jutri.
I don't know how long.	Ne vem kako dolgo.
Or my work.	Ali moje delo.
When he doesn't see us, he'll call.	Ko nas ne bo videl, bo poklical.
Tell him what to do.	Povej mu, kaj mora narediti.
He doesn't like anyone.	Nihče mu ni všeč.
It's not hard for me.	Ni mi težko.
We thought it was right.	Zdelo se nam je prav.
Swim very fast.	Zelo hitro plavati.
I mean, you know.	Mislim, veš.
That's right.	To je tako.
We've never had that before.	Tega še nikoli nismo imeli.
Everything is still there.	Vse je še vedno.
You probably know what the reason is.	Verjetno veš, kaj je to razlog.
It seemed like a lot at the time.	Takrat se je zdelo veliko.
They may not have it at all tomorrow.	Morda sploh ne bodo imeli jutri.
I will not eat at all.	sploh ne bom jedel.
Now I would never know why.	Zdaj ne bi nikoli vedela, zakaj.
He needs me.	Potrebuje me.
That way no one would see you.	Tako te nihče ne bi videl.
Can someone please do this?	Ali lahko nekdo prosim to stori?
That, even more so.	To, še bolj.
We saw the kids at the party	Otroke smo videli na zabavi
He said he has.	Rekel je, da ima.
We'll know soon enough.	Kmalu bomo vedeli.
He said .	Rekel je .
And so will he.	In tudi on bo.
were you	si bil ti?
Again, nothing happened there again.	Tudi tam se spet ni zgodilo nič.
Very very good.	Zelo zelo dobro.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.	Narobe, narobe, narobe.
That was not true.	Tako ni bilo res.
He doesn't talk very often.	Ne govori prav pogosto.
It's for fun.	Gre za zabavo.
You're my boyfriend.	Ti si moj fant.
That's why she won't be.	Zato je ne bo.
That feels good.	To se počuti dobro.
Maybe it is.	Mogoče je to.
Because we can't do much about it.	Ker glede tega ne moremo veliko narediti.
Not just my work.	Ne samo moje delo.
Stay with me.	Ostal pri meni.
I knew nothing.	Nič nisem vedel.
It's very simple.	To je zelo preprosto.
I'm still there.	Še vedno sem tam.
It's fast.	To je hitro.
He simply exists.	On preprosto obstaja.
it's true.	res je.
I have to work.	Moram delati.
He would.	On bi.
I'll be back for you.	Vrnil se bom po vas.
And you didn't know.	In nisi vedel.
I want her here.	Želim jo tukaj.
She doesn't need him.	Ne potrebuje ga.
I have to go.	Moram iti.
I don't want him to come.	Nočem, da pride.
There was obviously something else to see.	Očitno je bilo še kaj videti.
Everything he does works well.	Vse, kar počne, dela dobro.
I have it.	jaz jo imam.
I could still.	še bi lahko.
I would help you with that.	Pri tem bi vam pomagal.
My boyfriend wouldn't talk to you.	Moj fant ne bi govoril s tabo.
He was not here.	Tukaj ga ni bilo.
He won't ask you again.	Ne bo te več vprašal.
She'll be better.	Bolje ji bo.
He knows when it is.	On ve, kdaj je.
What can be	Kaj je lahko
There really is nothing to do.	Res ni kaj narediti.
That's behind us.	To je za nami.
There is a lot of money today.	Danes je denarja veliko.
That's the way things are.	Tako so stvari.
Tell me what's going on.	Povej mi kaj se dogaja.
Soon he couldn't.	Kmalu ni mogel.
I never felt that way again.	Nikoli več se nisem počutil tako.
I really understand.	res razumem.
It's simply not possible.	Preprosto ni mogoče.
That's enough for everyone.	Dovolj je za vse.
i can't be sure.	ne morem biti prepričan.
But not me.	Vendar ne jaz.
I want to be here.	želim biti tukaj.
This is a very good thing.	To je zelo dobra stvar.
However, it is not very difficult.	Vendar pa ni zelo težko.
Ni.	Ni.
I'm sorry to see you.	Žal mi je, da te vidim.
What else can he do.	Kaj drugega lahko naredi.
I don't know what he's up to.	Ne vem, kaj namerava.
I shouldn't do that either.	Tudi tega ne bi smel storiti.
I think they probably will.	Mislim, da verjetno bodo.
But we have it.	Vendar ga imamo.
I have them, but not without a lot of work.	Imam jih, vendar ne brez veliko dela.
It was hard for everyone.	Vsem je bilo težko.
That was the one thing I wouldn't do.	To je bila edina stvar, ki je ne bi naredil.
Without it, I would be nothing.	Brez tega ne bi bil nič.
You said yourself he was in trouble.	Sam si rekel, da ima težave.
you are at home.	doma ste.
I never heard him.	Nikoli ga nisem slišal.
And you will be better too.	In tudi ti boš boljši.
We should get out.	Morali bi ven.
I want to hear what he has to say about this.	Rad bi slišal, kaj ima o tem povedati.
I doubt this is the only one.	Dvomim, da je to edini.
That's right enough.	To je dovolj prav.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
This one might work time.	Ta morda dela čas.
You have to help us.	Pomagati nam moraš.
But no.	Vendar ne.
You can't see him.	Ne moreš ga videti.
It might be better if you did.	Morda bi bilo bolje, če bi.
Maybe not much.	Morda ne veliko.
We are very.	Zelo smo.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
He no longer knew what it was.	Ni več vedel, kaj je.
This is going to happen, this is definitely going to happen.	To se bo zgodilo, to se bo zagotovo zgodilo.
As it is now.	Kot je zdaj.
I wonder where he lives.	Sprašujem se, kje živi.
I tried.	Poskušal sem.
He saw, but he wouldn't tell her.	Videl je, a ji ni hotel povedati.
Maybe he was.	Mogoče je bil.
I should do that.	To bi moral narediti.
And so we did.	In tako smo tudi storili.
He likes it here.	Všeč mu je tukaj.
I just asked her something.	Pravkar sem jo nekaj vprašal.
I think this is a problem with us.	Mislim, da je to problem pri nas.
That would be right.	To bi bilo prav.
He eats almost everything.	Poje skoraj vse.
That is a lot.	To je veliko.
We can be better than that.	Lahko smo boljši od tega.
I called you home, but you weren't there.	Poklical sem te domov, a te ni bilo.
She wanted it to be true.	Želela je, da bi bilo res.
If I had, I might never have left.	Če bi, morda ne bi nikoli odšel.
I should come tomorrow.	Prišel bi moral jutri.
I know you're there.	Vem, da si tam.
And so was my father.	In bil je tudi moj oče.
If nothing else, it is.	Če ni nič drugega, je to.
What he said.	Kar je rekel.
Just like yours, here.	Tako kot tvoj, tukaj.
That is a lot.	To je veliko.
I never said that.	Tega nisem nikoli rekel.
We don't.	Mi pa ne.
Something she said was very difficult.	Nekaj, kar je rekla, je bilo zelo težko.
I told him.	Povedal sem mu.
He will see you himself.	Sam te bo videl.
It's probably there too.	Verjetno je tudi tam.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ni hotel govoriti z mano.
Maybe.	Mogoče se.
I hope everything is allright.	Upam, da je vse v redu.
He never wanted to.	Nikoli ni hotel.
My friend is here.	Moj prijatelj je tukaj.
I couldn't speak.	nisem mogel govoriti.
I'll tell him you're not here.	Povedal mu bom, da te ni tukaj.
It's just not there.	Preprosto ga ni.
This is a good day.	To je na dober dan.
I know.	Vem.
Now or never !.	Zdaj ali nikoli!.
Everything goes so fast.	Vse gre tako hitro.
Here is!	Tukaj je!
Just a little.	Le malo.
I want you .	Želim si te .
Nobody has.	Nihče nima.
And that was because of me.	In to je bilo zaradi mene.
This is not an issue at the moment.	To trenutno ni vprašanje.
That's your problem.	To je tvoj problem.
He tried to help her.	Poskušal ji je pomagati.
He got lost.	Izgubil se je.
Almost no one can.	Skoraj nihče ne more.
That was not possible.	To ni bilo mogoče.
I'll tell you when.	ti bom povedal kdaj.
And so it was.	In tako je bilo.
This is all life.	Vse življenje je to.
He still has it.	Še vedno jo ima.
Maybe a little.	Mogoče, malo.
Or he shouldn't have.	Ali pa naj ne bi imel.
A friend.	Prijatelj.
I don't ask much.	ne sprašujem veliko.
Very true.	Zelo res.
He doesn't seem to know anything.	Zdi se, da ne ve ničesar.
He's only human.	On je samo človek.
Why not?' 	Zakaj ne?'
I didn't tell him much.	Nisem mu povedal veliko.
We just have to be on it.	Preprosto moramo biti na tem.
I gave it my all.	Dal sem vse.
We should too.	Tudi mi bi morali.
But that wasn't all.	A to še ni bilo vse.
He will be fine.	On bo v redu.
We don't know how it happened.	Ne vemo, kako se je zgodilo.
I did my job and he did his.	Jaz sem opravil svoje delo, on pa svoje.
But when a man can, he will.	Ko pa človek lahko, bo.
He expected to be here for a while.	Pričakoval je, da bo tukaj še nekaj časa.
I got off to a nice start on this today.	Danes sem lepo začel k temu.
It was a pleasure working for you.	Lepo je bilo delati za vas.
I used to be a man and.	Nekoč sem bil človek in.
He couldn't help himself.	Ni si mogel pomagati.
Nothing is wrong.	Nič ni narobe.
Man, you were probably there.	Človek, verjetno si bil tam.
More and more.	Vedno več in več.
And nothing else.	Pa nič drugega.
That's what I would do.	To je tisto, kar bi naredil.
He was obviously surprised by what had happened.	Očitno je bil presenečen nad tem, kar se je zgodilo.
They weren't like me.	Niso bili kot jaz.
It happened here.	To se je zgodilo tukaj.
Have you been to this place before?	Ste že bili na tem mestu?
This is clearly not going to happen.	To se očitno ne bo zgodilo.
I didn't want to see anyone.	Nikogar nisem hotel videti.
But he couldn't help himself.	Vendar si ni mogel pomagati.
Nothing else happened, really.	Nič drugega se ni zgodilo, res.
None of us saw that.	Nihče od nas tega ni videl.
Time is everything.	Čas je vse.
She knew how to do it.	Vedela je, kako to narediti.
I want to know what's going on.	Rad bi vedel, kaj se dogaja.
He died soon after your father left.	Umrl je kmalu po tem, ko je tvoj oče odšel.
And that's a good thing.	In to je dobra stvar.
I didn't hear what he said.	Nisem slišal, kaj je rekel.
All of this is right, since he decided to stay here.	Vse to je prav, saj se je odločil ostati tukaj.
And good for me.	In dobro zame.
I see this all the time.	To vidim ves čas.
I know it's not me.	Vem, da nisem jaz.
Just not, man.	Samo ne, človek.
Maybe you should.	Mogoče bi moral.
That was so obvious.	To je bilo tako očitno.
He did what he did.	Naredil je, kar je naredil.
That last week.	To prejšnji teden.
Not again.	Ne že spet.
I didn't have that.	Tega nisem imel.
And that, too, was wrong.	In tudi to je bilo narobe.
If not now, when?.	Če ne zdaj, kdaj?.
And they will do almost anything you want.	In naredili bodo skoraj vse, kar želite.
It used to be that simple.	To je bilo včasih tako preprosto.
It's only a matter of time.	Samo vprašanje časa je.
We have time.	Imamo čas.
I'm not very good at this.	Nisem zelo dober v tem.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
You were very good!	Zelo dober si bil!
However, when this would happen would not be obvious.	Vendar, kdaj bi se to zgodilo, ne bi bilo očitno.
Which they all used to be.	Kar so bili običajno vsi.
I don't have to do this.	Ni mi treba narediti tega.
He didn't hear her.	Ni je slišal.
If not, fine.	Če ne, v redu.
He wouldn't let her go.	Ni ji dovolil oditi.
This is hard work.	To je težko delo.
That's fine with us.	To je v redu z nami.
That's what you told us.	To si nam povedal.
He was my true friend.	Bil je moj pravi prijatelj.
You forgot something.	Nekaj ​​si pozabil.
Not as good as you think.	Ni tako dobro, kot si mislite.
And nothing goes.	In nič ne gre.
Not you either.	Ne tudi ti.
You will have to do it yourself.	To boste morali narediti sami.
It was supposed to be a good day.	Dan naj bi bil dober.
He didn't see anything.	Videl ni ničesar.
Not soon enough.	Ne dovolj kmalu.
And like you.	In kot ti.
You can't, it doesn't exist.	Ne moreš, ne obstaja.
I do not like.	ne maram.
It makes me feel so much better.	Zaradi tega se počutim veliko bolje.
It just wasn’t enough.	Preprosto ni bilo dovolj.
That time is back.	Ta čas se je vrnil.
I did it myself.	To sem naredil sam.
You have to be tired.	Moraš biti utrujen.
It was difficult for me.	Zame je bilo težko.
He is simply alone.	Preprosto je sam.
I don’t know why, it’s simple.	Ne vem zakaj, preprosto je.
It could be better.	Lahko bi bilo bolje.
He worked for me.	Delal zame.
This is not going to happen here.	Tukaj se to ne bo zgodilo.
I didn’t know there was such a thing.	Nisem vedel, da obstaja kaj takega.
There was really nothing to see.	Res ni bilo kaj videti.
I had it.	Imel sem ga.
Maybe he's right.	Mogoče ima prav.
Never never never.	Nikoli nikoli nikoli.
I would do a lot of things today.	Danes bi počel veliko stvari.
We didn’t have much to do yesterday.	Včeraj nismo imeli veliko dela.
Don't talk to me.	Ne govori z mano.
You should come.	Moral bi priti.
Sometimes you are, sometimes you are not.	Včasih si, včasih pa ne.
He certainly knew that was not true.	Zagotovo je vedel, da to ni res.
Nothing can be done about it.	Glede tega se ne da narediti nič.
They both knew how much he had done.	Oba sta vedela, koliko je naredil.
I could do more.	Lahko bi naredil več.
I'm afraid that's it.	Bojim se, da je to to.
Nobody thought it was possible.	Nihče si ni mislil, da je to mogoče.
I'm sure you'll know what to do.	Prepričan sem, da boste vedeli, kaj storiti.
He was not surprised.	Ni bil presenečen.
I waited a bit.	malo sem čakal.
Which is someone no one likes.	Kar je nekdo, ki nihče ne mara.
He says he knows you and that you will help him.	Pravi, da te pozna in da mu boš pomagal.
That's why he does it.	Zato to počne.
I would love to hear from you.	Zelo bi rad slišal od vas.
However, I could not do that.	Vendar tega nisem mogel storiti.
I want to know what happened there.	Želim vedeti, kaj se je tam zgodilo.
It happened last week.	Zgodilo se je prejšnji teden.
He thinks.	On misli.
Where will she go now.	Kam bo šla zdaj.
That's what he ate.	To je tisto, kar je jedel.
Fast and big.	Hitro in veliko.
I don't have children	jaz nimam otrok
You don’t have to do everything yourself.	Ni vam treba narediti vsega sami.
There was nothing else to say.	Nič drugega ni bilo za povedati.
I am sure he will be here very soon.	Prepričan sem, da bo zelo kmalu tukaj.
I lost some, but not too much.	Nekaj ​​sem izgubil, a ne preveč.
Unfortunately, I can't help it anymore.	Žal ne morem več pomagati.
It's true.	Res je.
You will leave.	Odšel boš.
It is never easy.	Nikoli ni lahko.
But now it’s not that simple.	Zdaj pa ni tako preprosto.
We know more now than before.	Zdaj vemo več kot prej.
This is not true.	To ni res.
These are.	To so.
He doesn't want to talk.	Ne želi govoriti.
A man who must.	Človek, ki mora.
Until then, but not yet.	Do tja, vendar še ne.
The man was right.	Človek je imel prav.
No, he wasn't.	Ne, ni bil.
It feels like I feel.	Zdi se mi, kot se počutim.
He only has me.	On ima samo mene.
A little more.	Malo več.
If you have time.	Če imaš čas.
It will be difficult.	Težko bo.
I really don't know her.	Res je ne poznam.
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
Or so it sure seemed.	Ali pa se je zagotovo zdelo.
There were too many of them.	Preveč jih je bilo.
It was really, really hard.	Bilo je res, res težko.
She seemed to be talking to him.	Zdelo se je, da govori z njim.
I've never seen.	Nikoli nisem videl.
What are you going to do?	Kaj boš naredil?
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
It was nice to play.	Lepo je bilo igrati.
You can't talk to him.	Ne moreš govoriti z njim.
That happened.	To se je zgodilo.
Like, that's right.	Kot, tako je.
There are a lot of things here.	Tukaj je veliko stvari.
But it's not nice.	Ali ni lepo.
Nice to see you.	Lepo te je videti.
We can't leave.	Ne moremo oditi.
This will not be difficult for me.	To mi ne bo težko.
I would be willing to help.	Bil bi pripravljen pomagati.
I quit my job.	pustil sem službo.
I never met her.	Nikoli je nisem srečal.
Who are.	Kdo so.
Doing something is something.	Delati nekaj je nekaj.
I had to go out.	Moral sem iti ven.
He was much more than that now.	Zdaj je bil veliko več kot to.
The next day is even better.	Naslednji dan je še bolje.
I know them well.	Dobro jih poznam.
It was as if he didn't mean it.	Zdelo se je, kot da tega ni mislil.
Not what you'd think.	Ne kar bi si mislil.
He was gone now.	Zdaj ga ni bilo več.
There was too much money.	Denarja je bilo preveč.
You know why it was like that.	Veš zakaj je bilo tako.
I don't know what for.	Ne vem pa za kaj.
Are you sure that was enough?	Ste prepričani, da je bilo to dovolj?
I wanted to help him right away.	Želel sem mu takoj pomagati.
You may not even know it’s there.	Morda niti ne veš, da je tam.
We would never do that now.	Tega zdaj ne bi nikoli naredili.
It seemed to be.	Zdelo se je, da je.
And for a while it was enough.	In za nekaj časa je bilo dovolj.
I knew none of this at the time.	Takrat nisem vedel nič od tega.
Who lost everything.	Kdo vse je izgubil.
No, that's not a problem.	Ne, to ni problem.
I didn’t know they did another one.	Nisem vedel, da so naredili drugega.
I asked him if he had ever seen him.	Vprašal sem ga, če ga je že kdaj videl.
It seems to help.	Zdi se, da pomaga.
That was what he expected.	To je bilo tisto, kar je pričakoval.
What would you like to do?	Kaj bi rad počel?
I'm sorry you can't see.	Žal mi je, da ne moreš videti.
And that makes me feel good.	In zaradi tega se počutim dobro.
I didn’t know much about it, but I knew it wasn’t like that.	Nisem vedel veliko o tem, vendar sem vedel, da ni nič takega.
They won’t even know it’s there.	Sploh ne bodo vedeli, da je tam.
Something actually.	Pravzaprav nekaj.
You know what to do.	Veš kaj storiti.
I got to know many of them very well.	Veliko sem jih zelo dobro spoznal.
Maybe she was.	Morda je bila.
I will not do that.	tega ne bom storil.
So it was really hard.	Tako da je bilo res težko.
That was so beautiful.	To je bilo tako lepo.
That is, he does what is right.	Se pravi, dela, kar je prav.
This has been going on for years.	To se dogaja že leta.
There will be a lot of work at the party.	Na zabavi bo veliko dela.
That much is true.	Toliko je res.
I was nothing and I had nothing.	Bil sem nič in nisem imel ničesar.
All this is true.	Vse to je res.
I did it.	To mi je uspelo.
I had to see you.	Moral sem te videti.
We know he's a good boy.	Vemo, da je dober fant.
He didn't like it.	Ni mu bilo všeč.
I'll just go home.	samo domov bom šel.
And he was the only one who knew.	In bil je edini, ki je vedel.
You almost got me too.	Tudi mene si skoraj dobil.
Mine doesn't do that.	Moj tega ne dela.
I'm glad I know.	Vesel sem, da vem.
We have to move on.	Moramo iti naprej.
I don't know what happened to you.	Ne vem kaj se ti je zgodilo.
Not like here.	Ne tako kot tukaj.
All my life.	Vse moje življenje.
I've never seen anyone.	Nikoli nisem videl nikogar.
This week is going to be really good.	Ta teden bo res dober.
Nothing so simple.	Nič tako preprosto.
I can't help myself much.	Precej si ne morem pomagati.
You know what nothing is.	Veste, kar ni nič.
I loved this game.	Všeč mi je bila ta igra.
But I will go with you.	Vendar bom šel s tabo.
No, it was more.	Ne, to je bilo več.
Each of you.	Vsak od vas.
So much more.	Toliko več.
I thought you would think so.	Mislil sem, da boš tako mislil.
How could it be possible.	Kako bi bilo mogoče.
he said.	rekel je.
This is definitely wrong.	To je zagotovo narobe.
That's how it is today.	Danes je tako.
This is not the right time.	Trenutno ni pravi čas.
Not a bit.	Niti malo ni.
That is what we need to know.	To je tisto, kar moramo vedeti.
We don't know again.	Spet ne vemo.
He learned a lot from him.	Od njega se je veliko naučil.
I like that in the morning.	To mi je všeč zjutraj.
I'm going there.	grem tja.
My father was there too.	Tam je bil tudi moj oče.
That's what I wanted.	To sem želel.
Tell him everything you told me.	Povedati mu vse, kar si povedal meni.
He thinks so.	On to misli.
They will never see.	Nikoli ne bodo videli.
Like there's something here.	Kot da je tukaj nekaj.
And your father doesn't know you're here, not yet.	In tvoj oče ne ve, da si tukaj, še ne.
With that.	S tem.
Which he did.	Kar je tudi storil.
Why not now ?.	Zakaj ne zdaj?.
Much better than before.	Veliko bolje kot prej.
That is very good.	To je zelo dobro.
She would definitely be home the next day.	Zagotovo bi bila naslednji dan doma.
You definitely want to go there!.	Zagotovo si želiš iti tja!.
That just can’t be true.	To preprosto ne more biti res.
I thought you knew that too.	Mislil sem, da tudi ti to veš.
I'm a good boy.	jaz sem dober fant.
He needed to know what was going on.	Moral je vedeti, kaj se dogaja.
I should probably be angrier.	Verjetno bi moral biti bolj jezen.
This has never happened before.	To se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
Just never again.	Samo nikoli več.
I'm not afraid anymore.	ne bojim se več.
If nothing else.	Če ni nič drugega.
He was angry.	Bil je jezen.
I do not know where it is.	Ne vem kje je.
Life there is hard.	Življenje je tam težko.
Because it's like that now.	Ker je zdaj tako.
Just not in the way he thought.	Samo ne tako, kot je mislil.
None of us know what you are anymore.	Nihče od nas ne ve več, kaj si.
He went with that.	S tem je šel.
I'm not well.	Nisem dobro.
I was right.	Imel sem prav.
Here's the problem.	Tukaj si problem.
This is much better.	To je veliko bolje.
He did this regardless of knowing it.	To je storil ne glede na to, da je to vedel.
All the time.	Ves čas.
Speak, ”she said.	Govori,« je rekla.
More likely three.	Bolj verjetno tri.
Your father asked you.	Tvoj oče te je vprašal.
That was probably good, but it wasn’t good.	To je bilo verjetno dobro, vendar ni bilo dobro.
I was there, I did it.	Bil sem tam, naredil to.
He started to say something.	Začel je nekaj govoriti.
I know people he knows.	Poznam ljudi, ki jih pozna.
I thought it could be so.	Mislil sem, da bi lahko bilo tako.
I have to do this.	To moram narediti.
It's just for me.	To je samo zame.
I was tired of it.	Bil sem utrujen od tega.
Maybe he's right.	Morda ima prav.
No one would know what she did.	Nihče ne bi vedel, kaj je storila.
I'll give him something to take home.	Dal mu bom nekaj za domov.
He wanted to know the time.	Želel je vedeti čas.
That you know you're here.	Da veš, da si tukaj.
She has been living alone ever since.	Od takrat živi sama.
I don't want to do that here.	Nočem tega početi tukaj.
This is the person.	To je ta oseba.
Not so good.	Ne tako dobro.
He was right.	Imel je prav.
She was so very good.	Tako je bila zelo dobra.
That never happened.	To se ni nikoli zgodilo.
I have to do something.	nekaj moram narediti.
That seems obvious to me.	To se mi zdi očitno.
Not even once.	Niti enkrat.
I didn’t think it was serious.	Nisem mislil, da je resno.
How to do it?.	Kako to narediti?.
We haven't seen many of them.	Nismo jih veliko videli.
We knew that then.	Takrat smo to vedeli.
This is happening to me too.	Tudi meni se to dogaja.
It seems very right to me.	Zdi se mi zelo prav.
I'm not so sure about that.	V to nisem tako prepričan.
That remains to be seen.	To je treba še videti.
And a quick question here.	In hitro vprašanje tukaj.
There was nothing to do.	Ni bilo kaj narediti.
For you.	Zate.
How much.	Koliko.
Tell him everything is going well here.	Povej mu, da gre tukaj vse dobro.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu gre.
They are what they are.	So to, kar so.
I need someone here for me.	Potrebujem nekoga tukaj zame.
Now they had.	Zdaj so imeli.
You are absolutely right.	Imaš popolnoma prav.
It seems so.	Tako se zdi.
It seemed to help.	Zdelo se je, da pomaga.
If you are sure.	Če ste prepričani.
I don’t see what else I could do.	Ne vidim, kaj bi še lahko naredil.
This is going to happen.	To se bo zgodilo.
It's not about the money.	Ne gre za denar.
But he knew he wouldn't.	A vedel je, da ne bo.
You may not like it.	Morda vam ni všeč.
She said she felt much better.	Rekla je, da se počuti veliko bolje.
It doesn't seem that way.	Ne zdi se tako.
She is doing very well.	Zelo dobro ji gre.
I'd like to help.	Rad bi pomagal.
As someone said, it's not.	Kot je nekdo rekel, ni.
We don't need to do that here.	Tukaj nam tega ni treba storiti.
There was a time when she would say what she thought.	Bil je čas, ko bi rekla, kar misli.
But it happened.	Vendar se je zgodilo.
Nothing will happen to me.	Nič se mi ne bo zgodilo.
he asked.	je vprašal.
I said no.	Rekel sem ne.
I left angry and never saw her again.	Jezen sem odšel in je nisem nikoli več videl.
It's not about that.	Ni na tem.
He says he is.	Pravi, da je.
However, more needs to be done.	Vendar je treba narediti več.
It was so obvious.	Bilo je tako očitno.
This is all too much for me.	Vse to je zame preveč.
You should know better.	Moral bi vedeti bolje.
She was home.	Bila je doma.
Maybe something else.	Mogoče je kaj drugega.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
There is much more behind us.	Za nami je še veliko več.
I'm pretty sure it's the only one that exists.	Prepričan sem, da je edini, ki obstaja.
I'm going to have to go with that.	Moral bom iti z da.
If you think you're going to get better, you will.	Če misliš, da ti bo bolje, boš.
I would never forget him.	Nikoli ga ne bi pozabil.
She likes me.	Všeč sem ji.
I don't see why not.	Ne vidim zakaj ne.
He knows it's more than that.	Ve, da je več kot to.
Maybe you're right.	Mogoče imaš prav.
Time.	Čas.
As we have seen, this is not the case here.	Kot smo videli, tukaj ni tako.
I do a lot these days.	Te dni počnem veliko.
There was no one to help her.	Ni bilo nikogar, ki bi ji pomagal.
That one.	Prav tisti.
I see him at home.	Vidim ga kot doma.
maybe not.	morda ne.
There won't be more days.	Ne bo več dni.
Not a hotel.	Ni hotel.
That was never an issue.	To nikoli ni bilo vprašanje.
As it was, it didn't happen.	Tako kot je bilo, se to ni zgodilo.
He can always do them with us.	Vedno jih lahko dela pri nas.
But there is something.	Nekaj ​​pa je.
He sat like that so often.	Tako je pogosto sedel.
He is surprised.	Presenečen je.
He told us everything.	Vse nam je povedal.
It won't be me.	Ne bom jaz.
That didn't happen.	To se ni zgodilo.
Fine.	V redu.
He told me he was going home.	Rekel mi je, da gre domov.
Not so much anymore.	Ne toliko ne več.
You have to come here.	Moraš priti sem.
We used to have it.	Včasih smo ga imeli.
Did you have enough to eat today?	Ste danes imeli dovolj jesti?
Maybe I don't understand.	Morda ne razumem.
He died as a child.	Umrl je kot otrok.
I still see this a lot.	To še vedno veliko vidim.
He did a lot of things for me.	Veliko stvari mi je naredil.
It was now.	Zdaj je bilo.
That was this week.	To je bilo ta teden.
Still too much.	Še vedno preveč.
It really is more a question of who would find them.	Res je bolj vprašanje, kdo bi jih našel.
I saw it myself.	Sam sem to videl.
We will succeed.	To nam bo uspelo.
Because you did something wrong.	Ker si naredil nekaj narobe.
Without it, I would not have succeeded.	Brez tega mi ne bi uspelo.
Now was not the time.	Zdaj ni bil čas.
And you weren't.	In nisi bil.
Yes, a little.	Lahko, malo.
More than once.	Več kot enkrat.
And nothing seemed to help.	In zdelo se je, da nič ne pomaga.
However, this is not possible.	Vendar to ni mogoče.
You should do more.	Moral bi narediti več.
There are so many of you.	Toliko vas je.
I knew immediately what had happened.	Takoj sem vedel, kaj se je zgodilo.
I'd like to see what comes out.	Rad bi videl, kaj bo ven.
He said no.	Rekel je ne.
He really loves me and will do anything for me.	Res me ima rad in zame bo naredil vse.
But that's just what we did.	Vendar je to samo tisto, kar smo naredili.
She did it.	Uspelo ji je.
I'll tell her this afternoon.	Povedal ji bom danes popoldne.
So be it.	Pa naj bo.
Not at the moment.	Trenutno ne.
My father was a good man.	Moj oče je bil dober človek.
We know now.	Zdaj vemo.
We are right.	Imamo prav.
Like it or not, you will die.	Všeč ali ne, umrl boš.
I didn't mean anything by that.	S tem nisem mislil nič.
That never happened.	Tega nikoli ni bilo.
It was obvious that the teacher was not well.	Očitno je bilo, da učitelj ni dobro.
It goes fast.	Hitro gre.
I could be there.	Lahko bi bil tam.
There was no such thing.	Tega ni bilo.
And there it is.	In tam je.
I thought maybe I could do something with it.	Mislil sem, da bi morda lahko kaj naredil s tem.
Now I have it too.	Zdaj ga imam tudi jaz.
And it won't be easy.	In ne bo lahko.
Everything seems fine to me.	Vse se mi zdi v redu.
I don’t want and I don’t need anything more than that.	Ne želim in ne potrebujem ničesar več od tega.
It's small.	Malo je.
Everything seems fine.	Vse se zdi v redu.
Really, really good.	Res, res dobro.
And that time would certainly be now.	In zagotovo bi bil ta čas zdaj.
I hope they will.	upam, da bodo.
There were so few of us.	Bilo nas je tako malo.
It never happened to me.	Nikoli se mi ni zgodilo.
It couldn’t be done that easily.	Ni bilo mogoče storiti, tako preprosto.
But there was nothing.	Nič pa ni bilo.
I don’t know how that could have happened.	Ne vem, kako bi se to lahko zgodilo.
What? 	Kaj?
He returned home the next day.	Naslednji dan se je vrnil domov.
I hope you will too.	Upam, da boš tudi ti.
It wouldn't be right.	Ne bi bilo prav.
She really didn’t know how long.	Res ni vedela, kako dolgo.
And so it comes to this.	In tako pride do tega.
They had their chance.	Imeli so svojo priložnost.
We know.	Vemo.
Everyone seems to have someone.	Zdi se, da ima vsak nekoga.
I can understand that.	To lahko razumem.
I still had time, but probably not much.	Imel sem še čas, a verjetno ne veliko.
I don't see it myself.	Sam tega ne vidim.
Maybe one more time.	Mogoče še enkrat.
It still exists.	Še vedno obstaja.
I don't think they really will.	Mislim, da res ne bodo.
But they are enough.	Vendar so dovolj.
It has something for everyone.	Ima nekaj za vse.
I didn't see him.	Nisem ga videl.
I want to be better.	rad bi bil boljši.
He won't get any of it.	Od tega ne bo imel nič.
Everything was as he left it.	Vse je bilo tako, kot je pustil.
Can anyone help me with this.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga pri tem.
He's been here a lot.	Veliko je bil tukaj.
He came looking pretty tired.	Prišel je videti precej utrujen.
Life is work.	Življenje je delo.
But it was hard to tell.	Vendar je bilo težko povedati.
We had a life.	Imeli smo življenje.
Your father has my people.	Tvoj oče ima moje ljudi.
It won't happen.	Ne bo se zgodilo.
He never asked himself what it was.	Nikoli se ni vprašal, kaj je to.
Who is.	Kdo je.
I couldn't eat anything.	Nič nisem mogel jesti.
She did well.	Dobro ji je uspelo.
But they did nothing.	Vendar niso storili ničesar.
I could do something like this.	Lahko bi naredil kaj takega.
I see the problem.	Vidim problem.
What were you doing?	Kaj si počel?
Not good, maybe.	Ni dobro, morda.
He said she would have liked it better that way.	Rekel je, da bi ji bilo tako bolj všeč.
As we knew it would be.	Kot smo vedeli, da bo.
Nothing there either.	Tudi tam nič.
Why is.	Zakaj je.
Boy, he said.	Fant, je rekel.
I don't like him.	Ne maram ga.
I just wish there were more.	Želim si le, da bi jih bilo več.
You could be right.	Lahko bi imel prav.
He wants to know how.	Želi vedeti, kako.
So much work.	Toliko dela.
Which could be good.	Kar bi lahko bilo dobro.
However, this is not the case here.	Vendar tukaj ni tako.
But we'll see.	Bomo pa videli.
Seems like trouble.	Zdi se kot težave.
I could leave him there.	Lahko bi ga pustil tam.
I succeeded.	Meni je uspelo.
I didn't see anyone.	Nikogar nisem videl.
It was just a lot of work so far.	Do sem je bilo le veliko dela.
I have to go.	Moram oditi.
she said.	je rekla.
I think he was fine.	Mislim, da je bil v redu.
It's that time again.	Spet je tisti čas.
I didn't tell you before.	Prej ti nisem povedal.
And nothing else.	In nič drugega.
Obviously it has to be.	Očitno mora biti.
It was for you.	Za vas je bilo.
I got it.	Dobil sem jo.
They did this once in a few days.	To so naredili enkrat za nekaj dni.
He has known her ever since.	Od takrat jo pozna.
This is not the case here.	Tukaj ni tako.
I want to go home.	Rad bi se vrnil domov.
Instead of.	Namesto tega.
I don't think so.	ne mislim jaz.
I didn't expect that.	Tega nisem pričakoval.
probably would.	verjetno bi.
What to do.	Kaj storiti.
I made it myself.	Naredil sem ga sam.
He was a very good man.	Bil je zelo dober človek.
He says he needs it for his work.	Pravi, da ga potrebuje za svoje delo.
I wasn’t sure what was going to happen.	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj se bo zgodilo.
It just happened.	Pravkar se je zgodilo.
And they were.	In so bili.
The question of being today.	Vprašanje biti danes.
Just a boy.	Samo fant.
I'm not afraid of anything.	Ničesar se ne bojim.
And not for a while.	In ne za malo.
I had to know, to see.	Moral sem vedeti, videti.
I'm not even that.	Niti to nisem.
We can know many things.	Lahko vemo veliko stvari.
Probably still.	Verjetno še vedno.
I want to know why.	Rad bi vedel zakaj.
They are gone now.	Zdaj jih ni več.
But it will happen.	Vendar se bo zgodilo.
what about you?	kaj pa ti?
I love everything about it.	Všeč mi je vse na tem.
She was.	Bila je.
Just as he expected.	Tako kot je pričakoval.
He seemed to have made up his mind.	Zdelo se je, da se je odločil.
He came home happy every day.	Vsak dan je prišel domov vesel.
Here it is.	Tukaj je to.
You have to come.	Moraš priti.
He was working well.	Delal je dobro.
I hope she doesn't go.	Upam, da ne bo šla.
He didn't expect that.	Tega ni pričakoval.
I think there is more.	Mislim, da je več.
She was.	Bila je.
Not after last night.	Ne po sinoči.
I want everything to be done the right way.	Želim, da se vse naredi na pravi način.
It has to be good enough.	Mora biti dovolj dobro.
And she wanted to.	In želela si je.
I'm afraid that's all we have.	Bojim se, da je to vse, kar imamo.
Because you never know what will happen.	Ker nikoli ne veš, kaj se bo zgodilo.
Is everything okay?	Je vse v redu?
Not very good.	Ni zelo dober.
I was angry.	bil sem jezen.
Never came home.	Nikoli prišel domov.
I don’t know if he has or not.	Ne vem ali ima ali ne.
He did what he said again.	Spet je naredil, kar je rekel.
That very much, but he did.	To zelo, vendar je storil.
I would love that.	To bi mi bilo všeč.
Nobody knows why.	Nihče ne ve zakaj.
He can do something like that.	Lahko naredi kaj takega.
Or that there isn't one.	Ali da ga ni.
I sat back.	Sedel sem nazaj.
Now she knew he was here.	Zdaj je vedela, da je bil tukaj.
We need to see.	Moramo videti.
They all were.	Vsi so bili.
That's how it's supposed to be.	Tako naj bi bilo.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
He really didn't know.	Res ni vedel.
I don't want to eat anything right now.	Trenutno nočem jesti ničesar.
I could be there for a while.	Lahko bi bil tam nekaj časa.
But even that was not enough.	A tudi to ni bilo dovolj.
And it often is.	In pogosto je.
I don't have it.	jaz ga nimam.
Because tomorrow he will be gone.	Ker jutri ga ne bo več.
she said.	je rekla.
That seems right.	To se zdi prav.
You could think.	Lahko bi si mislil.
It can't be.	Ne more biti.
In fact, this is not the case.	Pravzaprav temu ni tako.
I need you with me here.	Potrebujem te z mano tukaj.
He lost his job.	Izgubil je službo.
But I was working on it.	Sem pa delal na tem.
I know how they are.	Vem, kako so te.
He must have seen some things before.	Zagotovo je že videl nekaj stvari.
Because it's not going to be nice.	Ker to ne bo lepo.
He's there right now.	Trenutno je tam.
Maybe one day the time will come.	Mogoče bi nekoč prišel čas.
It's a simple question.	To je preprosto vprašanje.
He hasn't done anything yet.	Nič še ni naredil.
That's quite a few.	To je kar nekaj.
He loves us very much.	Zelo nas ima rad.
He saw it too.	Tudi on ga je videl.
Maybe still.	Mogoče še vedno.
Isn't that really something.	Ali ni res nekaj.
what he was doing.	kaj je počel.
You will go home soon.	Kmalu boš šel domov.
We both knew right away.	Oba sva vedela, takoj.
It's so nice to see you.	Tako lepo te je videti.
He was waiting for me this morning.	Danes zjutraj me je čakal.
You are here for your own good.	Tukaj ste za svoje dobro.
Now none of this is going to happen.	Zdaj se nič od tega ne bo zgodilo.
And now he likes it.	In zdaj mu je všeč.
He expected to be at the party.	Pričakoval je, da bo na zabavi.
It's behind you.	Za tabo je.
And it's very early.	In to je zelo zgodaj.
And yet he knew about it.	In vendar je vedel za to.
Very good.	Zelo dobro.
I'll leave them to you.	Pustil ti jih bom.
No matter what, he should be there for you.	Ne glede na vse bi moral biti tam zate.
I want him back with us.	Želim ga nazaj z nami.
This is how life is supposed to be.	Tako naj bi bilo življenje.
I don’t really know who they were.	Pravzaprav ne vem, kdo so bili.
Do this, don't do that.	Naredi to, ne naredi tega.
That's better.	To je bolje.
No one knows what will happen to him.	Nihče ne ve, kaj bo z njim.
I just left home.	Pravkar sem odšel od doma.
Maybe he has something there.	Mogoče ima kaj tam.
This is really hard for me.	To mi je res težko.
And nothing more.	In nič več.
I came to the party.	Prišel sem na zabavo.
She's not home.	Ni je doma.
That's what I told him.	To sem mu tudi povedal.
He did that.	To je storil.
There is nothing like that.	Tam ni nič takega.
That really helps.	To res pomaga.
He can't just leave.	Ne more kar tako oditi.
And that's what it's about.	In za to gre.
He's never met me like that before.	Še nikoli me ni srečal tako.
This is more of an opportunity.	To je bolj priložnost.
I don’t know how that happened.	Ne vem, kako se je to zgodilo.
It is scheduled to start next week.	Začel naj bi naslednji teden.
He said it used to be nice.	Rekel je, da je bilo včasih lepo.
Then it would be.	Takrat bi bilo.
A child should see this.	Otrok bi to moral videti.
I didn't lose.	Nisem izgubil.
I am that.	Jaz sem to.
I liked it that way.	Všeč mi je bilo tako.
I don't have to tell you.	Ni mi treba povedati.
I have to be there.	moram biti tam.
He felt like a kid again.	Spet se je počutil kot otrok.
Much more than that has happened.	Zgodilo se je veliko več kot to.
But he didn't stay there long.	A tam ni ostal dolgo.
There is	Obstaja
He never was.	Nikoli ni bil.
And on.	In še naprej.
And that's actually good.	In to je pravzaprav dobro.
Just like you could on your own.	Tako kot bi lahko sami.
Maybe I could help.	Mogoče bi lahko pomagal.
He came right away.	Takoj je prišel.
Have you ever seen him?	Ste ga že kdaj videli?
Actually, it's not.	Pravzaprav ni.
Something else to do.	Nekaj ​​drugega za delati.
I was without everything.	Bil sem brez vsega.
But it could be better.	Lahko pa bi bilo bolje.
He can't move on.	Ne more naprej.
That was not possible.	To ni bilo mogoče.
In fact, we would love it.	Pravzaprav bi nam bilo všeč.
Everyone has a chance.	Vsak ima možnost.
I need more.	potrebujem več.
This is not going to happen.	To se ne bo zgodilo.
Bi, these days.	Bi, te dni.
I was no longer human at all.	Sploh nisem bil več človek.
And it didn’t happen alone.	In to se ni zgodilo edini.
It seems to have failed.	Zdi se, da ni uspelo.
It can be so hard.	Lahko je tako težko.
It was hard then.	Takrat je bilo težko.
We'll see how it goes.	Bomo videli, kako bo s tem.
Time was and time was not.	Čas je bil in čas ni bil.
I don't know anything about that.	Ne vem nič o tem.
He was a really good man.	Res je bil dober človek.
But no one seems to know where he is.	A zdi se, da nihče ne ve, kje je.
If you've been here, you know.	Če si bil tukaj, veš.
Everyone should be better.	Vsi bi morali biti boljši.
Here is .	Tukaj je .
I still haven't heard of you.	Še vedno nisem slišal zate.
Now that's the problem.	Zdaj je to problem.
I'm not ready for that.	Nisem pripravljen na to.
Tell yourself that now.	Povej si to zdaj.
Okay, that's it.	V redu, to je to.
Someone who knows him.	Nekdo, ki ga pozna.
And so we will continue.	In tako bomo še naprej.
Or maybe because of that.	Ali pa morda zaradi tega.
Right.	Prav.
Something will have to be done.	Bo treba kaj narediti.
He says he's very, very happy to meet you.	Pravi, da je zelo, zelo vesel, da te je spoznal.
I don't think that's true.	Mislim, da to ni res.
You came for that.	Po to si prišel.
I think he left because he wanted to leave.	Mislim, da je odšel, ker je hotel oditi.
Not at all.	Ni pa.
We have to go to work tomorrow.	Jutri moramo v službo.
I don’t know how she managed that.	Ne vem, kako ji je to uspelo.
No, not there.	Ne, ne tam.
There's always more.	Vedno je več.
But it was hard.	Vendar je bilo težko.
That would not happen today.	Danes se to ne bi zgodilo.
I think it's him.	Mislim, da je to on.
That would be too much.	To bi bilo preveč.
He knew this was going to happen.	Vedel je, da se bo to zgodilo.
It was like coming home.	Bilo je, kot bi se vrnil domov.
I just wouldn't.	Preprosto ne bi.
I know you're probably right.	Vem, da imaš verjetno prav.
That might work.	To bi lahko uspelo.
I am sure we will succeed.	Prepričan sem, da nam bo uspelo.
We were lucky for the first time.	Prvič smo imeli srečo.
I really need to see.	Res moram videti.
But the problem remained money.	A problem je ostal denar.
I’m not sure what can be done.	Nisem prepričan, kaj je mogoče storiti.
I mean, maybe they will.	Mislim, morda bodo.
The thing is what it is and not something else.	Stvar je to, kar je in ne nekaj drugega.
I will be here, even if it is.	Tukaj bom, tudi če bo.
And he could have.	In lahko bi imel.
They would probably be better.	Verjetno bi bili boljši.
I'd rather see something else.	Raje bi videl kaj drugega.
It would be nice.	Lepo bi bilo.
She did it.	Uspelo ji je.
That's why he's there.	Za to je tam.
This is exactly what they did when the time came.	Prav to so tudi storili, ko je prišel čas.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Rekel je, da o tem ne ve ničesar.
I wasn't sure I believed you.	Nisem bil prepričan, da ti verjamem.
It has that.	To ima .
He likes to help.	Rad pomaga.
He was a child.	Bil je otrok.
We'll see what he has.	Bomo videli kaj ima.
He wouldn't die.	Ne bi umrl.
I am absolutely sure of that.	Popolnoma sem prepričan o tem.
And they didn't have much of it.	In tega niso imeli prav veliko.
This is very difficult.	To je zelo težko.
And we had no children.	In nismo imeli otrok.
He can't know anything about that.	O tem ne more vedeti ničesar.
I've always done that.	Vedno sem to delal.
I'm back home.	nazaj sem domov.
You will meet her soon.	Kmalu jo boš spoznal.
He couldn't know.	Ni mogel vedeti.
I'm very tired.	Zelo sem utrujen.
I definitely have them.	Jaz jih zagotovo imam.
It seems to me that we have a problem.	Zdi se mi, kot da imamo problem.
she will say.	bo rekla.
I worked there every day.	Vsak dan sem delal tam.
I'm afraid I could.	Bojim se, da bi lahko.
He is not a man.	On ni človek.
I can't go on like I do right now.	Ne morem naprej kot trenutno.
Does anyone know for sure.	Ali kdo zagotovo ve.
No one saw her.	Nihče je ni videl.
Never again.	Nikoli več.
I see that today.	To vidim danes.
He couldn't see.	Ni mogel videti.
I really don't understand.	res ne razumem.
He was just sitting there.	Samo sedel je tam.
He didn't die.	Ni umrl.
I don't know anything else.	drugega pa ne vem.
In that.	V tem.
It seems likely.	Zdi se verjetno.
I wouldn’t even wait to get something to eat.	Ne bi čakal niti, da bi dobil kaj za jesti.
Not so.	Ni tako.
Maybe it's nothing more than that.	Morda ni nič več od tega.
He called her.	Poklical jo je.
Something didn't seem right to me.	Nekaj ​​se mi je zdelo ne prav.
You should be home.	Moral bi biti doma.
That's really not much.	To res ni veliko.
That's enough for me.	To mi je dovolj.
And it's simple.	In to je preprosto.
There was something wrong here.	Tukaj nekaj ni bilo v redu.
Not a good man anymore.	Dober človek ne več.
Not just you and me.	Ne samo ti in jaz.
You know better than that.	Ti veš bolje kot to.
I had money.	Imel sem denar.
That time.	Tisti čas.
I didn't ask him why.	Nisem ga vprašal zakaj.
I don't care how much.	Ne zanima me koliko.
But that still may not be right.	A to še vedno ne more biti prav.
I hope you don't have to come here.	Upam, da vam ne bo treba priti sem.
They saw what they saw.	Videli so, kar so videli.
That would never happen.	To se ne bi nikoli zgodilo.
And so he had.	In tako je imel.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ni.
And neither can any of you.	In tudi nihče od vas ne more.
You did that.	To si naredil.
It will be a long time.	Dolgo bo.
He told you that and he does it.	To ti je rekel in to počne.
I think you are too.	Mislim, da si tudi ti.
All was well, all was well.	Vse je bilo dobro, vse je bilo dobro.
He knows there aren't many.	Ve, da jih ni veliko.
I had to go from there, and fast.	Moral sem iti od tam, in to hitro.
First, nothing is as simple as it seems.	Prvič, nič ni tako preprosto, kot se zdi.
That would find someone.	To nekoga bi našel.
Much more.	Še veliko več.
If you think .	Če misliš .
I knew he meant it.	Vedel sem, da je to mislil.
I went to my room.	Šla sem v svojo sobo.
It's very good for me.	Zame je zelo dobro.
They are from home.	Od doma so.
He couldn't see them.	Ni jih mogel videti.
He'll be back soon.	Kmalu se bo vrnil.
He asked me.	Vprašal me je.
I love you very much.	Zelo te imam rad.
Or he will return.	Ali pa se bo vrnil.
For what, he wasn't sure.	Za kaj, ni bil prepričan.
None of this exists.	Nič od tega ne obstaja.
I like.	všeč mi je.
Now he knew.	Zdaj je vedel.
I'm really fine.	Res sem v redu.
I don't want you back.	Nočem te nazaj.
That was quite some time ago.	To je bilo že kar nekaj časa nazaj.
In this way.	Na ta način.
All alone.	Vse sama.
There is nothing we can do.	Nič ne moremo storiti.
He thought of his children.	Mislil je na svoje otroke.
He promised he would.	Obljubil je, da bo.
We are so lucky.	Imamo tako srečo.
You never knew.	Nikoli nisi vedel.
We've never seen that before.	Tega še nikoli nismo videli.
Like everything in this place.	Kot vse na tem mestu.
He has a lot to tell her.	Veliko ji ima za povedati.
You can't be here without it.	Brez tega ne moreš biti tukaj.
We could have done much better.	Lahko bi naredili veliko bolje.
You saw how hard it was to get here.	Videli ste, kako težko je bilo priti sem.
I hope so.	Upam, da je tako.
Nothing else seemed big enough.	Nič drugega se ni zdelo dovolj veliko.
I loved the work so much.	Všeč mi je bilo tako veliko delo.
But you could know.	Vendar bi lahko vedela.
That seemed like a lot to me.	To se mi je zdelo veliko.
Nobody cares what you think.	Nikogar ne zanima, kaj si mislite.
Not because of me.	Ne zaradi mene.
I feel very well.	Počutim se zelo dobro.
He was the one who left.	On je bil tisti, ki je odšel.
I didn't do anything!	Nič nisem naredil!
I quit my job.	pustil sem službo.
He's doing it now.	To počne zdaj.
I've never seen him like that.	Nikoli ga nisem videl takega.
I was fine with that.	S tem sem bil v redu.
He doesn't have to be.	Ni mu treba biti.
we can't go.	ne moremo iti.
Not too many people know.	Ne ve preveč ljudi.
The more of us, the better.	Več nas, bolje.
Once once.	Enkrat enkrat.
I did it.	uspelo mi je.
If you like it.	Če ti je všeč.
We would be fine on our own.	Sami bi bili v redu.
That's what he decided to do.	Za to se je odločil.
There was so much to see!	Toliko je bilo videti!
He learned nothing.	Nič se ni naučil.
You have to do it again.	To moraš narediti še enkrat.
who knows what.	kdo ve kaj.
I'd like to know what it is.	Rad bi vedel, kaj je to.
It doesn't go that way.	Ne gre tako.
I didn't tell anyone.	nikomur nisem povedal.
She was just.	Bila je samo.
Or something like that.	Ali nekaj takega.
That was better.	To je bilo bolje.
But there was nothing he could do.	Vendar ni mogel storiti ničesar.
I know how it is.	vem kako je.
It was always with us.	Vedno je bilo z nami.
We could do that.	To bi lahko storili.
It was again.	Spet je bilo.
That's not a problem.	To ni problem.
Or something why.	Ali pa nekaj zakaj.
I won't anymore.	Ne bom več.
I do not want to.	nočem.
That's him.	To je on.
My father couldn't believe it.	Moj oče ni mogel verjeti.
Anything was possible.	Vse je bilo mogoče.
I thought he was back.	Mislil sem, da se je vrnil.
He couldn't even speak.	Niti ni mogel govoriti.
More about it here.	Več o tem tukaj.
It was hard.	Bilo je težko.
He will buy a car this week.	Ta teden bo kupil avto.
But they can be.	Lahko pa so.
He didn't say much.	Ni veliko rekel.
But that hasn't happened yet.	Vendar se to še ni zgodilo.
I thought he had.	Mislil sem, da ima.
It now seems highly unlikely that this will happen.	Zdaj se zdi zelo malo verjetno, da bi se to zgodilo.
I need help.	Potrebujem pomoč.
I wanted to talk more.	Želel sem govoriti več.
Or even if I had it.	Ali tudi če bi ga imel.
If you want to be.	Če želiš biti.
We don't know for sure.	Ne vemo zagotovo.
He's a boy!	Fant je!
Not a little if.	Ni malo če.
So what? 	Pa kaj?
he says.	on pravi.
Because we haven't done anything yet.	Ker še nismo nič naredili.
I know where he is all the time.	Vem, kje je ves čas.
He didn't want to see anyone.	Nikogar ni hotel videti.
A little tired.	Malo utrujen.
And he knew they would.	In vedel je, da bodo.
He's doing so well.	Tako dobro mu gre.
I never was, really not.	Nikoli nisem bil, res ne.
There is so much of it.	Toliko ga je.
We just won't.	Samo ne bomo.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar.
There never was anyone else.	Nikoli ni bilo nikogar drugega.
I hope she succeeds.	Upam, da ji bo uspelo.
I wish it was possible.	Želim si, da bi bilo mogoče.
I came back for help.	Vrnil sem se po pomoč.
He has a lot of work to do.	Ima veliko dela.
He is a really good man.	On je res dober človek.
He wasn't good.	Ni bil dober.
And it feels good.	In se počuti dobro.
That's all and that's all.	Vse je to in je vse.
I didn't want to do that.	Nisem hotel tega narediti.
She was the only one who wasn't.	Bila je edina, ki ni.
It's still early.	Še vedno je zgodaj.
But it was good.	Vendar je bilo dobro.
They are not.	Niso.
I'd rather go with you.	raje grem s tabo.
And he is.	In on je.
I would never come back.	Nikoli se ne bi vrnil.
I did what he said.	Naredil sem, kar je rekel.
This is very difficult to play.	To je zelo težko igrati.
I have a lot of work to do.	Veliko dela imam.
It's so nice to see you again.	Tako lepo te je spet videti.
There really is nothing else for that.	Za to res ni nič drugega.
We did it once.	Enkrat smo to naredili.
And here he is with us.	In tukaj je z nami.
He didn't call at all.	Sploh ni poklical.
Maybe you didn't know that.	Morda tega niste vedeli.
He did it himself.	To je naredil sam.
Just something happened.	Samo nekaj se je zgodilo.
I won't even talk to you tomorrow.	Jutri niti ne bom govoril s tabo.
So the father decided to go.	Zato se je oče odločil, da gre.
I've never been to this before.	Še nikoli nisem bil na tem.
It was really nice.	Bilo je res lepo.
Maybe again.	Mogoče spet.
We are not what we used to be.	Nismo to, kar smo bili.
Not now, never, she said.	Ne zdaj, nikoli, je rekla.
Everyone.	Vsi.
We didn't manage to do that.	Tega nam ni uspelo.
And he will go.	In šel bo.
I didn't say we would.	Nisem rekel, da bomo.
It won't be pretty.	Ne bo lepo.
I won't be in town.	Ne bom v mestu.
It was just a question of who would lose	Bilo je samo vprašanje, kdo bo izgubil
The baby was good.	Otrok je bil dober.
There was nothing here.	Tukaj ni bilo nič.
Are you with us?	Ste z nami?.
Or we should.	Ali pa bi morali.
I do that a lot.	To počnem veliko.
I would, for sure.	Bi, zagotovo.
And maybe this is just an opportunity.	In morda je to le priložnost.
You had a lot of help.	Imeli ste veliko pomoč.
I've been waiting for this.	Čakal sem na to.
You just don't know.	Samo ne veš.
I'm not afraid of him.	Ne bojim se ga.
That's how he got the money.	Tako je dobil denar.
Back after that.	Nazaj po tem.
And if my father was on his own, I still wouldn’t be.	In če je bil moj oče po svoje, ga še vedno ne bi.
I hope you all like it.	Upam, da vam je vsem všeč.
That's what you said.	To si rekel.
You told me.	Rekel si mi.
That was work.	To je bilo delo.
More than likely I wouldn’t.	Več kot verjetno ne bi.
He didn't think it was too much.	Ni se mu zdelo preveč.
I have so much.	imam toliko.
It was all mine.	Bilo je moje vse.
Sometimes this is the case.	Včasih je temu tako.
It seemed to him that he should not do that.	Zdelo se mu je, da tega ne bi smel početi.
He won the day.	Zmagal je dan.
I can't even be a friend.	Ne morem biti niti prijatelj.
Maybe not.	Mogoče ni.
That wasn't good enough.	To ni bilo dovolj dobro.
What he is and what he does.	Kaj je in kaj počne.
I don’t understand how that could be.	Ne razumem, kako bi to lahko bilo.
My question now is.	Moje vprašanje je zdaj.
Or you can.	Ali pa lahko.
He’s glad he has something to do.	Vesel je, da ima kaj početi.
Maybe it was.	Morda je bilo.
Do only what is right.	Naredi samo tisto, kar je prav.
I lost my children, my life.	Izgubil sem svoje otroke, svoje življenje.
Nice of you to come.	Lepo od tebe, da si prišel.
I thought it was pretty good.	Zdelo se mi je kar dobro.
And we don't know what to do with it.	In ne vemo, kaj bi s tem.
Everything that comes sooner is here.	Vse, kar pride prej, je tukaj.
Really, really, really angry.	Res, res, res jezen.
You never know who will do what.	Nikoli ne veš, kdo bo kaj naredil.
Right and wrong.	Prav in narobe.
Apparently he didn't know where he was.	Očitno ni vedel, kje je.
First, she’s really good at what she does.	Prvič, res je dobra v tem, kar počne.
You should help.	Moral bi pomagati.
Nice to see you.	Lepo te je videti.
They are not there.	Niso tam.
And there was a reason for that.	In za to je bil razlog.
I told him to come.	Rekel sem mu, naj pride.
And she knew it.	In to je vedela.
Nobody does that.	Nihče tega ne počne.
And now you think you're nothing without him.	In zdaj misliš, da si nič brez njega.
It was there.	Tam je bilo.
I don't know why this is so.	Ne vem zakaj je temu tako.
Maybe just a few.	Mogoče le nekaj.
This is really not a problem.	To res ni problem.
Maybe that's right.	Mogoče je prav tako.
That's where the car goes.	Tam gre avto.
He didn't eat.	Ni jedel.
What is it?	Kaj je to?
I don't believe that yet.	Tega še ne verjamem.
Maybe you can.	Mogoče lahko.
Fortunately, we will succeed.	S srečo nam bo uspelo.
I don't mean well.	Ne mislim dobro.
We love it here.	Všeč nam je tukaj.
I said something, he said something.	Nekaj ​​sem rekel, on je nekaj rekel.
I'm doing pretty well on my own.	Sama mi gre kar dobro.
I hope this happens.	Upam, da se bo to zgodilo.
Who knows.	Kdo ve.
I will definitely be back.	Zagotovo se bom vrnil.
I had to move on.	Moral sem iti naprej.
I like everything, I like it.	Vse mi je všeč, všeč mi je.
As if we weren't there at all.	Kot da nas sploh ni bilo.
I'm not interested.	Me ne zanima.
I did that.	To sem naredil.
Also for work.	Tudi za delo.
And that's not good.	In to ni dobro.
It just was.	Samo je bilo.
nor do I want to.	niti nočem.
Just keep going as usual.	Samo naprej kot običajno.
Actually no.	Pravzaprav ne.
I will not forget that.	tega ne bom pozabil.
Maybe something will really happen tonight.	Mogoče se bo nocoj res kaj zgodilo.
She knows she should tell him everything.	Ve, da bi mu morala vse povedati.
They just are.	Samo so.
But I was lucky.	Vendar sem imel srečo.
Nobody.	Nihče ne.
It wasn’t hard to do.	Ni bilo težko narediti.
This is what a man does.	To je tisto, kar človek počne.
Nobody knows how much.	Nihče ne ve, koliko.
That would never happen today.	To se danes ne bi nikoli zgodilo.
You obviously didn’t know what he was doing there.	Očitno niste vedeli, kaj počne tam.
I've seen so much.	Toliko sem videl.
Not from anyone.	Ne od nikogar.
I no longer know if this is true or not.	Ne vem več ali je to res ali ne.
And he was more than right.	In imel je več kot prav.
I am very good at this.	V tem sem zelo dober.
It's supposed to be here.	Tukaj naj bi bilo.
I had a lot of work to do.	Imel sem veliko dela.
That's the way it has to be.	Tako mora biti.
I know those things.	Te stvari poznam.
I knew everything was going to be okay.	Vedel sem, da bo vse v redu.
They seemed completely uninterested in the work.	Videti je bilo, da jih delo popolnoma ne zanima.
Or something like that.	Ali nekaj takega .
She didn't know what she was doing.	Ni vedela, kaj počne.
You could go too.	Saj bi lahko tudi šel.
This has happened before.	To se je zgodilo že prej.
I know who won.	Vem, kdo je zmagal.
With that.	S tem.
I just don't understand.	Samo ne razumem.
So it was with me.	Tako je bilo z mano.
Let him think.	Naj misli.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
i should be the one.	jaz bi moral biti tisti.
He has never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni storil.
It was very difficult.	Bilo je zelo težko.
That's what I should do.	To bi moral tudi jaz.
I just didn't.	Preprosto nisem.
Something more here.	Nekaj ​​več tukaj.
I certainly can.	Zagotovo lahko.
However, he did not do so.	Vendar tega ni storil.
I don't know what's wrong with that.	Ne vem, kaj je s tem narobe.
I believe with you.	verjamem s tabo.
It didn't seem like much.	Zdelo se je ne veliko.
You should know better.	Morala bi vedeti bolje.
He's not here now.	Zdaj ga ni.
I can't do more.	Ne morem narediti več.
Little by little.	Malo po malo.
This is much better.	To je veliko bolje.
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
And no money.	In brez denarja.
It still is.	Še vedno je.
This is completely wrong.	To je popolnoma narobe.
Sometimes you have to work fast.	Včasih moraš delati hitro.
He should be ready for work immediately.	Takoj bi moral biti pripravljen za delo.
I think he's here.	Mislim, da je tukaj.
As a kid.	Kot otrok.
Life for life.	Življenje za življenje.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
But that is what happened.	To se je pa zgodilo.
I have it sometimes too.	Tudi jaz ga imam včasih.
I think it will someday.	Mislim, da bo nekoč.
No matter what you think.	Ne glede na to, kaj mislite.
I know it is for me.	Vem, da je zame.
I thought.	Mislil sem.
I was more than a little surprised.	Bil sem več kot malo presenečen.
will say.	bo rekel.
He said he has a good reason for it.	Rekel je, da ima dober razlog za to.
I'll get back to you about that.	O tem se vam bom vrnil.
That would not be possible for.	To ne bi bilo mogoče za.
Just don "t.	Samo ne.
That's what I expected.	To sem pričakoval.
Here we are.	Tukaj smo.
He didn't know what to do to help.	Ni vedel, kaj storiti, da bi pomagal.
I never knew who it was.	Nikoli nisem vedel, kdo je to.
He was very good at it.	Bil je zelo dober v tem.
I love how hard it is.	Všeč mi je, kako težko je.
Maybe I was there with him.	Morda sem bil tam z njim.
In fact, she wished he would go away.	Pravzaprav si je želela, da bi odšel.
No one knows how to do it.	Nihče ne ve, kako to storiti.
Maybe we should.	Mogoče bi morali.
No, no problem.	Ne, ni problem.
You can never tell what will happen.	Nikoli ne moreš povedati, kaj se bo zgodilo.
He was not at all surprised.	Sploh ni bil videti presenečen.
It was like nothing they hadn’t seen before.	Bilo je kot nič, kar še niso videli.
Maybe they are like me.	Morda so kot jaz.
And here we are again.	In spet smo tukaj.
In fact, it was pretty simple.	Pravzaprav je bilo precej preprosto.
This is all wrong.	Vse to je narobe.
You need to know that.	To moraš vedeti.
I could work with that.	Lahko bi delal s tem.
I heard it once.	Enkrat sem jo slišal.
He decided not to do that.	Odločil se je, da tega ne bo storil.
No one would ever do that.	Tega nihče ne bi nikoli naredil.
Good, he said.	Dobro, je rekel.
It was just him.	Bil je samo on.
That was just a few years ago.	To je bilo le nekaj let nazaj.
A lot of that.	Veliko tega.
But he is not even sure about that.	A niti o tem ni prepričan.
I'm there now.	zdaj sem tam.
How nice!	Kako lepo!
And you left.	In odšel si.
I understand why you have to do this.	Razumem, zakaj moraš to storiti.
But here I am.	Vendar sem tukaj.
She did it.	Uspelo ji je.
And that is life, too.	In to je tudi življenje.
Or not and they are not.	Ali pa ne in niso.
I could give him time.	Lahko bi mu dal čas.
There was probably nothing wrong with him.	Verjetno ni bilo nič z njim.
I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s a possibility.	Mislim, da ni verjetno, vendar je možnost.
Where is that? 	Kje je to?
I wouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi storila.
And he returned quickly.	In hitro se je vrnil.
I knew it was only a matter of time.	Vedel sem, da je samo vprašanje časa.
Those.	Tisti.
He did not return.	Ni se vrnil.
Now I'm ready to go.	Zdaj sem pripravljen iti.
A few things.	Nekaj ​​stvari.
Is it true or not.	Je res ali ne.
I wanted to know what it was for.	Želel sem vedeti, za kaj je to.
I am very sorry.	Zelo mi je žal.
I doubt it would.	Dvomim, da bi.
That day may come.	Ta dan lahko pride.
Not for us.	Ni za nas.
That is, if it succeeds tonight.	Se pravi, če bo nocoj uspelo.
I saw that.	To sem videl.
I hope you will like it.	Upam, da ti bo všeč.
He didn't think it would be a problem.	Ni si mislil, da bo to problem.
Just like you think you are.	Tako kot misliš, da si.
It’s okay if you want what you want.	V redu je, če želite, kar želite.
No one was ever convinced.	Nihče ni bil nikoli prepričan.
He went to the hotel.	Odšel je v hotel.
To hear him.	Da bi ga slišal.
Or probably couldn't.	Ali verjetno ne bi mogel.
I would know soon enough.	Kmalu bi vedela.
Or maybe with.	Ali morda z.
I could have told him yesterday or this morning.	Lahko bi mu povedal včeraj ali zjutraj.
You think if anyone knows, it must be him.	Misliš, da če kdo ve, mora biti to on.
I think that's it.	Mislim, da je to to.
I see it happening every day little by little.	Vidim, da se to dogaja vsak dan malo po malo.
When I started.	Ko sem začel.
He seems to have.	Zdi se, da ima.
That would be better.	To bi bilo bolje.
I would speak.	Jaz bi govoril.
No one was happy about that.	Nihče ni bil vesel tega.
Never, never, never.	Nikoli, nikoli, nikoli.
She said she was going home.	Rekla je, da gre domov.
This is a well.	To je dobro.
I hope this is true.	Upam, da je to res.
It feels hard.	Počuti se težko.
He came here yesterday	Včeraj je prišel sem
He doesn't know who he is.	Ne ve, kdo je.
Not life either.	Tudi življenje ne.
I won't stay long.	ne bom ostal dolgo.
She knew, and she knew he knew it.	Vedela je in vedela je, da on to ve.
No one could see me there.	Tam me nihče ni mogel videti.
I will stay here.	ostal bom tukaj.
It was nice to see him.	Lepo ga je bilo videti.
Just like we did.	Tako kot smo storili mi.
I love you very much.	Zelo te imam rad.
And now is the time.	In zdaj je čas.
In fact, they are not.	Pravzaprav niso.
I'm glad to be here.	Vesel sem, da sem tukaj.
Which would be nice.	Kar bi bilo lepo.
This is more of a problem for me.	To je zame bolj problem.
This is an option.	To je možnost.
That's not right.	To ni prav.
This is a problem, but a good one.	To je problem, vendar dober.
They didn't see him.	Niso ga videli.
In fact, she was.	Pravzaprav je bila.
We don't know for sure either.	Tudi mi ne vemo zagotovo.
Not that long ago, not even.	Ne toliko nazaj, niti ne.
Don't tell anyone.	Nikomur ne povej.
I really don't feel well.	Res se ne počutim dobro.
Obviously there is a lot of work here.	Očitno je tukaj veliko dela.
I just don't know how to do it.	Samo ne vem, kako to narediti.
Being here now.	Biti tukaj zdaj.
This is going to happen.	To se bo zgodilo.
I don't understand why it would.	Ne razumem, zakaj bi.
This is not difficult to say.	To ni težko govoriti.
Or tried to be.	Ali poskušal biti.
There was a lot to see.	Veliko je bilo videti.
Normally we wouldn't do anything here.	Običajno tukaj ne bi naredili ničesar.
That's right now.	Zdaj je tako.
He hadn't even seen him before.	Prej ga niti ni videl.
Nobody comes.	Nihče ne pride.
I love being here.	Rad sem tukaj.
This will never happen.	To se ne bo nikoli zgodilo.
It was that day now.	Zdaj je bil tisti dan.
He hadn't expected this yet.	Tega še ni pričakoval.
I'm sure they are.	Prepričan sem, da so.
Do any of you know.	Ali kdo od vas ve.
I need help.	Potrebujem pomoč.
From another.	Od drugega.
I'll start tomorrow.	Začel bom jutri.
However, he did not give up.	Vendar se ni dal.
I found a lot of things.	Našel sem veliko stvari.
I really didn't.	res nisem.
You didn't do anything wrong.	Nič nisi naredil narobe.
He's gone.	Odšel je.
We know that too.	To vemo tudi mi.
It would be helpful.	V pomoč bi bilo.
But it could be a car problem.	Lahko pa je avto problem.
It seems fine to me.	Meni se zdi v redu.
It doesn't feel like work.	Ne počutim se kot delo.
But there was only him and me in the room.	A v sobi sva bila samo on in jaz.
I haven't seen him since this afternoon.	Nisem ga videl od danes popoldne.
Actually, nothing.	Pravzaprav nič.
We made it.	Naredili smo ga.
I don't need that.	Ne potrebujem tega.
He's there.	On je tam.
ki.	ki.
I will not lose everything.	Ne bom izgubil vsega.
They always look so good.	Vedno so videti tako dobro.
It happened to everyone.	Vsem se je zgodilo.
We know so much for sure.	Toliko zagotovo vemo.
I do not know where it is.	Ne vem kje je.
He liked the game.	Igra mu je bila všeč.
He was sure that no one thought so.	Prepričan je bil, da nihče ne misli tako.
The money was found pretty quickly.	Denar se je našel precej hitro.
We now know that it was much, much more than that.	Zdaj vemo, da je bilo veliko, veliko več kot to.
You would see it happening.	Videli bi, da se dogaja.
You are not my child.	Ti nisi moj otrok.
I hope you know that.	Upam, da to veš.
Nobody knows where you are.	Nihče ne ve, kje si.
Because I could.	Ker bi lahko.
i have good	imam dobro.
I don't care what you think.	Ne zanima me, kaj misliš.
Whatever it will be.	Kar bo pa bo.
You'll love them.	Všeč vam bodo.
what is me	kaj je jaz
They were almost there.	Skoraj so bili tam.
Where have you been for so long?	Kje si bil tako dolgo?
That’s a lot that happened back then.	To se je takrat veliko zgodilo.
That's not much.	To ni prav veliko.
It's just good.	Samo dobro je.
This is not a good job.	To ni dobro delo.
That's all I told myself.	Samo to sem si rekel.
Please, man.	Prosim, človek.
You want something from me.	Želiš nekaj od mene.
We have to play nice.	Moramo igrati lepo.
We were not the only ones.	Nismo bili edini.
it's true to me.	res mi je.
It was just as good.	Bilo je prav tako dobro.
I couldn't see.	Nisem mogel videti.
She's never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni storila.
It's been a while.	Za nekaj časa je.
Just the usual.	Samo običajno.
I'm so happy.	tako sem vesel.
I went out and there.	Šla sem ven in tja.
They had to go home.	Morali so domov.
But it is difficult, very difficult.	Je pa težko, zelo težko.
You started all this.	Ti si začel vse to.
For your people.	Za svoje ljudi.
Never heard of it, never seen it.	Nikoli slišal za to, nikoli videl.
I would do anything.	Vse bi naredil.
It really is something.	Res je nekaj.
I don't know what it could be.	Ne vem, kaj bi lahko bilo.
No one can tell me what's wrong with me.	Nihče mi ne more povedati, kaj je narobe z mano.
That's not it.	To ni to.
I wouldn't decide.	Ne bi se odločil.
That's so right.	Toliko je prav.
We can't stay here.	Ne moremo ostati tukaj.
Let it be what you want.	Naj bo tisto, kar želite.
He had to be.	Moral je biti.
I worked fast.	Delal sem hitro.
You have to go.	Moraš oditi.
We like you.	Všeč si nam.
He didn't hear him again.	Ni ga več slišal.
No one felt right.	Nihče se ni počutil prav.
We are still here.	Še vedno smo tukaj.
I tried to talk about it.	Poskušal sem govoriti o tem.
I think that's enough.	Mislim, da je dovolj.
It was simple.	Preprosto je bilo.
I don't see that happening yet.	Ne vidim, da bi se to še zgodilo.
It will happen soon.	Hitro se bo zgodilo.
We have so much time.	Imamo toliko časa.
That it will not work.	Da ne bo uspelo.
Maybe it will be enough.	Mogoče bo dovolj.
I could stay there forever.	Tam bi lahko ostal za vedno.
Or they should be.	Ali pa naj bi bili.
I understand why this would happen.	Razumem, zakaj bi se to zgodilo.
I thought you knew you were better than that.	Mislil sem, da veš, da si boljši od tega.
Enough.	Dovolj je.
You will not allow it.	Ne boš dovolil.
You would never make it.	Nikoli ti ne bi uspelo.
Or he had something.	Ali pa je nekaj imel.
And the boy is mine.	In fant je moj.
Are you okay?' 	Ali si v redu?'
she said.	je rekla.
But you don’t have to play.	Vendar vam ni treba igrati.
I can see him.	Lahko ga vidim.
I would too.	tudi jaz bi bil.
It's here now.	Zdaj je tukaj.
He doesn't want to talk.	Noče govoriti.
No, that's something.	Ne, to je nekaj.
You didn't do anything.	Nič nisi naredil.
I want you to know that you are not alone.	Želim, da veš, da nisi sam.
I couldn't help myself.	Nisem si mogel pomagati.
I had to leave.	Moral sem oditi.
And that's why we were there.	In zato smo bili tam.
He saw what it was.	Videl je, kaj je bilo.
See people.	Videti ljudi.
That's your problem.	To je tvoj problem.
This, however, failed.	To pa ni uspelo.
There must be some.	Nekaj ​​jih mora biti.
But I understand why.	Razumem pa zakaj.
You have to stay with us here.	Tukaj moraš ostati z nami.
Or he was supposed to be.	Ali pa naj bi bil.
We can't know what's going to happen.	Ne moremo vedeti, kaj se bo zgodilo.
You know that's true.	Veš, da je to res.
He didn't have any money either.	Tudi denarja ni imel.
Like it's not that hard.	Kot da ni tako težko.
No one was there to meet him.	Nihče ni bil tam, da bi ga srečal.
That was fine too.	Tudi to je bilo v redu.
Maybe it's that simple.	Mogoče je tako preprosto.
We don't know who they are.	Ne vemo, kdo so.
He got a job he is not interested in.	Dobil je delo, ki ga ne zanima.
He didn’t see the things he wanted to see.	Ni videl stvari, ki jih je želel videti.
We should all know that by now.	To bi morali že vsi vedeti.
He knew it wasn't right, but he couldn't help himself.	Vedel je, da to ni prav, a si ni mogel pomagati.
And so on.	In tako naprej.
It was for me.	Zame je bilo.
You don't even know who.	Niti za veste koga.
Nothing could be done without him.	Brez njega ni bilo mogoče storiti ničesar.
I want to be something.	Želim biti nekaj.
It was just.	Bilo je samo.
We saw him last week.	Videli smo ga prejšnji teden.
That was too much.	To je bilo preveč.
I had a hard time with that.	Težko sem imel s tem.
Live for today.	Živi za danes.
He needed a life.	Potreboval je življenje.
I thought it was.	Mislil sem, da je.
You will not regret.	Ne bo ti žal.
There is nothing to do.	Nič ni za narediti.
Can anyone help please ???.	Ali lahko kdo pomaga prosim???.
But it seemed to be true.	A zdelo se je, da je res.
She didn’t know if that was still true or not.	Ni vedela, ali je to še res ali ne.
You're doing pretty well with that.	Kar dobro ti gre s tem.
Just not now.	Samo ne zdaj.
I don’t believe any of that.	Ne verjamem nič od tega.
You were.	Bili ste.
Do you know where that was?	Ali veš kje je bilo to?
I know life is so hard for you.	Vem, življenje je tako težko zate.
Unfortunately, this is no longer possible.	Žal to ni več mogoče.
That also happened.	Tudi to se je zgodilo.
This is a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
There's a lot of them.	Veliko jih je.
It goes to everyone.	Gre k vsem.
No, that's not it.	Ne, to ni to.
But they are few.	Vendar jih je malo.
That was serious.	To je bilo resno.
I don't want you here.	Nočem te tukaj.
I'm still doing a little today.	Še danes malo počnem.
I just have to be better.	Samo bolje moram biti.
I wasn't there.	Nisem bil tam.
We haven't seen him since.	Od takrat ga nismo videli.
He had a nice time, for sure.	Lepo se je imel, zagotovo.
I know he was.	Vem, da je bil.
Which they probably did.	Kar so verjetno tudi storili.
It won't be nice.	Ne bo lepo.
I mean, it's so beautiful.	Mislim, tako lepo je.
I always am.	Vedno sem.
I'm not like you.	nisem kot ti.
It seemed like just being there was enough.	Zdelo se je, da je dovolj samo biti tam.
And sometimes that's true.	In včasih je to res.
It's not enough.	Ni skoraj dovolj.
I knew immediately.	Takoj sem vedel.
He couldn't help but see them.	Ni jih mogel ne videti.
And it usually is.	In običajno je.
He can't see me.	Ne more me videti.
I was lucky to play once a week.	Imel sem srečo, da sem igral enkrat na teden.
I wouldn't.	jaz ne bi.
I have to go, you said.	Moram iti, si rekel.
Just like you are.	Tako kot si ti.
This is my job.	To je moje delo.
I do not understand.	Ne razumem.
We didn't see anything.	Nič nismo videli.
He got what he came here for.	Dobil je tisto, po kar je prišel sem.
I needed another.	Potreboval sem drugega.
I never would.	nikoli ne bi.
Or it can be.	Ali pa je lahko.
We don’t really know why it’s going.	Pravzaprav ne vemo, zakaj gre.
Tell me what you did today.	Povej mi, kaj si počel danes.
I learned so much from him.	Toliko sem se naučil od njega.
And how he knew.	In kako je vedel.
But a lot of things are hard to do well.	Je pa veliko stvari težko narediti dobro.
From home.	Od doma.
He wanted her.	Želel jo je.
Back to me.	Nazaj k meni.
I wouldn't need him here.	Tukaj ga ne bi potreboval.
that was the question.	to je bilo vprašanje.
I saw that he liked it.	Videl sem, da mu je všeč.
But there was no time.	A časa ni bilo.
Who is this person?	Kdo je ta oseba?
And now enough of that.	In zdaj dovolj tega.
You’ll probably never know this, but we do.	Verjetno tega ne boste nikoli vedeli, mi pa vemo.
What happened.	Kaj je bilo.
I didn't know that myself.	Sam tega nisem vedel.
Like you were.	Kot si bil.
I didn't want to see.	Nisem hotel videti.
I would like to be here today.	Danes bi bil rad tukaj.
You will never have to do that.	Tega ti nikoli ne bo treba storiti.
So are we.	Pa smo.
We never saw him.	Nikoli ga nismo videli.
I like you very much.	Zelo si mi všeč.
But we are right.	Vendar imamo prav.
It will be so hard.	To bo tako težko.
I didn't see you there.	Nisem te videl tam.
That's not good enough.	To ni dovolj dobro.
And a friend to all.	In prijatelj vsem.
No, it can't be.	Ne, ne more biti.
You asked me.	Vprašal si me.
I bought it on the spot.	Kupil sem ga na mestu.
Maybe she would.	Mogoče bi to storila.
Now with you.	Zdaj pa s tabo.
Time, as he well knew, is short.	Časa je, kot je dobro vedel, malo.
I saw them.	Videl sem jih.
Again, nothing happened.	Spet se ni zgodilo nič.
So it will be.	Tako bo.
There was nowhere to go.	Ni bilo kam iti.
I'm human.	Sem človek.
So much for that.	Toliko o tem.
As a father as a child.	Kot oče kot otrok.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ni hotel govoriti z mano.
It was pretty simple.	Bilo je precej preprosto.
And we didn’t have that time.	In tega časa nismo imeli.
The man was something else.	Človek je bil nekaj drugega.
He knew where this man lived.	Vedel je, kje ta človek živi.
I wouldn't be there.	Ne bi bil tam.
Good day for that.	Dober dan je za to.
This needs to be done here as well.	To je treba storiti tudi tukaj.
To this day, they are not.	Do danes še niso.
Because you think you said something wrong.	Ker misliš, da si rekel nekaj narobe.
Maybe he'll tell you.	Morda ti bo povedal.
Is everything okay? 	Je vse v redu?
We have a lot of work to do in the morning.	Zjutraj imamo veliko dela.
he asked.	je vprašal.
It's for work.	Je za delo.
They were here.	Bili so tukaj.
And he knows everything.	In ve vse.
Why, he didn't know.	Zakaj, ni vedel.
What! 	Kaj!
I didn't ask him.	Nisem ga vprašal.
It felt good to him.	Zdelo se mu je dobro.
It was a really good thing for me.	Bila je res dobra stvar zame.
I like it that way.	Všeč mi je tako.
He was right the first time.	Prvič je imel prav.
I was really lucky.	Res sem imel srečo.
Just like he had.	Tako kot je imel.
It wasn't right.	Ni bilo prav.
He's been there for quite some time.	Tam je že kar nekaj časa.
That's what my friend used to say.	To je moj prijatelj rad rekel.
If it is, do it.	Če je to, naredi to.
I gave him money.	Dal sem mu denar.
I know it seems hard to believe, but it is.	Vem, da se zdi težko verjeti, a je.
The day started off very well	Dan se je začel zelo
I've never heard of it.	Nikoli nisem slišal za to.
I just said, boy.	Pravkar sem rekel, fant.
They didn’t seem to be there before.	Zdelo se je, da prej niso bili tam.
That's what.	Je to kaj.
She had to go once.	Nekoč je morala iti.
Or I would love to do.	Ali pa bi rad naredil.
I need to know.	Moram vedeti.
Nothing else could be done.	Ničesar drugega ni bilo mogoče narediti.
He was sitting.	Sedel je.
Never.	Nikoli ne.
I saw her.	Videl sem jo.
When to eat.	Kdaj jesti.
The child said it well.	Otrok je dobro povedal.
He lost.	Izgubil je.
They still had something to do.	Nekaj ​​so še morali narediti.
No one knows why or how.	Nihče ne ve zakaj in kako.
I'm lucky.	Imam srečo.
I think you are.	Mislim, da si.
I've never seen you.	Nikoli te nisem videl.
He was pretty good for us.	Bil je precej dober za nas.
Lots and lots of thoughts.	Veliko in veliko misli.
I don’t understand why I would decide.	Ne razumem, zakaj bi se odločil.
He couldn't even speak.	Niti ni mogel govoriti.
You know, just the way you like it.	Veš, tako kot ti je všeč.
You wanted it and you will get it.	To si želel in to boš dobil.
I'm not going to talk to you about this.	Ne bom govoril s tabo o tem.
It won't be long.	Ne bo več dolgo.
you really are.	res si.
That’s what will come out of it.	To je tisto, kar bo iz tega.
It wasn’t just my job.	Ni bilo samo moje delo.
He knew that if anyone knew.	To je vedel, če je kdo vedel.
They never did anything.	Nikoli niso naredili ničesar.
Are you ready ?.	Si pripravljen?.
Good thing here.	Dobra stvar tukaj.
I heard you went out this morning.	Slišal sem, da si šel zjutraj ven.
Why is a good question.	Zakaj je dobro vprašanje.
I came, he said.	Prišel sem, je rekel.
I found a lot the other day.	Prejšnji dan sem našel veliko.
None of this was for us.	Nič od tega ni bilo za nas.
And I wonder why.	In sprašujem se, zakaj.
I know you have.	Vem, da imaš.
Just a thing.	Samo stvar.
He just thought he had.	Samo mislil je, da ima.
He was waiting for her.	Čakal jo je.
Tell me what you want.	Povej mi kaj želiš.
But even that is sometimes difficult.	A tudi to je včasih težko.
I thought it was my time.	Mislil sem, da je moj čas.
We'll be there.	Tam bomo.
Either it's right or it's wrong.	Ali je prav ali pa je narobe.
What is wrong? 	Kaj je narobe?
he asked.	je vprašal.
I think we'll see.	Mislim, da bomo videli.
I think they are a good thing.	Mislim, da so dobra stvar.
Must be.	Mora biti.
I have a question about things.	Imam vprašanje glede stvari.
I told him to come tomorrow.	Rekel sem mu, naj pride jutri.
He will return.	Vrnil se bo.
What he said is simply not true.	Kar je rekel, preprosto ni res.
There was nothing wrong.	Nič ni bilo narobe.
I was trying to do things.	Poskušal sem narediti stvari.
He knows himself well there.	Tam se dobro pozna.
But we didn't know that at the time.	A tega takrat še nismo vedeli.
First, it wasn’t true.	Prvič, ni bilo res.
He definitely has money.	Zagotovo ima denar.
I wouldn't go home.	ne bi šel domov.
I knew it would never be enough.	Vedela sem, da to nikoli ne bo dovolj.
I knew what was going to happen.	Vedel sem, kaj bo.
I let it go.	Pustil sem to.
Like it's mine.	Kot da je moj.
It was done by a man.	To je storil človek.
I think he's right.	Mislim, da ima prav.
I would stay that way.	Tako bi tudi ostal.
There is little else to say.	Malo je drugega za povedati.
It's always there for me.	Vedno je tam zame.
Not much actually.	Pravzaprav ne veliko.
And maybe it was that good.	In morda je bilo tako dobro.
She also knew what interested her.	Vedela je tudi, kaj jo zanima.
I don’t think we can do anything more than that.	Mislim, da ne moremo storiti ničesar več kot to.
Whether this is true cannot be known.	Ali je to res, ni mogoče vedeti.
Time never seems to be enough.	Časa se zdi, da nikoli ni dovolj.
I always am and always will be.	Vedno sem in vedno bom.
The man was working.	Človek je delal.
She is here and she is interested in work.	Tukaj je in jo zanima delo.
I know you can't talk about it.	Vem, da ne moreš govoriti o tem.
I'm just not there yet.	Samo še nisem tam.
Everything he said was true.	Vse, kar je rekel, je bilo res.
I have to go.	Moram iti.
That's how he died.	Tako je umrl.
Just that it won't happen.	Samo da se ne bo zgodilo.
Making something out of nothing.	Narediti nekaj iz nič.
You did the right thing.	Prav ste naredili.
He doesn't feel well.	Ne zdi se mu dobro.
Now I know what he means.	Zdaj vem, kaj misli.
I like them very much.	Zelo so mi všeč.
I am very sorry.	Zelo mi je žal.
And you failed.	In ti ni uspelo.
They are, probably often.	So, verjetno pogosto.
I really want to meet him.	Res bi ga rad spoznal.
If not, then no.	Če ne, pa ne.
I don't even want to do this.	Sploh nočem narediti tega.
You don't have to be angry.	Ni ti treba biti jezen.
I think you did a good job.	Mislim, da si opravil dobro delo.
Now we know we can.	Zdaj vemo, da lahko.
But we need to know.	Vendar moramo vedeti.
I have no work.	Nimam dela.
We are there at the moment.	Tam smo trenutno.
I think now you have what you wanted.	Mislim, da zdaj imaš, kar si želel.
This makes it unlikely.	Zaradi tega je malo verjetno.
He was ready for anything.	Bil je pripravljen na vse.
I didn't say anything.	Nič nisem rekel.
No one was there.	Nihče ni bil tam.
Just your money and that's it.	Samo svoj denar in to je to.
I could never do that now.	Tega zdaj nikoli ne bi mogel storiti.
He always came back.	Vedno se je vrnil.
Certainly not.	Zelo zagotovo ne.
Just something happened.	Samo nekaj se je zgodilo.
No one will help you with this.	Pri tem vam nihče ne bo pomagal.
It is what you will be, what will happen to you.	To je tisto, kar boš, kar se ti bo zgodilo.
It's a good game.	To je dobra igra.
And it's the week before that.	In teden pred tem je.
He's in his room.	V svoji sobi je.
Would you come with me?	Bi šel z mano?
I know where they are.	Vem, kje so.
You can have it.	Lahko ga imaš.
I still had a lot of money back then.	Takrat sem imel še veliko denarja.
It seemed to be.	Zdelo se je, da je.
Don't talk to me.	Ne govori z mano.
She said it would be okay.	Rekla je, da bi bilo v redu.
I was convinced something was wrong.	Prepričan sem bil, da je nekaj narobe.
And did a lot.	In naredil veliko.
He will have to help us.	Moral nam bo pomagati.
I'm just a man.	jaz sem samo človek.
We all.	Mi vsi.
I know it can be hard to get here.	Vem, da je lahko težko priti sem.
They will see that.	To bodo videli.
Years of time.	Leta časa.
This is not easy for me to do.	To mi ni lahko narediti.
There are few of them.	Malo jih je.
That day probably wasn’t long ago.	Ta dan verjetno ni bil dolgo nazaj.
She actually said that.	Pravzaprav je to rekla.
Nice to see you again.	Lepo te je spet videti.
What is homeless in this place.	Kaj je brez doma na tem mestu.
I don't know what they did to him.	Ne vem, kaj so mu naredili.
As if he never wanted anything.	Kot da nikoli ni hotel ničesar.
I would like to know that.	To bi rad vedel.
I haven't seen that yet.	Tega še nisem videl.
I just want to say.	želim samo povedati.
She likes it.	Všeč ji je.
But that doesn't seem to be happening here.	A zdi se, da se to tukaj ne dogaja.
But so it seems.	Ali, tako se zdi.
I'll give him this and that,	Dal mu bom to in to,
He did that.	To je storil.
But unfortunately they were not there.	A žal jih ni bilo.
I would really like to hear from you.	Resno bi rad slišal od vas.
I used to like it.	Včasih mi je bilo všeč.
It seemed nice enough.	Zdelo se je dovolj lepo.
He was not alone.	Ni bil sam.
I don't want to be alone.	Nočem biti sam.
That's what happened.	To se je zgodilo.
But not much.	Vendar ne veliko.
Now I’m not sure what happened.	Zdaj nisem prepričan, kaj se je zgodilo.
I came for something else.	Prišel sem po nekaj drugega.
I can’t believe it works so fast.	Ne morem verjeti, da tako hitro dela.
And some more work.	In še nekaj dela.
But maybe it’s so good.	Morda pa je tako dobro.
I wasted no time coming here.	Nisem izgubil časa, ko sem prišel sem.
It will be there.	Tam bo.
I'm not sure yet.	Nisem še prepričan.
No, it looks like it is, but it isn't.	Ne, videti je, kot da je, vendar ni.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
I just don’t know when that day will be.	Samo ne vem, kdaj bo ta dan.
He gave the money quickly.	Hitro je dal denar.
I'm going to do it again.	Grem še enkrat na to.
He knew we were there.	Vedel je, da smo tam.
She said she thought she could.	Rekla je, da misli, da lahko.
It was time to party.	Čas je bil za zabavo.
I could have it all now.	Zdaj bi lahko dobil vse.
No one comes or goes.	Nihče ne pride ali ne gre.
This is my life.	To je moje življenje.
He's been doing this for years.	To počne že leta.
The one who did all the talking.	Tisti, ki je vse govoril.
As you know.	Kot veš.
I don’t know who else I could be.	Ne vem, kdo bi še lahko bil.
And they could be better.	In lahko bi bili boljši.
I'm not surprised.	nisem presenečen.
Lots of stuff here.	Veliko stvari tukaj.
But it can be anything.	Lahko pa je vse.
Not all of them.	Ne vsi.
He saw her.	Videl jo je.
Now he knew.	Zdaj je vedel.
Your father died.	Tvoj oče je umrl.
She knew what he meant.	Vedela je, kaj je mislil.
We haven't even been there in a while.	Niti nismo bili že kar nekaj časa.
I knew it couldn’t be easy.	Vedel sem, da ne more biti lahko.
We need to be told.	Treba nam je povedati.
now i know you	zdaj te poznam.
I needed a car.	Potreboval sem avto.
You should know that.	To bi moral vedeti.
She really wanted to believe him.	Res mu je želela verjeti.
It has been since before.	Od prej je.
We know what you did.	Vemo, kaj ste naredili.
Each of us was.	Vsak od nas je bil.
Being human is okay.	Biti človek je v redu.
it seems difficult to me.	težko se mi zdi.
I was the problem.	Jaz sem bil problem.
You're doing well.	Dobro ti gre.
But nothing like that would happen at home.	Doma pa se ne bi zgodilo nič takega.
First time here.	Prvič tukaj.
Something works for me.	Nekaj ​​mi dela.
He couldn't help who he was.	Ni si mogel pomagati, kdo je.
He really did everything he could.	Res je naredil vse, kar je lahko.
I like it better in my way, right?	Meni je na moj način bolj všeč, kajne?
The reason for this is as follows.	Razlog za to je naslednji.
It seemed a bit wrong.	Zdelo se je nekoliko narobe.
And we are very sure he will find himself.	In zelo smo prepričani, da se bo našel.
Tell me if he needs anything.	Povej mi, če kaj potrebuje.
Is it about a.	Ali gre za a.
I totally understand what you mean.	Popolnoma razumem, kaj misliš.
I really can't do that right now.	Tega trenutno res ne morem storiti.
I'll go with you if you want.	Grem s tabo, če želiš.
I did.	Sem naredil.
I think there are a few things.	Mislim, da je nekaj stvari.
I still don't.	jaz še vedno ne.
We know that now.	To zdaj vemo.
I bought this book.	Kupil sem to knjigo.
He is never afraid.	Nikoli se ne boji.
Do it fast.	Naredi to hitro.
He tried to speak.	Poskušal je govoriti.
I believe it will.	Verjamem, da bo.
No one should know.	Nihče ne bi smel vedeti.
And that's us.	In to smo mi.
No more time.	Ni več časa.
Not just a question of money.	Ne samo vprašanje denarja.
He is absolutely right about that.	Glede tega ima popolnoma prav.
I need him.	potrebujem ga.
That was nice.	To je bilo lepo.
That's the way it has to be.	Tako mora biti.
Not like this morning.	Ne kot danes zjutraj.
In fact, it never does.	Pravzaprav tega nikoli ne stori.
And that’s what interests me.	In to je tisto, kar me zanima.
I feel better too.	Tudi jaz se počutim bolje.
He only met her once.	Spoznal jo je le enkrat.
I like it a lot.	Veliko všeč pri tem.
I had to go back.	Moral sem nazaj.
How was your time.	Kako ste se imeli.
Except he just wasn't that anymore.	Le da preprosto ni bil več to.
But I still don't understand why.	Še vedno pa ne razumem, zakaj.
Something else was wrong.	Nekaj ​​drugega je bilo narobe.
I'm back, ready.	Vrnil sem se, pripravljen.
I went to talk to him.	Šla sem govoriti z njim.
It would be.	Bilo bi.
That everything seems so simple.	Da se vse zdi tako preprosto.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar.
But he will do more.	Vendar bo naredil več.
You should do it.	Morala bi to narediti.
Be with me.	Biti z mano.
And maybe it was true.	In morda je bilo res.
Everything is possible.	Vse je mogoče.
And he probably needed help.	In verjetno je potreboval pomoč.
Who would have thought, all this money and everything.	Kdo bi si mislil, ves ta denar in vse.
He does not live.	On ne živi.
He did something.	Nekaj ​​je naredil.
It was big.	Bilo je veliko.
And sometimes even that is not enough.	In včasih tudi to ni dovolj.
And he wasn't alone.	In ni bil sam.
This is my life now.	To je zdaj moje življenje.
I think it is now.	Mislim, da je zdaj.
There is enough.	Ima dovolj.
I liked everything.	Vse mi je bilo všeč.
But I really like them.	Meni so pa res všeč.
No one asked why.	Nihče ni vprašal zakaj.
There is no other.	Drugega ni.
I think it's time.	Mislim, da je čas.
That's the way life is now.	Tako je zdaj življenje.
He said he would wait for me.	Rekel je, da me bo čakal.
But that seems to be exactly what happened.	A zdi se, da se je zgodilo prav to.
As if to make a problem out of it.	Kot da bi iz tega delal problem.
It is true that.	Res je, da.
Which is why.	Kar je razlog, da.
So we'll see how it goes.	Tako da bomo videli kako bo.
Nobody ever said anything.	Nihče ni nikoli nič rekel.
You have to do something yourself.	Nekaj ​​moraš narediti sam.
That's something, he thinks.	To je nekaj, si misli.
The boy is here.	Fant je tukaj.
We will have to see what happens next.	Videti bomo morali, kaj se bo zgodilo naprej.
Until then.	Do tega.
I completely understand.	popolnoma razumem.
She hasn't done that in years.	Tega že leta ni storila.
He says he is.	Pravi, da je.
I don't do that.	jaz tega ne počnem.
I knew what it was for.	Vedela sem za kaj.
I didn't wait any longer.	Nisem več čakal.
She knows him better.	Bolje ga pozna.
You could hear it all.	Vse si lahko slišal.
I'll tell you as a friend.	Povedal ti bom kot prijatelj.
Maybe it's all of you.	Mogoče so vsi ti.
And it's beautiful.	In lepo je.
I'm so tired!	Tako sem utrujen!
Maybe more.	Mogoče več.
And it's still like that today.	In tako je še danes.
Instead .	Namesto .
The problem is money.	Problem je denar.
It's more than that.	Je več kot to.
That's gone too.	Tudi tega ni več.
She had to do that.	To je morala storiti.
That could really be so.	To bi lahko bilo res tako.
We'll be there soon.	Kmalu bomo tam.
I wouldn't hear of it.	Ne bi slišal za to.
I just worked.	Pravkar sem delal.
You too.	Tudi ti.
And sometimes it happened.	In včasih se je zgodilo.
They did it once, not so long ago.	Nekoč so ga, ne tako dolgo nazaj.
But there was a possibility.	Vendar je bila možnost.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu gre.
Usually for me, sorry.	Zame običajno, žal.
But maybe he was too tired to play.	Morda pa je bil preveč utrujen, da bi se igral.
I don't know what's next.	ne vem kaj naprej.
He couldn't leave.	Ni mogel oditi.
That was my life.	To je bilo moje življenje.
I know who he is.	Vem kdo je.
I came home.	Prišel sem domov.
I didn't do anything.	Nič nisem storil.
That's all that's happening.	Samo to se dogaja.
that is.	to je.
You have your money.	Imaš svoj denar.
It wasn’t so much that my job was hard.	Ni bilo toliko, da je bilo moje delo težko.
He can give it to you right away.	Lahko ti da takoj.
But he didn't know what else to do.	A ni vedel, kaj bi še naredil.
What is it? 	Kaj je to?
I mean my room.	Mislim na svojo sobo.
After that he went home.	Po tem odšel domov.
I am too.	Tudi jaz sem.
It was wrong and we know what happened.	Bilo je narobe in vemo, kaj se je zgodilo.
I haven't decided yet.	Nisem se še odločil.
Why oh why.	Zakaj o zakaj.
I haven't done that in years.	Tega že leta nisem storil.
Don’t think you failed.	Ne mislite, da vam ni uspelo.
This would be nice.	To bi bilo lepo.
He was surprised.	Bil je presenečen.
This is simply not true.	To preprosto ni res.
It seemed to him.	Zdelo se mu je.
It was much better now, but he had never seen it.	Zdaj je bilo veliko bolje, a tega ni nikoli videl.
Are you.	Ali si.
We don't even need it.	Niti nam ni treba.
I meant it.	Resno sem mislil.
I don't think that's right.	Mislim, da to ni prav.
To be better.	Biti boljši.
That was not a yes.	To ni bil da.
He's supposed to be mine.	On naj bi bil moj.
She was here now.	Zdaj je bila tukaj.
I'm fine on my own.	Sama sem v redu.
He did that.	To je storil.
You met them before.	Spoznal si jih že prej.
Maybe they did something wrong.	Mogoče so naredili kaj narobe.
A friend told me everything would be fine.	Prijatelj mi je rekel, da bo vse v redu.
Not once.	Niti enkrat.
But he knew he had to go.	Vendar je vedel, da mora iti.
He probably worked.	Verjetno je delal.
You don’t have to get to school that early.	Ni vam treba priti v šolo tako zgodaj.
I can't just go.	Ne morem kar iti.
If you want to talk to us, fine.	Če želite govoriti z nami, v redu.
Actually, I still am.	Pravzaprav sem še vedno.
I love what he does.	Všeč mi je, kar počne.
Maybe not.	Morda ne.
Im asking for help.	Prosim za pomoč.
And he didn't have the stuff to do it.	In ni imel stvari, da bi to naredil.
I'm not just from you.	Nisem samo od tebe.
It was so hard.	Bilo je tako težko.
Regardless, it's not about me.	Ne glede na to, ne gre zame.
You are never alone.	Nikoli nisi sam.
It is very good too.	Zelo dobro je tudi.
He won't do anything.	Nič ne bo naredil.
I'm not wondering.	Ne sprašujem se.
I just wanted something.	Samo nekaj sem hotel.
She was a person.	Bila je oseba.
I am amazed at how well it is going.	Presenečen sem, kako dobro gre.
I've never done this myself.	Sam tega še nikoli nisem naredil.
Who we were.	Kdo smo bili.
Sooner than you think.	Prej kot si mislite.
But it is also something else.	Je pa tudi nekaj drugega.
Where we are.	Kje smo.
They never are.	Nikoli niso.
Just like now.	Tako kot zdaj.
That's why he's here.	Zato je tukaj.
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
It was all because of you.	Vse je bilo zaradi tebe.
But he was very right.	Je pa imel veliko prav.
He couldn't see anything.	Ničesar ni mogel videti.
And if she wasn't.	In če ne bi bila.
That's the thing.	To je pa stvar.
It was not.	Ni bilo.
Like, good man.	Kot, človek dober.
I'm not feeling well today.	Danes se ne počutim dobro.
I think he might need some help.	Mislim, da morda potrebuje pomoč.
But they are not here.	Vendar jih ni tukaj.
Not so.	Ni pa tako.
Not maybe about that.	Ne morda o tem.
He didn't call anyone.	Nikogar ni poklical.
I knew he knew everything about me.	Vedela sem, da ve vse o meni.
He didn't need it.	Ni mu bilo treba.
This is your time.	To je tvoj čas.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
I have a chance.	Imam možnost.
He will come as soon as he can, no matter what.	Prišel bo takoj, ko bo lahko, ne glede na vse.
It's not ok.	Ni v redu.
Probably just for fun.	Verjetno samo za zabavo.
Just like you just.	Tako kot ti pravkar.
Not something like that.	Ne nekaj takega.
I would say no.	jaz bi rekel ne.
This one definitely is.	Ta je zagotovo.
And so every day throughout the week.	In tako vsak dan ves teden.
maybe not.	morda ne.
It was about time something was done.	Bil je že čas, da se nekaj naredi.
I'll have to do it myself.	To bom moral narediti sam.
Let it be.	Naj bo.
I found him.	Našel sem ga.
I'm going now.	Zdaj grem.
There I am.	Tam sem jaz.
He arrived this morning.	Prišel je zjutraj na ta dan.
This is a difficult question.	To je težko vprašanje.
I never told you that.	Tega ti nisem nikoli povedal.
I am seriously interested.	Resno me zanima.
You made it.	Ti si jo naredil.
Do you think she will succeed?	Mislite, da ji bo uspelo?
In fact, it can be more.	Pravzaprav je lahko več.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
I did it.	Uspelo mi je.
That's because it is.	To je zato, ker je.
Do it fast.	Naredi to hitro.
It was good to see her.	Dobro mi je bilo videti jo.
There is probably a reason for this.	Verjetno obstaja razlog za to.
Sometimes he does.	Včasih to počne.
What else do I have to do here.	Kaj še moram tukaj narediti.
You left me with nothing.	Pustil si me brez ničesar.
And it won't.	In ne bo.
I do not like.	Ne maram.
Or really, the question.	Ali res, vprašanje.
The man died.	Človek je umrl.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
This is not the case now.	Zdaj temu ni tako.
Where did she go?	Kam je šla?
This was quite common.	To je bilo precej pogosto.
You could know.	Lahko bi vedeli.
My question is here.	Moje vprašanje je tukaj.
Something must be wrong.	Nekaj ​​mora biti narobe.
You have time.	Čas imaš.
It's not hard either.	Tudi to ni težko.
I mean, man !.	Mislim, človek!.
He really couldn't do that.	Tega res ni mogel storiti.
She lives alone.	Živi sama.
I was working.	Delal sem.
I saw why.	Videl sem, zakaj.
I know it exists.	Vem, da obstaja.
We were for those things.	Bili smo za te stvari.
He thought so too.	Tudi on je tako mislil.
Now you can.	Zdaj lahko.
I wouldn't just go out!	Ne bi šel kar tako ven!
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni več.
I could be here.	Lahko bi bila tukaj.
I went for it.	Šla sem na to.
And the one before.	In tisto prej.
Apparently someone had.	Očitno je nekdo imel.
And yet he had.	In vendar je imel.
All he knew was that he didn't want to be alone.	Vedel je le, da noče biti sam.
It will be quite difficult.	Precej težko bo.
It really was.	Res je bilo.
You don’t have to go into that.	Ni vam treba iti v to.
You just know what to do.	Samo veš, kaj narediti.
Or so fast that it could be right away.	Ali pa tako hitro, da bi lahko bilo takoj.
There are a lot of people.	Veliko je ljudi.
You didn't do anything wrong.	Niste naredili nič narobe.
I haven't seen him in a long time.	Že dolgo ga nisem videl.
I believe my time has come.	Verjamem, da je prišel moj čas.
I thought you were right.	Mislil sem, da imaš prav.
He needs a car.	Potrebuje avto.
To this day, they still didn't know.	Do danes še vedno niso vedeli.
I still had work to do.	Imel sem še delo.
That's what she did.	Tako je storila.
I'll just go home.	Samo domov bom šel.
They were nothing to me.	Zame niso bili nič.
Now it seemed he would have to do just that.	Zdaj se je zdelo, da bo moral narediti prav to.
Not so much.	To pa ne toliko.
If only I could tell her.	Ko bi ji le povedal.
Or so it seemed.	Ali pa se je tako zdelo.
He did as he wanted.	Naredil je, kot je hotel.
Let me see you.	Naj te vidim.
And now, gone.	In zdaj, odšel.
It's not enough.	Ni dovolj.
He would know that.	On bi to vedel.
And we will have help.	In imeli bomo pomoč.
First time for my kids and me.	Prvič za moje otroke in zame.
That was my job.	To je bilo moje delo.
seriously? 	resno?
He knew.	Vedel je.
This would be the first time I would.	To bi bilo prvič, če bi.
But I want to see more.	Želim pa videti več.
You have it.	Imaš jo.
for sure	zagotovo,
You needed me.	Potreboval si me.
I don't know what's going on.	Ne vem kaj se dogaja.
You know, just do it.	Veš, samo naredi to.
Nobody knew anything.	Nihče ni vedel ničesar.
I didn't want to do that.	Nisem hotel narediti tega.
Only now he was gone.	Samo zdaj ga ni bilo.
It was a good deed.	Bilo je dobro delo.
You should if you didn't.	Moral bi, če ne bi.
He did nothing.	Nič ni naredil.
He just called.	Pravkar je poklical.
It happened.	Zgodilo se je.
That time will be here soon.	Ta čas bo kmalu tukaj.
The day he came home.	Dan, ko je prišel domov.
It's early.	Zgodaj je.
This happens often.	To se dogaja pogosto.
He had done this before.	To je storil že prej.
But from now on, nothing more.	A od zdaj naprej nič več.
She didn't know where.	Ni vedela kam.
You like it.	Všeč ti je.
You should be too.	Tudi ti bi moral biti.
I did it.	To mi je uspelo.
I think we are too.	Mislim, da smo tudi mi.
I think he is.	Mislim, da on.
We shouldn't talk for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa ne bi smeli govoriti.
And it continues.	In je še naprej.
In fact, much more.	Pravzaprav veliko več.
There is a reason why we are still here.	Obstaja razlog, zakaj smo še vedno tukaj.
But maybe it’s not that simple.	Morda pa to ni tako preprosto.
He asked her for help.	Prosil jo je za pomoč.
I returned it to you.	Vrnil sem ti.
If you are in.	Če ste v.
She was always very good to me.	Vedno je bila zelo dobra do mene.
I hope help comes.	Upam, da pride pomoč.
I did not have.	nisem imel.
I won once.	Enkrat sem zmagal.
But not often.	Vendar ne pogosto.
It actually is.	Pravzaprav je.
Everything seems possible there.	Zdi se, da je tam vse mogoče.
He doesn't like help.	Ne mara pomoči.
I just said.	Pravkar sem rekel.
Not for years.	Že leta ne.
How it helps you be who you are today.	Kako vam pomaga biti to, kar ste danes.
Dad has had enough, he says.	Oče je imel dovolj, pravi.
I'm not feeling well today.	Danes se ne počutim dobro.
there are none.	jih ni.
Would not .	Ne bi .
From then on.	Od takrat naprej.
That would not happen.	To se ne bi zgodilo.
There was nothing to buy.	Ni bilo kaj kupiti.
He doesn't like that.	To mu ni všeč.
It wasn't right away.	Ni bilo takoj.
But as good as.	Ali tako dobro kot.
No, it's not.	Ne ni.
I don't believe that's the case.	Ne verjamem, da je tako.
That's so good.	To je tako dobro.
Does he really have a reason to feel that way?	Ali ima res razlog, da se tako počuti?
And if you're lucky, he'll tell you.	In če boš imel srečo, ti bo povedal.
I have to see for myself.	Moram se prepričati sam.
You're not now.	Zdaj nisi.
Something like this has never happened to me before.	Kaj takega se mi prej ni zgodilo.
It just wasn't right.	Preprosto ni bilo prav.
I had to leave.	Moral sem oditi.
Not very good.	Ni zelo dobro.
Someone who was good.	Nekdo, ki je bil dober.
I just want to be alone.	Preprosto želim biti sam.
No, you didn't.	Ne, nisi.
I'm not in it for the money.	Nisem v tem zaradi denarja.
He's like us.	On je kot mi.
I was there.	Bil sem tam.
I am very sorry	zelo mi je žal
He likes this one too.	Tudi ta mu je všeč.
This is not difficult.	To ni težko.
You went after him.	Šel si za njim.
I just left.	Pravkar sem odšel.
He didn't like it.	Ni mu bilo všeč.
There was no one to talk to.	Nikogar ni bilo za govoriti.
This one is for me.	Ta je zame.
I thought it was you.	Mislil sem, da si ti.
That was nice to see.	To je bilo lepo videti.
No one could believe it.	Nihče ni mogel verjeti.
I hope you are OK.	Upam, da si v redu.
It was a really good job.	Res je bilo dobro delo.
I could do anything.	Lahko bi naredil vse.
We can't go on like this.	Ne moremo tako naprej.
My next may or may not be.	Moj naslednji je lahko ali pa ne.
I've done little else all my life.	Vse življenje sem počel malo drugega.
And you have to be.	In moraš biti.
I've never met her before.	Še nikoli je nisem srečal.
That could be a problem.	To bi lahko bil problem.
And yours.	In tvoj .
I think you will too.	Mislim, da boš tudi ti.
He came home.	Prišel je domov.
I still can't believe it.	Še vedno ne morem verjeti.
You never came back.	Nikoli se nisi vrnil.
Not enough money.	Ni dovolj denarja.
You are not what they are.	Nisi to, kar so.
That's not my problem.	To ni moj problem.
If I were lucky.	Če bi imel srečo.
I don't think he can do anything but help us.	Mislim, da nam ne more nič drugega kot pomagati.
I doubt it will be easy.	Dvomim, da bo to lahko.
He's not there, but he's there.	Ni ga, je pa tam.
i don't like it either.	tudi meni ni všeč.
You know you want to.	Veš, da želiš.
It seems like all of this has already happened.	Zdi se, da se je vse to že zgodilo.
And I wouldn't talk about it.	In o tem ne bi govoril.
A lot a lot a lot.	Veliko veliko veliko.
I'm not so sure.	nisem tako prepričan.
We are someone.	Nekdo smo.
He failed to do so.	Tega mu ni uspelo.
And father.	In oče.
I thought you didn't care.	Mislil sem, da te ne zanima.
I can't from here yet.	Ne morem še od tukaj.
However, this is not so difficult to do on your own.	Vendar to ni tako težko narediti sami.
I've never felt this way before.	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil.
We've been together for three years.	Skupaj sva tri leta.
It was time for fun.	Čas je bil za zabavo.
And that's true.	In to je res.
I would expect that.	To bi pričakoval.
I need to know how this happened.	Moram vedeti, kako se je to zgodilo.
I managed almost everything.	Skoraj vse mi je uspelo.
This has never happened to me.	Nikoli se mi to ni zgodilo.
I hope you're okay with that.	Upam, da si v redu s tem.
But it never felt right.	Vendar se nikoli ni zdelo prav.
My father bought it.	Moj oče ga je kupil.
To do what he wanted.	Da naredi, kar je želel.
He had that.	To je imel.
He knew he had just won.	Vedel je, da je pravkar zmagal.
You really don't have to do it yourself.	Tega vam res ni treba storiti sami.
He didn't look happy about it.	Ni bil videti vesel zaradi tega.
How.	Kako.
And it's still not enough.	In še vedno ni dovolj.
That's not it.	To ni tisto.
Yes, he told her.	Da, ji je rekel.
He was on.	Bil je na.
I didn’t expect this to happen.	Nisem pričakoval, da se bo to zgodilo.
I didn't win.	nisem zmagal.
I like it very, very much.	Zelo, zelo mi je všeč.
I had to be ready.	Moral sem biti pripravljen.
You've never done that before.	Tega še nikoli niste storili.
She is only interested in money.	Zanima jo samo denar.
No, it really can't be.	Ne, res ne more biti.
Seriously, there’s so much going on.	Resno, toliko se dogaja.
It's really simple.	To je res preprosto.
You should go back.	Moral bi iti nazaj.
I think we had enough.	Mislim, da smo imeli dovolj.
Yes, she wanted more than that.	Da, želela je več kot to.
He would come.	On bi prišel.
Quick.	Hitro.
It doesn't work.	Ne gre.
I bought a car.	Kupil sem avto.
I wouldn't have anything without it.	Brez tega ne bi imel ničesar.
He really succeeded.	Res mu je uspelo.
I know you will.	Vem, da boš.
Not much.	Ni veliko.
A lot of that.	Veliko tega.
You should make sure you have it all.	Moral bi biti prepričan, da imaš vse.
Just like you are.	Tako kot si.
And maybe he was right.	In morda je imel prav.
However, this never happened.	Vendar se to nikoli ni zgodilo.
He preferred it that way.	Tako je imel raje.
That’s when he got it right.	Takrat je dobil prav.
I really wanted to.	Res sem si želel.
I don't want any more children.	nočem več otrok.
And he's probably right.	In verjetno ima prav.
I will never forget what he did.	Nikoli ne bom pozabil, kaj je naredil.
We just have to move on.	Samo naprej moramo.
He seemed to know what to do.	Zdelo se je, da ve, kaj storiti.
No one in front of him.	Nihče pred njim.
And he had.	In imel je.
I don't think anyone can.	Mislim, da nihče ne more.
And we did it, we did it.	In uspelo nam je, uspelo nam je.
I mean, it's true.	Mislim, res je.
I think you'll be fine.	Mislim, da boš v redu.
He saw it now.	To je zdaj videl.
I just don't.	Samo mi ne.
No, that's not true.	Ne, to ni res.
It was absolutely beautiful.	Bilo je popolnoma lepo.
I will not forget you.	Ne bom te pozabil.
.	.
And if you don’t know, you can’t believe it.	In če ne veš, ne moreš verjeti.
And live.	In živi.
I was alone all this time.	Ves ta čas sem bil sam.
I think it's true.	Mislim, da je res.
He doesn't know why.	Ne ve zakaj.
That was not possible.	To ni bilo mogoče.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
He was ready.	Bil je pripravljen.
He saw it immediately.	Takoj je videl.
That's my real problem.	To je moj pravi problem.
He had time.	Imel je čas.
Nothing after that.	Po tem nič.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žal.
More on that tomorrow.	Več o tem jutri.
That you were my friend, that is.	Da si bil moj prijatelj, to je.
we are having a good time.	lepo se imamo.
I hope you stay here.	Upam, da boš ostal tukaj.
He left and hasn't come back yet.	Odšel je in se še ni vrnil.
They were probably right.	Verjetno so imeli prav.
He can't stay here.	Ne more ostati tukaj.
I used to do that.	Včasih sem to delal.
No one does better.	Nihče ne naredi bolje.
So I said no.	Zato sem rekel ne.
This week will be even better.	Ta teden bo še boljši.
Nothing,” she said quickly.	Nič,« je hitro rekla.
Actually too much.	Pravzaprav preveč.
You are a teacher.	Ti si učitelj.
Like in me.	Kot v meni.
He didn't expect that.	Tega ni pričakoval.
That, even more so.	To, še bolj.
Like you.	Tako kot ti.
You're home now, boy.	Zdaj si doma, fant.
I will say friend.	bom rekel prijatelj.
No one is like him.	Nihče ni kot on.
Everyone liked it.	Vsem je bilo všeč.
She had been to this place before.	Na tem mestu je bila že prej.
That was not true.	To ni bilo res.
Just like the hotel.	Tako kot hotel.
They are not there.	Niso tam.
She has to say that now, she said.	To mora zdaj povedati, je rekla.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
Like last night.	Kot sinoči.
For another, it might not.	Za drugega morda ne bo.
He will be good because he must be good.	Dober bo, ker mora biti dober.
He called me today.	Danes me je poklical.
And that's something.	In to je nekaj.
He didn't want her.	Ni je hotel.
Back to work.	Nazaj na delo.
Someone should do something about it.	Nekdo bi moral nekaj narediti glede tega.
It's that simple !.	Tako preprosto je!.
This is possible today.	Danes je to mogoče.
You will have to be.	Moral boš biti.
But you were.	Ali ste bili.
We did everything right.	Vse smo naredili prav.
I will stay here.	ostal bom tukaj.
I love work.	rad imam delo.
I want that for all my children.	To želim za vse svoje otroke.
You were a real friend.	Bil si pravi prijatelj.
We really have a problem.	Res imamo problem.
What you said.	Kar si rekel.
I didn't make it.	To mi ni uspelo.
I hope there is a better way to do this.	Upam, da obstaja boljši način za to.
He should be there.	Tam bi moral biti.
A way to see who can play.	Način, kako videti, kdo lahko igra.
And that was enough.	In to je bilo dovolj.
Keep talking to yourself.	Kar naprej si to govori.
He longs for them.	Zelo si želi k njim.
I haven't come back since.	Od takrat se nisem več vrnil.
Maybe he had kids.	Morda je imel otroke.
I did this to work here.	To sem naredil, da bi delal tukaj.
If it wasn't for him, she wouldn't have made it.	Če ne bi bilo njega, ji ne bi uspelo.
Actually, nothing happened.	Pravzaprav se ni zgodilo nič.
What he did.	Kaj je naredil.
I doubt he's right.	Dvomim, da ima prav.
It was obvious that she knew him.	Očitno je bilo, da ga pozna.
I don’t believe you could do that to me.	Ne verjamem, da bi mi to lahko storil.
Something would happen.	Nekaj ​​bi se zgodilo.
That's what he says there.	To tam govori.
Or for money.	Ali za denar.
You, it is.	Ti, to je.
I'm here for that.	Tukaj sem zaradi tega.
You never ate anything.	Nikoli nisi nič jedel.
And it never will be.	In nikoli ne bo.
They may be helpful.	Morda bodo v pomoč.
Nobody here would do that.	Nihče tukaj tega ne bi naredil.
But it can be.	Lahko pa je.
It happened a long time ago.	Zgodilo se je že dolgo nazaj.
No, because you'll regret it.	Ne, ker ti bo žal.
No, I wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
I would like to know.	rad bi vedel.
I didn't like him one bit.	Niti malo mi ni bil všeč.
And he succeeded.	In uspelo mu je.
I never will.	nikoli ne bom.
You need to know how to do it.	Moraš vedeti, kako to narediti.
She knew it wouldn't be long now.	Vedela je, da zdaj ne bo dolgo.
It never will.	Nikoli ne bo.
It feels like him.	Počuti se kot on.
We'll see what happens.	Bomo videli, kaj se bo zgodilo.
It happened at.	Zgodilo se je ob.
I'll be here.	Tukaj bom.
But we are lucky.	Vendar imamo srečo.
He saw what was there.	Videl je, kaj je tam.
I don't see anything wrong.	Ne vidim nič narobe.
Sam taught her how to do it.	Sam jo je naučil, kako to narediti.
It will be quite because he is not actually here.	Precej bo, ker ga pravzaprav ni tukaj.
For a few years.	Za nekaj let.
There was nothing else to do.	Nič drugega ni bilo za početi.
That's a lot of money.	To je kar veliko denarja.
I became alone early.	Zgodaj sem postal sam.
It was still early.	Bilo je še zgodaj.
I didn't hear him.	Nisem ga slišal.
No one knows for sure.	Nihče ne ve zagotovo.
That was a little difficult.	To je bilo malo težko.
You are a true friend.	Ti si pravi prijatelj.
He saw it too.	Tudi on je to videl.
That's the question.	To je vprašanje.
You should know what to do.	Morali bi vedeti, kaj storiti.
I wanted money.	Hotel sem denar.
We may never know for sure.	Morda nikoli ne vemo zagotovo.
I don't know what it is.	ne vem kaj je.
I heard you were working.	Slišal sem, da si delal.
None of you have anyone.	Nihče od vas nima nikogar.
He never talked about it.	O tem ni nikoli govoril.
you will know.	vedeli boste.
What did they do wrong?	Kaj so naredili narobe?
He stayed there for a long time.	Tam je ostal dolgo.
I didn't want much.	Nisem hotel veliko.
None of that.	Nič od tega.
Everything is as it should be.	Vse je tako kot mora biti.
A simple question.	Preprosto vprašanje.
That's what she wanted.	To si je želela.
I'm glad you said that my friend.	Vesel sem, da si to rekel, prijatelj moj.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
I can't talk to him.	Ne morem govoriti z njim.
I was very happy.	Bil sem zelo vesel.
I don't want anything.	Nočem ničesar.
I didn't lose her.	Nisem je izgubil.
Why are you.	Zakaj si.
Would anyone like to tell me what's going on?	Bi mi kdo rad povedal, kaj se dogaja?
I'm never alone.	Nikoli nisem sam.
I went to school this morning.	Danes zjutraj sem šel v šolo.
For some time.	Za nekaj časa.
Right at .	Prav pri .
I wouldn't be surprised.	Ne bi bil presenečen.
Long live him!	Dolgo življenje mu!
You have everything.	Vse imaš.
Just what's going on.	Le kaj se dogaja.
He succeeded.	To mu je uspelo.
And it has been for a while.	In nekaj časa je.
We know where you are.	Vemo, kje ste.
I would need more money.	Potreboval bi več denarja.
One can only hope.	Človek lahko samo upa.
He needs these things.	Te stvari potrebuje.
He was so angry.	Bil je tako jezen.
They won't have you.	Ne bodo te imeli.
Does not exist.	Ne obstaja.
No one knows for sure who she was.	Nihče ne ve zagotovo, kdo je bila.
But no one comes out.	Nihče pa ne pride ven.
I could hardly.	Težko ne bi mogel.
Not much actually.	Pravzaprav ne veliko.
I couldn't tell you.	Nisem ti mogel povedati.
This is because he is not.	To je zato, ker ga ni.
Bo ven.	Bo ven.
I feel very good right now.	Trenutno se počutim zelo dobro.
He was a boy again.	Spet je bil fant.
He needs you for that.	Za to te potrebuje.
I know you well.	dobro te poznam.
I'm behind you, man.	Za tabo sem, človek.
He wanted to know what he was thinking.	Želel je vedeti, kaj si misli.
I like them.	Všeč so mi.
It was nice.	Lepo je bilo.
That's fine.	To je v redu.
He's at it again.	Spet je pri tem.
He stuck to what he said.	Ostal je pri tem, kar je rekel.
I think it will be soon.	Mislim, da bo kmalu.
Just not everyone.	Samo ne vsi.
That's as good as it gets.	To je tako dobro, kot je.
How he wants to keep seeing me.	Kako me želi še naprej videti.
And now he has it.	In zdaj ga ima.
Do you find it difficult to buy?	Se vam zdi, da ga je težko kupiti?
First time.	Prvič.
It wasn’t much going forward.	Ni bilo veliko za naprej.
It's big.	Veliko je.
It was only a matter of time now.	Zdaj je bilo samo vprašanje časa.
He is much more.	On je veliko več.
I thought there was something wrong with me.	Mislil sem, da je nekaj narobe z mano.
Or something more.	Ali kaj več.
Every man wanted or found a job.	Vsak človek si je želel ali našel službo.
And they seem likely to be.	In zdi se verjetno, da bodo.
I didn't.	Nisem.
I didn’t think anyone would.	Nisem si mislil, da bo kdo.
I never would.	Nikoli ne bi.
I would help you.	jaz bi ti pomagal.
I would never do that.	Nikoli ne bi naredil tega.
Things are fine right now.	Stvari so trenutno v redu.
In fact, it was very good.	Pravzaprav je bilo zelo dobro.
Not a little.	Ne malo.
Not so today.	Danes ni tako.
He didn't do that.	Tega ni storil.
You're not sure.	Nisi prepričan.
I found a job.	Našel sem službo.
I allowed him.	dovolil sem mu.
They made us.	Naredili so nas.
That's fine with me.	To je v redu z mano.
It worked last night.	Uspelo sinoči.
He'll probably get a job.	Verjetno bo dobil službo.
I wonder if it's true.	Zanima me, če je res.
We would not succeed in that.	To nam ne bi uspelo.
I wanted to say.	Hotel sem povedati.
And it seems not.	In zdi se, da ne.
He came with us once.	Enkrat je prišel z nami.
Now to work.	Zdaj pa na delo.
He never even asked for it.	Nikoli ga niti ni prosil.
I see everything.	Vidim vse.
They are here for you.	Tukaj so za vas.
I need more money.	Potrebujem več denarja.
She said nothing.	Nič ni rekla.
It would be a good game, it would.	To bi bila dobra igra, to bi.
I couldn't do that now.	Zdaj tega ne bi mogel storiti.
However, this is not the right way to go.	Vendar to ni pravi način zaradi.
I'll be good to you.	Dober bom do tebe.
Much more.	Veliko več.
Not that, ”he said very seriously.	Ne to,« je rekel zelo resno.
It was as usual.	Bilo je kot običajno.
I told you you were going to learn something.	Rekel sem ti, da se boš nekaj naučil.
We almost were.	Skoraj smo bili.
She never did that.	Tega ni nikoli storila.
No one said much.	Nihče ni rekel veliko.
They won't do anything to me.	Nič mi ne bodo naredili.
I saw he had.	Videl sem, da ima.
He said more than he wanted.	Povedal je več, kot je hotel.
It's every day now.	Zdaj je vsak dan.
I didn't have that kind of time.	Nisem imel takega časa.
Your father wanted you to have this.	Tvoj oče je želel, da imaš to.
I still couldn't see her.	Še vedno je nisem mogel videti.
Just tell me what you think.	Samo povej mi, kaj misliš.
And maybe it was for you.	In morda je bilo za vas.
I'm lucky to be here.	Imam srečo, da sem tukaj.
Nice to have you here with me !.	Lepo, da si tukaj z mano!.
That was never an issue.	To nikoli ni bilo vprašanje.
I didn't like the question.	Vprašanje mi ni bilo všeč.
My question is why are you interested.	Moje vprašanje je zakaj te zanima.
Or because nothing is happening.	Ali zato, ker se nič ne dogaja.
It makes me feel good.	Zaradi tega se počutim dobro.
Or better, about it.	Ali bolje, glede tega.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe.
I haven't seen that yet.	Tega še nisem videl.
We did that.	To smo naredili.
I know why.	vem zakaj.
Here we are.	Tukaj smo.
He has to do it or he does nothing.	To mora storiti ali pa ne naredi nič.
And he didn't call me.	In ni me poklical.
A few years ago.	Še nekaj let nazaj.
You're not and it's just not right.	Ti, nisi in preprosto ni prav.
Just a friend.	Samo prijatelj.
I wonder why you didn't.	Sprašujem se, zakaj nisi.
I think so.	Mislim.
There is enough time !.	Časa je dovolj!.
It's obvious.	Očitno je.
i wouldn't let that happen.	jaz tega ne bi pustil.
But he is no more.	Vendar ga ni več.
No time.	Brez časa.
Nothing was as it was.	Nič ni bilo tako, kot je bilo.
It must be pretty serious.	Mora biti precej resno.
It was just a question.	Bilo je samo vprašanje.
I believe I prefer not to.	verjamem, da raje ne.
And maybe no one ever told him.	In morda mu nihče ni nikoli povedal.
We can't here.	Tukaj ne moremo.
I wouldn't know where it is.	Ne bi vedel, kje je.
I know you're a good person.	Vem, da si dobra oseba.
It was better, much better.	Bilo je bolje, veliko bolje.
I'm tired of it.	Utrujen sem od tega.
He will go with you.	On bo šel s tabo.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
I would be happy.	Vesel bi bil.
He is ready for work.	Pripravljen je na delo.
It was just there.	Tam je bilo samo.
This one would do.	Ta bi naredil.
He died there.	Tam je umrl.
He didn't look too good.	Ni bil videti preveč dobro.
I didn't get that.	Tega nisem dobil.
It happened so fast.	Tako hitro se je zgodilo.
And it needs quite a bit of work.	In potrebuje kar nekaj dela.
We have everything and everything.	Imamo vse in vse.
You know where he is.	Veš kje je.
What is right is right, what is wrong is wrong.	Kar je prav, je prav, kar je narobe, je narobe.
He had a hard time finding a job.	Težko je našel službo.
Not that we knew that at the time.	Saj ne, da smo to takrat vedeli.
I wonder what will happen now.	Zanima me, kaj bo zdaj.
All right with me.	V redu z mano.
Something that didn't look right.	Nekaj, kar ni bilo videti v redu.
We never will.	Nikoli ne bomo.
I'm not entirely sure.	Nisem popolnoma prepričan.
I told you that afternoon.	Tisto popoldne sem ti povedal.
She didn't know what they were.	Ni vedela, kaj so.
We'll see how things go.	Bomo videli kako bodo stvari.
That happened.	To se je zgodilo.
And it will.	In bo.
I'd rather stay here.	Raje bi ostal tukaj.
We have help.	Imamo pomoč.
He knew what he would find.	Vedel je, kaj bo našel.
That's a lot of stuff.	To je veliko stvari.
It is hard.	Je, težko.
They saw a lot.	Videli so veliko.
I was something else.	Bil sem nekaj drugega.
We never did.	Nikoli nismo.
I thought you knew.	Mislil sem, da veš.
I want to be your friend.	Želim biti tvoj prijatelj.
Enough for now.	Dovolj za zdaj.
no.	ne.
I knew that.	Vedel sem to.
That’s when I knew it was a possibility.	Takrat sem vedel, da je to možnost.
For more money.	Za več denarja.
Who's there? 	Kdo je tam?
I think he needs to do a little bit of that.	Mislim, da mora to malo narediti.
This is happening, for now.	To se dogaja, za zdaj.
If anyone knows please help with this.	Če kdo ve prosim za pomoč pri tem.
Tomorrow is my day.	Jutri je moj dan.
you have a problem.	imaš problem.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ne vem, kaj se je zgodilo z njim.
A lot of money.	Veliko denarja.
However, this is not always the case.	Vendar to ni vedno tako.
I'd rather not have children.	Raje ne bi imel otrok.
One has to speak.	Človek mora govoriti.
That’s really, really obvious!	To je res, res očitno!
He won't buy it.	Ne bo ga kupil.
I have something to tell you.	Nekaj ​​ti imam za povedati.
It's there, but it's not.	Je tam, vendar ni.
He lives here.	Tukaj živi.
None of this worked.	Nič od tega ni uspelo.
We will do that.	To bomo storili.
She wanted to be together again.	Želela je biti spet skupaj.
That was life.	To je bilo življenje.
She just had to see.	Samo videti je morala.
It's fine now.	Zdaj je v redu.
I want to be here and now.	Želim biti tukaj in zdaj.
No one can be better than you.	Nihče ne more biti boljši od tebe.
First question for me.	Zame pa prvič vprašanje.
Or maybe that's not it.	Ali pa morda to ni to.
This has already happened.	To se je že zgodilo.
He's a boy.	Fant je.
still can.	še vedno lahko.
Good thing he didn't.	Še dobro, da ni.
Called again.	Spet poklical.
I never regretted it.	Nikoli mi ni bilo žal.
You can't do that.	Tega ne moreš početi.
I have a life.	imam življenje.
Nobody heard him.	Nihče ga ni slišal.
wrong.	narobe.
This, and this, and this too.	To, in to, in to tudi.
So we have.	Tako imamo.
Or I could do something.	Ali pa bi lahko nekaj naredil.
As he says, he says.	Kot pravi, pravi.
I know they are there.	Vem, da so tam.
No one was seen.	Nikogar ni bilo videti.
And you won't know.	In ne boste vedeli.
But she needs it.	Vendar ga potrebuje.
You will not die.	Ne boš umrl.
From everything they were.	Od vsega, kar so bili.
You know better than that.	Veš bolje od tega.
You were the only one who heard me.	Ti si bil edini, ki me je slišal.
You're not.	Nisi.
In that room.	V tisti sobi.
If you like it, live.	Če ti je všeč, živi.
He’s a guy who’s already won.	On je fant, ki je že zmagal.
It really was that way.	Res je bilo tako.
We have enough of them.	Imamo jih dovolj.
There is simply nothing we can do with it here.	Tukaj z njim preprosto ne moremo narediti ničesar.
Is that really what you wanted to say?	Je to res tisto, kar si hotel povedati?
He seems very confident.	Zdi se zelo prepričan.
I didn’t know when and how this was going to happen.	Nisem vedel, kdaj in kako se bo to zgodilo.
I know what's wrong with you.	Vem kaj je narobe s tabo.
It seems so to us because it is true.	Tako se nam zdi, ker je res.
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
I came.	Prišel sem.
And a lot of that.	In veliko tega.
I didn't get it.	Nisem ga dobil.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
You can't talk.	Ne moreš govoriti.
Someone behind it.	Nekdo za tem.
Life must go on.	Življenje mora iti naprej.
And he didn't know what to do.	In ni vedel, kaj naj naredi.
from	od
She was never mine.	Nikoli ni bila moja.
I will not tell anyone.	nikomur ne bom povedal.
This is thoughtless.	To je brez misli.
I just thought it would be good to see you.	Samo mislil sem, da bi te bilo dobro videti.
You are not my father.	Ti nisi moj oče.
I had them.	Imel sem jih.
I would leave and come back again.	Odšel bi in se spet vrnil.
She won't be back for a few days.	Še nekaj dni je ne bo nazaj.
Not even a little.	Niti malo.
This may seem like a long time.	To se morda zdi veliko časa.
So that's what it is.	Zato je to, kar je.
Not so for the first time.	Ne tako prvič.
Nobody really does.	Nihče res ne.
You know you can.	Veš, da lahko.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
They both knew that.	To sta vedela oba.
He is still angry.	Še vedno je jezen.
Nobody does that.	Nihče tega ne počne.
Maybe he gave a little more time.	Mogoče je dal malo več časa.
I can't tell you when.	Ne morem ti povedati kdaj.
This is a game of chance.	To je igra za srečo.
This is obvious now.	To je zdaj očitno.
Doesn't it work well?	Ali ne dela dobro?
I could have.	Lahko bi imel.
So on.	Tako da tako naprej.
Maybe you are.	Mogoče si.
All day.	Ves dan.
She’s been here before and she’s just doing it.	Tukaj je že bila in to samo počne.
In fact, he didn't even know why he was there.	Pravzaprav sploh ni vedel, zakaj je tam.
I could never do that.	Tega nikoli ne bi mogel storiti.
I told him not to talk.	Rekel sem mu, naj ne govori.
I don't know how to do it.	Ne vem, kako to narediti.
You told me that.	To si mi povedal.
It didn't always work out so well.	Ni vedno uspelo tako dobro.
There is nothing to do.	Nič ni za narediti.
You never were.	Nikoli nisi bil.
I had to talk.	Moral sem govoriti.
He was not and never would be.	Ni bil in nikoli ne bi bil.
She didn’t even know what she would do if she did.	Sploh ni vedela, kaj bi storila, če bi.
I knew this was going to happen.	Vedel sem, da se bo to zgodilo.
In fact, there are many.	Pravzaprav jih je veliko.
There are still too many.	Še vedno jih je preveč.
He just looked angry.	Samo videti je bil jezen.
That was a good thing to do, he told himself.	To je bilo dobro narediti, si je rekel.
That's really not true.	To res ni res.
I feel at home.	Počutim se kot doma.
You'll be alone after that.	Po tem boš sam.
There was never enough money.	Denarja ni bilo nikoli dovolj.
Not to me either.	Niti meni ne.
I hope he can come home soon.	Upam, da bo lahko kmalu prišel domov.
I have to go back to the house.	Moram nazaj v hišo.
So he decided to go there.	Zato se je odločil, da gre tja.
Everything was to be said and nothing.	Vse je bilo za povedati in nič.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
That's better.	Tako je bolje.
Yours and yours and yours.	Tvoj in tvoj in tvoj.
He will not sit alone.	Ne bo sedel sam.
It may have been wrong, but he thought it was right.	Morda je bilo narobe, vendar je mislil, da je prav.
I worked there.	Tam sem delal.
Someone who was not well.	Nekdo, ki mu ni bilo dobro.
But they were not enough.	A niso bili dovolj.
We'll be able to see.	Bomo lahko videli.
I don't think so.	ne mislim.
What happened happened.	Kar se je zgodilo, se je zgodilo.
He doesn't know it's us.	Ne ve, da smo mi.
He didn't know.	Ni vedel.
I see what they did there.	Vidim, kaj so naredili tam.
I had to be here.	Moral sem biti tukaj.
He was so tired.	Bil je tako utrujen.
I am not anymore.	nisem več.
I actually had.	Pravzaprav sem imel.
And so are we.	In tudi mi smo.
That's what I expected.	To sem pričakoval.
Are you going to buy this?	Boš to kupil?
And nothing happened.	In nič se ni zgodilo.
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.	Nihče ne ve, kaj se bo zgodilo jutri.
That was not true.	To ni bilo res.
I don't know about me either.	Tudi jaz ne vem za mene.
There is no one left.	Nikogar več ni.
Want to see how it's done?	Želite videti, kako se to naredi?
I want to know what's going on here.	Želim vedeti, kaj se tukaj dogaja.
And there he tells her he can't.	In tam ji pravi, da ne more.
But she didn't say that.	Vendar tega ni rekla.
You got.	Ti imaš.
I heard it was good.	Slišal sem, da je dobro.
I knew that was the reason.	Vedel sem, da je to razlog.
But there was still money.	A tam je bil še denar.
If and when anyone could get it.	Če in ko bi ga kdo lahko dobil.
I'm still there.	še vedno sem tam.
I want to know why.	Želim vedeti zakaj.
I didn't like it.	Ni mi bilo všeč.
You should see them.	Moral bi jih videti.
There were a few, but not very many.	Nekaj ​​jih je bilo, a ne prav veliko.
He had it now.	Zdaj ga je imel.
Apparently they didn't have time.	Očitno niso imeli časa.
There is no such thing.	Tega ni.
It didn't seem right to me.	Meni se ni zdelo prav.
We wouldn't even know about something like that.	Za kaj takega sploh ne bi vedeli.
That's obviously there.	To je očitno tam.
He didn't want to tell me anything.	Ničesar mi ni hotel povedati.
It was something she had to do on her own.	To je bilo nekaj, kar je morala narediti sama.
He was absolutely right.	Imel je popolnoma prav.
I might do something else.	Morda bi naredil kaj drugega.
You want someone you like.	Želite nekoga, ki vam je všeč.
Someone has to.	Nekdo mora.
Still no one.	Še vedno nihče.
I saw him.	Videl sem ga.
And he seems to be right.	In zdi se, da ima prav.
I didn’t even know how he was feeling.	Sploh nisem vedel, kako se počuti.
I just found it.	Pravkar sem ga našel.
You just let him go.	Pravkar si ga pustil.
She said okay.	Rekla je v redu.
I shouldn't have done that.	Ne bi smel narediti tega.
He never got them.	Nikoli jih ni dobil.
The time has come.	Prišel je čas.
Maybe that would be good.	Mogoče bi bilo pa to dobro.
There is nothing more.	Nič več ni.
He helped me a lot.	Zelo mi je pomagal.
You will stay here.	Tukaj boš ostal.
But it isn't.	Vendar ni.
She moved on.	Šla je naprej.
I was so sure about it.	Bil sem tako prepričan o tem.
I know you're angry.	Vem, da si jezen.
You should be.	Moral bi biti.
That's right, at all.	Tako je, na vse.
Just like my father in front of me.	Tako kot moj oče pred mano.
He's been here before.	Tukaj je že bil.
I would forget.	Pozabil bi.
I really like that.	To mi je zelo všeč.
No more for home.	Nič več za domov.
That was it, nothing more.	To je bilo to, nič več.
You are and he is not yet.	Ti si in on še ni.
You have to get right.	Moraš priti prav.
And he came to me.	In prišel je k meni.
And that's the problem.	In to je problem.
But not often.	Vendar ne pogosto.
I would really like that.	res bi si to želel.
Because there's money.	Ker tam je denar.
Maybe he feels good.	Mogoče se mu zdi dobro.
You probably weren't.	Verjetno nisi bil.
I will say more.	Povedal bom več.
I didn't think it would.	Nisem mislil, da bo.
There was nothing like that.	Nič takega ni bilo.
That happened.	To se je zgodilo.
She would never make it.	Nikoli ji ne bi uspelo.
Sometimes it goes well, sometimes it doesn’t.	Včasih gre to dobro, včasih pa ne.
I gave you what you wanted.	Dal sem ti, kar si želel.
A lot of things.	Veliko stvari.
You know that as well as we do.	To veste tako dobro kot mi.
Are you sure about this?	Ste prepričani o tem?
He used to do things for me.	Včasih je delal stvari zame.
It was good for me.	Meni je bilo dobro.
He is what he is.	On je to, kar je.
That is certainly true.	To je zagotovo res.
We are what we are.	Smo kar smo.
It's not.	Ni se.
Found a way.	Našel način.
It won't be long.	Ne bo dolgo.
Yes, he was good at it.	Da, bil je dober v tem.
And no one would buy it.	In nihče ga ne bi kupil.
It was really good.	Res je bilo dobro.
not good.	ni dobra.
He didn't expect that.	Tega ni pričakoval.
You should see that.	To bi moral videti.
Is there still time?	Je še čas?
I don't know who he is.	Ne vem, kdo je.
Right there, right there.	Takoj, prav tam.
He seemed to be interested in that.	Videti je bilo, da ga to zanima.
Now I see something to do.	Zdaj vidim nekaj za narediti.
You won't die.	Ne boš umrl.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Samo ne vem, kako to narediti.
That's my business.	To je moja stvar.
But there was something else.	Vendar je bilo nekaj drugega.
That is, if you know what is good for you.	Se pravi, če veš, kaj je dobro zate.
That is if you're even interested.	To je, če te sploh zanima.
This has never been the case.	To nikoli ni bilo tako.
They are always there for me.	Vedno so tam zame.
That's what he did.	Tako je naredil.
Do it now.	Naredi to takoj.
Really them.	Res jih.
Which probably exists.	Kar verjetno obstaja.
I can not do it anymore.	ne morem več.
I have to keep talking.	Moram govoriti naprej.
I learned a lot.	Naučil sem se veliko.
He keeps telling you.	Kar naprej ti govori.
I forgot who it is.	Pozabil sem, kdo je.
It feels like something that is true.	Počuti se kot nekaj, kar je res.
More of that.	Več tega.
None of this was good.	Nič od tega ni bilo dobro.
And what else.	In kaj še.
And no one came too well.	In nihče ni prišel preveč dobro.
he says.	pravi.
You will	Boš
He was not back at work.	Dela ga ni bilo nazaj.
They are here all the time.	Ves čas so tukaj.
He came quite often.	Prišel je precej pogosto.
I could hear.	Lahko sem slišal.
Why he was here was a question.	Zakaj je bil tukaj, je bilo vprašanje.
I can't help myself.	Ne morem si pomagati.
He will be the one to decide.	On bo tisti, ki se bo odločil.
We have to do this for our children.	To moramo narediti za svoje otroke.
Just for this occasion.	Samo za to priložnost.
He knew when he was well.	Vedel je, kdaj mu je bilo dobro.
I'd like to see what else you have there.	Rad bi videl, kaj še imaš tam.
Here at home.	Tukaj doma.
It never was.	Nikoli ni bilo.
In fact, it still is.	Pravzaprav je še vedno.
The next day.	Naslednji dan.
That's almost everyone.	To so skoraj vsi.
Certainly not me.	Zagotovo nisem.
I think this time is good.	Mislim, da je ta čas dober.
We just don’t know when he was there.	Samo ne vemo, kdaj je bil tam.
He was angry.	Bil je jezen.
I completely understand.	Popolnoma razumem.
It won't be easy.	Ne bo lahko.
He got three years for that.	Za to je dobil tri leta.
They had nothing to say.	Niso imeli kaj povedati.
Sometimes I do.	Včasih mi je tako.
In fact, he was quite right.	Pravzaprav je imel precej prav.
Maybe to everyone who was with him.	Mogoče vsem, ki so bili z njim.
More than enough.	Več kot dovolj.
That is the only reason for that.	To je edini razlog za to.
And when he gets there, he does something.	In ko pride tja, nekaj naredi.
That's right.	Tako je.
And maybe he lost.	In morda je izgubil.
They were usually a game.	Običajno so bili igra.
I didn't know that.	tega nisem vedel.
I want her here right now.	Želim jo tukaj takoj.
Nice to see you.	Lepo te je videti.
He is my life.	On je moje življenje.
He's not here today.	Danes ga ni tukaj.
You haven't seen anything yet.	Ničesar še nisi videl.
And if there are, they are very few.	In če že, jih je zelo malo.
Not them today.	Danes jih ne.
I don't understand this.	Ne razumem tega.
Quite a few, really.	Kar nekaj, res.
He is fine.	On je dobro.
Where have you been?	Kje si bil?
Life is not that simple.	Življenje ni tako preprosto.
There was no need.	Ni bilo treba.
Or maybe this one.	Ali pa morda ta.
Not even a child was real.	Niti otrok ni bil pravi.
This is very difficult, but it is possible.	To je zelo težko, vendar je mogoče.
Because you don't know what they are.	Ker ne veš kaj so.
I said again.	Še enkrat sem rekel.
Apparently we're both.	Očitno sva oba.
It could be you or me.	Lahko bi bila ti ali jaz.
it can help you.	vam lahko pomaga.
Now do it.	Zdaj pa naredi.
No one really knows.	Nihče res ne ve.
We have already done that.	To smo že storili.
It happened.	Zgodilo se je.
This is obviously difficult.	To je očitno težko.
You're almost certainly right.	Skoraj zagotovo imaš prav.
He will do me good.	Dobro mi bo naredil.
We have work to do.	Imamo delo.
I need to know.	Moram vedeti.
We love it.	Všeč nam je.
It was more than a.	Bilo je bolj kot a.
I don’t know how he found it so quickly.	Ne vem, kako ga je tako hitro našel.
Maybe you should go with him?	Mogoče bi morala iti z njim?
We have to help each other.	Pomagati si moramo.
You know it doesn't work that way.	Saj veš, da ne gre tako.
Everything you said is true.	Vse kar si rekel je res.
What he says is so true.	Kar pravi, je tako res.
He promised to make me feel good.	Obljubil je, da se bom počutil dobro.
And we did.	In to smo storili.
Can anyone help me with this ?.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga pri tem?.
He almost never goes out.	Skoraj nikoli ne gre ven.
Sometimes it is, sometimes it is not.	Včasih je, včasih ne.
He must have been waiting for someone.	Verjetno je nekoga čakal.
I really didn't have to.	Res mi ni bilo treba.
In fact, you have to work for nothing.	Pravzaprav moraš delati za nič.
I love that you are here.	Všeč mi je, da si tukaj.
It's not what it looks like.	Ni tako, kot je videti.
No, without seeing them first.	Ne, ne da bi jih prej videl.
I thought I should know.	Mislil sem, da bi moral vedeti.
It took more time.	Potreboval je več časa.
He lives alone now.	Zdaj živi sam.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
I gave everything a little.	Sem dal vsega po malo.
And there were no people.	A ljudi ni bilo.
He was sitting there.	Tam je sedel.
I've never seen him before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl.
I'll start right away.	Takoj bom začel.
For some time now more than today.	Že nekaj časa bolj kot danes.
i learned a lot.	veliko sem se naučil.
And that is exactly what happened.	In prav to se je zgodilo.
He doesn't.	On pa ne.
It's just a.	To je samo a.
There would never be time.	Nikoli ne bi bilo časa.
Tell me what happened.	Povej mi, kaj se je zgodilo.
That's a little too much.	To je malo preveč.
how are you	kako si
I wish you would work for me.	Želim si, da bi delal zame.
It is good to know.	Dobro je vedeti.
Maybe I know him.	Morda ga poznam.
Just for you.	Samo zate.
I need more money.	Potrebujem več denarja.
I will not die.	ne bom umrl.
I wouldn't be surprised if he left you here.	Ne bi bil presenečen, če te je pustil tukaj.
I have to work on it.	Moram delati na tem.
But we should.	Ali bi morali.
I can't tell anyone.	Nikomur ne morem povedati.
She didn't know what she was thinking.	Ni vedela, kaj si misli.
I'll tell you right away.	Takoj vam bom povedal.
He gives it to me.	On mi ga da.
I just got here.	Pravkar sem prišel sem.
Please, more.	Prosim še, več.
Or to the house.	Ali v hišo.
I would do that too.	Tudi jaz bi to naredil.
He had to be.	Moral je biti.
It was hard to leave.	Težko je bilo oditi.
That's us.	To smo mi.
It has to be mine.	Mora biti moj.
Nice to see you.	Lepo te je videti.
He wasn't sure.	Ni bil prepričan.
It's not serious.	Ni resno.
I never had that.	Tega nikoli nisem imel.
The problem still exists.	Problem še vedno obstaja.
I know.	Vem.
No one came.	Nihče ni prišel.
That's what we did.	To smo naredili.
This is normal.	To je običajno.
That should be life.	To naj bo življenje.
And how much.	In koliko.
I should know something.	Nekaj ​​bi moral vedeti.
That's what he expected.	To je pričakoval.
He has problems there.	Tam ima težave.
I was alone.	Bila sem sama.
So much has happened and so much more has happened.	Toliko se je zgodilo in toliko se je še zgodilo.
I really didn't like this one.	Ta mi res ni bil všeč.
I was very happy at home.	Doma sem bil zelo vesel.
Here is something.	Tukaj je nekaj.
A lot of things.	Veliko stvari.
It has to be better.	Mora biti bolje.
It wouldn't be that hard.	Ne bi bilo tako težko.
And you should know.	In moral bi vedeti.
Back in time again.	Spet nazaj v čas.
I would have heard.	Slišal bi.
Maybe, never.	Morda, nikoli.
I've never done that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem storil.
He said he would know when he got there.	Rekel je, da bo vedel, ko bo prišel tja.
This is not the first time this has happened.	To se ni zgodilo prvič.
He told me he didn't know.	Rekel mi je, da ne ve.
I knew you wanted time with him.	Vedel sem, da si želiš čas z njim.
You should have seen him sooner.	Moral bi ga videti prej.
There was nothing you could do then.	Takrat nisi mogel storiti ničesar.
Life was hard.	Življenje je bilo težko.
i'm just a kid.	jaz sem samo otrok.
He's too angry.	Preveč je jezen.
I've never been there before.	Še nikoli nisem bil tam.
Boy, he does it when he can.	Fant, to počne, ko lahko.
This is not possible now.	Zdaj to ni mogoče.
You don’t even have to know everything from yourself.	Tudi od vas ni treba vedeti vsega.
He was a boy.	Bil je fant.
I don't want to know anything.	Nočem vedeti ničesar.
But there was no help.	A ni bilo pomoči.
He has me there.	Tam me ima.
Just do it.	Samo naredi ti.
I told him I liked it.	Rekel sem mu, da mi je všeč.
What does it do.	Kaj to naredi.
I know this is right.	Vem, da je to prav.
He had a home.	Imel doma.
And I wouldn't have it for long.	In ne bi ga imel dolgo.
It didn't look good.	Ni bilo videti dobro.
You have taught us so much.	Toliko si nas toliko naučil.
This is not my problem as it worked perfectly fine.	To ni moj problem, saj je delal popolnoma v redu.
He will see you.	On te bo videl.
I knew then.	Takrat sem vedel.
He's been gone for a long time.	Dolgo ga ni več.
You couldn't help it.	Nisi si mogel pomagati.
You should talk to him about it.	O tem bi morala govoriti z njim.
Maybe more than a few.	Morda več kot nekaj.
No one should really be surprised.	Nihče pravzaprav ne bi smel biti presenečen.
I'm fine with that.	V redu sem s tem.
They will do this if they can.	To bodo storili, če bodo lahko.
I don't have that much time.	Nimam toliko časa.
I know there are many.	Vem, da jih je veliko.
No, it's not okay.	Ne, ni v redu.
We shouldn't do that anymore.	To in narediti več ne bi smeli.
Say that again, please.	Povej to še enkrat, prosim.
She had to, she told him.	Morala je, mu je rekla.
That was for me.	To je bilo zame.
He did it.	Naredil to.
I needed more time than that.	Potreboval sem več časa kot to.
Because you won't go out with him.	Ker ne boš šel z njim ven.
She said yes, you can't go alone.	Rekla je, da, ne moreš iti sam.
I would love to.	Bi pa rad.
Either one heard it or one didn't.	Človek je to slišal ali pa ne.
I hope they will.	Upam, da bodo.
Obviously not.	Očitno ne.
Again, that's fine.	Še enkrat, to je v redu.
We can't do that.	Tega ne moremo storiti.
But he was no more.	Vendar ga ni bilo več.
It wasn't good.	Ni bilo dobro.
This is a difficult question.	To je težko vprašanje.
He should come today or tomorrow.	Priti bi moral danes ali jutri.
i would do that.	jaz bi to naredil.
He's gone, you can't help him anymore.	Ni ga več, ne moreš mu več pomagati.
What do we have here?	Kaj imamo tukaj?
I was both.	Bila sem oba.
She liked her immediately.	Takoj ji je bila všeč.
That must be hard.	To mora biti težko.
I did several things.	Naredil sem več stvari.
This is not about that.	Tukaj ne gre za to.
There is a way to work around this.	Obstaja način za delo pri tem.
A lot of people were never seen again.	Veliko ljudi nikoli več ni bilo videti.
I won't tell you anymore.	Ne bom ti več povedal.
That's really it.	To je res to.
You will come to me from time to time.	Od časa do časa boš prišel k meni.
It wasn't good.	Ni bilo dobro.
This is actually wrong.	To je pravzaprav narobe.
That's what they always were.	To so vedno bili.
He won't have to.	Ne bo mu treba.
Maybe a few days.	Lahko nekaj dni.
I know this is something.	Vem, da je to nekaj.
There are many things to love here!	Tukaj je veliko stvari za rad!
Therefore.	Zato.
You saw that.	To ste videli.
And he was seriously pissed off.	In bil je resno jezen.
I think we had.	Mislim, da smo imeli.
I want it.	Želim si ga.
But he has thoughts.	Vendar ima misli.
We just.	Mi samo.
He didn't play.	Ni igral.
But there was no time.	A časa ni bilo.
It wasn't too much.	Ni bilo preveč.
All the time,” he said.	Ves čas,« je rekel.
I can't buy this.	Tega ne morem kupiti.
I think it was true.	Mislim, da je bilo res.
It's all in us.	Vse je v nas.
Do you have time?	Ali imaš čas?
I said.	Rekel sem.
You like them.	Všeč so ti.
He wanted to.	Želel je.
No one knows how much.	Nihče ne ve, koliko.
Now she didn't know what to think.	Zdaj ni vedela, kaj naj si misli.
I never wanted a baby.	Nikoli si nisem želela otrok.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe.
Still not.	Še vedno ne.
He didn't help.	Ni pomagal.
I seriously don't understand.	Resno ne razumem.
I never found them again.	Nikoli več jih nisem našel.
I'm back at work too.	Tudi jaz sem se vrnil v službo.
You have it here.	Tukaj ga imaš.
Tell me that's not true.	Povej mi, da to ni res.
We had them there yesterday.	Včeraj smo jih imeli tam.
Do not speak.	Ne govori.
They still are.	Še vedno so.
Seriously, that's all.	Resno, to je vse.
I don't see that.	ne vidim tega.
Never tell anyone anything you didn't have to.	Nikoli nikomur ne povej ničesar, kar ti ni bilo treba.
I don't think so.	ne mislim.
I have everything here.	Tukaj imam vse.
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
I have a lot to tell you.	Veliko ti moram povedati.
I don't like it a bit.	malo mi ni všeč.
I don't know for sure that mine.	Ne vem zagotovo, da moj.
Know where he was.	Vedeti, kje je bil.
It always is.	Vedno je.
This is what actually happened.	To se je pravzaprav zgodilo.
Now move on.	Zdaj pa kar naprej.
I like it there.	Všeč mi je tam.
You have done a lot.	Veliko si naredil.
He felt more and more at home.	Vedno bolj se je počutil doma.
Spoke to him.	Govoril z njim.
I don't care how.	Ne zanima me kako.
He went back to that.	Vrnil se je k temu.
And we didn't.	In nismo.
How could this happen.	Kako se je to lahko zgodilo.
But he did nothing.	Vendar ni storil ničesar.
I just need to talk to you.	Samo govoriti moram s tabo.
He didn't come out.	Ni prišel ven.
He wanted to leave.	Hotel je oditi.
It wasn't before.	Ni bilo prej.
Maybe it's nothing.	Mogoče ni nič.
No, they didn't.	Ne, niso.
None of this is true.	Nič od tega ni res.
I have to go home.	moram domov.
It was so simple.	Bilo je tako preprosto.
And it's probably not going well.	In pri tem verjetno ne gre dobro.
And died immediately.	In takoj umrl.
First, he was tired.	Prvič, bil je utrujen.
They will be soon.	Kmalu bodo.
You should go.	Moral bi iti.
I'm doing better now, just tired.	Zdaj mi gre bolje, samo utrujen.
Obviously this was not the case.	Očitno temu ni bilo tako.
I think it could be something else.	Mislim, da je lahko kaj drugega.
I failed.	mi ni uspelo.
Now it was.	Zdaj je bilo.
You will stay here.	Tukaj boš ostal.
That was obvious.	To je bilo očitno.
There is so much going on.	Toliko se dogaja.
He expected as much.	Toliko je pričakoval.
That would not be easy.	To ne bi bilo lahko.
Apparently to make it look nice.	Očitno zato, da bi bilo videti lepo.
I know it's hard.	Vem, da je težko.
I do not have time.	nimam časa.
He was.	Bil je.
I mean nothing.	Nič ne mislim.
No one can do that.	Tega nihče ne more storiti.
You don't have to be here.	Ni ti treba biti tukaj.
And if I hadn't seen her.	In če je ne bi videl.
I've never seen him.	Nikoli ga nisem videl.
you told us.	povedal si nam.
You wanted him.	Želela si ga je.
Good thing here.	Dobra stvar tukaj.
Everything could be true.	Vse bi lahko bilo res.
So my question here.	Zato moje vprašanje tukaj.
It seems like quite some time.	Zdi se, da kar nekaj časa.
But I don't think it will.	Vendar mislim, da ne bo.
That didn't happen here.	To se tukaj ni zgodilo.
But I never asked you for anything.	Nikoli pa te nisem nič prosil.
I'm the only one here.	Jaz sem edini tukaj.
I really would rather not.	Res bi raje ne.
They must have seen him, too.	Zagotovo so ga tudi videli.
I'm a little tired.	malo sem utrujen.
And I.	In jaz.
That's your problem, not mine.	To je tvoj problem, ne moj.
I asked what it was.	Vprašal sem, kaj je to.
I haven't seen anything like it.	Nič takega nisem videl.
I got there immediately.	Takoj sem prišel tja.
But it is much better.	Je pa veliko bolje.
Maybe they will be right.	Mogoče bodo imeli prav.
And so it was with that.	In tako je bilo tudi s tem.
I bought it.	Kupil sem ga.
He has few.	Malo jih ima.
I can't do that.	tega ne morem.
He may not like it.	To mu morda ne bo všeč.
Or you should know.	Ali pa bi moral vedeti.
Is this the right way?	Je to pravi način?
This man would definitely help.	Ta človek bi zagotovo pomagal.
This issue is not before us.	To vprašanje ni pred nami.
He started right away.	Takoj je začel.
We really are.	Res smo.
I'm at it again.	Spet sem pri tem.
I want you too much.	preveč si te želim.
He found nothing.	Ničesar ni našel.
She didn't know many things.	Veliko stvari ni vedela.
It seemed too much.	Zdelo se je preveč.
Better not, better not.	Bolje ne, bolje ne.
It's right there.	Prav tam je.
I wouldn't let him eat that day.	Tisti dan mu ne bi dovolil več jesti.
She wanted out.	Želela je ven.
That would be hard work.	To bi bilo težko delo.
I'm right behind you.	Takoj za tabo sem.
But that is no longer the case.	A temu ni več tako.
You may or may not.	Lahko ali pa tudi ne.
There was no more to say.	Ni bilo več za povedati.
I'll never forget seeing you.	Nikoli ne bom pozabil, da sem te videl.
It was as usual.	Bilo je kot običajno.
But he didn't think it would.	A si ni mislil, da bo.
I can not do it anymore.	ne morem več.
There was obviously something wrong with him.	Z njim je bilo očitno nekaj narobe.
This is not about that.	Tukaj ne gre za to.
He wanted to work more.	Želel je več delati.
It’s not as hard as it seems.	Ni tako težko, kot se zdi.
There were so few.	Tako malo je bilo.
It felt good to sit down for a while.	Dobro se mi je zdelo, da sem za nekaj časa sedel.
What would that be.	Kaj bi to.
All right with me.	V redu z mano.
I hope you would too.	Upam, da bi tudi ti.
Not that he liked the job.	Saj ne, da mu je bilo delo všeč.
Unfortunately, this cannot be true.	Žal to ne more biti res.
Or like.	Ali všeč.
I felt like a child.	Počutil sem se kot otrok.
I have nothing to do with the book.	S knjigo nimam nič.
He knows he would lose.	Ve, da bi izgubil.
He couldn't do what he had to do here.	Tukaj ni mogel storiti, kar je moral.
Even if it's me.	Tudi če sem jaz.
You have it.	To imaš.
The boy refuses to talk about what happened.	Fant noče govoriti o tem, kaj se je zgodilo.
I know we didn't do that.	Vem, da tega nismo storili.
I have a good job so there is that.	Imam dobro službo, tako da to obstaja.
I'm going alone.	jaz grem sam.
Nobody asked me to.	Nihče me ni prosil.
Maybe he's right.	Mogoče ima prav.
And so.	In so.
You brought me back to life.	Vrnil si me v življenje.
Just a little bit more.	Samo še malo.
Even better.	Tudi boljši.
But I will never tell him that.	Vendar mu tega nikoli ne bom povedal.
I always.	Jaz vedno .
In fact, it can’t be.	Pravzaprav ne more biti.
Maybe you don't like it.	Mogoče ti to ni všeč.
Not really, it still is.	Pravzaprav ne, še vedno je.
It was nothing like that.	To ni bilo nič takega.
It just really has to be.	Samo res mora biti.
We just know.	Samo vemo.
He died there.	Ta je tam umrl.
No one helped him.	Nihče mu ni pomagal.
Apparently it was.	Očitno je bilo tako.
They knew that.	To so vedeli.
It's neither here nor there.	To ni ne tukaj ne tam.
He just couldn't.	Preprosto ni mogel.
You will find.	Boš našel.
I'm glad to be with you.	Vesel sem, da sem s tabo.
The money came quickly.	Denar je prišel hitro.
I wonder what she regrets.	Sprašujem se, kaj ji je žal.
It's not difficult either.	Tudi težko ni.
I wish you.	Želim ti.
I wouldn't know.	Ne bi vedel.
he's right.	ima prav.
I could just die.	Lahko bi kar umrl.
He's still supposed to be playing.	Še vedno naj bi igral.
I know it seems so, but it’s not true.	Vem, da se zdi tako, vendar ni res.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Preprosto nisem mogel verjeti.
And so do we.	In tudi mi.
He never left.	Nikoli ni odšel.
And I won't have to tell anyone.	In nikomur mi ne bo treba povedati.
My father is back.	Moj oče se je vrnil.
He actually said that.	Pravzaprav je to rekel.
it's good.	dobro je.
Now is not the time for any of that.	Zdaj ni časa za nič od tega.
He admitted that a lot is true.	Priznal je, da je veliko res.
And there's nowhere to go.	In ni kam iti.
I worked for both.	Delal sem za oba.
He got lost.	Izgubil se je.
Now it goes on and on and on.	Zdaj gre naprej in naprej in naprej.
I think you have a problem.	Mislim, da imaš problem.
It never was, never will be.	Nikoli ni bilo, nikoli ne bo.
We made it.	Naredili smo jo.
I wouldn't eat.	Ne bi jedel.
Just like you and me.	Tako kot ti in jaz.
He is nothing more.	On ni nič več.
I have all that.	Vse to imam.
We are there today.	Tam smo danes.
I still can't believe it.	Še vedno ne morem verjeti.
And without it.	In brez tega.
I know.	Vem .
There was no one in the room.	V sobi ni bilo nikogar.
She went to dinner.	Šla na večerjo.
I want to go out more.	Želim iti več ven.
Sometimes I do.	Včasih mi je tako.
We are here and we have work to do.	Tukaj smo in imamo delo.
Nobody knew about you.	Nihče ni vedel zate.
Nothing was in place.	Nič ni bilo na mestu.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
He seemed to like it.	Videti je bilo, da mu je to všeč.
The car was still there.	Avto je bil še vedno tam.
We will never know for sure, now.	Nikoli ne bomo vedeli zagotovo, zdaj.
That was the problem.	To je bil problem.
He felt better this morning.	Danes zjutraj se je počutil bolje.
We can't stay.	Ne moremo ostati.
I already understand what you said.	Že razumem, kaj si rekel.
I don't want to see him again.	Nočem ga več videti.
It wasn't like that here.	Tukaj ni bilo tako.
I'm sorry for you.	Žal mi je zate.
To go to work.	Da grem v službo.
He sat and waited.	Sedel je in čakal.
I'm sure you know about that.	Prepričan sem, da veš o tem.
This is not for you.	To ni za vas.
He won't talk about it.	Ne bo govoril o tem.
And he gave it to her.	In dal ji ga je hotel.
That was simple enough.	To je bilo dovolj preprosto.
My work was very simple.	Moje delo je bilo zelo preprosto.
I will come to you.	Prišel bom do tebe.
It should be something.	Moral bi biti nekaj.
I thought I wanted to know.	Mislil sem, da bi rad vedel.
And you should be too.	In tudi ti bi moral biti.
He was busy.	Bil je zaposlen.
Everyone loved it.	Vsem je bilo všeč.
I feel like yes.	Počutim se, kot da.
And it's not good.	In ni dobro.
There’s usually not much there.	Tam običajno ni veliko.
He works as a teacher.	Dela kot učitelj.
What about this.	Kaj pa to.
I hope you like them.	Upam, da vam bodo všeč.
In me.	V meni.
I know too many things.	Vem preveč stvari.
You have to do better.	Moraš narediti bolje.
You should be angry.	Moral bi biti jezen.
She knew now that this was not going to happen.	Zdaj je vedela, da se to ne bo zgodilo.
You're nothing without me.	Brez mene si nič.
No one saw him come.	Nihče ga ni videl priti.
Just here and gone.	Samo tukaj in odšel.
That's what I'll decide.	Tako se bom odločil.
I really can't talk right now.	Zdaj res ne morem govoriti.
I actually liked it.	Pravzaprav mi je bilo všeč.
Boy, are you good at this.	Fant, si dober v tem.
He seems pretty angry.	Zdi se, da je precej jezen.
There is nothing here for you.	Tukaj ni nič zate.
I wasn't too happy.	Nisem bil preveč vesel.
He knew what was going on and did nothing.	Vedel je, kaj se dogaja in ni storil ničesar.
I knew it existed.	Vedel sem, da obstaja.
I knew he wouldn't come back.	Vedel sem, da se ne bo vrnil.
He says something.	Nekaj ​​pravi.
No one really knows.	Nihče res ne ve.
You will need to know.	Morali boste vedeti.
This has never been the case.	Tega ni bilo nikoli.
And it was perfectly fine.	In bilo je popolnoma v redu.
He had never seen him before.	Še nikoli ga ni videl.
Whether she liked it or not.	Ali ji je bilo všeč ali ne.
Like you could die if you never see him again.	Kot da bi lahko umrl, če ga ne boš več videl.
I'm not afraid of you as much as I am.	Ne bojim se te toliko kot tega.
I need a room.	Potrebujem sobo.
Father and child.	Oče in otrok.
I am very happy to be here.	Zelo sem vesel, da sem tukaj.
He knew something.	Nekaj ​​je vedel.
I know this is not going to happen.	Vem, da se to ne bo zgodilo.
The question is difficult.	Vprašanje je težko.
For now.	Za zdaj.
It needs to be done.	Treba je narediti.
I can't tell anyone.	ne morem nikomur povedati.
That's all.	To je vse.
You will now.	Zdaj boš.
Always will be and always will be.	Vedno bo in vedno.
No, not for us.	Ne, ne za nas.
And that's enough.	In to je dovolj.
it's true.	res je.
What? 	Kaj?
Maybe something would happen.	Mogoče bi se kaj zgodilo.
She knew what she was doing.	Vedela je, kaj počne.
Which is so wrong.	Kar je tako narobe.
He is no more today.	Danes ga ni več.
She said so herself.	Tudi sama je tako rekla.
I gave her everything.	Dal sem ji vse.
I believe it was.	Verjamem, da je bilo.
Yes, he will definitely do that.	Da, zagotovo bo to storil.
Are you okay?	Si v redu?
She has to go alone.	Sama mora iti.
I've never seen her before.	Nikoli prej je nisem videl.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
Too many years.	Preveč let.
Not that he needed to.	Ne da bi mu bilo treba.
I would like more.	rad bi več.
Not anymore.	Pa ne več.
But very good.	Vendar zelo dobro.
But no.	Vendar ne .
Also, like I said.	Tudi, kot sem rekel.
It would be good to see you again.	Dobro bi te bilo spet videti.
He seemed to want to be me, but better.	Zdelo se je, da je hotel biti jaz, vendar bolje.
It feels good to me.	Zdi se mi dobro.
I didn't hear you.	Nisem te slišal.
I just wanted to know what was going on.	Hotel sem samo vedeti, kaj se dogaja.
A few days probably.	Nekaj ​​dni verjetno.
said my father.	je rekel moj oče.
There will come a time when you will have to leave.	Prišel bo čas, ko boste morali oditi.
He didn't have to see them.	Ni mu jih bilo treba videti.
If so, we don’t have to do anything.	Če je tako, nam ni treba storiti ničesar.
So,.	Tako,.
There's something about that.	Nekaj ​​je na tem.
Let it be so that and.	Naj bo tako, da in.
You will never see me again.	Nikoli več me ne boš videl.
I'm leaving in the morning.	Zjutraj grem.
We have to do that.	To moramo storiti.
He's right.	Ima prav.
Just like he was.	Tako kot je bil on.
You told me yourself.	Sam si mi povedal.
This happens every day.	To se dogaja vsak dan.
Would be.	Bi bilo.
Maybe they were right.	Mogoče so imeli prav.
I want to know how and why and when.	Želim vedeti, kako in zakaj in kdaj.
And no, that's not it either.	In ne, niti to ni to.
And in their own way.	In po svoje.
Or he refused to say.	Ali pa ni hotel povedati.
He will do what is right.	Naredil bo, kar je prav.
I never would.	Nikoli ne bi.
In this way.	Na ta način se.
I just want them at home.	Želim jih samo doma.
I didn't speak either.	Tudi jaz nisem govoril.
Not even that.	S tem niti ne.
He wants to see you.	On te želi videti.
That could happen to me.	To bi se mi lahko zgodilo.
More, more, he said.	Več, več, je rekel.
Something is going wrong.	Nekaj ​​gre narobe.
Probably not good.	Verjetno ni dobro.
I would give my life for it.	Za to bi dal življenje.
I think they would see that.	Mislim, da bi to videli.
I saw that right away.	To sem takoj videl.
No one knew anything, no one saw her.	Nihče ni vedel ničesar, nihče je ni videl.
Maybe so.	Morda je tako.
I wanted money anyway.	Na vsak način sem hotel denar.
I had to tell her.	Moral sem ji povedati.
I really knew where they were.	Res sem vedel, kje so.
Now she's done it.	Zdaj je to storila.
Might as well go home.	Lahko bi tudi šel domov.
There was a lot there.	Tam je bilo veliko.
You can be something more.	Lahko si nekaj več.
We may never know.	Morda nikoli ne vemo.
I’m not sure if that helps you.	Nisem prepričan, če vam to pomaga.
I want to be somebody.	Želim biti nekdo.
He made a lot of people.	Naredil je veliko ljudi.
You have to be tired.	Moraš biti utrujen.
I passed the first time.	Prvič sem opravil.
I liked mine.	meni je bil moj všeč.
My time has surely come.	Zagotovo je prišel moj čas.
Now is my chance.	Zdaj je moja priložnost.
Like every day.	Kot vsak dan.
And to see them.	In da bi jih videl.
I don’t know where I’m going wrong.	Ne vem, kje grem narobe.
He just went out.	Pravkar je odšel ven.
But he's gone.	Vendar ga ni več.
No one ever is.	Nihče ni nikoli.
I didn't want it.	Nisem ga hotel.
I hope he's right.	Upam, da ima prav.
We are here now.	Zdaj smo tukaj.
He's tired.	Utrujen je.
And he still didn't want to go back.	In še ni hotel nazaj.
And now she knew what they were.	In zdaj je vedela, kaj so.
I don't understand anymore.	Ne razumem več.
If there was anything obvious, it was.	Če je bilo kaj očitno, je bilo to.
Just let me know if you're interested.	Samo povej mi, če te zanima.
It's actually very simple.	Pravzaprav je zelo preprosto.
Here is the reason.	Tukaj je razlog.
Not just for me.	Ne samo zame.
And now this.	In zdaj to.
I will say it exists.	Povedal bom, da obstaja.
I could just say you know.	Lahko bi samo rekel, da veš.
I know I can.	Vem, da lahko.
He taught her everything he knew.	Naučil jo je vsega, kar je vedel.
I knew it would be so.	Vedel sem, da bo tako.
From now on, I will do things.	Od zdaj naprej bom delal stvari.
But they also did more.	Vendar so naredili tudi več.
Maybe it's better that way.	Mogoče je tako bolje.
I'm sure he'll be fine.	Prepričan sem, da bo v redu.
I sat in the car.	Sedel sem v avto.
I don't know you either.	tudi jaz te ne poznam.
If she were good.	Če bi bila dobra.
That's what we did.	Tako smo naredili.
To do that.	Da bi to naredili.
He didn't do any of that.	Nič od tega ni storil.
Why do you need to know?	Zakaj moraš vedeti?
Who would not?.	Kdo ne bi?.
The question now is whether they will.	Vprašanje je zdaj, ali ga res bodo.
I don't know what it is.	Ne vem kaj je.
That's what you told us.	To si nam povedal.
He said this was not going to happen to me.	Rekel je, da se mi to ne bo zgodilo.
I know it's not much.	Vem, da ni veliko.
No one can be sure.	Nihče ne more biti prepričan.
We had a good time.	Imeli smo se dobro.
I quickly sat down.	Hitro sem sedel.
I would be good to you.	Bil bi dober do tebe.
I didn't know any better.	Nisem vedel nič bolje.
I have a good job.	Imam dobro službo.
He did a lot.	Veliko je počel.
You just have to be who you are.	Samo moraš biti to, kar si.
And we need to know that.	In to moramo vedeti.
That was not the reason.	To ni bil razlog.
I talked to him.	govoril sem z njim.
She knew for the first time.	Prvič je vedela.
Where will she go and she is doing well.	Kam bo šla in ji gre dobro.
Here is the real problem.	Tukaj je pravi problem.
He'll be back soon.	Kmalu se bo vrnil.
You know very well why that is.	Dobro veš zakaj je tako.
He must be a very good friend of mine.	Mora biti moj zelo dober prijatelj.
There was no one there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar.
I thought.	Mislil sem.
I don't understand what's going on.	Ne razumem, kaj se dogaja.
I'm not afraid of anything.	Ničesar se ne bojim.
It's happening now.	Zdaj se dogaja.
I talked to you that day.	Tisti dan sem govoril s tabo.
I needed someone to tell me it would be okay.	Potreboval sem nekoga, ki bi mi povedal, da bo v redu.
I want to know that he will be fine.	Želim vedeti, da bo z njim v redu.
There was no time.	Ni bilo časa.
I would like you to have this.	Rad bi, da imaš to.
And now he wanted to leave.	In zdaj je hotel oditi.
I just.	Pravkar sem.
Three more years.	Še tri leta.
we really have.	res imamo.
Nothing was as it was before.	Nič ni bilo tako, kot je bilo prej.
Something is wrong.	Nekaj ​​ni v redu.
Nothing was right.	Nič ni bilo v redu.
He's been at it ever since.	Od takrat je pri tem.
I knew then.	Takrat sem vedel.
None of this interests me.	Nič od tega me ne zanima.
Or still.	Ali pa še vedno.
It just doesn't work that way.	Tako preprosto ne gre.
Always and forever.	Vedno in za vedno.
He is a good man.	On je dober človek.
I really should go to school.	Res bi morala iti v šolo.
We never saw her.	Nikoli je nismo videli.
Do what you have to do.	Naredi, kar moraš.
Maybe you think it’s me, and maybe it is.	Mogoče misliš, da sem pravi jaz, in morda je tako.
It was simple but good.	Bilo je preprosto, a dobro.
I didn’t know anyone really did that anymore.	Nisem vedel, da je to res nihče več naredil.
Not fast enough.	Ne dovolj hitro.
The only question is how soon.	Vprašanje je le, kako kmalu.
It's just me.	Samo jaz sem.
I don't know if it's still there.	Ne vem, če je še tam.
I know what we have to do tonight.	Vem, kaj moramo narediti nocoj.
No matter where you are today, someone helped you get there.	Ne glede na to, kje ste danes, vam je nekdo pomagal priti tja.
This is not the case at all.	To sploh ni tako.
I almost wouldn't know she had it.	Skoraj ne bi vedel, da ga ima.
I didn't say that.	Tega nisem rekel.
There is nothing else he can do.	Nič drugega ne more storiti.
This will happen.	To se bo zgodilo.
But there really was no time for that.	Res pa ni bilo časa za to.
However, it did not seem likely.	Vendar se ni zdelo verjetno.
You were tired.	Bil si utrujen.
No, not much.	Ne, ne veliko.
It has an angle.	Ima kot.
The one no one wanted.	Tisti, ki ga nihče ni želel.
I think something is going on.	Mislim, da se nekaj dogaja.
I was alone.	Bil sem sam.
That's quite a lot.	To je kar veliko.
That's how it goes.	Tako gre.
He was surprised.	Bil je presenečen.
But we can't know for sure.	Ne moremo pa vedeti zagotovo.
He just didn't want to.	Preprosto ni hotel.
But there was nothing he could do.	Vendar ni mogel storiti ničesar.
I came back here right away.	Takoj sem se vrnil sem.
Always is, always will be.	Vedno je, vedno bo.
Now they could certainly be right.	Zdaj bi zagotovo lahko imeli prav.
He is not surprised there.	Tam ni presenečen.
You would wait.	Ti bi čakal.
And so it is.	In temu je tako.
He will give everything he has.	Dal bo vse, kar ima.
You don't need to do anything more.	Ni vam treba storiti ničesar več.
As if we both knew we had it.	Kot da sva oba vedela, da ga imamo.
That seems wrong to me, too.	Tudi to se mi zdi narobe.
That doesn't seem right.	To se ne zdi prav.
There are too many people.	Preveč ljudi je.
All the way out.	Vse do ven.
And I hope the next one doesn't either.	In upam, da tudi naslednji ne.
but I don't believe it.	pa ne verjamem.
It can still be done.	Še vedno se da narediti.
It will continue to be so.	Tako bo še naprej.
It's getting better.	Je vse bolje.
Few of us are enough.	Malo nas je dovolj.
I'm sorry for earlier.	Žal mi je za prej.
That's what he thought.	Tako je mislil.
She knew she didn't want that.	Vedela je, da tega ne želi.
If you did, you were fine.	Če si to storil, si bil v redu.
We will do that.	To bomo naredili.
It simply isn't.	Preprosto ni.
It was good to be tired.	Dobro je bilo biti utrujen.
What.	Kaj.
Now I can see everything.	Zdaj lahko vse vidim.
I need this book.	Potrebujem to knjigo.
However, this is certainly not true.	Vendar to zagotovo ni res.
They are there tonight.	Tam so nocoj.
He will get that opportunity tonight.	Nocoj bo dobil to priložnost.
He knew everything and nothing.	Vedel je vse in nič.
It doesn't do any better.	To ne naredi nič bolje.
I know it seems like a lot.	Vem, da se zdi veliko.
However, this cannot be true.	Vendar to ne more biti res.
He didn't go home.	Ni šel domov.
There is no such thing.	Nič takega ni.
He didn't do that either.	Niti tega ni storil.
I want to do something, be someone.	Želim nekaj narediti, biti nekdo.
You will die.	Umrl boš.
We didn't do anything wrong.	Ničesar nismo naredili narobe.
That just isn’t good enough.	To preprosto ni dovolj dobro.
Because it's there.	Ker je tam.
I don't even need to say anything else.	Sploh mi ni treba povedati ničesar drugega.
Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow.	Nihče ne ve, kaj se bo zgodilo jutri.
That was the only way.	To je bil edini način.
I want him to do it.	Želim, da to stori.
Maybe it was.	Morda je bilo.
I know a lot of people.	Poznam veliko ljudi.
He had to know that.	To je moral vedeti.
I think they are.	Mislim, da so.
Actually, no, it's not.	Pravzaprav ne, ni.
We had a great time.	Imeli smo se lepo.
I think he is.	Mislim, da je on.
We have to play with what we have.	Igrati se moramo s tem, kar imamo.
He is so.	On je tako.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
Okay, he told no one.	Dobro, je rekel nikomur.
He will come after me.	Prišel bo za mano.
I would work more.	več bi delal.
You had to do what you did.	Moral si narediti, kar si naredil.
I didn't like to tell you.	Nisem ti rad povedal.
I wish I had come sooner.	Želim si, da bi prišel prej.
You had your chance and you lost it.	Imel si priložnost in si ga izgubil.
He knows he's doing wrong.	Ve, da dela narobe.
He is too.	Tudi on je.
I will have something else.	Imel bom nekaj drugega.
I know this very well.	To zelo dobro vem.
You know you shouldn't be here.	Veš, da ne bi smel biti tukaj.
She likes it here.	Tukaj ji je všeč.
I didn't hear it anymore.	Nisem več slišal.
I'm sure it would.	Prepričan sem, da bi.
But that probably won’t happen anytime soon.	A to se verjetno ne bo zgodilo kmalu.
You're the only one who couldn't.	Ti si edini, ki ni mogel.
That's pretty much it for this week.	To je skoraj vse za ta teden.
That must be good.	To mora biti dobro.
I wanted more.	Hotel sem več.
I will see him.	ga bom videl.
He just didn't have enough time.	Le časa ni imel dovolj.
Maybe someday.	Mogoče bi se, nekoč.
Most likely you will.	Zelo verjetno boste.
Life is simple.	Življenje je preprosto.
He went out to speak to it.	Šel je ven, da bi govoril s tem.
He lost that.	Tega je izgubil.
And no.	In ni.
It's just something.	Samo nekaj je.
Not alone.	Ne sama.
If anything happened, it would happen now.	Če bi se kaj zgodilo, bi se zgodilo zdaj.
However, nothing seemed to help.	Vendar se je zdelo, da nič ne pomaga.
If I did, I would know.	Če bi, bi vedel.
That's not all.	To ni vse.
It was a day for that.	Bil je dan za to.
You just know what's supposed to happen.	Samo veš, kaj naj bi se zgodilo.
I'm glad of that.	Vesel sem tega.
the boy asked.	je vprašal fant.
This is not the case today.	To pa tudi danes ni tako.
It was good enough.	Bilo je dovolj dobro.
I hope you have a nice time here.	Upam, da se boste imeli tukaj lepo.
This is an opportunity.	To je priložnost.
Maybe someone knows more.	Mogoče kdo ve več.
He decided he was going to have to leave.	Odločil se je, da bo moral oditi.
I've never seen it before.	Nikoli prej nisem videl.
Maybe it was a lot or a little.	Morda je bilo veliko ali malo.
But that can't be right.	Vendar to ne more biti prav.
There was no one without work.	Brez dela ni bilo nikogar.
And nothing happened for a long time.	In dolgo se ni nič zgodilo.
That's what she said.	To je rekla.
There are still problems.	Še vedno so težave.
And it can be that way.	In tako je lahko.
I still have it.	Še vedno ga imam.
He was home for so many years.	Toliko let je bilo doma.
He's there.	On je tam.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	O tem noče govoriti.
This is happening.	To se dogaja.
This is something you want to work for.	To je nekaj, za kar si želite delati.
He is tired and not well.	Utrujen je in ni dobro.
And so they saw it.	In tako so to videli.
Not me either.	Tudi mi ne.
Not so much.	Ne tako zelo.
I still haven’t worked with him much.	Še vedno nisem veliko delal z njim.
I've never heard him talk to me like that before.	Še nikoli ga nisem slišal tako govoriti z mano.
What a beautiful afternoon.	Kako lepo popoldne.
I believe that.	To verjamem.
I just don't know that.	Samo tega ne vem.
It's true.	Res je tako.
I feel like a child.	Počutim se kot otrok.
And she will succeed.	In ji bo uspelo.
He really didn't expect that.	Tega res ni pričakoval.
He works for me.	On dela zame.
He told her everything he knew.	Povedal ji je vse, kar je vedel.
Gone, just like that.	Odšel, kar tako.
He's gone.	Ni ga več.
I have to go home.	Moram domov.
I wish I didn't have to be seen.	Želim si, da me ne bi bilo treba videti.
Like there was something wrong with me.	Kot da bi bilo z mano nekaj narobe.
You shouldn't go either.	Tudi ti ne bi smel iti.
For that day.	Za ta dan.
That just isn’t enough time.	To preprosto ni dovolj časa.
No one asked.	Nihče ni vprašal.
But maybe you want to go home.	Morda pa želiš oditi, domov.
It should be done once.	Enkrat bi bilo treba narediti.
Okay, I understand.	V redu, razumem.
He died.	Umrl je.
I had to do everything myself.	Vse sem moral narediti sam.
He said nothing more and he didn’t have to.	Nič več ni rekel in mu ni bilo treba.
I doubt it.	dvomim v to.
Obviously this is not possible now.	Očitno to zdaj ni mogoče.
It was not.	Ni bilo.
They were behind us.	Bili so za nami.
We only have today.	Samo danes imamo.
But it happened.	Vendar se je zgodilo.
I said something.	Nekaj ​​sem rekla.
You have to go out.	Moraš iti ven.
That was never true.	To nikoli ni bilo res.
Quick, right?	Hitro, kajne?
Better me.	Boljši jaz.
There was a lot to see.	Veliko je bilo videti.
I love doing that.	To rad počnem.
I'm yours, you're mine.	Jaz sem tvoj, ti si moj.
Nothing more than that.	Nič več od tega.
He told me that he loved me and that he had gone to work.	Povedal mi je, da me ima rad in da je odšel v službo.
This is something else.	To je nekaj drugega.
I never found it.	Nikoli ga nisem našel.
A good thing is really good.	Dobra stvar je res dobra.
I never expected this to happen.	Nikoli nisem pričakoval, da se bo to zgodilo.
I love them.	Rad jih imam.
Because he's here.	Ker je tukaj.
I don't.	jaz pa ne.
So it has been until this morning.	Tako je bilo do danes zjutraj.
No one told me it would be that way.	Nihče mi ni rekel, da bo tako.
There will never be another.	Nikoli ne bo drugega.
He had to know.	Moral je vedeti.
In fact, I've never seen him talk so much.	Pravzaprav ga še nikoli nisem videl toliko govoriti.
You've never seen anything like me before.	Še nikoli nisi videl nič takega kot jaz.
Where will we be?	Kje bomo.
I had to hurry.	Moral sem hitro.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ne vem, kaj je narobe z mano.
Not much time.	Ni veliko časa.
What are we going to do back.	Kaj bomo storili nazaj.
You already told me that.	To si mi že povedal.
I'm glad he's not in it.	Vesel sem, da ni v tem.
I think that's really it.	Mislim, da je to res to.
I didn't see any of that.	Nič od tega nisem videl.
He wasn't there.	Ni ga bilo tam.
He came ready.	Prišel je pripravljen.
There must be more to it.	Mora biti več na tem.
I would love to hear from you.	rad bi slišal od vas.
He needs me.	Potrebuje me.
But he didn’t do much for me.	Vendar zame ni naredil veliko.
Again, a lot needs to be done.	Še enkrat, veliko je treba narediti.
I do not believe.	Ne verjamem.
I wouldn't come back.	Ne bi se vrnil.
I loved that he was with us.	Všeč mi je bilo, da je bil z nami.
With this book.	S to knjigo.
Maybe too much.	Morda preveč.
We know this is not true.	Vemo, da to ni res.
I think he's human.	Mislim, da je človek.
He knew who was talking.	Vedel je, kdo govori.
I'm glad you came.	Vesel sem, da si prišel.
He decided to move on.	Odločil se je, da gre naprej.
, I do not.	, jaz ne.
If it happened.	Če se je zgodilo.
I wanted him to do anything and everything.	Želel sem, da naredi vse in vse.
It seemed too obvious.	Zdelo se je preveč očitno.
I think everyone should too!.	Mislim, da bi morali tudi vsi!.
I was waiting for the right time and the time is now.	Čakal sem na pravi čas in čas je zdaj.
Say what you think.	Povej kar misliš.
Not a car.	Ne avto.
You've never done that before.	Tega še nikoli niste storili.
Everyone is fine.	Vsi so v redu.
I really wanted to.	Zelo sem si želel.
It wasn't very difficult.	Ni bilo zelo težko.
I understand that sometimes you have to leave.	Razumem, da moraš včasih oditi.
They were really right about that.	Glede tega so imeli res prav.
No, without telling him everything.	Ne, ne da bi mu vse povedal.
He is better than me today.	Danes je boljši od mene.
I was there the next day.	Tam sem bil naslednji dan.
But they are not the only ones.	Niso pa edini.
Now your father.	Zdaj pa tvoj oče.
I used to feel that way every day.	Včasih sem se tako počutil vsak dan.
I actually have.	pravzaprav imam.
You will too.	Tudi ti boš.
I'll try to talk to him tomorrow.	Jutri bom poskušal govoriti z njim.
He will not return.	Ne bo se vrnil.
But she was very good at it.	Vendar je bila v tem zelo dobra.
I was ready to do something.	Bil sem pripravljen nekaj narediti.
If you have something to say, tell me.	Če imaš kaj za povedati, mi to povej.
I doubt there are many people.	Dvomim, da je veliko ljudi.
Maybe, just maybe.	Mogoče, samo morda.
However, this is probably not good enough anymore.	Vendar to verjetno ni več dovolj dobro.
It's pretty simple.	To je precej preprosto.
For a while.	Za čas.
Really, I shouldn't.	Res, ne bi smel.
There was as much as they had to say.	Bilo je toliko, kot so morali povedati.
He doesn't mean to say anything wrong.	Ne misli povedati ničesar narobe.
Everyone could do that.	To bi lahko storili vsi.
That is not enough.	To ni dovolj.
I'm moving fast.	Hitro grem naprej.
This cannot be done.	Tega ni mogoče storiti.
I've never been able to see that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem mogel videti.
And sometimes really.	In včasih tudi res.
It's okay.	V redu je.
You can have it right away if you want it.	Lahko ga imaš takoj, če ga želiš.
No, that was simply not possible.	Ne, to preprosto ni bilo mogoče.
I'm sure you've seen it before.	Prepričan sem, da ste to že videli.
And not like always.	In ne tako kot vedno.
There was nothing else to do.	Nič drugega ni bilo za početi.
Which is pretty simple.	Kar je precej preprosto.
I could see now.	Zdaj sem lahko videl.
Maybe it would be okay.	Mogoče bi bilo v redu.
I wanted to start school on my own.	Želel sem, da bi sam začel šolo.
.	.
v	v
Everyone saw it.	Vsi so to videli.
This has never been a problem for us.	To za nas nikoli ni bil problem.
He is usually very busy.	Običajno je zelo zaposlen.
I’m not good at being alone.	Nisem dober v tem, da sem sam.
Let it be, they will always be with me.	Naj bo, vedno bodo z mano.
That's enough for the question.	To je dovolj za vprašanje.
But.	Na ali.
I hope it will help you !.	Upam, da vam bo v pomoč!.
That's a lot of work.	To je veliko dela.
And this child.	In ta otrok.
You'll have to see.	Boš moral videti.
They did everything right to make it better.	Naredili so vse, kar je prav, da bi bilo bolje.
You haven't seen anything like it before.	Kaj takega še niste videli.
A long time ago.	Dolgo časa nazaj.
I hope you have a good day.	Upam, da ti gre dan dobro.
It feels so right to me.	Zdi se mi tako prav.
I'm sure it wasn't.	Prepričan sem, da ni bilo tako.
I really got it.	Res sem dobil.
As if nothing ever happened.	Kot da se ni nikoli nič zgodilo.
And it often is.	In pogosto je.
I don’t think that would have happened today.	Mislim, da se danes to ne bi zgodilo.
It's good to have him.	Dobro je, da ga ima.
I couldn't go because of the time.	Zaradi časa nisem mogel iti.
That's what she said.	Tako je rekla.
I saw her do that.	Videl sem jo, da to počne.
You are who you are and that's it.	Si to kar si in to je to.
It's really simple.	Res je preprosto.
It will always be you.	To boš vedno ti.
He said he didn't do it.	Rekel je, da tega ni storil.
That's really nice.	To je res lepo.
He needs a job.	Potrebuje delo.
Nobody wants that.	Nihče si tega ne želi.
This is not possible with.	To ni mogoče, z.
He wanted them to.	Želel je, da bi.
We should not do that.	Tega ne bi smeli storiti.
I knew it would.	Vedel sem, da bo.
I really didn't make it.	Res mi ni uspelo.
I wish you knew that.	Želim si, da bi to vedeli.
I wish I had a little more than it was there.	Želel bi si malo več, kot je bilo tam.
I see a problem.	Vidim problem.
You just never know.	Samo nikoli ne veš.
You helped me.	Pomagal si mi.
I have it together here.	Tukaj imam skupaj.
It only exists here.	Obstaja samo tukaj.
Or from here.	Ali od tukaj.
She knew she couldn't.	Vedela je, da ne more.
I could talk to him.	Lahko bi govoril z njim.
Unfortunately, this is not true.	Žal to ni res.
He will never return.	Nikoli se ne bo vrnil.
I saw them, but not today.	Videl sem jih, a ne danes.
He's just a.	On je samo a.
I know you wanted to help.	Vem, da si hotel pomagati.
There were too many people.	Preveč ljudi je bilo.
The man was surprised.	Človek je bil presenečen.
And he won't.	In ne bo ga.
It is not possible to do so.	Ni mogoče, da bi to naredili tako.
I was glad he never found it.	Vesel sem bil, da ga nikoli ni našel.
It's not about that.	Ne gre za to.
We were fine.	Bili smo v redu.
Much, much more.	Še veliko, veliko več.
However, not everything is so simple.	Vendar vse ni tako preprosto.
You'll probably be fine.	Verjetno boš v redu.
No matter who.	Ne glede na to, kdo.
He waited for her to come out.	Čakal je, da pride ven.
So so.	Tako tako.
He seemed surprised by this.	Videti je bil presenečen nad tem.
That's not it either.	Tudi to ni to.
You will need it.	Potreboval ga boš.
She was alone in the room.	Bila je sama v sobi.
He realized what he had done.	Spoznal je, kaj je storil.
And it wasn't because of me.	In to ni bilo zaradi mene.
I would have died without it.	Brez tega bi umrl.
He's really happy there.	Tam je res vesel.
Sometimes it's okay.	Včasih je v redu.
So would we if I didn’t.	Tudi mi bi, če ne bi.
And you weren't there this morning.	In danes zjutraj te še vedno ni bilo.
But obviously that was not the case.	A očitno ni bilo tako.
And we are sure it will.	In prepričani smo, da bo.
He.	On.
I'm so tired.	Tako sem utrujen.
There are many of them.	Ki jih je veliko.
That's how it feels.	Tako se počuti.
It's been a long time.	To je dolgo časa.
I don't like it here anymore.	Tukaj mi ni več všeč.
And they were probably right.	In verjetno so imeli prav.
So we were broke.	Tako smo bili brez denarja.
He wanted to do it himself.	To je hotel narediti sam.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
That is to this day.	Se pravi do danes.
That's what I want.	To si želim.
I never was and never will be.	Nikoli nisem bil in nikoli ne bom.
You were right.	Imel si prav.
So many kids here.	Toliko otrok tukaj.
I feel better.	Jaz se počutim bolje.
That's why it's there.	Zato je tam.
I shouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi smel početi.
I didn’t do anything other than I wanted to.	Nisem naredil nič drugega kot sem hotel.
He died.	Umrl je.
I can't help you.	Ne morem ti pomagati.
I've already made up my mind.	Odločil sem se že.
That's life.	Tako je življenje.
Therefore,.	Zato, .
The reason is too many people.	Razlog je preveč ljudi.
But I couldn't.	Nisem pa mogel.
That's fine.	To je v redu.
It didn't just happen.	Ni se zgodilo kar tako.
Do something.	Delati nekaj.
We know that for sure.	To vemo zagotovo.
Or maybe it’s just not for you.	Ali pa morda preprosto ni za vas.
I was my own man.	Bil sem svoj človek.
She knew what she wanted to say.	Vedela je, kaj želi povedati.
Wrong again!	Spet narobe!
I believe it is wrong.	Verjamem, da je narobe.
Let them be better.	Naj bodo boljši.
He's at it again.	Spet je pri tem.
And stayed.	In ostal.
I've already done that.	To sem že naredil.
And it was hard for her.	In težko ji je bilo.
That can't be right.	To ne more biti prav.
It wasn't hard for him.	Ni mu bilo težko.
How much is that?	Koliko je to?
Maybe you are.	Mogoče si.
Okay, that's who.	Prav, to je kdo.
Does he even know about.	Ali sploh ve za.
Never, never see.	Nikoli, nikoli videti.
It really is very simple.	Res je zelo preprosto.
The question is how to do it.	Vprašanje je, kako to narediti.
That's not an option.	To ni možnost.
I just asked.	sem samo vprašal.
I see.	vidim.
He said it takes a long time.	Rekel je, da potrebuje veliko časa.
And he never had.	In nikoli ni imel.
But there seemed to be something wrong with him.	A zdelo se je, da je nekaj narobe z njim.
So far he wasn't sure.	Do zdaj ni bil prepričan.
For the first time, he was simply lucky.	Prvič je imel preprosto srečo.
I didn't start like that, you know.	Nisem začel tako, veš.
You think.	Misliš.
He wanted her not to do it.	Želel je, da tega ne bi storila.
No, we didn't.	Ne, nismo.
That didn't happen.	To se ni zgodilo.
We knew better.	Vedeli smo bolje.
Neither will we.	Tudi mi ne bomo.
That's not right.	To ni prav.
We didn't like that.	To nam ni bilo všeč.
Sometimes you just have to.	Včasih je preprosto treba.
I know it can't be easy.	Vem, da ne more biti lahko.
That is so true.	To je tako res.
You were a real friend.	Bil si pravi prijatelj.
i will never know.	nikoli ne bom vedel.
I know enough.	vem dovolj.
And so we are here.	In tako smo tukaj.
He didn't expect that.	Tega ni pričakoval.
This is me.	To sem jaz.
He did it because he could.	To je storil, ker je lahko.
He can't do anything.	Ničesar ne more storiti.
I said he died.	Rekel sem, da je umrl.
I'm really afraid not.	Res se bojim, da ne.
I was good to you.	bil sem dober do tebe.
Anything and everything was still possible.	Vse in vse je bilo še vedno mogoče.
He hardly has time to see them.	Skoraj nima časa, da bi jih videl.
I have my life and that is more than enough.	Imam svoje življenje in to je več kot dovolj.
It was a very good day.	Bil je zelo dober dan.
She said she was not interested.	Rekla je, da je ne zanima.
Very very.	Zelo zelo.
I still want it.	Še vedno si ga želim.
This looks like a good opportunity.	To je videti kot dobra priložnost.
It's very simple.	To je zelo preprosto.
It was entirely possible.	Bilo je popolnoma mogoče.
Tell yourself.	Povej si.
He just loved to play.	Preprosto se je rad igral.
Nothing is happening.	Nič se ne dogaja.
He couldn't help himself.	Ni si mogel pomagati.
I'll just leave it there.	To bom kar pustil tam.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
They are something else.	So nekaj drugega.
So I asked.	Zato sem vprašal.
Money speaks.	Denar govori.
Really very busy.	Res zelo zaposlen.
You were helpful.	Bili ste v pomoč.
I wouldn't find help there.	Tam ne bi našel pomoči.
This is already happening.	To se že dogaja.
You're so right.	Toliko imaš prav.
It seemed to be getting better.	Zdelo se je, da gre na bolje.
He had me.	Imel me je.
I won't.	Ne bom pa.
It's a really good thing, really, really good.	To je res dobra stvar, res, res dobra.
At this he asked himself.	Ob tem se je vprašal.
This is not going to happen.	To se ne bo zgodilo.
He talks about everything.	Govori o vsem.
Something in me.	Nekaj ​​v meni.
He was gone now.	Zdaj ga ni bilo več.
But today is not easy.	A danes ni lahko.
I think it was.	Mislim, da je bilo.
I've seen that a lot.	To sem veliko videl.
Many people have children.	Veliko ljudi ima otroke.
I can’t believe no one is going to help.	Ne morem verjeti, da nihče ne bo pomagal.
And he was a good friend.	In bil je dober prijatelj.
I don't want anything.	nič ne želim.
He decided not to call her back.	Odločil se je, da je ne bo poklical nazaj.
That's my father.	To je moj oče.
Tell her.	Povej ji.
I've ever bought you that much.	Toliko sem ti že kdaj kupil.
You wanted me.	Želel si me.
I won't tell you.	Ne bom ti povedal.
Maybe you saw you.	Morda ste te videli.
It was just a problem.	Bil je samo problem.
He probably wouldn’t have made it anyway.	Verjetno mu tako ali tako ne bi uspelo.
I think it is.	Mislim, da je.
I waited there all the time.	Ves čas sem čakal tam.
But you won't see that.	Tega pa ne boste videli.
It's actually very simple.	Pravzaprav je zelo preprosto.
He could be a teacher.	Lahko bi bil učitelj.
It's better without it.	Bolje je brez tega.
I'm thinking of you.	Mislim na vas.
That you are .	Da si .
Is it or nothing.	Je to ali nič.
It will happen.	Zgodilo se bo.
I'm my own man now.	Zdaj sem sam svoj človek.
He looked tired.	Videti je bil utrujen.
I should just say that.	To bi moral samo povedati.
Both.	Oba.
I will not.	ne bom.
He's been here a long time.	Dolgo je bil tukaj.
There was enough time for me to leave.	Bilo je dovolj časa, da sem odšel.
I'm sure I'm a good friend.	Prepričan sem, da sem dober prijatelj.
He won't be home.	Ne bo ga doma.
Someone needs to know.	Nekdo mora vedeti.
Too much to do.	Preveč za narediti.
And you won.	In zmagal si.
And nobody does anything about it.	In nihče nič ne naredi glede tega.
That's very good.	To je zelo dobro.
Lots more money.	Veliko več denarja.
None of this is a problem.	Nič od tega ni problem.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
It can't be anymore.	Več ne more biti.
It would be a better time.	Bi bil boljši čas.
I never did.	Nikoli nisem.
And it was like that early on.	In tako je bilo že zgodaj.
No one could really help me with that.	Nihče mi res ni mogel pomagati pri tem.
I am very sorry about that.	Zelo mi je žal za to.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
I told her everything.	Vse sem ji povedal.
Maybe not for a long time.	Mogoče ne za dolgo časa.
Because it's true.	Ker je res.
Nothing to eat.	Nič za jesti.
It can help here.	Tukaj lahko pomaga.
Probably not.	Verjetno ne.
I will do this every day.	To bom počel vsak dan.
So far, however, this has never happened.	Do zdaj pa se to še nikoli ni zgodilo.
Over and over and over.	Še in še in naprej.
I had to leave immediately.	Takoj sem moral oditi.
I would do more.	Naredil bi več.
He was just sitting there.	Samo sedel je tam.
I just wasn’t ready.	Preprosto nisem bil pripravljen.
We have work to do.	Imamo delo.
Sometimes it helps a little.	Včasih malo pomaga.
I don't know what will happen.	Ne vem, kaj se bo zgodilo.
You don't have to work anymore.	Ni ti treba več delati.
I was there, you know.	Bil sem tam, veš.
Nobody.	Nihče ne.
But we can no longer be sure.	Vendar ne moremo biti več prepričani.
It's still easy.	Še vedno je lahko.
I didn't hear that.	Tega nisem slišal.
It works for both of us.	Dela za oba.
I've been.	Bil sem.
I didn't want to leave.	Nisem hotel oditi.
How did he have to know?	Kako je moral vedeti?
You have to be good at this.	V tem moraš biti dober.
This is already happening.	To se že dogaja.
You said you were sure.	Rekel si, da si prepričan.
I did something wrong.	Naredil sem nekaj narobe.
She was gone for so many years.	Toliko let je ni bilo več.
He says he will, but not tomorrow.	Pravi, da to stori, vendar ne jutri.
really? 	res?
Everything would be fine.	Vse bi bilo v redu.
I knew he was right.	Vedel sem, da ima prav.
He couldn't leave.	Ni mogel oditi.
That would be a lot.	To bi bilo zelo veliko.
They have been doing this for a very long time.	Pri tem so že zelo dolgo.
This would be nice.	To bi bilo lepo.
I didn't find anything.	Nič nisem našel.
He knew immediately that he was home.	Takoj je vedel, da je doma.
I tried, you know.	Poskušal sem, veš.
No, no, it won't.	Ne, ne, ne bo.
For the first time without children.	Prvič brez otrok.
So simple things are.	Tako preprosto stvari so.
Or maybe not for you.	Ali pa morda ne zate.
He didn't say that.	Tega ni rekel.
None of us can.	Nihče od nas ne more.
Only no one knew when that would happen.	Le da nihče ni vedel, kdaj se bo to zgodilo.
not to me.	meni ne.
They are not and never will be.	Niso in nikoli ne bodo.
I just needed you to know.	Potreboval sem samo, da veš.
They were all here.	Vsi so bili tukaj.
It will be difficult for him to move on now.	Zdaj mu bo težko iti naprej.
I will learn to be good.	Naučil se bom biti dober.
It used to be nice here.	Nekoč je bilo tukaj lepo.
Again, they were clearly right.	Spet so imeli očitno prav.
There is a lot to know.	Veliko je treba vedeti.
He did it.	On je to storil.
She did it.	To je storila.
I had both.	Imel sem oba.
Not alone, that is.	Ne sami, to je.
Maybe she'd be better off without him.	Mogoče bi ji bilo bolje brez njega.
Whether you like it or not.	Ali ti bo všeč ali pa ne.
You think it's a game.	Misliš, da je to igra.
I can't do that.	Tega ne morem storiti.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
I didn't ask for that.	Tega nisem prosil.
Now he doesn't even want to play.	Zdaj sploh noče igrati.
There wasn't much of that.	Ni bilo veliko tega.
If they ever were.	Če so kdaj bili.
He didn't seem to want to talk about it.	Videti je bilo, da o tem ni hotel govoriti.
The work seemed simple enough.	Delo se je zdelo dovolj preprosto.
That wasn't so good.	To ni bilo tako dobro.
And saw what he expected.	In videl, kaj je pričakoval.
This is my job.	To je moje delo.
I would like to say something.	Nekaj ​​bi rad povedal.
Maybe you could.	Mogoče bi lahko.
So he left early in the morning.	Zato je odšel zgodaj zjutraj.
He doesn't have time either.	Tudi časa nima.
I didn't say where.	Nisem rekel kam.
You've been here before, haven't you?	Ste že bili tukaj, kajne?
Just started.	Pravkar začel.
You never came back to me.	Nikoli se mi nisi vrnil.
Now to work.	Zdaj pa na delo.
Please not him, please not him.	Prosim, ne njega, prosim ne njega.
And yet no one wanted to know.	Pa vendar nihče ni hotel vedeti.
Not now.	Zdaj pa ne.
He loves being in his room.	Rad je v svoji sobi.
He needs to know.	Mora vedeti.
How she knew, she didn't know.	Kako je vedela, ni vedela.
Here it is now.	Tukaj je zdaj.
I think it's this one.	Mislim, da je ta.
He never returned it.	Nikoli ga ni vrnil.
Please tell me now.	Prosim povej mi zdaj.
You know there is a very good reason for this.	Veste, da za to obstaja zelo dober razlog.
It felt like he was home again.	Zdelo se mi je, kot da je spet doma.
You have to work too.	Tudi ti moraš delati.
He looked angry.	Videti je bil jezen.
I don't want to do that.	Tega nočem storiti.
And they would be right, there weren’t many of them.	In prav bi imeli, ni jih bilo veliko.
So he did.	Tako je naredil.
Again, what they are and not what they are not.	Še enkrat, kaj so in ne kaj niso.
Today it is so.	Danes je tako.
None of us had.	Nihče od nas ni imel.
Like my friend.	Kot moj prijatelj.
And so on.	In tako naprej.
There must be more of that.	Tega mora biti več.
All or nothing, he said.	Vse ali nič, je rekel.
Someone should tell you in front of me.	Nekdo bi ti moral povedati pred mano.
He didn't want to come here.	Ni hotel priti sem.
He saw what happened.	Videl je, kaj se je zgodilo.
I'm sorry.	Žal mi je.
Don't tell her.	Ne povej ji.
Why? 	Zakaj?
That’s really good to see.	To je res dobro videti.
He was there.	Tam je bil.
Maybe he loves you very much.	Mogoče te ima zelo rad.
Or still.	Ali pa še vedno.
Please tell me.	Prosim povej mi.
You were sure, very sure.	Prepričan si bil, zelo prepričan.
That would be difficult.	To bi bilo težko.
Nor are they.	Niti niso.
A little too ready.	Malo preveč pripravljen.
I had to do something right.	Moral sem nekaj narediti prav.
This is you.	To si ti.
He decided not to come back.	Odločil se je, da se ne bo vrnil.
No, it just goes out.	Ne, to preprosto gre ven.
They've been there before.	Tam so že bili.
The next day.	Naslednji dan.
You are too.	Ti si tudi.
What to do now ?.	Kaj zdaj narediti?.
What would he.	Kaj bi on.
I couldn't reach him.	Nisem mogel priti do njega.
I tried.	Poskušal sem.
It comes to that.	Do tega pride.
It's all over now.	Zdaj je vse.
And he didn't want to come.	In ni hotel priti.
That's all.	To je vse.
I have a lot of things.	Imam veliko stvari.
But he is lucky.	Vendar ima srečo.
I don't know when, how or why.	Ne vem kdaj, kako ali zakaj.
That he wanted her.	Da si jo je želel.
I liked it.	Všeč mi je bilo.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
It can't be true.	Ne more biti res.
I didn't know if you were coming.	Nisem vedel, če boš prišel.
And we have work to do.	In imamo dela.
If I could have that day back.	Če bi lahko imel ta dan nazaj.
How nice!	Kako lepo!
If possible.	Če je mogoče.
No one will ever know.	Tega nihče ne bo nikoli vedel.
I know he's right.	Vem, da ima prav.
It’s hard to do everything.	Težko je narediti vse.
There are few of them, actually.	Malo jih je pravzaprav.
He asked where they were.	Vprašal je, kje so.
I wasn’t ready for that.	Nisem bil pripravljen na to.
He tried, but didn't know how to help us.	Poskušal, a ni vedel, kako bi nam pomagal.
They shouldn't be.	Ne bi smeli biti.
That's the reason.	To je razlog.
He's not there.	Ni ga tam.
He became angry.	Postal je jezen.
This is not very common.	To ni zelo pogosto.
I also know he needs you.	Vem tudi, da te potrebuje.
There is little else to do.	Malo je drugega za narediti.
But she knew what he was going to say.	Vedela pa je, kaj bo rekel.
It was not.	Ni bilo.
He has a lot of money	Ima veliko denarja
But this is not the case with us again.	A pri nas spet ni tako.
It won't be long for me.	Zame ne bo dolgo.
It was the only opportunity we had.	To je bila edina priložnost, ki smo jo imeli.
Long ahead of you.	Dolgo pred tabo.
He went out immediately.	Takoj je šel ven.
Nothing was necessary.	Nič ni bilo treba.
It's a game.	To je igra.
And maybe they are.	In morda so.
You're more human than you know.	Ti si bolj človek, kot veš.
Apparently it was not so.	Očitno ni bilo tako.
It hasn't been in three years.	Ni je bilo že tri leta.
Maybe there is a way.	Mogoče obstaja način.
Maybe it was.	Mogoče pa je bilo.
It will be fine now.	Zdaj bo v redu.
Because he never asked them.	Ker jih nikoli ni vprašal.
No one has ever spoken or can speak like him.	Nihče ni nikoli govoril ali ne more govoriti tako kot on.
I asked for help.	Prosil sem za pomoč.
I just wanted to make sure.	Hotel sem se samo prepričati.
I'm interested to see more.	Zanima me, da vidim več.
Forever and ever.	Za vedno in vedno.
And that seems to be it.	In zdi se, da je to to.
What did you say?	Kaj si rekel?
But I am.	Jaz pa sem.
I don’t know how that happened.	Ne vem, kako se je to zgodilo.
This one for luck.	Ta za srečo.
You can't go on like this.	Ne moreš tako naprej.
It's just not me.	Samo nisem jaz.
Help! 	Na pomoč!
help! 	pomoč!
let someone help us!	naj nam kdo pomaga!
It often does.	Pogosto se.
He came to get me.	Prišel je po mene.
I was never the one to sit down.	Nikoli nisem bil tisti, ki bi sedel.
She knew he wanted her too.	Vedela je, da si jo želi tudi on.
I told her she didn’t have to do anything.	Rekel sem ji, da ji ni treba storiti ničesar.
He seems to be over it.	Zdi se, da je nad tem.
They were above him.	Bili so nad njim.
I will help her.	jaz ji bom pomagal.
If you don't want to do that.	Če tega ne želite storiti.
When we have to.	Ko moramo.
I would definitely come back.	Zagotovo bi se vrnil.
He said he wanted to buy it.	Rekel je, da ga želi kupiti.
I came back every day.	Vrnil sem se vsak dan.
I want to know.	Želim vedeti.
What he did wrong, however, was obvious.	Kaj je naredil narobe, pa je bilo očitno.
I'm not sure what they will be.	Nisem prepričan, kaj bodo.
I'll tell you.	Povedal ti bom.
The way things are.	Način stvari.
When did this happen?	Kdaj se je to zgodilo?
She didn't know what else to do.	Ni vedela, kaj naj še naredi.
I don't want to be there.	Nočem biti tam.
Nobody comes.	Nihče ne pride.
And no one can tell you where.	In nihče vam ne more povedati, kje.
But he hasn't been home for a long time.	A že dolgo ga ni bilo doma.
But they were there for more than just that.	Vendar so bili tam za več kot le to.
I will definitely be back for a lot more of this.	Zagotovo se bom vrnil po veliko več tega.
I can not do it anymore.	Ne morem več.
I'm going with you, he said.	Grem s tabo, je rekel.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
He succeeded.	Uspelo mu je.
A man who has no money does not do this.	Človek, ki je brez denarja, tega ne počne.
Nothing has been the same since then.	Od takrat ni nič več tako, kot je bilo.
They were still there.	Še vedno so bili tam.
He didn't know what.	Ni vedel kaj.
I don't want him.	Nočem ga.
That's right.	Ta tam.
I still couldn’t believe this was happening.	Še vedno nisem mogel verjeti, da se to dogaja.
There was no one else.	Ni bilo nikogar drugega.
If you really want to do it yourself.	Če si res želite narediti sami.
It's just me here.	Tukaj sem samo jaz.
You saw what happened the other day.	Videli ste, kaj se je zgodilo prejšnji dan.
It happened.	Zgodilo se je.
More than surprised.	Več kot presenečen.
All of that is gone.	Vsega tega ni več.
Unfortunately, this is not what we have.	To žal ni tisto, kar imamo.
Which is fine for me.	Kar je zame v redu.
But he wasn't so sure.	Vendar ni bil tako prepričan.
She knew her father would not come.	Vedela je, da oče ne bo prišel.
He's not going to work.	Ne gre v službo.
But I'm serious.	Mislim pa resno.
It was much more than that.	Bilo je precej več kot to.
When you know, you will know.	Ko boš vedel, boš vedel.
I looked like a child.	Videti sem bil kot otrok.
I liked her.	Všeč mi je bila.
He had a house.	Imel je hišo.
I learned a lot too.	Tudi jaz sem se veliko naučil.
Never.	Nikoli ne.
Does not exist.	Ne obstaja.
I mean, we are.	Mislim, smo.
You also .	Ti tudi .
Keep it simple.	Naj bo preprosto.
He knows something.	On nekaj ve.
I think they did it their way.	Mislim, da so naredili na svoj način.
You will be here with us.	Tukaj boš z nami.
I'm not that good at it.	V tem nisem tako dober.
That's wrong.	To je narobe.
Tell me something else.	Povej mi še kaj.
I won't be there.	ne bom tam.
And maybe they will.	In morda bodo.
That won't happen.	To se ne bo zgodilo.
Maybe you like it back.	Mogoče ti je všeč nazaj.
And she still did.	In še vedno je to storila.
And a week after that.	In teden po tem.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
He had nothing to say to her.	Ni ji imel kaj povedati.
It would seem so.	Zdelo bi se tako.
In.	In.
It happened.	Zgodilo se je.
I'm not the only one who thinks so.	Ne mislim samo jaz tako.
It just feels good.	Preprosto se počuti dobro.
I will not say.	ne bom rekel.
But it is enough.	Vendar je dovolj.
No one can tell you when either.	Tudi kdaj vam nihče ne more povedati.
Where did you go?	Kam si šel?
Everyone liked it.	Vsem je bil všeč.
Actually, that's not true.	Pravzaprav pa to ni res.
There is something you should know.	Nekaj ​​bi morali vedeti.
I wonder if he's ever been here.	Sprašujem se, če je bil kdaj tukaj.
It's simple.	To je preprosto.
I thought it was something like that.	Mislil sem, da je nekaj takega.
Play here.	Igra tukaj.
I know it probably wasn't right.	Vem, da verjetno ni bilo prav.
I completely understand.	popolnoma razumem.
So it is here.	Tako je tudi tukaj.
Nothing about being human.	Nič o biti človek.
She wasn't alone, she said.	Ni bila sama, je rekla.
She really had to go.	Res je morala iti.
He did such a good job.	Opravil je tako dobro delo.
And maybe she did.	In morda je to storila.
i would do that.	jaz bi to naredil.
Nothing like that happened.	Nič takega se ni zgodilo.
It seems like a lot to me.	Zdi se mi veliko.
Which is.	Ki je.
But you should see me.	Vendar bi me moral videti.
And you have to be.	In to moraš biti.
That's quite likely.	To je precej verjetno.
And he was there again.	In spet je bil tam.
Someone was waiting for her.	Nekdo jo je čakal.
I haven't seen much.	Nisem videl veliko.
You know, like mine.	Veš, kot moj.
I knew something was wrong.	Vedel sem, da nekaj ni v redu.
I know because it happened to me.	Vem, ker se je zgodilo meni.
Probably not so good.	Verjetno ne tako dobro.
Just be.	Preprosto biti.
How many aren't there.	Koliko jih ni.
And that's exactly what they did.	In prav to so storili.
It must be your problem.	Tvoj mora biti problem.
not now.	zdaj ne.
I've known him for a long time.	Poznam ga že dolgo.
It's hard to know.	Težko je vedeti.
She didn't even need to know.	Niti ji ni bilo treba vedeti.
I saw her.	Videl sem jo.
That's right.	Tako je.
It's not like you mean anything by that.	Ni tako, kot da bi s tem kaj mislil.
No, not you.	Ne, ne ti.
If not, who knows.	Če ne, kdo ve.
We had such a nice time.	Imeli smo se tako lepo.
This is true.	To je res.
He will not lose.	Ne bo izgubil.
That's the way.	To je način.
Sometimes it wasn't like that.	Včasih ni bilo tako.
He was very busy.	Bil je zelo zaposlen.
I want to do what is right.	Želim narediti, kar je prav.
I met him too.	Tudi jaz sem ga srečal.
But you're right.	Imaš pa prav.
Who and more.	Kdo in še več.
This is not a job for children, she told no one.	To ni delo za otroke, je rekla nikomur.
It happens every week.	Dogaja se vsak teden.
I haven't met her yet.	Jaz jo še nisem spoznal.
Not too many.	Preveč jih ne.
I don't regret it.	Ni mi žal za to.
None of that.	Nič od tega.
And perhaps the only one at that.	In morda edina pri tem.
Just like us.	Tako kot mi.
The question is when.	Vprašanje je, kdaj.
At home.	Doma.
This has been going on for quite some time.	To se dogaja že kar nekaj časa.
But they did nothing about it.	A s tem niso naredili ničesar.
I could call for help.	Lahko bi poklical na pomoč.
She was not what she wanted to be.	Ni bila to, kar je želela biti.
I know what I would do.	Vem, kaj bi naredil.
You have to stay.	Moraš ostati.
He decided not to ask.	Odločil se je, da ne bo vprašal.
It's not enough.	Ni dovolj.
And that will be it.	In to bo to.
I liked that.	To mi je bilo všeč.
I hope that's not the case.	Upam, da ni tako.
If it were normal.	Če bi bilo običajno.
That person was me.	Ta oseba sem bil jaz.
I have a few right now.	Trenutno jih imam nekaj.
Can you please help me with this.	Mi lahko prosim kdo pomaga pri tem.
I have nothing for you.	Nimam nič zate.
It's been a long time.	To je dolgo časa.
They saw him a lot.	Videli so ga veliko.
This can be seen as follows.	To je mogoče videti na naslednji način.
Also not.	Prav tako ne.
Where have you been? 	Kje si bil?
That they were already there.	Da so že bili tam.
This obviously failed.	To očitno ni uspelo.
That did not happen.	Tako se ni zgodilo.
I like you, boy.	Všeč si mi, fant.
It will be here for a long time.	Tukaj bo še dolgo časa.
That wasn’t enough for me, ever.	To mi ni bilo dovolj, nikoli.
You had a nice time.	Imel si se lepo.
It's back again.	Spet je nazaj.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.	Žal je, kar je.
How to 'get'.	Kako 'priti'.
We'll see about that.	Bomo videli o tem.
I knew that.	Vedel sem to.
I have no one else to help me.	Nimam nikogar drugega, ki bi mi pomagal.
Also.	In tudi.
This does not seem to be the case.	Zdi se, da temu ni tako.
I believe you will.	Verjamem, da boš.
That we had to go.	Da smo morali iti.
not to me.	meni ne.
He let her go, she knew that.	Pustil ji je, to je vedela.
I see this happening more and more.	Vidim, da se to dogaja vedno bolj.
Or even better.	Ali še bolje.
It's a bit like having him back for a while.	Malo je tako, kot bi ga imel nazaj za nekaj časa.
And one more time.	In še enkrat.
I don’t know how this is going to happen.	Ne vem, kako se bo to zgodilo.
I do not know.	Ne vem.
Like any child.	Kot vsak otrok.
It has to be more than that.	Mora biti več kot to.
You, boy.	Ti, fant.
This would be nice.	To bi bilo lepo.
But even if it were true.	A tudi če bi bilo res.
And it was small.	In bilo je malo.
He seemed to be right about that, too.	Zdelo se je, da ima tudi glede tega prav.
And now he has it.	In zdaj ga ima.
But maybe he won.	Morda pa je zmagal.
If they had them.	Če so jih imeli.
I went back to school today.	Danes sem šel nazaj v šolo.
You will call them here.	Poklical jih boš sem.
We were together all this time.	Ves ta čas sva bila skupaj.
But I really don't understand why.	Res pa ne razumem zakaj.
You gotta get out of there, man.	Moraš oditi od tam, človek.
And that may be right.	In to je morda prav.
It's just us.	To smo samo mi.
I really don’t think of it that way.	Res ne mislim na to tako.
He got nothing.	Nič ni dobil.
You did that.	To si naredil.
You're too good a guy not to.	Preveč si dober fant, da ne bi.
I don't feel well anymore.	Ne počutim se več dobro.
I wish I could come back again.	Želim si, da bi se spet vrnil.
I have to eat.	moram jesti.
Do it better if you can.	Naredi to bolje, če lahko.
Not for the first time.	Ne prvič.
And he just didn't come back.	In kar tako se ni več vrnil.
V	V
He knew she didn't have to do that.	Vedel je, da ji tega ni treba storiti.
I see this with so many today.	To vidim pri toliko danes.
He did nothing.	Nič ni storil.
It should be.	Moral bi biti.
I'm sure many of you have been there before.	Prepričan sem, da vas je veliko že bilo tam.
We all know that now.	To zdaj vemo vsi.
It is what it is.	Je kar je.
He was surprised to see him.	Bil je presenečen, ko ga je videl.
The day before he was fine.	Dan prej je bil v redu.
I would never have thought that would happen.	Nikoli si ne bi mislil, da se bo to zgodilo.
We had a good day.	Imeli smo dober dan.
Everyone is here!	Vsi so tukaj!
But that was not enough.	A tega je bilo malo.
Is anyone there?	Je kdo tam?
It still is.	Še vedno je.
I don't mean that.	ne mislim tega.
I want to know what will happen next.	Želim vedeti, kaj se bo zgodilo naprej.
Do it right.	Naredi prav.
I know because it happened to me.	Vem, ker se mi je to zgodilo.
That was really about it.	To je bilo res o tem.
It won't.	Ne bo.
You can't do that.	S tem ne moreš.
Where did he go.	Kam je šel.
No one spoke.	Nihče ni govoril.
I'll go alone.	Sam bom šel.
He was mine.	Bil je moj.
In fact, he always had one.	Pravzaprav ga je vedno imel.
Because someone has to.	Ker nekdo mora.
We did it.	Uspelo nam je.
He, too, saw that this had happened and did nothing.	Tudi on je videl, da se je to zgodilo in ni storil ničesar.
First time.	Prvič.
He is very busy and has no time for this.	Zelo je zaposlen in nima časa za to.
I could talk from there.	Od tam bi lahko govoril.
I just need to know what it is.	Samo vedeti moram, kaj je.
I wonder when he will return home.	Sprašujem se, kdaj se bo vrnil domov.
He was just now.	Bil je samo zdaj.
He would do all the work.	On bi opravil vse delo.
He wasn't sure how to proceed.	Ni bil prepričan, kako naprej.
So we have to go.	Zato moramo oditi.
Time is money.	Čas je denar.
And not just for me.	Pa ne samo zame.
It seems pretty obvious to me.	Zdi se mi precej očitno.
He never does that.	Nikoli ne počne tega.
I know that's a bit much.	Vem, da je to malo.
I think the simpler it is, the better.	Mislim, da bolj preprosto kot je, bolje bi bilo.
He seemed to want to help her.	Zdelo se je, da ji želi pomagati.
I mean, he's a friend too.	Mislim, tudi prijatelj je.
Time to eat.	Čas jesti.
I don't know anything about it.	Nič ne vem o tem.
This has always been a problem for me.	Zame je bil to vedno problem.
My child she said.	Moj otrok je rekla.
He heard nothing.	Nič ni slišal.
We are lucky to be alive.	Imamo srečo, da smo živi.
I don't think they still are.	Mislim, da še vedno niso.
I gave her money.	Dal sem ji denar.
I think she needs to be told what's going on.	Mislim, da ji je treba povedati, kaj se dogaja.
I mean, good.	Mislim, dobra.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Nič, nič, nič.
I want you now.	Želim te zdaj.
This is very hard work.	To je zelo težko delo.
They didn't have time.	Niso imeli časa.
I was convinced of that.	Bil sem prepričan v to.
It's like everything.	Tako je kot vse.
I'm fine with that.	v redu sem s tem.
They will have to go.	Morali bodo iti.
It has often happened to me to do this.	Pogosto se mi je zgodilo, da to storim.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
It was more than that.	Bilo je več kot to.
This may help if anyone needs it.	To lahko pomaga, če kdo potrebuje.
She didn't do anything like that.	Nič takega ni storila.
Why do you think this happened?	Zakaj mislite, da se je to zgodilo?
I know this is not good.	Vem, da to ni dobro.
It probably is.	Verjetno je.
Can anyone help me with this.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga pri tem.
We don't know how.	Ne vemo kako.
It's all or nothing.	Je vse ali nič.
It can't be.	Ne more biti.
Because it is not.	Ker ni.
Maybe that's what it's about.	Morda gre za to.
I thought there must be something ‘wrong’ with me.	Mislil sem, da mora biti z mano nekaj 'narobe'.
And so should you.	In tudi ti bi moral biti.
Now it has to be what it is.	Zdaj mora biti to, kar je.
It was never true.	Nikoli ni bilo res.
I'm out of place.	Nisem na mestu.
That seems unlikely to me.	To se mi zdi malo verjetno.
Are you good.	Ali si dober.
He didn't think of anything else.	Nič drugega ni mislil.
Will you be here next week?	Boš tukaj naslednji teden?
I knew he was having trouble.	Vedel sem, da ima težave.
I didn't go out like that.	Nisem tako odšel ven.
He still has some work to do.	Ima še nekaj dela.
That's not my problem.	To ni moj problem.
I have a question.	Imam vprašanje.
You can too.	Lahko tudi ti.
I thought maybe it was yours.	Mislil sem, da je morda tvoj.
I'll be there and.	Jaz bom tam in.
This goes on and on.	To gre naprej in naprej.
He's definitely gone now.	Zdaj ga zagotovo ni več.
But something more than that is happening.	Vendar se dogaja nekaj več kot to.
I have to go to work.	Moram v službo.
He was so surprised he couldn't speak.	Bil je tako presenečen, da ni mogel govoriti.
Let him do what he has to do.	Naj naredi, kar mora.
This one went much better.	Ta je šel veliko bolje.
She had to see for herself.	V to se je morala prepričati sama.
All of that was fine with me.	Vse to mi je bilo v redu.
He gave her something back.	Nekaj ​​ji je vrnil.
He didn't have much else to do.	Ni mu bilo veliko drugega za početi.
It was hard to know what it was all about.	Težko je bilo vedeti, za kaj gre.
You have to go out.	Moraš iti ven.
There will be few.	Malo jih bo.
He loved to do that.	To je rad počel.
I have a lot of work.	Imam veliko dela.
I was in the room.	Bil sem v sobi.
It's just gone.	Pravkar ni več.
I wouldn't say how.	Ne bi rekel, kako.
I don't do that.	jaz tega ne počnem.
John should leave.	John bi moral oditi.
You're right.	Prav imaš.
He doesn't know what's going on.	Ne ve, kaj se dogaja.
I was there for that.	Za to sem bil tam.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mogoče je to dobro.
It all seems so long ago.	Vse se zdi tako dolgo nazaj.
Instead, it happened.	Namesto tega se je zgodilo to.
She was like	Bila je kot
Only you could do this for me.	Samo ti bi to lahko storil zame.
Or he meant it.	Ali pa je to resno mislil.
Not when he came back now.	Ne, ko se je vrnil zdaj.
You will again.	Spet boš.
He didn't want to know.	Ni hotel, da ve.
You might see what you like.	Morda boste videli, kaj vam je všeč.
I couldn't do anything right at the moment.	Trenutno nisem mogel narediti ničesar prav.
Maybe a little too much.	Mogoče malo preveč.
I haven't seen it yet.	Nisem še videl.
That may be so.	To je lahko tako.
And it often is.	In pogosto se je.
Hard indeed.	Pravzaprav težko.
I heard it's very fine.	Slišal sem, da je zelo v redu.
Alas, my friend! 	Žal, prijatelj!
Both.	Oba.
You knew that because it wouldn’t be possible.	To ste vedeli, ker to ne bi bilo mogoče.
It really needs good timing.	Res potrebuje dober čas.
I just wouldn't.	Preprosto ne bi.
I still have a lot of work to do.	Imam še veliko dela.
And also how they did it.	In tudi kako so to storili.
It wasn't for me.	Ni bilo zame.
After that, they were together.	Po tem sta bila skupaj.
Do you know how many people live here?	Ali veste, koliko ljudi živi tukaj?
I wasn't ready to go.	Nisem bil pripravljen iti.
You tell us.	Ti nam povej.
You put me back to work again.	Spet si me dal nazaj na delo.
Maybe that was it.	Mogoče je bilo to to.
I did it myself.	Sam sem to naredil.
But there is more.	Vendar je še več.
Why are there so many?	Zakaj jih je toliko.
But we'll see what happens.	Bomo pa videli kaj se bo zgodilo.
No, it won't.	Ne, ne bo.
Unfortunately, none of this happened.	Žal se ni zgodilo nič od tega.
And they are not.	In niso.
And there are a lot of things about that.	In o tem je veliko stvari.
I think it was just me.	Mislim, da sem bil samo jaz.
They are not.	Niso.
Maybe I could come back tonight.	Mogoče bi se lahko vrnil nocoj.
You still are.	Si še vedno.
He just needed a chance.	Potreboval je samo priložnost.
He hasn't been in years.	Že leta ni bil.
Now he.	Zdaj on.
He always loved her.	Vedno jo je imel rad.
This is not a problem now.	To zdaj ni problem.
When he plays, he looks pretty tired.	Ko igra, je videti precej utrujen.
And that's fine.	In to je v redu.
So there we were, just a little further.	Tako smo bili tam, le malo naprej.
They have been for years.	Že leta so.
We didn't do that, man.	Tega nismo storili, človek.
He is like a child.	Je kot otrok.
None of that.	Nič od tega.
Only us then.	Takrat samo mi.
I couldn’t, not the way he could.	Jaz nisem mogel, ne tako, kot bi lahko on.
He waited.	Čakal je.
Something would happen right now.	Trenutno bi se nekaj zgodilo.
What if.	Kaj če.
I wish I was still here.	Želim si, da bi bila še vedno tukaj.
I could be more, I could be better.	Lahko bi bil več, bil bi boljši.
And he didn't give it to me either.	In tudi meni ga ni dal.
We will too.	Tudi mi bomo.
Or you may simply not know what to do next.	Ali pa morda preprosto ne veste, kaj storiti naprej.
None of us knew what was going on.	Nihče od nas ni vedel, kaj se dogaja.
But I don’t see that happening.	Ne vidim pa, da bi se to zgodilo.
I told you this afternoon.	Povedal sem ti danes popoldne.
This is being worked on.	Na tem se dela.
Please do it.	Prosim, naredi to.
We have to work now.	Zdaj moramo delati.
I don't want to go there.	Nočem iti tja.
You don’t have to eat much.	Ni vam treba veliko jesti.
It might be.	Morda je.
I hope you got me.	Upam, da si me dobil.
This is sure to happen.	To se bo zagotovo zgodilo.
She was a person.	Bila je oseba.
Until then, all the time.	Do takrat pa ves čas.
we are not.	nismo.
But he's ready to see you.	Vendar te je pripravljen videti.
I'm really tired today.	Danes sem res utrujen.
And you should see her here.	In moral bi jo videti tukaj.
You could also have.	Lahko bi tudi imel.
Looks like you have a chance.	Videti je, da imaš priložnost.
She was behind him now.	Zdaj je bila za njim.
Just money.	Samo denar.
He couldn't believe he said that.	Ni mogel verjeti, da je to rekel.
I thought for sure.	Mislil zagotovo.
She told him not to be afraid.	Rekla mu je, naj se ne boji.
That is absolutely true.	To je popolnoma res.
I mean, you.	Mislim, ti.
It was hard for me.	Bilo mi je težko.
We don't know what it is.	Ne vemo, kaj je.
She's been here before.	Bila je tukaj že prej.
It's here.	To je tukaj.
Nobody knows.	Nihče ne ve.
She's just not interested right now.	Trenutno je preprosto ne zanima.
Maybe none of that happened.	Mogoče se ni zgodilo nič od tega.
He bought a book.	Kupil je knjigo.
Something else is happening here.	Tukaj pa se dogaja nekaj drugega.
That's probably fast enough.	To je verjetno dovolj hitro.
Some days it is like that.	Nekaj ​​dni je tako.
I hope yours too !.	Upam, da tudi tvoj!.
I really like it.	res mi je zelo všeč.
I was the one who did it.	Jaz sem bil tisti, ki je to naredil.
I'm leaving in the morning.	Zjutraj grem.
Neither do I, man.	Jaz tudi ne, človek.
I would have her.	Imel bi jo.
I have a problem.	imam težave.
Those who don't never will.	Tisti, ki ne, nikoli ne bodo.
I was talking at the time.	Takrat sem govoril.
Not this kid.	Ne ta otrok.
They didn't even see them.	Niti jih niso videli.
You will think something.	Nekaj ​​si boš mislil.
I don't want you.	nočem te.
i hope it gets better.	upam, da bo bolje.
It can also be here.	To je lahko tudi tukaj.
He could be of great help to us.	Lahko bi nam bil v veliko pomoč.
He wanted to know why.	Želel je vedeti zakaj.
The time will come for that.	Za to bo prišel čas.
Now everyone knows.	Zdaj vsak ve.
A long time ago.	Že dolgo nazaj.
And that's what people care about.	In to je tisto, kar ljudi zanima.
You got me.	Dobil si me.
And we will.	In bomo.
I heard them.	Slišal sem jih.
I would like to do more of this.	Rad bi naredil več tega.
Which he certainly didn't do.	Kar zagotovo ni storil.
Sometimes in my room.	Včasih v svoji sobi.
I was good at it.	Bil sem dober v tem.
I hope you have a great time here.	Upam, da se boste imeli tukaj lepo.
Yes that `s right.	Da, tako je.
It's still you.	Še vedno si ti.
But it can also come sooner.	Lahko pa pride tudi prej.
I had that.	To sem imel.
Sometimes with me.	Včasih pri meni.
He never had.	Nikoli ni imel.
I've never done that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem storil.
Where do you want to go?	Kam želiš iti?
He had done this before.	To je storil že prej.
It won't be long, it can't be long.	Ne bo dolgo, ne more biti dolgo.
I don't know him well enough to have one.	Ne poznam ga dovolj, da bi ga imel.
I know you are.	Vem, da si.
He didn't wait long.	Ni dolgo čakal.
I have a job now.	Zdaj imam službo.
Never.	Nikoli ne.
I'm here now.	Zdaj sem tukaj.
He's a real, real guy.	On je pravi, pravi fant.
This must be something, he told himself.	To mora biti nekaj, si je rekel.
I thought we had.	Mislil sem, da imamo.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to help that much.	Žal se zdi, da ne pomaga toliko.
I'm sure you'll succeed.	Prepričan sem, da ti bo uspelo.
Just sitting.	Samo sedel.
He won't do anything to us.	Nič nam ne bo naredil.
He has to go to work every day.	Vsak dan mora v službo.
You have to come here right away and tell us everything.	Takoj moraš priti sem in nam vse povedati.
It's beautiful here.	Tukaj je lepo.
Not even who you were.	Niti kdo si bil.
Maybe not.	Mogoče ne.
And maybe there is.	In morda obstaja.
It's not possible.	Ni mogoče.
Sometimes more than a little.	Včasih več kot malo.
I still have to work.	Še vedno moram delati.
I don't like to eat alone.	Ne maram jesti sam.
I'm sure he is.	Prepričan sem, da je.
Now with you.	Zdaj pa s tabo.
It was me.	Meni je bilo.
I didn't tell anyone.	Nikomur nisem povedal.
I’m not so sure it’s true.	Nisem tako prepričan, da je res.
I doubt that a bit.	Malo dvomim o tem.
Usually not much.	Običajno ni veliko.
He did that.	To je naredil.
You certainly don't know that.	Tega zagotovo ne veš.
This one will be tomorrow.	Ta bo jutri.
He needs money now.	Zdaj potrebuje denar.
And maybe not.	In morda ne.
Maybe I would be lucky.	Mogoče bi imel srečo.
Why, she didn't know.	Zakaj, ni vedela.
I have so little of everything.	Vsega imam tako malo.
Let if.	Naj če.
If that happened, we would love it.	Če bi se to zgodilo, bi nam bilo všeč.
She knew what was there.	Vedela je, kaj je tam.
I think it must be helpful to us.	Mislim, da nam mora biti v pomoč.
I can't talk to him.	Ne morem govoriti z njim.
I am? 	Sem jaz?
But I couldn't do that.	Tega pa nisem mogel storiti.
I won't tell anyone who you are.	Nikomur ne bom povedal, kdo si.
I feel sorry for them too.	Tudi meni jih je žal.
And that was no more.	In tega ni bilo več.
There is no time now.	Zdaj ni časa.
And he just sat there.	In samo je sedel tam.
what would you do	kaj bi naredil
This is going to happen to us.	To se nam bo zgodilo.
I didn't do anything there.	Tam nisem naredil ničesar.
Which you have never seen.	Ki ga nikoli niste videli.
It's not just talk here.	Tukaj se ne govori samo.
I didn't make it.	To mi ni uspelo.
If only he could see.	Ko bi le videl.
Nobody wanted to do that.	Tega nihče ni hotel narediti.
It was a game.	To je bila igra.
We don't need to talk.	Ni nam treba govoriti.
I had to.	Moral sem.
Not only that, he is not sorry.	Ne samo to, ni mu žal.
Everyone needs help.	Vsak potrebuje pomoč.
Not really, she said.	Pravzaprav ne, je rekla.
He knew what he was doing.	Vedel je, kaj počne.
I had to be something more.	Moral sem biti nekaj več.
Or maybe they had.	Ali pa so morda imeli.
You know for sure.	Zagotovo veste.
That's what I told him then.	Tako sem mu takrat rekel.
He was glad to hear that.	Bil je vesel, ko je to slišal.
There were none.	Ni jih bilo.
You are absolutely angry, she said.	Popolnoma si jezen, je rekla.
How can I do this?	Kako lahko to storim?
My thing is to know.	Moja stvar je vedeti.
She said no.	Rekla je, da ni.
I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.	Ne bi bil niti malo presenečen.
This is not always true.	To ni vedno res.
No need to know.	Ni treba vedeti.
Sometimes she didn't know where she was.	Včasih ni vedela, kje je.
I should.	Moral bi.
But even that will not be enough.	A tudi to ne bo dovolj.
He played very well.	Igral je zelo dobro.
I shouldn't be here.	Ne bi smel biti tukaj.
He was supposed to do that.	To naj bi storil.
I thought maybe he knew something.	Mislil sem, da morda kaj ve.
To see her.	Da jo vidim.
I don't need him.	ne potrebujem ga.
Maybe that was my problem.	Mogoče je bil to moj problem.
They will be better than nothing.	Bolje bodo kot nič.
It's hard to tell.	Težko je človek povedati.
You wanted to be good to him.	Želela si biti dobra z njim.
Didn't you see him?	Ga nisi videl?
Something is here.	Nekaj ​​je tukaj.
That was not a problem.	To ni bil problem.
Or we shouldn’t be.	Ali pa ne bi smeli biti.
Actually really good.	Pravzaprav res dobro.
If only it were like that for all of us.	Ko bi le bilo tako za vse nas.
And they really did.	In res so to storili.
She said it was yours.	Rekla je, da je tvoj.
So did the next one.	Tako je naredil naslednji.
I am life.	Jaz sem življenje.
She was good at it.	Bila je dobra v tem.
The only thing is.	Edina stvar je.
He decided to go out.	Odločil se je, da gre ven.
And let it be fast.	In naj bo hitro.
It's not about me.	Ne gre za mene.
However, they do not seem to be.	Vendar se zdi, da ne bodo.
I wanted him to know that someone had found him.	Hotel sem, da ve, da ga je nekdo našel.
I wanted something more.	Želel sem nekaj več.
I hope there is nothing wrong.	Upam, da ni nič narobe.
I wish.	Želim si.
However, it could.	Vendar pa bi lahko.
No one heard them.	Nihče jih ni slišal.
They had little time to see anything else.	Imeli so malo časa, da bi videli kaj drugega.
I would never have known that either.	Niti tega ne bi nikoli vedel.
I would meet him again.	Še enkrat bi ga srečal.
I'm not good at this.	Nisem dober v tem.
He doesn't like anyone.	Nikogar ne mara.
I did that too.	Tudi jaz sem tako naredil.
No one will help me.	Nihče mi ne bo pomagal.
Neither does my father.	Moj oče tudi ne.
That's all from us here.	To je vse od nas tukaj.
They are both very good.	Oba sta zelo dobra.
A few need to be done.	Nekaj ​​jih je treba narediti.
It was gone.	Ni je bilo več.
But they will soon.	A kmalu bodo.
I'll give you this one.	Dal ti bom tega.
You should see here.	Moral bi videti tukaj.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
It was more than enough for us.	Za nas je bilo več kot dovolj.
You're better than that.	Ti si boljši od tega.
Not too much.	Ne preveč.
I'm actually surprised to see you.	Pravzaprav sem presenečen, da te vidim.
That's something.	To je nekaj.
There is nothing else to say.	Ni kaj drugega za govoriti.
It's more for us.	Za nas je bolj.
I actually like it.	Pravzaprav mi je všeč.
He really wanted to go.	Zelo si je želel iti.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
It was an opportunity.	Priložnost je bila.
He went to work.	Šel je v službo.
I really want this.	Res si želim tega.
This is not going to happen.	To se ne bo zgodilo.
It might be tomorrow.	Morda bo jutri.
And yet you are not.	Pa vendar niste.
Now we have.	Zdaj pa imamo.
There was so much to do.	Toliko je bilo treba narediti.
That's all right.	To je vse v redu.
I can not.	ne morem.
I was glad he did it and not me.	Vesel sem bil, da je to počel on in ne jaz.
Was there a little early.	Bil tam malo zgodaj.
Life is good !.	Življenje je dobro!.
I'm fine myself.	sam sem v redu.
Maybe he wasn't.	Mogoče ni bil.
That's what it's about.	Za to gre.
I still don’t understand what happened.	Še vedno ne razumem, kaj se je zgodilo.
Talking about it is simple.	Govoriti o tem je preprosto.
I'm sure it was him.	Prepričan sem, da je bil on.
Sam didn't have much.	Sam ni imel veliko.
But it's not that simple.	A ni tako preprosto.
It's not easy.	Ni lahko.
That's how it is with us.	Pri nas je tako.
Really early.	Res zgodaj.
Totally, totally wrong.	Popolnoma, popolnoma narobe.
You won't get me.	Ne boš me dobil.
I'm glad you came.	Vesel sem, da si prišel.
You can't do things.	Ne moreš delati stvari.
I didn't know where he was.	Nisem vedel kje je.
Yes, next week.	Da, naslednji teden.
It's just not happening.	Samo ne dogaja.
Maybe he was.	Morda je bil.
And he got it.	In dobil ga je.
He wished he hadn't come.	Želel si je, da ne bi prišel.
I didn't know about that.	Nisem vedel za to.
The only problem is how to do it.	Edini problem je, kako to narediti.
I've been doing this for a long time.	To počnem že dolgo.
If only it were that simple.	Ko bi le bilo tako preprosto.
V	V
It doesn't go after that.	Po tem ne gre.
I didn't mean anything.	Ničesar nisem mislil.
We immediately said yes.	Takoj sva rekla da.
Quite a few actually.	Pravzaprav kar nekaj.
I don't think he wants to go home!	Mislim, da noče domov!.
There is still a lot to do and say.	Še veliko je za narediti in povedati.
I think so, a little.	Mislim, da je, malo.
I have to be with you.	Moram biti s tabo.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
I really liked it.	Zelo mi je bilo všeč.
maybe.	mogoče.
Who he was.	Kdo je bil.
It would be difficult.	Težko bi bilo.
There will be work to be done.	Delo bo še.
When life goes well, little is made of it.	Ko gre življenje dobro, se iz njega naredi malo.
Also good at what he did.	Tudi dober v tem, kar je naredil.
You need to know that.	To moraš vedeti.
It still is.	Še vedno je.
I will decide for myself.	Sam se bom odločil.
He loves a lot of things.	Rad ima veliko stvari.
Not so much.	Ni tako veliko.
He obviously knew where they were.	Očitno je vedel, kje so.
I would do that.	Bi to naredil.
It’s so simple and so hard.	To je tako preprosto in tako težko.
It can't be.	To ne more biti.
I was a boy.	Bil sem fant.
Not again.	Spet ne skoraj.
Where did he go?	Kam je šel?
I've never seen him.	Nikoli ga nisem videl.
He never forgot that.	Tega ni nikoli pozabil.
Even if you can.	Tudi če lahko.
I do not understand.	ne razumem.
It can be quite difficult.	Zna biti kar težko.
You should see.	Morala bi videti.
And there it is to this day.	In tam je do danes.
They did nothing.	Nič niso storili.
I told her again.	Spet sem ji rekel.
No, I wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
He once told me it wouldn’t be a problem.	Enkrat mi je rekel, da ne bo problem.
Yes, more of that please.	Da, še več tega, prosim.
Everything would be fine now.	Zdaj bi bilo vse v redu.
And be with you.	In biti s tabo.
Do what he did.	Naredi to, kar je storil.
You should know that too.	To bi moral vedeti tudi ti.
I don't want anyone to know.	Nočem, da kdo ve.
It's really quite obvious.	Res je precej očitno.
He hasn't worked in years.	Že leta ne dela.
Right or wrong.	Prav ali narobe.
He doesn't do what he says.	Ne dela tega, kar pravi.
I don’t know if he was or not.	Ne vem, ali je bil ali ne.
She wanted this life.	Želela si je to življenje.
You don't know how much.	Ne veš koliko.
He was sure he had seen it before.	Bil je prepričan, da je to že videl.
I don't know from whom.	Ne vem od koga.
Nobody seems to care.	Zdi se, da nikogar ne zanima.
I don't want to go.	Jaz nočem iti.
I didn't know that either.	Tudi tega nisem vedel.
She likes it.	Všeč ji je.
I've never had one.	Nikoli ga nisem imel.
You know, I say.	Veste, pravi jaz.
Not much else.	Ne veliko drugega.
No, never again.	Ne, nikoli več.
That’s what’s so hard.	To je tisto, kar je tako težko.
Here's the problem.	Tukaj je problem.
How she wanted him.	Kako si ga je želela.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
I had a nice time.	Imel sem se lepo.
I do not know what would that be.	Ne vem, kaj bi to bilo.
You never wanted anything else.	Nikoli si nisi želel ničesar drugega.
So much remains to be done.	Toliko je treba še narediti.
I will not.	ne bom.
They were all alive.	Vsi so bili živi.
Think good.	Dobro misli.
You should totally do that.	Popolnoma bi moral to storiti.
Everything still looked good.	Vse je bilo še videti dobro.
It seemed so much.	Zdelo se je tako veliko.
He was trying to say something.	Poskušal je nekaj povedati.
She knew better now.	Zdaj je vedela bolje.
You never will.	Nikoli ne boš.
Even at home.	Tudi doma.
Either way almost as much.	Tako ali tako skoraj toliko.
In fact, that is not enough.	Pravzaprav to ni dovolj.
He met someone.	Spoznal je nekoga.
He needs to get to it quickly.	Hitro mora priti do njega.
I will leave tomorrow.	jutri bom odšel.
That was hard.	To je bilo težko.
However, he could not do that.	Vendar tega ni mogel storiti.
How he spoke.	Kako je govoril.
I'm tired of it.	Utrujen sem od tega.
He was convinced of that.	O tem je bil prepričan.
I really was.	Res sem bil.
That's what you did.	Tako ste storili.
He helped me too much.	Preveč mi je pomagal.
We've never been here before.	Še nikoli nismo bili tukaj.
It was so fast.	Bilo je tako hitro.
A very good person.	Zelo dobra oseba.
But he was not there.	Vendar ga ni bilo.
However, much remains to be done.	Vendar je treba še veliko narediti.
Not so.	Ni pa tako.
Say what I want to say.	Povedati, kar želim povedati.
He was probably right.	Verjetno je imel prav.
I haven’t seen anyone play like that yet.	Še nisem videl, da bi kdo igral tako.
He realized that his father loved him.	Spoznal je, da ga ima oče rad.
That was my whole life.	To je bilo vse moje življenje.
She knew he wouldn't.	Vedela je, da ne bo.
However, it is not.	Vendar pa ni.
It was a good game.	Bila je dobra igra.
He sings beautifully.	Lepo poje.
It is never easy.	Nikoli ni lahko.
I don’t know what to think about that.	Ne vem, kaj naj si mislim o tem.
I’ve never done that and I never will.	Tega nisem nikoli naredil in nikoli ne bom.
We should and should talk about it.	Morali bi in bi morali govoriti o tem.
Nobody wanted to help me.	Nihče mi ni hotel pomagati.
That's where it happened.	Tam se je zgodilo.
I've never seen him before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl.
I have to tell you again.	Moram ti še enkrat povedati.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
I just didn't see that.	Samo tega nisem videl.
Or not so much.	Ali pa ne toliko.
We have to help her.	Pomagati ji moramo.
He just heard her speak.	Samo slišal jo je govoriti.
He told her that often.	To ji je pogosto govoril.
Who knows what will happen next day?	Kdo ve, kaj bo naslednji dan?
We are next.	Mi smo naslednji.
I can't help it.	Ne morem si pomagati.
I don't know what will happen tomorrow.	Ne vem, kaj se bo zgodilo jutri.
This one is for you.	Ta je za vas.
He told me he wouldn't be home for a while.	Rekel mi je, da ga nekaj časa ne bo doma.
I'm not there right now.	Trenutno nisem tam.
But it didn't happen that way at all.	Vendar se sploh ni zgodilo tako.
I didn't feel well.	Nisem se počutil dobro.
I really think something is wrong.	Res mislim, da je nekaj narobe.
He was there to help him.	Bil je tam, da bi mu pomagal.
No one wanted to know anything.	Nihče ni hotel ničesar vedeti.
And not only that.	In ne samo to.
I'll be waiting for you.	Čakal te bom.
She does it because she likes it.	To počne, ker ji je všeč.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
We need to be better.	Moramo biti boljši.
However, this would not be the case.	Vendar temu ne bi bilo tako.
She had to be.	Morala je biti.
We know now.	Zdaj vemo.
None of that.	Nič od tega.
I can't be sure.	Ne morem biti prepričan.
I don't think it's good.	Mislim, da ni dobro.
It was good, but it could have been better.	Bilo je dobro, vendar bi lahko bilo bolje.
It certainly wasn't here.	Tukaj zagotovo ni bilo.
All of him.	Vsi on.
When he felt better, there was plenty of time.	Ko se je počutil bolje, je bilo dovolj časa.
I have to go for help.	Moram iti po pomoč.
Must be.	Mora biti.
Now you can.	Zdaj lahko.
Let them be sure of it.	Naj bodo prepričani o tem.
It didn't look like much.	Ni bilo videti veliko.
I wasn’t ready to tell him everything.	Nisem mu bil pripravljen povedati vsega.
According to the	Glede na
He doesn't need to be told anymore.	Več mu ni treba povedati.
But I will say that.	Bom pa to rekel.
Why would.	Zakaj bi.
He always sings when he is happy.	Vedno poje, ko je vesel.
Nobody knows.	Nihče ne ve.
There really is nothing more.	Res ni nič več.
There were many of them.	Veliko jih je bilo.
She always was.	Vedno je bila.
This is not difficult to do.	To ni težko narediti.
Because the work is there.	Ker je delo tam.
I just want to help you.	Samo pomagati ti želim.
Can anyone please help me ?.	Mi lahko kdo prosim pomaga?.
I doubt he will return.	Dvomim, da se bo vrnil.
I know him better than you.	Poznam ga bolje kot ti.
He was a teacher.	Bil je učitelj.
Once was enough.	Enkrat je bilo dovolj.
I knew then, if no one.	Takrat sem vedel, če ne kdo.
However, this is not always the case.	Vendar ni vedno tako.
He went to work.	Šel je v službo.
It's too much for me.	Preveč je zame.
I think you will be a good father.	Mislim, da boš dober oče.
You should know that.	To bi morala vedeti.
You probably should.	Verjetno bi moral.
I'm really glad you did it.	Res sem vesel, da ti je to uspelo.
Not everything is as it seems.	Vse ni tako, kot se zdi.
I haven’t played for over a week now.	Zdaj nisem igral več kot teden dni.
Or not with me.	Ali pa ne pri meni.
Maybe it would.	Mogoče bi.
we have it all.	imamo vse.
He didn't look well.	Ni bil videti dobro.
I hope this was helpful.	Upam, da je bilo to v pomoč.
He spoke quickly.	Hitro je govoril.
I understand you.	Razumem te.
And you know that.	In to veš.
Yes, and yes and yes.	Da, in da in da.
I didn't know how.	Nisem vedel kako.
This is a way to make more money.	To je način za več denarja.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
For me.	Za mano.
Now that's enough.	Zdaj pa je dovolj.
I like it, he says.	Všeč mi je, pravi.
And maybe it’s still not right.	In morda še vedno ni v redu.
I'm going to do it now.	Grem zdaj to narediti.
You saw it.	Videli ste.
He was sure he wouldn't.	Bil je prepričan, da ne bo.
That needs to be said.	To je treba povedati.
But he was right.	Vendar je imel prav.
This has happened to me a lot.	To se mi je veliko zgodilo.
There wasn’t that much to say.	Ni bilo toliko za povedati.
Unfortunately they are not.	Žal niso.
Are you.	Ali ste.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
Now she actually liked it better.	Zdaj ji je bil pravzaprav bolj všeč.
And you have to do it.	In to moraš storiti.
Who taught you?	Kdo te je naučil?
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
It's still like that today.	Še danes je tako.
He wouldn't let her go.	Ni ji dovolil oditi.
It was a good question.	Bilo je dobro vprašanje.
But they are not the only ones.	Niso pa edini.
I never told anyone that.	Tega nisem nikoli nikomur povedal.
Don't say that.	Ne govori tako.
There was no one then	Takrat ni bilo nikogar
Is it ever.	Ali je kdaj.
Just not so fast.	Samo ne tako hitro.
And talk to him.	In govori z njim.
He was good to me.	Bil je dober do mene.
You should do everything you can.	Moral bi narediti vse, kar lahko.
And she was.	In bila je.
No one ever thought this was going to happen.	Nihče si ni nikoli mislil, da se bo to zgodilo.
That's for me.	To je zame.
Not everyone is.	Niso vsi.
Why, why, why.	Zakaj, zakaj, zakaj.
He doesn’t care much for things we don’t know.	Ne zanima ga veliko za stvari, ki jih ne vemo.
This will not be a problem for me.	To zame ne bo problem.
What could be this problem.	Kaj je lahko ta problem.
He wanted to.	Želel je.
me.	jaz.
He knew what he had to do.	Vedel je, kaj mora storiti.
he thought.	mislil je.
It's not for me.	To zame ni.
It simply isn't.	Preprosto ni.
I was there too.	Tudi jaz sem bil tam.
No, not yet.	Ne, še ne.
Money couldn't buy it.	Denar ga ni mogel kupiti.
Obviously not too much.	Očitno ne preveč.
Given that, we weren’t sure what to do with the school.	Glede na to nismo bili prepričani, kaj storiti s šolo.
I think he's right.	Mislim, da ima prav.
He was so tired.	Bil je tako utrujen.
I wonder about that.	Sprašujem se o tem.
I liked it there and decided to stay.	Tam mi je bilo všeč in sem se odločil ostati.
I wouldn’t put a lot of money into it.	Za to ne bi dal veliko denarja.
That's how it is here.	Tako je tukaj.
You should go to work.	Moral bi iti v službo.
It really isn’t like anything else.	Res ni kot nič drugega.
I hope all is well.	Upam, da je vsem dobro.
I also.	Jaz tudi.
Time is not money.	Čas ni denar.
A lot of time.	Veliko časa.
He wouldn't do that.	On tega ne bi storil.
This is too much for people.	To je preveč za ljudi.
There was something else as well.	Bilo je tudi nekaj drugega.
It's good that we're here.	Dobro je, da smo tukaj.
Did you have a good day?	Ste imeli dober dan?
That was obvious.	To je bilo očitno.
For us, it goes as usual.	Za nas gre kot običajno.
Now everyone has them.	Zdaj jih ima vsak.
There were none.	Ni jih bilo.
That's right.	Prav je.
You will become a father.	Postal boš oče.
He wanted to make sure too.	Tudi on se je želel prepričati.
Just like he knew they would.	Tako kot je vedel, da bodo.
And on and on.	In še in še.
That's about all anyone has ever said to me.	To je skoraj vse, kar mi je kdo kdaj rekel.
Time, that's a problem.	Čas, to je problem.
One who would speak or die.	Tisti, ki bi govoril ali umrl.
They were like us.	Bili so kot mi.
She had to say more.	Morala je povedati več.
I called him.	poklical sem ga.
I lost.	Izgubil sem.
Maybe that would be a good thing.	Mogoče pa bi bilo to dobro.
Not here either.	Tudi tukaj ne.
How true that is.	Kako res je to.
As we used to.	Kot smo včasih.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ne bo.
I didn't think you wouldn't be here that long.	Nisem si mislil, da te ne bo tako dolgo.
He didn't speak.	Ni govoril.
you don't.	ti ne.
A lot has happened.	Veliko se je zgodilo.
May everything be better.	Naj bo vse bolje.
You made them.	Ti si jih naredil.
I wouldn't wait any longer.	Ne bi več čakal.
I asked what happened to her.	Vprašal sem, kaj se ji je zgodilo.
I could help.	Lahko bi pomagal.
I was just tired.	Bil sem samo utrujen.
I believe he will win.	Verjamem, da bo zmagal.
We were very much at it.	Zelo smo bili pri tem.
And maybe that’s why it’s so hard.	In morda je zato tako težko.
Not much.	Veliko ni.
I don't think I should, you know.	Mislim, da ne bi smel, veš.
It was so beautiful.	Bilo je tako lepo.
You could say he wants to tell me something else.	Lahko bi rekel, da mi želi povedati nekaj drugega.
We'll be fine.	V redu nam bo.
Why, you're a good man at home too.	Zakaj, tudi ti doma si dober človek.
They didn’t know and it’s that simple.	Niso vedeli in tako preprosto je.
Obviously there are many of you.	Očitno vas je veliko.
So we have to be simple.	Zato moramo preprosto.
That was him.	To je bil pravi on.
I’m really glad we made it.	Res sem vesel, da nam je uspelo.
That was a long time.	To je bilo dolgo.
He left with a lot of money.	Odšel je z veliko denarja.
It was like yesterday for me.	To je bilo zame kot včeraj.
Maybe he'd be better off.	Mogoče bi mu bilo bolje.
I don't want to do that anymore.	Tega nočem več početi.
That's what I'm wondering.	To se sprašujem.
I believe.	Verjamem.
He is not a child to me.	Zame ni otrok.
Like you.	Tako kot ti.
I'll just go out.	Samo šel bom ven.
But not all of them.	Vendar ne vsi.
I have to get back to work.	Moram nazaj na delo.
He asked for money.	Prosil je za denar.
I do not like.	ni mi všeč.
The more things, the better.	Več stvari, bolje je.
It's okay, she said, and nothing more.	V redu je, je rekla, in nič več.
I would if I were there.	Bi, če bi bil tam.
Every day he did.	Vsak dan, ki ga je naredil.
So few people know.	Tako malo ljudi ve.
Is this a man at all?	Je to sploh človek?
Or, if he did, he did nothing about it.	Ali pa, če je, ni storil ničesar glede tega.
Can anyone please help.	Ali lahko kdo prosim pomaga.
Life is Beautiful.	Življenje je lepo.
I was waiting for them.	Čakal sem jih.
Don't tell me.	Ne povej mi.
Only you don't know it yet.	Samo ti tega še ne veš.
And only when something is happening.	In samo takrat, ko se kaj dogaja.
This one is back.	Ta se je vrnil.
It was actually very nice.	Pravzaprav je bilo zelo lepo.
I really liked it.	res mi je bilo všeč.
He knew about it.	Vedel je za to.
I found him now.	Zdaj sem ga našel.
I don't think she even likes him.	Mislim, da ga niti ne mara.
So it seems.	Tako se zdi.
There is no time to do anything about it.	Ni časa, da bi kaj storili glede tega.
Everyone should come.	Vsi bi morali priti.
I didn't think he was right.	Nisem mislil, da je prav.
None of this happened.	Nič od tega ni bilo.
That must be hard.	To mora biti težko.
And because he still was.	In ker je še vedno bil.
It was as if he had heard something.	Kot da je nekaj slišal.
But she didn't think so.	Vendar se ji ni zdelo tako.
I know more than you.	Vem več kot ti.
Please have someone help her.	Prosim, da ji nekdo pomaga.
I just need some more time.	Potrebujem samo še nekaj časa.
It felt like it had to be.	Zdelo se je, kot da mora biti.
I can't talk at all.	Sploh ne morem govoriti.
From there.	Od tam.
He thought he was ready.	Mislil je, da je pripravljen.
He saw me.	Videl me je.
I was quite surprised.	Bil sem precej presenečen.
I never thought it would be you.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da boš to ti.
He actually died there.	Pravzaprav je tam umrl.
It won't be long now.	Zdaj ne bo dolgo.
Really not.	Res ne.
But he wasn't sure.	Vendar ni bil prepričan.
No one can do it for us.	Nihče tega ne more narediti namesto nas.
There are probably more.	Verjetno jih je še več.
It seems right.	Zdi se prav.
He's just alone.	On je samo sam.
Which is.	Kar je.
In fact, this is wrong.	Pravzaprav je to narobe.
I will never see again.	Nikoli več ne bom videl.
Now we knew we were right.	Zdaj smo vedeli, da imamo prav.
It is very difficult for me to do that.	Zelo težko mi je to narediti.
And not too much.	In ne preveč.
Maybe a little earlier.	Mogoče malo prej.
And you're just.	In ti si samo.
I could do that.	To bi lahko naredil.
We saw it, you saw it.	Videli smo, videli ste.
Obviously something was wrong.	Očitno je bilo nekaj narobe.
I know what you mean.	Vem, kaj si mislil.
That's not very good.	To ni zelo dobro.
I'll tell you what you want to know.	Povedal ti bom, kar želiš vedeti.
She still said nothing.	Še vedno ni rekla nič.
She just didn't know what to do with it all.	Samo ni vedela, kaj bi z vsem tem.
Maybe too much.	Mogoče preveč.
They will always be there.	Vedno bodo tam.
Everyone wanted something from him.	Vsak je hotel nekaj od njega.
This one is for me.	Ta je zame.
Not many people.	Veliko ljudi ni.
I know because it happened to me.	Vem, ker se mi je to zgodilo.
It wouldn't be easy.	Ne bi bilo lahko.
And he will be gone soon.	In kmalu bo odšel.
that's what i learned.	tega sem se naučil.
But he didn't just talk.	A ni samo govoril.
He left it to you.	Pustil ti ga je.
This is from children.	To je od otrok.
He thinks something is wrong.	Misli, da je nekaj narobe.
There was always something.	Nekaj ​​je vedno bilo.
You are more than that.	Ti si več kot to.
He doesn't like you.	Ne mara te.
That's how it was.	Tako je bila.
And none of that would be nice.	In nič od tega ne bi bilo lepo.
That's it.	To je že.
They never were.	Nikoli niso bili.
There was nowhere to go.	Ni bilo kam iti.
He helped too.	Tudi on je pomagal.
This is my job.	To je moje delo.
I'm so glad I met you.	Tako sem vesel, da sem te spoznal.
And it’s definitely a good thing.	In zagotovo je to dobra stvar.
He's not so sure.	Ni tako prepričan.
Everything that was there.	Vse, kar je bilo tam.
You can't do that.	Tako ne moreš.
More than you think you know.	Več, kot si mislite, da veste.
Not much to see.	Ni veliko za videti.
Can anyone help me?	Mi lahko kdo pomaga?
No more can be done now.	Zdaj ni več mogoče storiti.
This is something we need to do.	To je nekaj, kar moramo storiti.
And here it is.	In tukaj je.
I need to know what's going on here.	Moram vedeti, kaj se tukaj dogaja.
And maybe she would want that.	In morda bi si to želela.
I wanted to.	hotel sem.
He returned to work yesterday.	Včeraj se je vrnil na delo.
He can have it.	Lahko ga ima.
He had a job and he did it.	Imel je delo in ga je opravil.
Someone is after me.	Nekdo je za mano.
Not so much about.	Ne toliko o.
I didn't think anything was wrong at the time.	Takrat se mi ni zdelo nič narobe.
I couldn't help him.	Nisem mu mogel pomagati.
That's my question.	To je moje vprašanje.
My father or me.	Moj oče ali jaz.
It seems really hard.	Zdi se res težko.
We knew he was there.	Vedeli smo, da je tam.
Life here is not as difficult as it seems.	Življenje tukaj ni tako težko, kot se zdi.
In fact, we shouldn't.	Pravzaprav ne bi smeli.
Well, you can.	Pa lahko.
Why was he so angry?	Zakaj je bil tako jezen?
I don't know what they were.	Ne vem, kaj so bili.
I'll get there myself.	Sam bom prišel tja.
I couldn't take it anymore.	Nisem mogel več.
They will be better.	Boljši bodo.
However, it does more than that.	Vendar pa naredi več kot to.
She has something that interests her.	Ima nekaj, kar jo zanima.
He would like that.	To bi mu bilo všeč.
And that's not it.	In to ni to.
Or you know.	Ali pa veš.
Now he knows what’s going to happen, and he knows he wants it.	Zdaj ve, kaj se bo zgodilo, in ve, da si to želi.
Maybe we’ll get lucky and my dad will be there.	Morda bomo imeli srečo in bo tam moj oče.
I see everything.	Vidim vse.
It's still not my thing.	Še vedno pa to ni moja stvar.
Fine.	V redu.
Or did he fail.	Ali kaj mu ni uspelo.
He doesn't know about it yet.	Za to še ne ve.
There is no need to do this.	Tega ni treba storiti.
I know what will happen there.	Vem, kaj se bo tam zgodilo.
And they did.	In so to storili.
Not just mine.	Ne samo moj.
Instead, he said nothing.	Namesto tega ni rekel ničesar.
She knew she wasn't.	Vedela je, da ni.
Fine.	V redu.
He didn't ask for that.	Tega ni prosil.
I'll just stay here.	Samo tukaj bom ostal.
Nice to know.	Lepo je vedeti.
It's very nice.	Zelo je lepo.
What makes them.	Kaj jih naredi.
Someone help me.	Naj mi nekdo pomaga.
Just a minute.	Samo malo.
He was waiting for that.	To je čakal.
No one has heard of me.	Nihče ni slišal zame.
It happened again.	Spet se je zgodilo.
We need to know who did it.	Vedeti moramo, kdo je to storil.
Surely anyone would see.	Zagotovo bi kdo videl.
That's not enough.	To ni dovolj.
We know this is difficult.	Vemo, da je to težko.
You saw me.	Si me videl.
He was.	Bil je.
I don't know what you're going to do.	Ne vem, kaj boš naredil.
Or whatever you want.	Ali kar želite.
He left this morning.	Danes zjutraj je odšel.
It was you.	To si bil ti.
it really is simple.	res je preprosto.
Not to say.	Ni povedati.
He usually eats only once a day.	Običajno poje le enkrat na dan.
All because of me.	Vse zaradi mene.
He just told you.	Pravkar ti je povedal.
I told him what had happened to me.	Povedal sem mu, kaj se mi je zgodilo.
Maybe more than that.	Mogoče več kot to.
They never have.	Še nikoli niso.
I thought he had to go out again.	Mislil sem, da mora spet ven.
The time was not given.	Čas ni bil dan.
It seemed wrong.	Zdelo se je narobe.
He was there when he died.	Bil je tam, ko je umrl.
They probably won’t do that.	Verjetno tega ne bodo storili.
She didn't know where to go.	Ni vedela, kam bi šla.
I am sure.	Prepričan sem.
There was much more here.	Tukaj je bilo veliko več.
He told me where to go.	Povedal mi je, kam naj grem.
There was nothing that you could do about it.	Nič nisi mogel storiti.
He just got it.	Pravkar ga je dobil.
They are not there.	Niso tam.
That would be wrong too.	Tudi to bi bilo narobe.
In fact, it was very simple.	Pravzaprav je bilo zelo preprosto.
I came.	Prišel sem.
I almost wasn't.	Skoraj nisem bil.
This makes it very difficult to help you.	Zaradi tega vam je zelo težko pomagati.
I just don't see it.	Samo tega ne vidim.
No, that's none of my business.	Ne, to ni moja stvar.
But they are not the only ones.	Niso pa edini.
Where have you been.	Kje si bil.
I'm good to be.	Dobro mi je biti.
Who knows how many people.	Kdo ve koliko ljudi.
How can this be?	Kako je to lahko?
Would he succeed? 	Bi mu uspelo?
She said she had never been so okay.	Rekla je, da še nikoli ni bila tako v redu.
That must be right.	To mora biti prav.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je to.
I bought this book yesterday.	To knjigo sem kupil včeraj.
If it will.	Če bo.
How he loved them.	Kako jih je imel rad.
You're right about that.	Glede tega imaš prav.
I didn’t expect it not to be.	Nisem pričakoval, da ne bo.
That was wrong.	To je bilo narobe.
No one was ready.	Nihče ni bil pripravljen.
She is unlikely to succeed.	Malo verjetno je, da ji bo uspelo.
I've been here all this time.	Ves ta čas sem bil tukaj.
There is a car in front of us.	Pred nami je avto.
Almost nobody knew about you.	Skoraj nihče ni vedel za vas.
I don't know that.	tega ne vem.
She simply was.	Preprosto je bila.
Better not.	Bolje je, da ne.
There's nothing you can do about it.	Glede tega ne moreš storiti ničesar.
There are only more.	Samo več jih je.
It's not getting any better.	Ne gre na bolje.
I know you had to do this.	Vem, da si moral to narediti.
However, it would be better to come quickly.	Vendar bi bilo bolje, da pride hitro.
But I will give it a chance.	Bom pa dal priložnost.
There is no one there.	Tam ni nikogar.
She was good.	Bila je dobra.
I wasn’t sure what.	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj.
I saw.	Videl sem.
And not much time.	In ni veliko časa.
So much and nothing more.	Toliko in nič več.
That's how it is.	Tako je, kot je.
That's where the work begins.	To rad počne.
Your father was a good man.	Tvoj oče je bil dober človek.
I did it.	uspelo mi je.
I thought you were more than you thought.	Mislil sem, da si več, kot se zdi.
This can be a way to do it.	To je lahko način, kako to storiti.
This is hard work.	To je težko delo.
He has yet to come.	Mora še priti.
Now he asked her that.	Zdaj jo je to vprašal.
He needed her.	Potreboval jo je.
And they were.	In so bili.
It made me feel better.	Zaradi tega sem se počutil bolje.
If you ever are.	Če si kdaj.
However, this is not my way.	Vendar to ni moj način.
No, he wasn't.	Ne, ni bil to.
Maybe it still is.	Morda je še vedno.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
It seemed so.	Zdelo se je tako.
Not that he ever said much.	Ne, da je kdaj rekel veliko.
I didn’t tell anyone what was going on.	Nikomur nisem povedal, kaj se dogaja.
There was none of that.	Nič od tega ni bilo.
You have to go.	Moraš iti.
She said she could no longer work here.	Rekla je, da ne more več delati tukaj.
I wanted to do it now.	Želel sem narediti zdaj.
Things he wanted to know.	Stvari, ki jih je želel vedeti.
That was a possibility.	To je bila možnost.
And she could be.	In lahko bi bila.
He is the only child.	Je edini otrok.
I have to do something about it.	Moram nekaj narediti s tem.
And she really liked that.	In to ji je bilo zelo všeč.
He was ready for anything.	Bil je pripravljen na vse.
More than we ever had.	Več kot smo kdaj imeli.
That may be wrong.	To je morda narobe.
No one was before him.	Nihče ni bil pred njim.
I will leave too.	tudi jaz bom odšel.
We had a few of them ourselves.	Sami smo jih imeli nekaj.
It's nothing like that.	To ni nič takega.
I failed.	Ni mi uspelo.
It seems so simple to you.	Zdi se vam tako preprosto.
But he didn't do that very often.	A tega ni počel prav pogosto.
I didn't hear anything else.	Nič drugega nisem slišal.
I'll help myself.	Pomagal si bom sam.
Which didn't happen.	Kar se ni zgodilo.
That's what you told me.	To si mi rekel.
Actually a lot.	Pravzaprav veliko.
However, this is not always the case.	Vendar ni vedno tako.
I can't stay here.	Ne morem ostati tukaj.
There are many people.	Veliko ljudi je.
Something happened, something happened, something happened.	Nekaj ​​se je zgodilo, zgodilo, nekaj se je zgodilo.
He's not sure.	Ni prepričan.
That's us.	To smo mi.
I know.	Jaz vem.
She did it.	To ji je uspelo.
A few days.	Nekaj ​​dni.
And how long.	In kako dolgo.
I'm sure that won't be a problem.	Prepričan sem, da to ne bo problem.
This is hard work.	To je težko delo.
He wanted to play.	Želel je igrati.
Someone will be right there.	Nekdo bo takoj tam.
She didn't say.	Ni rekla.
Something else me.	Še nekaj jaz.
He talks a lot.	Veliko govori.
That's what happened to us.	Tako se nam je zgodilo.
That's not a problem.	To ni problem.
I have you now.	Zdaj te imam.
That seems good.	To se zdi dobro.
And it will do so.	In to bo tudi počel.
He certainly doesn't know.	Zagotovo ne ve.
He will not lose again.	Ne bo več izgubil.
It will be good for me.	Zame bo dobro.
Therein lies the reason.	V tem je razlog.
You won this car.	Ta avto si zmagal.
We don't know where we are now.	Ne vemo, kje smo zdaj.
I'm so tired.	Tako sem utrujen.
.	.
It was hard.	Bilo je težko.
it seemed to me.	zdelo se mi je.
I hope it comes soon.	Upam, da kmalu pride.
We will be gone in the morning.	Zjutraj nas ne bo več.
I've been waiting for you.	Čakal sem te.
If it was that simple, I would have been here sooner.	Če bi bilo tako preprosto, bi bil tukaj že prej.
He can't tell.	Ne more povedati.
We will too.	Tudi mi bomo.
I would never know what that is.	Nikoli ne bi vedela, kaj je to.
I don't want to know things.	Nočem vedeti stvari.
He said nothing.	Nič ni rekel.
No one spoke to him.	Nihče ni govoril z njim.
We have to leave now.	Zdaj moramo oditi.
I should never have told her.	Nikoli ji ne bi smel povedati.
It's so beautiful.	Tako lepo je.
That is, it worked.	To je, da je uspelo.
You had .	Imeli ste .
I was for another.	Bil sem za drugega.
He is in me.	On je v meni.
And yet it is.	In vendar je.
I could only do it again tonight.	Nocoj bi to lahko storil le še enkrat.
Someone who knew quite a bit about you.	Nekdo, ki je vedel kar nekaj o vas.
I didn’t like anything or you wanted anything.	Nič mi ni bilo všeč ali si ničesar želel.
No, more than that.	Ne, več kot to.
Someone is right.	Nekdo ima prav.
We really should.	Res bi morali.
You couldn't see.	Nisi mogel videti.
She was much more than that.	Bila je veliko več kot to.
I would stay again.	Spet bi ostal.
He had nothing more to say.	Ni imel več kaj povedati.
I'll be back soon.	se bom kmalu vrnil.
I didn't think so.	nisem mislil tako.
I wasn't good.	Nisem bil dober.
This one might be.	Ta je morda.
You'll never have time.	Nikoli ne boš imel časa.
Maybe that's why.	Mogoče zato.
This is something that would totally happen to me.	To je nekaj, kar bi se mi popolnoma zgodilo.
I have to go home.	domov moram.
You'll know when it's good again.	Vedeli boste, ko bo spet dobro.
Really, we are.	Res, smo.
He didn’t have it now, but he will soon.	Zdaj ga ni imel, a ga bo kmalu.
I'm for it.	jaz sem za to.
I like it more and more.	Vse bolj mi je všeč.
You know why you're here.	Veš, zakaj si tukaj.
It won't.	Ne bo.
That's really nice.	To je res lepo.
Not at all.	Niti malo.
I really don't understand why.	Res ne razumem zakaj.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
For me, money is nothing.	Zame denar ni nič.
This way is life.	Ta način je življenje.
It used to be.	Nekoč je bilo.
Do it for me.	Naredi to zame.
I know why you're here.	Vem zakaj si tukaj.
He knew we were there.	Vedel je, da smo tam.
That's how he did it.	Tako mu je to uspelo.
I didn’t think it existed.	Nisem mislil, da obstaja.
It wasn't like that.	Ni bilo tako.
Never heard of it.	Nikoli slišal.
Not wrong.	Ni narobe.
She could be there for years.	Tam bi lahko bila leta.
I really can't.	res ne morem.
Now seems like a good time to do it.	Zdi se, da je zdaj pravi čas za to.
Too hard.	Preveč težko.
Should not.	ne bi smel.
She moved on.	Šla je naprej.
Not much to talk about.	Ni veliko za govoriti.
Life is good.	Življenje je dobro.
I could go.	Lahko bi šla.
I don't know if we'll have tomorrow.	Ne vem, če bomo imeli jutri.
Again, maybe it is.	Spet, morda je.
Not even with.	Niti z.
I hope so.	Upam, da je tako.
You know what's what.	Veš kaj je kaj.
There is no money in this.	V tem ni denarja.
There's no time for that.	Ni časa za to.
No one saw this coming.	Nihče ni videl tega.
That was really it.	To je bilo res to.
Not like we are today.	Ne tako kot smo danes.
Who's next?	Kdo je naslednji?
He spoke, but never.	Govoril je, a nikoli.
She was alone.	Bila je sama.
He was too much of everything.	Bil je preveč vsega.
I would go there today.	Tja bi šla danes.
Please, I hope this will work for you.	Prosim, upam, da bo to delo za vas.
It wasn't something we should have done.	To ni bilo nekaj, kar bi morali narediti.
It won't be obvious.	Ne bo očitno.
You are a man for the people.	Ti si človek za ljudi.
This can be difficult.	To je lahko težko.
Not everything is good.	Vse ni dobro.
We can't talk about it.	Ne moremo govoriti o tem.
That seems nice to me.	To se mi zdi lepo.
He didn't say much when he came back.	Ko se je vrnil, ni govoril veliko.
how are you?	kako si?
It's that simple too.	Tudi to je tako preprosto.
He can swim.	Zna plavati.
I was into it.	Bil sem v to.
I decided to go alone.	Odločil sem se, da grem sam.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Zdelo se je, da gre vse v redu.
Which they did.	Kar so storili.
Please if anyone can help.	Prosim, če lahko kdo pomaga.
No, he wasn't.	Ne, ni bil.
Seriously, we don’t know what could happen.	Resno, ne vemo, kaj bi se lahko zgodilo.
There's nothing I can do about it.	Glede tega ne morem nič.
Even today.	Še danes.
Good man.	Dober človek.
She was no longer in her room.	Ni je bilo več v svoji sobi.
And every day.	In vsak dan.
But he didn't have to.	Vendar mu ni bilo treba.
You mean well.	Dobro misliš.
I am enough.	Jaz sem dovolj.
The boy doesn't think so.	Fant ne misli tako.
And so will yours.	In tudi tvoj bo.
I thought we were lucky.	Mislil sem, da imamo srečo.
That's my boyfriend.	To je moj fant.
Do it fast, I understand! 	Naredi hitro, razumem!
It wasn't like that.	Ni bilo tako.
And there is no one.	In ni nikogar.
This is simply what we should do.	To je preprosto tisto, kar bi morali narediti.
What it was, we don't know.	Kaj je bilo, ne vemo.
It's not actually there.	Pravzaprav ni tam.
Not much, but some.	Ne veliko, nekaj pa.
Who really knows.	Kdo res ve.
There were a lot of us that day.	Ta dan nas je bilo veliko.
I wanted more children.	Želela sem si več otrok.
I didn’t expect it to be that way.	Nisem pričakoval, da bo tako.
What is it? 	Kaj je to?
I didn't know whether to believe her or not.	Nisem vedel, ali naj ji verjamem ali ne.
he asked.	je vprašal.
He needed something to live on.	Potreboval je nekaj za življenje.
It was fine.	Bilo je v redu.
I don’t know how he managed it.	Ne vem, kako mu je uspelo.
You won't be alone.	Ne boš sam.
If you will	Če boste
No one has done that yet.	Tega še nihče ni storil.
He did it tonight.	To je storil nocoj.
I would like to lose her too.	Tudi jaz bi jo rad izgubil.
This seems very unlikely.	To se zdi zelo malo verjetno.
Maybe something from me.	Mogoče kaj od mene.
Yours is the one who needs it.	Tvoj je tisti, ki ga potrebuje.
As if she knew something.	Kot da bi nekaj vedela.
I didn't find anything.	Nič nisem našel.
We're sorry too.	Tudi nam je žal.
They didn't see her.	Niso je videli.
Can anyone ask what the reason is.	Ali lahko kdo prosim kaj je razlog.
I can't now.	zdaj ne morem.
More time than we have.	Več časa, kot ga imamo.
You can't stay.	Ne moreš ostati.
Maybe they are.	Mogoče so.
There was no need.	Ni bilo treba.
Unfortunately not today.	Danes žal ne.
so can I.	lahko tudi jaz.
There is no time, my friend.	Čas ne obstaja, prijatelj.
One can never know for sure.	Nikoli se ne more zagotovo vedeti.
After that, only once a week.	Po tem le enkrat na teden.
It was more than that.	Bilo je več kot to.
I think it’s pretty obvious what’s in there.	Mislim, da je precej očitno, kaj je tam.
it's good.	je dobro.
Okay, okay, that was good.	Dobro, dobro, to je bilo dobro.
Nobody is.	Nihče ni.
And you'd be right.	In imel bi prav.
There was too much of it.	Preveč ga je bilo.
We went to the room together.	Skupaj sva šla v sobo.
I really mean it.	res to mislim.
They would know who they are.	Vedeli bi, kdo so.
I mean, I could.	Mislim, lahko bi.
She wasn't human.	Ni bila človek.
Sometimes, but not often.	Včasih, vendar ne pogosto.
I was surprised but very happy to go.	Bil sem presenečen, a zelo vesel, da sem šel.
What did he say?	Kaj je rekel?
He now lives at home.	Zdaj živi doma.
You can't leave.	Ne moreš oditi.
And that was now.	In to je bilo zdaj.
You were here.	Bili ste tukaj.
I do not know how.	Ne vem, kako.
You've ever done that.	Ste že kdaj naredili.
You don't care about anything.	Prav nič te ne zanima.
He won’t let anyone think he got it.	Ne bo dovolil, da bi kdo mislil, da je dobil.
Does that help ?.	Ali to pomaga?.
I'm sure he'll be back.	Prepričan sem, da se bo vrnil.
Maybe everything.	Mogoče vse.
There was no telling what she could do.	Ni bilo povedati, kaj bi lahko storila.
It's not mine.	To ni moje.
Does anyone know how to play? 	Ali kdo zna igrati?
he asked.	je vprašal.
What happened happened.	Kar se je zgodilo, se je zgodilo.
I think that is the question now.	Mislim, da je to vprašanje zdaj.
I would never do something like that.	Nikoli ne bi naredil kaj takega.
He doesn't need to be told where to go.	Ni mu treba povedati, kam naj gre.
I think it's wrong.	Mislim, da je narobe.
There are more of them.	Več jih je.
You should too.	Tudi ti bi moral.
I hope they are.	upam, da so.
I came.	Prišel sem.
He never saw it.	Nikoli ga ni videl.
I needed him to be there for me.	Potreboval sem ga, da je tam zame.
We have a lot of work to do.	Imamo veliko dela.
I like to think so.	Rad tako mislim.
The day has come.	Dan je prišel.
Let there be something.	Naj bo kaj.
I don't want to see anyone.	Nočem videti nikogar.
It's a game.	Igra pa je.
You were right about me.	Prav si imel glede mene.
I am tired.	Utrujen sem.
That would be too obvious.	To bi bilo preveč očitno.
You know, it's that simple.	Veste, tako preprosto je.
I still had them.	Še vedno sem jih imel.
And you have to help me.	In ti mi moraš pomagati.
This is really not a problem.	To res ni problem.
He will never, ever give me back.	Nikoli, nikoli mi ne bo vrnil.
It's really not that hard to do.	To res ni tako težko narediti.
You talked to him.	Govoril si z njim.
It was him.	To je bil on.
That's not it.	To ni to.
I'm glad he's here.	Vesel sem, da je tukaj.
Everything was fine.	Vse je bilo v redu.
And yet.	Pa vendar.
I simply said it was not happening.	Preprosto sem rekel, da se ne dogaja.
That seems to be wrong.	Zdi se, da je to narobe.
They were just lucky.	Imeli so samo srečo.
Unfortunately, that time has not yet come.	Žal ta čas še ni prišel.
I hope and believe that will not be the case.	Upam in verjamem, da ne bo tako.
However, this did not happen at all.	Vendar se to sploh ni zgodilo.
We have life.	Življenje imamo.
Actually I can't.	Pravzaprav ne morem.
Now I know none of this is true.	Zdaj vem, da nič od tega ni res.
That's what he expected.	To je pričakoval.
We never did that again.	Tega nismo storili nikoli več.
It's the same here.	Tako je tudi tukaj.
Probably very little.	Verjetno zelo malo.
Does not exist anymore.	Ne obstaja več.
I didn't mean that.	Nisem si tega mislil.
You never know what you're going to get.	Nikoli ne veš, kaj boš dobil.
I heard them talking.	Slišal sem jih govoriti.
It's always better.	Vedno bolje je.
I learned so much.	Toliko sem se naučil.
It's nothing.	Nič ni.
I just didn't know.	Samo nisem vedel.
In bi.	In bi.
None of this is true.	Nič od tega ni res.
That was something they did.	To je bilo nekaj, kar so storili.
Maybe I could learn something from you.	Mogoče bi se kaj naučil od tebe.
There is a reason for this.	Za to obstaja razlog.
Dad never wants to be alone.	Oče noče biti nikoli sam.
This is something that was sometimes not possible.	To je nekaj, kar včasih ni bilo mogoče.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
We did what we had to.	Naredili smo, kar smo morali.
There was no more money.	Ni bilo več denarja.
Perfectly in place.	Popolnoma na mestu.
I'm going to work.	Grem na delo.
Here we are.	Tukaj smo.
I didn't say much today.	Danes nisem veliko povedal.
They were already here.	Bili so že tukaj.
But all that needs to be said is this.	Vendar je treba povedati samo to.
She never wanted that.	Tega si nikoli ni želela.
And do it.	In naredi to.
We can't stay here.	Ne moremo ostati tukaj.
But no one lives here anymore.	Vendar tukaj nihče več ne živi.
Something is going on.	Nekaj ​​se dogaja.
He did everything he could to tell himself.	Vse, da bi si lahko povedal, je naredil vse.
They never have and probably never will.	Nikoli jih ni in verjetno tudi ne bo.
Maybe it would be right to do that here.	Morda bi bilo prav, če bi to naredili tukaj.
At the time, it seemed like nothing.	Takrat se je zdelo kot nič.
Now there are very few of them.	Zdaj jih je zelo malo.
There is someone out there who can help you.	Tam je nekdo, ki ti lahko pomaga.
I think there is a reason for that.	Mislim, da obstaja razlog za to.
I saw that.	To sem videl.
Nothing will ever be the same again.	Nič ne bo več tako, kot je bilo.
Tell me.	Povej z mano.
Nice to have you this morning.	Lepo, da te imam danes zjutraj.
Maybe too much.	Mogoče preveč.
And yet it never is.	Pa vendar nikoli ni.
In fact, it needs very few.	Pravzaprav jih zelo malo potrebuje.
I don't know if that's right.	Ne vem pa, če je to prav.
But that was never the case.	Vendar tega ni bilo nikoli.
It's so hard for all of us.	Vsem nam je tako težko.
We have to help him.	Pomagati mu moramo.
I hope he knows what he's doing.	Upam, da ve kaj dela.
I was very happy about that.	Tega sem bil zelo vesel.
I don't do that.	tega ne počnem.
You wanted to do everything really well.	Vse si želel narediti res dobro.
He was convinced.	Bil je prepričan.
A few days.	Nekaj ​​dni.
And he would too.	In tudi on bi.
One thinks this is not possible, but it was.	Človek misli, da to ni mogoče, vendar je bil.
He works for me.	On dela zame.
No one went there that day.	Ta dan ni šel nihče tja.
He was well prepared.	Bil je dobro pripravljen.
I loved her.	Všeč mi je bila.
We have to talk.	Moramo govoriti.
He won't be back for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa se ne bo vrnil.
He didn't expect that either.	Tudi tega ni pričakoval.
I used to like it.	Včasih mi je bilo všeč.
Everything they did to her.	Vse, kar so ji naredili.
Just a little bit more.	Samo še malo.
Unfortunately, this was not the case.	Žal temu ni bilo tako.
There was nothing of the sort.	Tega ni bilo nič.
Just let him talk to me.	Samo naj govori z mano.
Mine is even more so.	Moj je še bolj.
Everything is going well.	Vse gre dobro.
He's not afraid of me in the slightest.	Niti malo se me ne boji.
It worked.	To je uspelo.
I did everything possible.	Naredil sem vse, kar je bilo mogoče.
But maybe this is more my problem than yours.	Mogoče pa je to bolj moj problem kot tvoj.
She knew it was.	Vedela je, da je.
It was time to be alone.	Čas je bil, da sem sam.
You've had it long enough.	Dovolj dolgo si ga imel.
And the child was gone.	In otrok ni bilo več.
But that wasn't enough for her.	A to ji ni bilo dovolj.
He seems to be right.	Zdi se, da ima prav.
I would have told you earlier.	Povedal bi ti prej.
He didn't get it.	Ni ga dobil.
I can see that happening.	Vidim, da se to dogaja.
I am interested in.	Zanima me.
He was very alone.	Bil je zelo sam.
But he is.	Ali je on.
Are you .	Ali si .
It's still not right.	Še vedno ni prav.
And he was the only one.	In bil je edini.
I don't understand them.	Ne razumem jih.
I probably didn’t want to know.	Verjetno nisem hotel vedeti.
That's what he told me.	To mi je rekel.
I don’t believe he wanted to do that at all.	Ne verjamem, da je to sploh hotel narediti.
That is the problem.	V tem je problem.
He needed money.	Potreboval je denar.
I was alone.	Bila sem sama.
This can be done as follows.	To je mogoče storiti na naslednji način.
He also never asked her to play with him.	Prav tako je ni nikoli prosil, naj se igra z njim.
He has not forgotten us.	Ni nas pozabil.
It's just getting better.	Samo vedno bolje je.
Too much too.	Tudi preveč.
It's always me who's wrong.	Vedno sem jaz tisti, ki nimam prav.
Do you know that?	Ali to veš.
I knew very well where everyone was.	Zelo dobro sem vedel, kje so vsi.
I've never been here.	Nikoli nisem bil tukaj.
She's afraid of you.	Boji se te.
She knew that.	To je vedela.
He said his.	Povedal je svoje.
And maybe it had to be nothing.	In morda je morala biti nič.
I don't feel that way anymore.	Ne počutim se več tako.
You too and much more.	Tudi te in še veliko več.
It is a question of what is right.	Gre za vprašanje, kaj je prav.
There was no one there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar.
But I don't want it.	Vendar ga nočem.
So I don’t have enough time right now.	Tako da trenutno nimam dovolj časa.
You know, like a way to know what to do next.	Veste, kot način, kako vedeti, kaj storiti naprej.
I understand.	Razumem.
I thought it was going to be really hard, but it wasn’t.	Mislil sem, da bo res težko, a ni bilo.
He knows her.	Pozna jo.
Just a little bit more.	Samo še malo.
It's not me anymore.	To nisem več jaz.
He says it's time.	Pravi, da je čas.
That's why he bought this one.	Zato je kupil tega.
He meant what he said before.	Mislil je, kar je rekel prej.
I think you should have been there.	Mislim, da si moral biti tam.
I think we were right about that.	Mislim, da smo imeli pri tem prav.
This has never happened before.	Še nikoli se to ni zgodilo.
Maybe it's the same with you.	Morda je tako tudi pri vas.
I knew something was wrong.	Vedel sem, da je nekaj narobe.
Like, a lot more.	Kot, veliko več.
This man doesn't have you anymore, not anymore.	Ta človek te nima več, ne več.
He was never angry.	Nikoli ni bil jezen.
I have a job.	Imam delo.
I think there were a lot of people.	Mislim, da je bilo veliko ljudi.
She will love it.	To ji bo všeč.
That doesn’t help us much.	To nam ne pomaga veliko.
And so it is.	In tako je.
I won't need that.	tega ne bom potreboval.
You will never know why.	Nikoli ne boste vedeli zakaj.
That was my only chance.	To je bila moja edina priložnost.
I will stay.	Ostal bom.
But there may be too many.	Morda pa jih je preveč.
I can be there for you.	Lahko sem tam zate.
He would go with you.	On bi šel s tabo.
I know you.	Poznam te.
Someone is, that's for sure.	Nekdo je, to je zagotovo.
I haven't heard before.	Prej nisem slišal.
No one can help you.	Nihče vam ne more pomagati.
Yes, we are.	Da, smo.
This is very good.	To je zelo dobro.
Never again to say.	Nikoli več za povedati.
But I couldn't tell him that very well.	Tega pa mu nisem mogel prav dobro povedati.
From work.	Od dela.
he thought.	mislil je.
It probably is.	Verjetno je.
No no no no no.	Ne ne ne ne ne.
And the problem is the following.	In problem je naslednji.
Sam.	Sam.
Not even for dinner.	Niti na večerjo ne.
Now that wouldn’t usually be a problem.	Zdaj to običajno ne bi bil problem.
When he arrived, something was wrong.	Ko je prišel, je bilo nekaj narobe.
No problem.	Ni problem.
Everything will be.	Vse bo.
Actually, I rather expected it.	Pravzaprav sem to raje pričakoval.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu gre.
No one will do it for you.	Nihče tega ne bo naredil namesto vas.
He has to do it whether he likes it or not.	To mora storiti, če mu je všeč ali ne.
He didn't like anything anymore.	Nič mu ni bilo več všeč.
We are fine together.	Dobro nam je skupaj.
I really didn't.	res nisem.
Now that's the only thing.	Zdaj je to edina stvar.
We have to go there.	Moramo iti tja.
Apparently he wasn't in it for the money.	Očitno ni bil v tem zaradi denarja.
The problem is still there.	Problem je še vedno tam.
He wants to come home.	Želi, da pride domov.
Been there and done that.	Bil sem tam in naredil to.
You can't be everything to everyone.	Ne moreš biti vsem vse.
Why they did it.	Zakaj so to storili.
Nobody told him to do that.	Nihče mu ni rekel, naj to stori.
Because that's really the whole problem here.	Ker je to res ves problem tukaj.
I learned a lot about that.	O tem sem se veliko naučil.
He wasn't too happy about it.	Ni bil preveč vesel tega.
Maybe now was the right time.	Morda je bil zdaj pravi čas.
He said why not.	Rekel je zakaj ne.
He was always good to you.	Vedno je bil dober do tebe.
People just don’t care what he has to say.	Ljudi preprosto ne zanima, kaj ima za povedati.
It will too.	Tudi to bo.
No one knew where she went or why.	Nihče ni vedel, kam je šla in zakaj.
I went there.	Šel sem tja.
I don’t know what he thinks, what he knows and what he doesn’t.	Ne vem, kaj si misli, kaj ve in kaj ne.
It's very good.	Zelo je dobro.
I have a lot.	Imam veliko.
I just thought I should know.	Samo mislil sem, da bi moral vedeti.
i don't know what's going on.	ne vem kaj se dogaja.
More of that.	Več tega.
Nothing more to say about it.	Ni kaj več za povedati o tem.
Where he had to be.	Kje je moral biti.
But he didn't let that happen.	A tega ni pustil pri tem.
He told me a little.	Malo mi je rekel.
She knew she would have to see him soon.	Vedela je, da ga bo morala kmalu videti.
I just knew.	Samo vedel sem.
He can't do that.	Tega ne more storiti.
He had never seen them before.	Še nikoli jih ni videl.
So long ago.	Tako dolgo nazaj.
Not just him.	Ni samo on.
All right, it is.	Prav, je.
But that was not the only time.	A to ni bil edini čas.
And that's a good thing.	In to je dobra stvar.
It was very simple.	To je bilo zelo preprosto.
It will be like that again.	Tako bo spet.
But he was not here.	Vendar ga ni bilo tukaj.
He is a friend.	On je prijatelj.
Maybe a lot more.	Mogoče veliko več.
It was so obvious he didn’t know what to do.	Bilo je tako očitno, da ni vedel, kaj naj naredi.
He doesn't know what he's doing.	Ne ve, kaj počne.
I could get to him.	Lahko bi prišel do njega.
It's better.	Je bolje.
It was so beautiful that I was able to do it.	Bilo je tako lepo, da sem to lahko naredil.
I'm very good at it.	Zelo sem dobra v tem.
He didn't let her.	Ni ji dovolil.
I started you.	Začel sem te.
Not that there is anything wrong with that.	Saj ne, da bi bilo kaj narobe s tem.
He had something to tell me.	Imel mi je nekaj za povedati.
That was not right, none of that.	To ni bilo prav, nič od tega.
He was simply lucky the first time.	Prvič je preprosto imel srečo.
I can not believe.	Ne morem verjeti.
As if everything was beautiful.	Kot da je bilo vse lepo.
Who we were.	Ko smo bili mi.
You should see.	Moral bi videti.
So I did.	Tako sem naredil.
I said it was mine.	Rekel sem, da je moj.
I absolutely loved it.	Popolnoma mi je bilo všeč.
I would love to hear more about this.	Rad bi slišal več o tem.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
I know what my problem is.	Vem, kaj je moj problem.
He didn't want to tell him anymore.	Več mu ni hotel povedati.
For the better, obviously.	Na bolje, očitno.
I'll tell you what happens.	Povedal vam bom, kaj se bo zgodilo.
That's nice of him.	To je lepo od njega.
You really helped.	Res si pomagal.
And now something else.	Zdaj pa še nekaj.
He was just here.	Pravkar je bil tukaj.
I believe you.	jaz ti verjamem.
Not so fast.	Ne tako hitro.
I don't know about that.	Ne vem o tem.
That's so nice of you.	To je tako lepo od tebe.
It's been quite some time.	Bilo je kar nekaj časa.
There is nothing here for me now.	Zame zdaj tukaj ni nič.
He called me.	Poklical me je.
What he knew.	Kar je vedel.
More needs to be done.	Še več je treba narediti.
I was good to you.	bil sem dober zate.
What is he and man?	Kaj je in človek?
There are a lot of them now.	Zdaj jih je veliko.
Why didn't you come yesterday?	Zakaj nisi prišel včeraj?
It could be true.	Lahko bi bilo res.
I'm sorry.	Žal mi je.
No one will stay here.	Nihče ne bo ostal tukaj.
It was fine before that.	Pred tem je bilo v redu.
I would definitely get that.	To bi zagotovo dobil.
As it is, nothing is being done.	Tako kot je, se nič ne dela.
But we didn't see him.	Vendar ga nismo videli.
I have more than enough of that today.	Danes imam tega več kot dovolj.
You don't want to work there anyway.	Tako ali tako ne želite delati tam.
I have to go home soon.	Kmalu moram domov.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
I know that completely.	To popolnoma vem.
She would be there.	Bila bi tam.
Don't do that.	Ne naredi tega.
I did it myself.	Sam sem to naredil.
I'm happy for you.	Vesel sem zate.
You know, he was right.	Veste, imel je prav.
This is not something anyone would want.	To ni nekaj, kar bi si kdo želel.
This is clearly not the case.	To očitno ni tako.
We can't do more.	Ne moremo storiti več.
I would love to see that.	To bi rad videl.
what is	kaj je
It was very early.	Bilo je zelo zgodaj.
But he felt better.	Počutil se je pa bolje.
I don’t know what happened to that now.	Ne vem, kaj se je zdaj zgodilo s tem.
We haven't done that yet.	Tega nam še ni uspelo.
And you can have them.	In lahko jih imaš.
Boy, we really had our work cut out for us.	Fant, res smo imeli svoje delo.
How could we not know.	Kako ne bi vedeli.
You should probably know something.	Nekaj ​​bi verjetno morali vedeti.
We knew that.	To smo vedeli.
It seems even more so.	Zdi se, da še bolj.
They were lucky.	Imeli so srečo.
They are with me.	Z mano so.
He had too much work to do.	Imel je preveč dela.
You have to stay with me.	Moraš ostati z mano.
He heard no more.	Ni več slišal.
I just made it.	Pravkar mi je uspelo.
I'm just not sure.	Samo nisem prepričan.
I have to stay here.	Moram ostati tukaj.
So much for that.	Toliko o tem.
I hope you like it.	Upam, da vam bo všeč.
And he saw something more.	In videl je nekaj več.
But whether that will happen this week remains to be seen.	A ali se bo to zgodilo ta teden, še ni videti.
And that was it.	In to je bilo to.
It wasn't a day.	Ni bil dan.
I saw him every day.	Videl sem ga vsak dan.
Because he knew.	Ker je vedel.
Apparently few people know about it.	Očitno malo ljudi ve za to.
Maybe really.	Mogoče res.
We will never always be right.	Nikoli ne bomo imeli vedno prav.
It's not enough.	Ni dovolj.
And you too, my friend.	In tudi ti, prijatelj moj.
They are still there.	Še vedno so tam.
I actually forgot about it.	Pravzaprav sem pozabil na to.
You won't like that you were able to do this.	Ne bo vam všeč, da ste to lahko storili.
And it's true.	In res je.
Good.	Bom.
This has happened once before.	To se je že enkrat zgodilo.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
Nam.	Nam.
I don't think that's the case.	Mislim, da temu ni tako.
I just have to see her.	Samo videti jo moram.
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni več.
Need we say more?.	Ali moramo povedati več?.
He wanted much, much more.	Želel je veliko, veliko več.
He sings people.	Poje ljudi.
It was hard.	Bilo je težko.
I'd like to see you there.	Rad bi te videl tam.
Maybe a little more.	Mogoče še malo.
Or something like that.	Ali nekaj takega.
It's simple.	To je preprosto.
I don't see how he couldn't.	Ne vidim, kako ni mogel.
I wouldn't leave home without it.	Brez tega ne bi šel od doma.
I'll talk to him.	govoril bom z njim.
It is what it is, nothing more.	Je, kar je, nič več.
That's right, there are more.	Tako je, več jih je.
He can't do anything to us.	Ne more nam nič.
I am very sorry.	Zelo mi je žal.
So still.	Tako še vedno.
I'm over it right now.	Trenutno sem nad tem.
That's how he saw me.	Tako me je videl.
We liked it.	Všeč nam je bilo.
Okay, if that was the case.	V redu, če je bilo tako.
There will be more tomorrow afternoon.	Jutri popoldne jih bo več.
I wouldn’t be here if that were the option.	Ne bi bil tukaj, če bi bila to možnost.
Not much.	Ni veliko.
If he has it.	Če ga ima.
Which, as you probably know, failed.	Kar, kot verjetno veste, ni uspelo.
Probably not all.	Verjetno ne vsega.
I can't speak to it.	Ne morem govoriti s tem.
Keep things in place.	Naj bodo stvari na mestu.
It's me again.	Spet sem jaz.
They knew who they were.	Vedeli so, kdo so.
If someone could help me, that would be great.	Če bi mi kdo lahko pomagal, bi bilo lepo.
He knew what it was.	Vedel je, kaj je.
He can't reach you.	Ne more do tebe.
Enough about me.	Pa dovolj o meni.
We don't know anything about where he went.	O tem, kam je šel, ne vemo ničesar.
for me too.	tudi zame.
Your father.	Tvoj oče .
And he knows it.	In to tudi ve.
But it was not easy.	A ni bilo lahko.
She will know.	Vedela bo.
We have enough time.	Imamo dovolj časa.
I told him to go out.	Rekel sem mu, naj gre ven.
v.	v.
I haven't been able to since.	Od takrat mi ne gre.
This is obviously not me.	To očitno nisem jaz.
I do not know.	ne vem.
No, not now.	Ne, ne zdaj.
I can't help myself.	Ne morem si pomagati.
I don't care.	Sploh mi je.
He was tired.	Bil je utrujen.
He did it too.	Tudi on je to storil.
Maybe there is such a thing.	Mogoče obstaja kaj takega.
That's why he was there.	Zato je bil tam.
Lots of them.	Veliko jih.
You shouldn't go.	Ne bi smel iti.
I understand.	Razumem.
We don't like it.	Ni nam všeč.
Unfortunately, this is often not the case.	Žal pogosto ni tako.
This is a very good question.	To je zelo dobro vprašanje.
You don’t have to do that now.	Zdaj vam tega ni treba storiti.
He was the father of it all.	On je bil oče vsega tega.
It's time for me to go.	Čas je, da grem.
Tell him to do things.	Povej mu, naj naredi stvari.
He is alone there.	Tam je sam.
I wish you luck.	Želim ti srečo .
There was something wrong here.	Tukaj je bilo nekaj narobe.
don't you know? 	ne veste?
He tried to speak, but could not.	Poskušal je govoriti, a ni mogel.
More often than not.	Bolj pogosto kot ne.
Or if he did, no one told me.	Ali če je, mi nihče ni povedal.
I think he's good.	Mislim, da je dober.
You should see.	Moral bi videti.
That felt wrong.	To se je zdelo narobe.
Just for a while.	Samo za nekaj časa.
He wasn't ready for this day.	Ni bil pripravljen na ta dan.
Everyday.	Vsak dan.
It seemed nice.	Zdelo se je lepo.
All this is true.	Vse to je res.
And it really wasn't true.	In res ni bilo res.
He didn't want you to know.	Ni želel, da veš.
Sam didn't work.	Sam ni delal.
I never heard him again.	Nikoli več ga nisem slišal.
You told me so yourself.	Sam si mi tako rekel.
That's better.	Tako je bolje.
Came from almost nothing.	Prišel skoraj iz nič.
Maybe I would have done it sooner.	Morda bi to storila že prej.
That's right.	Tako je.
When was it?	Kdaj je bilo?
We already have several.	Imamo jih že več.
Sometimes he went for it himself.	Včasih je šel sam po to.
But it was my chance.	Vendar je bila to moja priložnost.
We were right then.	Takrat smo imeli prav.
This is where.	To je 'kje'.
I'm sorry this has to happen.	Žal mi je, da mora priti do tega.
The question is what happened.	Vprašanje, kaj se je zgodilo.
I know it will happen as it happened.	Vem, da se bo zgodilo, kot se je zgodilo.
You should see!	Moral bi videti!
And that was probably a good thing.	In to je bilo verjetno dobro.
Could I do more?	Ali bi lahko naredil več?
Or not.	Ali pa ne.
I stayed with it.	Ostal sem pri tem.
That may be all.	To je morda vse.
Not about me.	Ne o meni.
It seems so wrong.	Zdi se tako narobe.
That was it.	To je bilo tako.
I want to be sure.	Želim biti prepričan.
That it can be.	Da je lahko.
You should see him.	Moral bi ga videti.
No, it was not possible.	Ne, ni bilo mogoče.
You were there.	Bil si tam.
That's not right.	To ni v redu.
Only once a week.	Samo enkrat na teden.
And now he won't.	In zdaj ga ne bo.
We can know that.	To lahko vemo.
I know you know things.	Vem, da veš stvari.
Tell me if it isn't.	Povej mi, če ni.
Just for a few days.	Samo za nekaj dni.
She said it was fine.	Rekla je, da je v redu.
He decided not to.	Odločil se je, da ni.
Why not go now? 	Zakaj ne gre zdaj?
.	.
very.	zelo.
I went too.	Tudi jaz sem šel.
Something for tomorrow.	Nekaj ​​za jutri.
I don’t know because no one told me.	Ne vem, ker mi nihče ni povedal.
Po.	Po.
How's yours.	Kako je tvoj.
He liked it.	Všeč mu je bilo.
He is right in his own way.	Po svoje ima prav.
And all this happened because of you.	In vse to se je zgodilo zaradi tebe.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
He did it.	On je to storil.
He didn't eat.	Ni jedel.
Which is very, very hard to do.	Kar je zelo, zelo težko narediti.
I was not happy.	Nisem bil vesel.
He's in trouble.	Ima težave.
You will see what you get.	Boš videl kaj boš dobil.
And no one saw him.	In nihče ga ni videl.
He could hear.	Lahko je slišal.
Obviously.	Očitno.
Not so much since then.	Od takrat ne toliko.
I'll tell you what happens.	Povedal ti bom, kaj se bo zgodilo.
Go ahead.	Takoj naprej.
I didn't mean it.	nisem mislil.
And that's there too.	In tudi to je tam.
My work was only a matter of time.	Moje delo je bilo samo vprašanje časa.
The time for happiness is now.	Čas za srečo je zdaj.
You must be busy.	Moraš biti zaposlen.
That was him.	To je bil on.
Maybe we already are.	Morda smo že.
I can't believe it's almost here.	Ne morem verjeti, da je že skoraj tukaj.
I will help you with that.	Pomagal vam bom pri tem.
I haven't seen that before.	Tega še nisem videl.
No, that wasn't good.	Ne, to ni bilo dobro.
They knew nothing about it.	Nič niso vedeli o tem.
I tried, but it wasn’t possible.	Poskušal sem, a ni bilo mogoče.
So is mine.	Tako tudi moja.
I still have it.	Še vedno ga imam.
My father also had a job there.	Tudi oče je imel tam službo.
But you could.	Lahko pa bi.
Nothing will happen to you.	Nič se ti ne bo zgodilo.
And I'm fine with that.	In s tem sem v redu.
I've worked with him before.	Z njim sem že delal.
Something tells me we can do better.	Nekaj ​​mi pravi, da smo lahko boljši.
I didn't see that.	Tega nisem videl.
He had to.	Moral je.
He was sitting now.	Zdaj je sedel.
I think we need to know more about this.	Mislim, da moramo o tem vedeti več.
Yes, even more than now.	Da, še bolj kot zdaj.
We knew who they were.	Vedeli smo, kdo so.
That needs to be done.	To je treba storiti.
I can't believe he's here.	Ne morem verjeti, da je tukaj.
I was glad I was able to help.	Vesel sem bil, da sem lahko pomagal.
I thought it was good.	Mislil sem, da je dobro.
I would never be human.	Nikoli ne bi bil človek.
He can talk, but he doesn't speak.	Lahko govori, vendar ne govori.
More than fine.	Več kot v redu.
He didn't want to do that.	Tega ni hotel narediti.
Life is not that simple.	Življenje ni tako preprosto.
I thought you'd be home by now.	Mislil sem, da boš že doma.
I was really glad they did.	Res sem bil vesel, da so to storili.
It's about how you feel.	Gre za to, kako se ti zdi.
He got there.	Prišel je tja.
I forgot about all that.	Pozabil sem na vse to.
I don't know what for.	Ne vem pa za kaj.
I don't want to talk about it.	Ne želim govoriti o tem.
I'm sure not.	Prepričan sem, da ne.
I don't want to be that person anymore.	Nočem biti več ta oseba.
And you will.	In ti boš.
I didn't know when you would.	Nisem vedel, kdaj boš.
I could like it.	Lahko bi mi bil všeč.
And that's a good thing.	In to je dobra stvar.
And you're probably right.	In verjetno imaš prav.
It was just me.	Bil sem samo jaz.
It's not like that.	Ni tako.
In fact, he really wanted to.	Pravzaprav si je zelo želel.
Do more now.	Zdaj naredi več.
You know what that is.	Veš kaj je to.
And is.	In je.
She told herself she wouldn't.	Rekla si je, da ne bo.
I don't know what he did to you.	Ne vem, kaj ti je naredil.
I'm sure that's how you live.	Prepričan sem, da se tako živi.
Which was true enough.	Kar je bilo dovolj res.
I don't know anything about that.	Ne vem nič o tem.
He said he had never heard of it before.	Rekel je, da tega še nikoli ni slišal.
Probably a lot of time.	Verjetno veliko časa.
It doesn't seem so hard to me anymore.	Ne zdi se mi več tako težko.
I know I can.	Vem, da lahko.
What he needs.	Kaj potrebuje.
So sorry, so sorry.	Tako žal, tako žal.
I told her, nothing.	Rekel sem ji, nič.
I can't talk to you.	Ne morem govoriti s tabo.
He wanted to be alone.	Želel je biti sam.
I didn't know that at the time.	Takrat tega nisem vedel.
Or maybe the one after.	Ali morda tisti po.
No one could know.	Nihče ni mogel vedeti.
You don't know how to do it.	Ne veste, kako to storiti.
I could hear that.	To sem lahko slišal.
I still have this problem.	Še vedno imam ta problem.
He was right.	Prav je imel.
Again, he decided not to.	Spet se je odločil, da tega ne stori.
Just a little bit.	Še malo.
When you are right, you are right.	Ko imaš prav, imaš prav.
I was at it again.	Spet sem bil pri tem.
And anyone can do it.	In to lahko stori vsak.
I think he's right.	Mislim, da ima prav.
I wish you could see that.	Želim si, da bi to videli.
He did it his way.	Naredil je po svoje.
We are lucky to have her here.	Imamo srečo, da jo imamo tukaj.
If that happened to us.	Če bi se nam to zgodilo.
Maybe this and more.	Mogoče to in še več.
And we are.	In smo.
He won't do that.	Tega ne bo storil.
As if he wanted it that way.	Kot da je tako želel.
I really should.	res bi moral.
I never did.	nikoli nisem.
Do it right.	Naredi to prav.
I don't see anyone else.	Ne vidim nikogar drugega.
I think everyone should know that.	Mislim, da bi to morali vsi vedeti.
It seemed like a lot.	Zdelo se je veliko.
That is not enough.	To ni dovolj.
Only it's hard to do.	Le da je to težko narediti.
I do not like.	Ne maram.
And that's me.	In to sem jaz.
If he likes them, he will come back to you.	Če so mu všeč, se vam bo vrnil.
He wasn't there, but he knows.	Ni bil tam, a ve.
As it is, it cannot.	Tako kot je, ne more.
No one will ever know you helped me.	Nihče ne bo nikoli vedel, da si mi pomagal.
Life was and nothing more.	Življenje je bilo in nič več.
No one could.	Nihče ni mogel.
But he said it would not happen.	A je rekel, da se to ne bo zgodilo.
Because she won't know.	Ker ne bo vedela.
It seemed like it was true.	Zdelo se je, kot da je res.
I’m not at all sure this is even possible.	Sploh nisem prepričan, da je to sploh mogoče.
He just said he didn't want to.	Samo rekel je, da noče.
Here is my problem.	Tukaj je moj problem.
I'm sorry about last night.	Žal mi je za sinoči.
It's still mine.	Še vedno je moj.
He couldn’t stay to see what he had done to him.	Ni mogel ostati, da bi videl, kaj mu je naredil.
Really, really nice.	Res, prav lepo.
I never wanted that.	Tega si nisem nikoli želel.
There was absolutely nowhere to go.	Popolnoma ni bilo kam.
There is nothing wrong with that.	V tem ni nič narobe.
Not to us.	Ne do nas.
He couldn't do it before.	Prej ni mogel popolnoma.
And probably died.	In verjetno umrl.
This was not usual.	To ni bilo običajno.
No, it won't.	Ne, ne bo.
I would do anything for you.	Vse bi naredil zate.
I'm well prepared.	Dobro sem pripravljen.
We know how to do it.	Vemo, kako to narediti.
It makes me feel at home.	Zaradi tega se počutim kot doma.
To be alone from everything.	Biti sam od vsega.
She lives alone now.	Zdaj živi sama.
Or because of you.	Ali pa zaradi tebe.
Not even that.	Tudi tega ne.
Anyone would give anything to have it.	Vsak bi dal vse, da bi ga imel.
And if something goes wrong.	In če gre kaj narobe.
I don't know why he doesn't talk.	Ne vem zakaj ne govori.
It was so beautiful.	Bilo je tako lepo.
Not us, not me.	Ne mi, ne jaz.
I'm sure not.	Prepričan sem, da ni.
I told him good work.	Rekel sem mu dobro delo.
It was hard, it was hard.	Bilo je težko, bilo je težko.
However, it is much more than that.	Vendar pa je veliko več kot to.
I'm afraid he lost it.	Bojim se, da ga je izgubil.
I knew that for sure.	To sem zagotovo vedel.
You will.	Ti boš.
He never said why.	Nikoli ni rekel zakaj.
He was very tired and just wanted to go home.	Bil je zelo utrujen in hotel je samo domov.
I thought you'd be mad.	Mislil sem, da boš jezen.
It never will be.	Nikoli ne bo.
You usually don't care.	Običajno te to ne zanima.
As if it never happened.	Kot da se nikoli ni zgodilo.
She wanted to know, she had to know.	Želela je vedeti, morala je vedeti.
But he was a very good father.	Vendar je bil zelo dober oče.
At the party.	Na zabavi.
Not that you were.	Ne da si bil.
There is no other.	Drugega ni.
No one talked to me.	Nihče ni govoril z mano.
The boy didn't come home last night.	Fant sinoči ni prišel domov.
If it is not there, nothing will happen.	Če tega ni, se ne bo zgodilo nič.
Too much.	Preveč.
Let it be so.	Naj bo tako.
Maybe so.	Morda je tako.
This is neither here nor there.	To ni ne tukaj ne tam.
He sat back.	Sedel je nazaj.
And it goes on.	In gre naprej.
She didn't like the man.	Človek ji ni bil všeč.
Hard to do.	Težko narediti.
You would like that.	To bi ti bilo všeč.
And so much has been with me.	In veliko tako je bilo z mano.
There is a good reason for this.	Za to obstaja dober razlog.
This has never been a problem.	To nikoli ni bil problem.
I just think it's the way it is.	Samo mislim, da je tako kot je.
And so on.	In tako naprej.
I can't even.	niti ne morem.
Because you don't know.	Ker ne veš.
Everything has its time.	Vse ima svoj čas.
Something is wrong here.	Tukaj nekaj ni v redu.
I think it could happen.	Mislim, da bi se lahko zgodilo.
I didn't look out of place.	Nisem bil videti na mestu.
There was very little of that.	Tega je bilo zelo malo.
He didn't give it to her.	Ni ji ga dal.
And it felt so good.	In bilo mi je tako dobro.
You will be here.	Tukaj boš.
She liked it.	Všeč ji je bilo.
And very seriously.	In zelo resno.
He told me he did.	Povedal mi je, da je.
Right man, right time.	Pravi človek, pravi čas.
To go out.	Da grem ven.
That thing?	Ta stvar?
This one is mine.	Ta je moj.
She wouldn't be.	Ne bi bila.
I want him.	Želim si ga.
And that is.	In to je.
We saw people who had children.	Videli smo ljudi, ki so imeli otroke.
And so it goes.	In tako to gre.
Can anyone do that.	Ali lahko kdo to naredi.
I understand that.	Razumem to.
I love this game.	Všeč mi je ta igra.
She said she knew.	Rekla je, da ve.
He comes and goes.	Pride in gre.
That has to go.	To mora iti.
And he realized something else.	In spoznal je nekaj drugega.
He knew that.	To je vedel.
I saw a book from there.	Od tam sem videl knjigo.
We would never do that.	Tega ne bi nikoli naredili.
If that's it.	Če je to to.
You never asked me anything.	Nikoli me nisi nič vprašal.
I tried to talk.	Poskušal sem govoriti.
This one for sure.	Ta pa zagotovo.
I went back to that.	Vrnil sem se k temu.
And it’s good that we should.	In dobro je, da bi morali.
You are more than enough.	Ste več kot dovolj.
He was not.	Ni bil.
All or nothing.	Vse ali nič.
Now he's back.	Zdaj se je vrnil.
I was quite surprised and asked if it really was there.	Bil sem precej presenečen in vprašal sem, če je res bilo tam.
No money.	Ni denarja.
I still don't understand.	Še vedno ne razumem.
That's fine.	To je v redu.
I could lose her.	Lahko bi jo izgubil.
I'm ready now.	Zdaj sem pripravljen.
I had so many once.	Enkrat sem jih imel toliko.
That doesn't feel good.	To se ne počuti dobro.
It's not about the money.	Ne gre za denar.
Tomorrow he will do even more than today.	Jutri bo naredil še več kot danes.
I had to do it.	Moral sem narediti.
And there is a reason.	In obstaja razlog.
They didn't really know.	Pravzaprav niso vedeli.
He didn't say that.	Tega ni rekel.
I told him he didn't live there.	Povedal sem mu, da ne živi tam.
Maybe you're a little.	Mogoče si malo.
The reason is as follows.	Razlog je naslednji.
And so on and so forth.	In tako naprej in tako naprej.
I'm not sure why that is.	Nisem prepričan, zakaj je temu tako.
She didn't have to.	Ni ji bilo treba.
Until last night.	Do sinoči.
I told you that.	To sem ti povedal.
I had to talk.	Moral sem govoriti.
Which was fine.	Kar je bilo v redu.
he thought.	mislil je.
He said no.	Rekel je, da ne.
I think I could help you.	Mislim, da bi ti lahko pomagal.
This does not seem to be the case here.	Tukaj se zdi, da ni tako.
We don't have to do anything tonight.	Nocoj nam ni treba narediti ničesar.
I mean, we're not sure.	Mislim, nismo prepričani.
I mean it.	mislim to.
Or about that.	Ali pa o tem.
Maybe no one was good enough.	Morda nihče ni bil dovolj dober.
He's going out.	On gre ven.
Not many people know about this.	O tem ne ve veliko ljudi.
It's pretty simple.	Precej preprosto je.
I know him well.	dobro ga poznam.
I wish there was someone else.	Želim si, da bi bil še kdo.
He liked this one.	Ta mu je bil všeč.
Even Sam would be behind him.	Tudi Sam bi bil za njim.
That's how I want to see him.	Tako si ga želim videti.
I don't understand what to do now.	Ne razumem, kaj naj zdaj grem.
It would never be him.	Nikoli ne bi bil on.
I better see if he's home.	Bolje, da vidim, če je doma.
I'll call you in the morning.	Poklical te bom zjutraj.
I heard you talk.	Slišal sem te govoriti.
He said he didn't like her.	Rekel je, da je ne mara.
Once he leaves, he will not return.	Ko bo enkrat odšel, se ne bo vrnil.
It seems fine to me.	Meni se zdi v redu.
They wouldn't know about it.	Za to ne bi vedeli.
Now he didn't know where to go.	Zdaj ni vedel, kam naj gre.
There was a lot to say.	Veliko je bilo za povedati.
I would win.	Zmagal bi.
No, you didn't.	Ne, nisi.
You should stay with us.	Moral bi ostati pri nas.
He asked me what it was.	Vprašal me je, kaj je to.
In fact, more than him.	Pravzaprav bolj kot on.
There was simply no time for that.	Za to preprosto ni bilo časa.
This is serious.	To je resno.
He did that.	To je storil.
That doesn't seem right to me.	To se mi ne zdi prav.
They were both three.	Oba sta bila po tri.
Someone will do it for you.	Nekdo bo to naredil namesto vas.
Tell.	Povej.
I wish I would.	Želim si, da bi.
That's how it seemed to me.	Tako se mi je zdelo.
She didn't think it was likely.	Ni se ji zdelo verjetno.
It's that simple.	To je tako preprosto.
I wonder where he lives now.	Sprašujem se, kje zdaj živi.
I won't be able to see them.	Ne bom jih mogel videti.
I can't leave.	Ne morem oditi.
I'm home.	doma sem.
I think it works too much.	Mislim, da ga preveč dela.
There won't be much work.	Ne bo veliko dela.
I really want to.	Zelo si želim.
He wouldn't let me leave without him.	Ni mi pustil, da bi odšel brez njega.
He was here.	Bil je tukaj.
I still had work to do.	Imel sem še delo.
I just know.	Samo vem.
You never did that.	Tega nisi nikoli naredil.
There are few people in the city.	V mestu je malo ljudi.
That was what he wanted.	To je bilo tisto, kar je hotel.
I wish I had.	Želim si, da bi imel.
He does what he has to do.	Dela, kar mora.
Because it was here again.	Ker je bilo spet tukaj.
We should leave.	Morali bi oditi.
That's a lot more.	To je veliko več.
Everyone knows someone.	Vsak pozna nekoga.
She will love you.	Všeč ji boš.
Actually, not us.	Pravzaprav ne mi.
More than once, maybe.	Več kot enkrat, morda.
You might like it.	Morda ti bo všeč.
It's so hard for us !.	Tako težko nam je!.
i don't know what to think.	ne vem kaj naj si mislim.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
If not further.	Če ne naprej.
It could be years.	Lahko so leta.
So it will be.	Tako bo.
No one had much to say.	Nihče ni imel veliko za povedati.
What he could do, he did.	Kar je lahko naredil, je naredil.
He worked on it for years.	Na tem je delal leta.
I wasn’t that good at it.	V tem nisem bil tako dober.
I didn’t see her out much.	Nisem jo videl veliko ven.
Something has to stay.	Nekaj ​​mora ostati.
And we are.	In smo.
And still nothing.	Pa še vedno nič.
He loved him very much.	Zelo rad ga je imel.
I probably would.	Verjetno bi.
Hard.	Težko.
I had to be.	Moral sem biti.
And it will.	In bo.
And we are lucky.	In imamo srečo.
And also not very good.	In tudi ne zelo dobro.
He gave him everything he ever asked for.	Dal mu je vse, kar je kdaj prosil.
My thing is to know.	Moja stvar je vedeti.
He was the one who should know things.	On je bil tisti, ki bi moral vedeti stvari.
It will be there for many years.	Tam bo več let.
A little.	Malo.
Life with us.	Življenje z nami.
There is nothing he can do.	On ne more storiti ničesar.
Ready to go.	Pripravljen da grem.
We have all day.	Ves dan imamo.
He was obviously tired, too.	Očitno je bil tudi utrujen.
I still don't understand them.	Še vedno jih ne razumem.
I believe you are.	verjamem, da si.
She's not here anymore.	Ni je več tukaj.
You don’t know what you did.	Ne veste, kaj ste storili.
We went on.	Šla sva naprej.
I'll call her.	jo bom poklical.
I don't know any more about this than you do.	O tem ne vem nič več kot ti.
He'll be fine.	Bil bo v redu.
That's all.	Samo to je.
If they are not, they are not.	Če niso, ni.
It actually is.	Pravzaprav je.
I wanted to see it again.	Hotel sem videti še enkrat.
It's nice to be back !.	Lepo je biti nazaj!.
I never wanted to do that.	Tega nisem nikoli hotel narediti.
He was glad to be back.	Vesel je bil, da se je vrnil.
No one knows what to do.	Nihče ne ve, kaj storiti.
If it was usual.	Če je bilo običajno.
And they still are.	In še vedno so.
He just left.	Pravkar je odšel.
I, on the other hand, had the money myself.	Jaz pa je imel denar sam.
This will not happen again.	To se ne bo več zgodilo.
Only that they will make it for you.	Samo da ti ga bodo naredili.
There is too much going on.	Preveč se dogaja.
And it will never be that way again.	In nikoli več ne bo tako.
That's why you needed so many people.	Zato si potreboval toliko ljudi.
I knew then.	Takrat sem vedel.
He liked where he was now.	Všeč mu je bilo, kje je zdaj.
I really like that.	To mi je zelo všeč.
Nice to see you.	Lepo te je videti.
Only.	Samo.
And it was good.	In bilo je dobro.
I would like to stay	rad bi ostal
It was nice to see you again.	Lepo te je bilo spet videti.
That's what he wants.	To je tisto, kar želi.
I asked her for help.	Prosil sem jo za pomoč.
I need a lot.	Potrebujem kar veliko.
And so it can be.	In tako je lahko.
He learned a lot.	Naučil se veliko.
He didn't mean it to me.	Ni mi mislil.
Keep it up.	Kar tako naprej.
It's very good.	Je zelo dobro.
You should know better.	Morala bi vedeti bolje.
They are nothing.	Nič niso.
Or is it? 	Ali je?
You have to go there with him.	Moraš iti tja z njim.
Not with us.	Ne pri nas.
That's it.	To je to.
He should be here now.	Zdaj bi moral biti tukaj.
I thought you might like it.	Mislil sem, da ti bo morda všeč.
I did what you said.	Naredil sem, kar si rekel.
And there really is much more.	In res je še veliko več.
That's not even an option.	To niti ni možnost.
I did it myself.	To sem naredil tudi sam.
There was no telling.	Ni bilo povedati.
But you don't have to stay long.	A pri tem ni treba dolgo ostati.
I couldn’t help but wonder how this man was so lucky.	Nisem si mogel pomagati, da se ne bi vprašal, kako je imel ta človek tako srečo.
Always, when, when.	Vedno, kdaj, kdaj.
Not so long ago.	Ne tako dolgo nazaj.
It is often difficult to say what he thinks.	Pogosto je težko povedati, kaj misli.
He can't leave.	Ne more oditi.
There weren't any.	Ni jih bilo.
That’s when I knew what it was.	Takrat sem vedel, kaj je to.
In the morning.	Zjutraj.
It’s pretty common now.	Zdaj je precej pogosto.
In and out.	V in ven.
Here is all he had to say.	Tukaj je vse, kar je imel povedati.
This is really hard for us.	To je res težko za nas.
I will do everything for you.	Vse bom naredil zate.
But maybe that’s just as good.	Morda pa je to prav tako dobro.
Maybe it's a lot or maybe not so much.	Mogoče je veliko ali pa ne tako veliko.
That's where I decided.	Tam sem se odločil.
You should go back.	Moral bi iti nazaj.
We are the ones at the moment.	Trenutno smo tisti.
To move on.	Da grem naprej.
It's just for us.	To je samo za nas.
No one knew where.	Nihče ni vedel, kje.
Nobody lives there.	Tam nihče ne živi.
The only child at this.	Edini otrok pri tem.
We just weren't.	Samo nismo bili.
I know how it is.	Vem, kako je.
He decided not to do that.	Odločil se je, da tega ne bo storil.
It's up to me.	Na meni je.
He now had three.	Zdaj je imel tri.
I never made it.	Nikoli mi ni uspelo.
She will know you loved her.	Vedela bo, da si jo imel rad.
It could be nothing.	Lahko bi bilo nič.
I do not know why.	Ne vem za kaj.
I will not say.	ne bom povedal.
I said very little.	rekel sem zelo malo.
She said who she was.	Rekla je, kdo je.
This is very, very difficult to talk about.	O tem je zelo, zelo težko govoriti.
the teacher asked.	je vprašal učitelj.
It's not that simple.	Ni tako preprosto.
Those.	Tisti.
Tell me again.	Povej mi še enkrat.
This is not an easy job.	To ni lahko delo.
And all this because of you.	In vse to zaradi tebe.
No one seems to know what’s going on.	Zdi se, da nihče ne ve, kaj se dogaja.
But I was happy.	Vendar sem bil vesel.
Now I know what is good.	Zdaj vem, kaj je dobro.
It works really well.	Dela res dobro.
I had such a good life.	Imel sem tako dobro življenje.
That's not what he does.	To ni tisto, kar počne.
You're doing much better.	Veliko bolje ti gre.
He was always waiting for her to come home.	Vedno je čakal, da pride domov.
This will make it difficult for me to help you.	Zaradi tega vam bom težko pomagal.
Or it's just me.	Ali pa sem samo jaz.
She said she had no plans.	Rekla je, da nič ne namerava.
First time from him.	Prvič od njega.
He could do as he should.	Lahko bi naredil, kot mora.
I just want you to know.	Samo želim, da veš.
He came to my house today.	Danes je prišel k meni domov.
And that's that.	In to je to.
You are alone.	Sami ste.
My father did nothing wrong.	Moj oče ni naredil nič narobe.
Was.	Je bil.
Everything was as it should be.	Vse je bilo tako, kot mora biti.
I need to see something.	Moram nekaj videti.
There aren't many of them.	Ni jih veliko.
But he was also lucky.	Imel pa je tudi srečo.
We would be together.	Bili bi skupaj.
It really helps !.	Res pomaga!.
He knew that day would come.	Vedel je, da bo ta dan prišel.
They would probably do very well themselves.	Sami bi verjetno naredili zelo dobro.
Just father.	Samo oče.
Sometimes it felt like the time would never come.	Včasih se je zdelo, da čas ne bo nikoli prišel.
You have to help me.	Moraš mi pomagati.
But it wasn’t from him.	Vendar ni bilo od njega.
But it was true.	Vendar je bilo res.
I will give it.	To bom dal.
And that can't be right.	In to ne more biti prav.
He died today.	Umrl je danes.
Someone left him here.	Nekdo ga je pustil tukaj.
In fact, a lot of money.	Pravzaprav kar veliko denarja.
Not a day.	Ne dan.
I couldn't take it anymore.	Nisem mogel več.
He worked very long.	Delal je zelo dolgo.
He had plenty of time.	Imel je dovolj časa.
Please don't tell him anything.	Prosim, ne govori mu ničesar.
There was nothing else he could do.	Nič drugega ni mogel storiti.
She knew she was right.	Vedela je, da ima prav.
Everyone knew.	Vsi so vedeli.
He's heard you before.	Te je že slišal.
I love this job.	Všeč mi je to delo.
It's just there forever.	Samo tam je za vedno.
She would like that.	To bi ji bilo všeč.
Not today.	Danes pa ne.
than to be.	kot biti.
I really like them.	Prav všeč so mi.
Life was no longer easy.	Življenje ni bilo več preprosto.
He had to come.	Moral je priti.
He died.	Je umrl.
I didn't talk to you.	Nisem govoril s tabo.
When he left, I didn’t sit for long.	Ko je odšel, nisem sedel dolgo.
We had enough.	Imeli smo dovolj.
Not that I could do anything about it.	Ne, da bi lahko kaj storil glede tega.
Again, this is true.	Še enkrat, to je res.
It would be nice.	Lepo bi bilo.
Enough of that.	Dovolj tega.
They will definitely be there.	Zagotovo bodo tam.
There must be a problem.	Mora biti problem.
This has always been a problem.	To je bil vedno problem.
It may have existed long before that.	Morda obstaja že dolgo pred tem.
He didn't want to, but he had to.	Ni hotel, a je moral.
I think that's nice.	Mislim, da je to lepo.
It can't be true.	Ne more biti res.
However, they never will.	Vendar pa nikoli ne bodo.
But I really don’t know how to do that.	Res pa ne vem, kako to narediti.
He does nothing for me.	Nič ne naredi zame.
A long, long time ago.	Dolgo, dolgo nazaj.
It seemed fine.	Zdelo se je v redu.
He didn't want me.	Ni me hotel.
Not with him, that’s for sure.	Ne z njim, to je zagotovo.
Certainly not!	Zagotovo ne!
We can't go tonight or tomorrow.	Ne moremo iti nocoj ali jutri.
I don't know if we should help him.	Ne vem, če bi mu morali pomagati.
He will probably come back for more.	Verjetno se bo vrnil po več.
He talks to me all the time.	Ves čas mi govori.
Is that so good.	Je to tako dobro.
I'll buy this.	To bom kupil.
It's beautiful here.	Tukaj je lepo.
Maybe he was right.	Mogoče je imel prav.
He decided what he was going to do.	Odločil se je, kaj bo naredil.
I know you can't see everything.	Vem, da ne moreš videti vsega.
I should.	Moral bi.
I won't tell you anything about it.	Nič ti ne bom povedal o tem.
It’s good to go the way it is.	Dobro je iti tako kot je.
I played well that day.	Tisti dan sem igral dobro.
I didn't know he would be here.	Nisem vedel, da bo tukaj.
I don't like you.	ne maram te.
A little too good.	Malo preveč dobro.
I'm going out.	Jaz grem ven.
I hope someone can help.	Upam, da lahko kdo pomaga.
He is a man.	On je človek.
He had none of that.	Nič od tega ni imel.
Maybe they did.	Morda so to storili.
We have to be there.	Tam moramo biti.
I heard that too.	To sem tudi slišal.
You are that person.	Ti si ta oseba.
However, he refuses to go.	Vendar pa noče iti.
And it will.	In bo.
Maybe it's true.	Mogoče je res.
You have to get out.	Moraš priti ven.
I can't believe he's doing this to you.	Ne morem verjeti, da ti to počne.
I wanted my life back.	Hotel sem svoje življenje nazaj.
I don't want to see anyone.	Nočem videti nikogar.
There was something.	Nekaj ​​je bilo.
He decided.	Odločil se je.
He had everything, but it still wasn't enough.	Imel je vse, a še vedno ni bilo dovolj.
It was like being a child again.	Bilo je, kot da bi bil spet otrok.
I don’t do this often, but it happened.	Tega ne počnem pogosto, vendar se je zgodilo.
I would never expect it from you.	Nikoli ne bi pričakoval od tebe.
There is a good reason.	Obstaja dober razlog.
Maybe better if we had.	Mogoče bolje, če bi imeli.
Probably more than usual.	Verjetno več kot običajno.
I know you were just a good friend.	Vem, da si bil samo dober prijatelj.
I better go now.	Bolje, da grem zdaj.
You said he was talking to you.	Rekel si, da je govoril s tabo.
I don't know what he said.	Ne vem pa, kaj je rekel.
I couldn't see well.	Nisem mogel dobro videti.
He just doesn't know.	Samo ne ve.
And all because you didn't know you were ready.	In vse zato, ker nisi vedel, da si pripravljen.
He was a good man.	Bil je dober človek.
He found very few of them.	Našel jih je zelo malo.
We don't really know what happened.	Pravzaprav ne vemo, kaj se je zgodilo.
He would do it.	On bi to storil.
I need to do more.	Moram narediti več.
We knew who we were.	Vedeli smo, kdo smo.
That's how I was.	Tako sem bil.
Or it never seemed to come out.	Ali pa se je zdelo, da nikoli ni prišel ven.
I don't know what they are.	Ne vem, kaj so.
I couldn't believe it.	Tega nisem mogel verjeti.
He didn't have that either.	Tudi on tega ni imel.
I'm afraid it's that simple.	Bojim se, da je tako preprosto.
But they are gone.	Vendar jih ni več.
Has anyone seen anything like this ?.	Je kdo videl kaj takega?.
Actually more likely.	Pravzaprav bolj verjetno.
He said it well.	Dobro je rekel.
I don't have to tell you.	Ni mi treba povedati.
There's a lot of them.	Veliko jih je.
I don't know anything about that.	Ne vem nič o tem.
The boy looked tired.	Fant je bil videti utrujen.
No, nothing yet.	Ne, še nič.
But there was no time for that.	A za to ni bilo časa.
i will go home too.	jaz bom šel tudi domov.
I'm tired of it.	Utrujen sem od tega.
I've never seen that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem videl.
And no one has ever seen that.	In tega nihče ni nikoli videl.
She didn't want him anymore, no.	Ni ga več želela, ne.
Apparently I didn’t do it for the money.	Očitno tega nisem storil zaradi denarja.
They both went out.	Oba sta šla ven.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ni.
I kept talking.	Kar naprej sem govoril.
I'm not out.	nisem ven.
You've never been there.	Nikoli nisi bil tam.
I always liked her.	Vedno mi je bila všeč.
There was little.	Tam je bilo malo.
I think she would love it.	Mislim, da bi ji bilo všeč.
He had three children.	Imel je tri otroke.
There was something more.	Bilo je nekaj več.
And maybe he's right.	In morda ima prav.
This is on a good day.	To je na dober dan.
He didn't hear anything.	Ničesar ni slišal.
That is true enough.	To je dovolj res.
They have not been seen since.	Od takrat jih ni bilo več.
I think he's afraid of it.	Mislim, da se tega boji.
Because there weren't any.	Ker jih ni bilo.
He thought so.	Tako je mislil.
I'll try to get there early.	Poskušal bom priti zgodaj.
They didn't do that.	Tega niso storili.
I saw what was going on.	Videl sem, kaj se dogaja.
I wished it was better.	Želela sem si, da bi bilo bolje.
I hope you get enough.	Upam, da boš dobil dovolj.
Not for nothing.	Ne za nič.
I'm not a child.	Nisem otrok.
Do it once, good.	Naredi to enkrat, dobro.
And so he came to me.	In tako je prišel k meni.
I just don't know how to do it.	Samo ne vem, kako to narediti.
There have been many of them since then.	Od takrat jih je bilo veliko.
I want to know how the game is played.	Želim vedeti, kako se igra igra.
Very.	Zelo.
And there is not much to say.	In ni veliko za povedati.
I wonder how long he's been there.	Sprašujem se, kako dolgo je že tam.
I don't know where I could be.	Ne vem, kje bi lahko bil.
Or he thought he had it.	Ali pa je mislil, da ga ima.
Maybe I would leave.	Mogoče bi odšel.
I need a job.	Potrebujem službo.
I knew it.	Vedel sem.
That's not a problem.	To ni problem.
How you doing.	Kako ti gre.
Better this than nothing.	Bolje to kot nič.
He was angry.	Bil je jezen.
I think it will be soon.	Mislim, da bo kmalu.
So he left.	Zato je odšel.
I've been there before.	Tam sem bil že prej.
I don't know what happened to me.	Ne vem, kaj se je zgodilo z mano.
You did very well.	Zelo dobro si naredil.
No one could tell what happened.	Nihče ni mogel povedati, kaj se je zgodilo.
We are not.	Nismo.
No one could see him, but he could see no one.	Nihče ga ni mogel videti, a tudi on nikogar.
Maybe he's here.	Mogoče je tukaj.
And here it is.	In tukaj je.
Not much time.	Ni veliko časa.
And yet.	In vendar.
He was tired, so tired.	Bil je utrujen, tako utrujen.
They haven't been here yet.	Tukaj še niso bili.
I really couldn’t take that long anymore.	Res ne bi mogel več tako dolgo.
Did you see that!	Ali si videl to!
Is it there or not.	Ali je tam ali pa ni.
More and more is happening.	Dogaja se vedno več.
So much for that.	Toliko o tem.
He did so much.	Toliko je naredil.
It never is and it never will be.	Nikoli ni in nikoli ne bo.
I thought he was going to go.	Mislil sem, da bo šel.
We should go.	Morali bi iti.
No, it must be something else.	Ne, mora biti nekaj drugega.
That's why we're here.	Zato smo tukaj.
This will be difficult.	To bo težko.
I know that now.	Zdaj to vem.
It seems so, she said.	Tako se zdi, je rekla.
I really think so.	Mislim pa res.
He must leave immediately.	Takoj mora oditi.
He knew nothing.	Nič ni vedel.
He needed me.	Potreboval me je.
I’m not sure if that’s possible.	Nisem prepričan, če je to mogoče.
Live with it.	Živi s tem.
which is very nice.	kar je zelo lepo.
Nothing does anything.	Nič ne naredi ničesar.
No, he couldn't speak at the moment.	Ne, trenutno ni mogel govoriti.
That's all.	To je vse.
But not for a few days.	To pa ne za nekaj dni.
I wanted to see her.	Hotel sem jo videti.
Nobody does that anymore.	Tega nihče več ne počne.
I do not doubt.	ne dvomim.
I think on and on.	Mislim naprej in naprej.
He is there.	Tam je.
Please don't talk to me now.	Prosim, ne govori z mano, zdaj.
What is wrong with you? 	Kaj je narobe s tabo?
he asked.	je vprašal.
And it really may or may not be.	In res je lahko ali pa tudi ne.
I've never seen them before.	Še nikoli jih nisem videl.
It's not out yet.	Še ni ven.
And yet it was not.	Pa vendar ni bilo.
I would come here for the children.	Prišel bi sem po otroke.
I'm not sure, really.	Nisem prepričan, res.
I can't be sure about that.	Ne morem biti prepričan o tem.
It's a hotel.	To je hotel.
The boy refused to speak.	Fant ni hotel govoriti.
You and only you will.	Ti in samo ti boš.
I really knew that.	To sem res vedel.
She already told me no.	Rekla mi je že ne.
And it didn't happen.	In to se ni zgodilo.
Who knows you're with us.	Kdo ve, da si z nami.
That's why it's happening.	Zato se to dogaja.
He didn't see where they were going.	Ni videl, kam sta šla.
He asked for you.	Prosil je zate.
You should see it.	Morali bi ga videti.
There is nothing we can do.	Nič ne moremo storiti.
Or maybe.	Ali pa morda.
He asked for you.	Prosil je za vas.
And you will get it.	In dobil boš.
I thought you meant it.	Mislil sem, da si to mislil.
There is still a lot of work to be done.	Še veliko dela.
And yet you could.	Pa vendar bi lahko.
I'll bring you back.	Vrnil te bom.
I haven't seen it yet.	še nisem videl.
You still have them.	Še vedno jih imaš.
That's wrong.	To je narobe.
Maybe that was the problem.	Mogoče je bil to problem.
He will be.	Bil bo.
Or right away.	Ali pa takoj.
It's not like that.	Ni tako, kot je.
Do you think I could eat like that?	Misliš, da bi lahko jedel tako?
I know what happened, and so do you.	Vem, kaj se je zgodilo, in tudi ti.
I saw that.	To sem videl.
You saw her.	Videl si jo.
Few people know that.	Malo ljudi to ve.
So we did it.	Tako smo naredili to.
i will not do that.	jaz tega ne bom storil.
He wasn't home yet.	Še ni bil doma.
Enough with him.	Dovolj z njim.
I told him no.	Rekel sem mu ne.
You are too.	Tudi ti si.
I know everything.	Vse vem.
I really do.	To res počnem.
I have now.	zdaj imam.
All this and more.	Vse to in še več.
Just like right now.	Tako kot trenutno.
It will be for another.	Za drugega bo.
I just wanted someone else to know.	Hotel sem samo, da bi vedel še kdo.
The question is what can be done.	Vprašanje je, kaj se da narediti.
We are not what is happening to us.	Nismo to, kar se nam dogaja.
It was all what and where and how and why, why, why.	Vse je bilo kaj in kje in kako in zakaj, zakaj, zakaj.
You should know better.	Moral bi vedeti bolje.
I didn't want to talk.	Nisem hotel govoriti.
However, he decided not to.	Vendar se je odločil, da ne.
Maybe he didn't think so.	Mogoče se mu ni zdelo tako.
I would love to.	Všeč bi mi bilo.
I hope you come back.	Upam, da se boš vrnil.
So will everyone.	Tako bodo vsi.
he asked.	je vprašal.
I don’t know if that’s a good thing.	Ne vem, če je to dobra stvar.
Or talk about it.	Ali govoriti o tem.
No one could tell why they were there.	Nihče ni mogel povedati, zakaj so tam.
I'm sure not.	Prepričan sem, da ne.
Now I don’t see anything more we could do.	Zdaj ne vidim ničesar več, kar bi lahko naredili.
Right in the afternoon.	Takoj popoldne.
Now you know.	Zdaj veš.
Still not.	Še vedno ne.
I was too surprised.	Bil sem preveč presenečen.
I needed something to work on once.	Enkrat sem potreboval nekaj za delo.
I saw it happening here.	Videl sem, da se to dogaja tukaj.
No one knew what could be done.	Nihče ni vedel, kaj se da narediti.
However, this is no longer so true.	Vendar to ni več tako res.
He knows better now.	Zdaj ve bolje.
He can't do that.	Tega ne more.
She hasn’t said that much and never will.	Toliko ni rekla in nikoli ne bo.
Like it is.	Kot da je.
I knew it was happening.	Vedel sem, da se dogaja.
That would be like your father.	To bi bilo kot tvoj oče.
I don’t know why anyone would have a problem with that.	Ne vem, zakaj bi imel kdo težave s tem.
It really isn't.	Res ni.
We have a room here.	Tukaj imamo sobo.
not to me.	meni ne.
Or maybe it was just me.	Ali pa sem bil samo jaz.
I have no idea.	Nimam misli.
I knew he knew that too.	Vedel sem, da tudi on to ve.
We should go now.	Zdaj bi morali iti.
It's right behind that house.	Takoj za tisto hišo je.
And that would be it.	In to bi bilo.
But that is exactly what happened.	Vendar se je zgodilo prav to.
Almost as usual.	Skoraj kot običajno.
Tell me, what did you want to eat?	Povej mi, kaj si hotel jesti?
He didn't want to talk.	Ni hotel govoriti.
Here's the thing.	Tukaj pa je stvar.
But unfortunately that did not happen.	A žal se to ni zgodilo.
I completely understand.	popolnoma razumem.
What they did to me.	Kaj so mi naredili.
I felt a little like that myself.	Sam sem se počutil nekoliko tako.
Someone did this to me too.	Nekdo je to naredil tudi meni.
It seemed obvious.	Zdelo se je očitno.
It's here, but not for long.	Tukaj je, a ne za dolgo.
It is true that man himself knows that he lives.	Res je, da človek sam ve, da živi.
However, he never returned.	Vendar se ni nikoli vrnil.
I could do no wrong.	Nisem mogel narediti nič narobe.
Life could be easy for me.	Življenje bi bilo zame lahko.
And he actually liked it.	In pravzaprav mu je bilo všeč.
Someone is here.	Nekdo je tukaj.
He just wanted the boy to leave.	Želel je samo, da bi fant odšel.
He always says that.	Vedno to pravi.
That's how it's supposed to be.	Tako naj bi bilo.
Well, you're right.	Pa imaš prav.
I didn't ask for it.	Nisem prosil za to.
He did not ask what the reason was.	Ni vprašal, kaj je razlog.
And there were some that weren’t.	In bilo je nekaj, ki niso.
However, it would not be so simple.	Vendar ne bi bilo tako preprosto.
really? 	res?
you said.	rekel si.
What he was doing was so simple.	To, kar je počel, je bilo tako preprosto.
I loved everything he did.	Všeč mi je bilo vse, kar je počel.
Maybe that was good.	Mogoče je bilo to dobro.
There was nothing to see.	Ni bilo kaj videti.
I will never forget you!	Nikoli te ne bom pozabil!
I just felt sorry for these people.	Te ljudi mi je bilo preprosto žal.
That's a lot of work.	To je veliko dela.
I actually went there.	Pravzaprav sem šel tja.
I want to tell you even more.	Želim vam povedati še več.
Maybe you shouldn't.	Morda ne bi smeli.
This worked very well for me.	To mi je zelo dobro uspelo.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar pa ni tako.
He didn't like leaving her there.	Ni mu bilo všeč, da bi jo pustil tam.
He lives in me.	Živi v meni.
He won't come.	Ne bo prišel.
He was alone.	Bil je sam.
I got lost when they saw me.	Izgubil sem se, če so me videli.
But we know that we have life.	Vemo pa, da imamo življenje.
They didn't know.	Niso vedeli.
It is much more than that.	Je veliko več kot to.
He waited and waited.	Čakal je in čakal.
I have no one.	nimam nikogar.
This has been going on for so long.	To se že tako dolgo dogaja.
It wasn't much.	Ni bilo veliko.
Not so with me.	Pri meni ni tako.
And well, for me it was.	In dobro, zame je bilo.
I already bought it.	Sem ga že kupil.
Not that he has much.	Ne, da ima veliko.
And he knew so much about so much.	In toliko je vedel o toliko.
I have this.	Jaz imam to.
I'll be waiting for them by car.	Čakal jih bom avto.
She did it.	To je storila.
They will do anything for money.	Za denar bodo naredili vse.
It is and it will be.	Je in bo.
I will work with that.	Delal bom s tem.
I'm not ready to talk to you yet.	Nisem še pripravljen govoriti s tabo.
But I have my own car.	Imam pa svoj avto.
You're back.	Nazaj si.
Tough question!	Težko vprašanje!
He heard nothing.	Nič ni slišal.
I am back.	Nazaj sem.
I don't know where he is right now.	Ne vem, kje je trenutno.
Maybe you will too.	Mogoče boš to tudi ti.
It will be a good day.	Dober dan bo.
He loves you very much.	Zelo te ima rad.
I am not sure.	Nisem prepričan.
They are no longer without money.	Niso več brez denarja.
He tried to make sure he wasn't thinking of anything.	Poskušal se je prepričati, da ne misli na nič.
Like it or not.	Všeč ali ne.
He loves us very much.	Zelo nas ima rad.
I'm not much of a help.	Nisem veliko v pomoč.
I don’t know if that’s possible.	Ne vem, če je to mogoče.
Maybe not.	Mogoče pa ne.
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
After that, everything is simple.	Po tem je vse preprosto.
I wish we had more time.	Želim si, da bi imeli več časa.
Talk about it.	Govori o tem.
Someone had to.	Nekdo je moral.
I do that quite a lot.	To počnem kar veliko.
It never, ever happened.	Nikoli, nikoli se ni zgodilo.
More than the day before.	Bolj kot prejšnji dan.
I am too.	Tudi sam.
What was the reason?	Kaj je bil razlog?
Everything works.	Vse dela.
But now I'm here.	Zdaj pa sem tukaj.
He felt good.	Dobro se je počutil.
However, more needs to be done.	Vendar je treba narediti več.
This is simply not possible.	To preprosto ni mogoče.
He wants more people tonight.	Nocoj želi več ljudi.
Not even that.	Niti tega ne.
Or he will die.	Ali pa bo umrl.
I didn't even try.	Sploh nisem poskušal.
You will be fine.	Dobro boš.
Tell me why.	Povej mi zakaj.
I never would.	Nikoli ne bi.
This should already have happened.	To naj bi se že zgodilo.
Nothing else to say.	Nič drugega za povedati.
The problem is money.	Problem je denar.
Soon everyone will be having a very good time.	Kmalu se bodo vsi imeli zelo dobro.
I will move on.	bom šel naprej.
I didn't find anything.	Nič nisem našel.
Now he decided that was enough.	Zdaj se je odločil, da je dovolj.
I knew how hard it was to look good in this place.	Vedel sem, kako težko je videti dobro na tem mestu.
You would too.	Tudi ti bi.
I hope you are doing well.	Upam, da ti gre dobro.
And it never will be.	In nikoli ne bo.
He says everything will be fine.	Pravi, da bo vse v redu.
He needs help.	Potrebuje pomoč.
He didn't know.	Ni vedel.
I had it.	Imel sem jo.
I want her there.	Želim jo tam.
No, don't think that.	Ne, ne misli tega.
I know he's my friend.	Vem, da je moj prijatelj.
It takes more time.	Potrebuje več časa.
I will do.	Naredil bom.
I asked him where he was going.	Vprašal sem ga, kam gre.
We are both.	Oba sva.
And mine too.	In moj tudi.
So ready for me.	Tako pripravljen zame.
No! 	Ne!
He wanted to know what it was.	Želel je vedeti, kaj je to.
I didn't see him.	Nisem ga videl.
We did a lot today.	Danes smo naredili veliko.
I just couldn’t.	Preprosto nisem mogel.
You know he can't.	Veš, da ne more.
I think we will be lucky.	Mislim, da bomo imeli srečo.
They had to get out of there and do it fast.	Morali so oditi od tam in to hitro.
It's not true.	Ni res.
I waited for him, but he didn't come.	Čakal sem ga, a ni prišel.
Which you wouldn't.	Kar pa ne bi.
He had never heard of such a thing.	Še nikoli ni slišal za kaj takega.
I didn’t do this to have problems.	Tega nisem storil, da bi imel težave.
It won't be that easy.	Ne bo tako preprosto.
I want to make sure.	Želim se prepričati.
For me.	Zame.
And you didn't do anything about it.	In s tem niste naredili ničesar.
She was very good at it.	Bila je zelo dobra v tem.
I am sure we will succeed.	Prepričan sem, da nam bo uspelo.
I don't want to be anything but me.	Nočem biti nič drugega kot jaz.
Little by little he began to speak.	Malo po malo je začel govoriti.
Not much now.	Zdaj ne veliko več.
It's obviously happening.	Očitno se dogaja.
I do not .	Jaz ne .
You wanted to leave.	Hotel si oditi.
That is true enough.	To je dovolj res.
There is no one here.	Tukaj ni nikogar.
And someone is.	In nekdo je.
This is simply not the case.	To pa preprosto ni tako.
So do many people.	Tako tudi veliko ljudi.
She didn't really know what it was.	Pravzaprav ni vedela, kaj je to.
You really don't.	Ti res ne.
I think they are.	Mislim, da so.
I want you to know it's not you.	Želim, da veš, da nisi ti.
I'm not ready now.	Zdaj nisem pripravljen.
Like me.	Kot jaz.
It's there all the time.	Ves čas je tam.
This issue is not before us.	To vprašanje ni pred nami.
I think you could do it.	Mislim, da bi ti uspelo.
I managed to work.	Uspelo mi je delati.
Everything and nothing.	Vse in nič.
Me neither.	Jaz tudi ne.
I mean not now.	Se pravi ne zdaj.
Three or more.	Tri ali več.
Very often.	Zelo pogosto.
I'm not so surprised.	Nisem tako presenečen.
I was fine.	Bilo mi je v redu.
In fact, they were lucky.	Pravzaprav so imeli srečo.
But I will say this.	Bom pa rekel to.
He doesn't need to be.	Ni mu treba biti.
Maybe it was.	Morda je bilo.
That's my friend.	To je moj prijatelj.
I was glad to see him.	Vesel sem bil, da sem ga videl.
It just seems so wrong.	Samo zdi se tako narobe.
It's a simple job.	To je preprosto delo.
John is a good friend.	John je dober prijatelj.
As if they still had work to do.	Kot da so imeli še delo.
No, they haven't seen him yet.	Ne, še niso ga videli.
I don't know for sure.	ne vem zagotovo.
If there is, we might have.	Če obstaja, bi morda imeli.
I won't talk to you anymore.	Ne bom več govoril s tabo.
He won't talk to me.	Noče govoriti z mano.
He should have known something was wrong.	Moral bi vedeti, da je nekaj narobe.
The child could not stay here.	Otrok ni mogel ostati tukaj.
Very good, very good.	Zelo dobro, zelo dobro.
I'm sure he has it with you.	Prepričan sem, da ima s tabo.
You can't help it.	Ne moreš ti pomagati.
I'm glad he's gone.	Vesel sem, da ga ni več.
And it worked.	In uspelo je.
I did the right thing.	Naredil sem prav.
She was only in town for a week.	V mestu je bila le teden dni.
Everyone has to move on.	Vsak mora iti naprej.
And also not good.	In tudi ne dobro.
So it will be.	Tako bo.
He wasn't sure why he came.	Ni bil prepričan, zakaj je prišel.
And she never was.	In nikoli ni bila.
He wanted to leave quickly.	Hotel je hitro oditi.
If you want to.	Če želiš.
.	.
Nobody needed it.	Nikomur ni bilo treba.
I had to do what was right.	Moral sem narediti, kar je prav.
But I can't do it anymore.	Vendar tega ne morem več.
I wish he was better than me.	Želim si, da bi bil boljši od mene.
I wouldn't have it.	jaz ga ne bi imel.
Did he start it? 	Je on to začel?
Because you can.	Ker lahko.
It was hard to talk to him.	Težko je bilo govoriti z njim.
So he went and saw for himself.	Zato je šel in sam videl.
I'll start that back too.	Tudi to bom začel nazaj.
And so are we.	In tudi mi smo.
A lot actually.	Pravzaprav veliko.
You can, I can't.	Ti lahko, jaz pa ne.
I just want to be sure.	Želim biti samo prepričan.
I never knew until today.	Nikoli nisem vedel do danes.
What's happening? 	Kaj se dogaja?
Maybe he doesn't even want that.	Morda si tega niti ne želi.
Life seemed difficult to her.	Življenje se ji je zdelo težko.
You will see in this.	Boš videl v tem.
ok ok ok.	v redu v redu v redu.
We like that.	To nam je všeč.
Only you have to be.	Samo ti moraš biti.
And it's wrong.	In narobe je.
I came here.	Prišel sem sem.
He has a chance without us.	Brez nas ima priložnost.
That's what your father would want.	To bi želel tvoj oče.
The child was happy.	Otrok je bil vesel.
It comes to him.	Pride do njega.
But it is very difficult to do.	Je pa zelo težko narediti.
The child was not here.	Otrok ni bil tukaj.
You have it.	Imaš ga.
Everyone to see them.	Vsi, da bi jih videli.
It's just, it wasn't.	Samo, ni bilo.
I will not go.	ne bom šel.
But it managed to be more than that.	Vendar je uspelo biti več kot to.
I knew that now.	Zdaj sem to vedel.
I will find him.	jaz ga bom našel.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
It simply won't.	Preprosto ne bo.
It was more than that, much more.	Bilo je več kot to, veliko več.
I'm here with you.	Tukaj sem s tabo.
Nothing seemed.	Ni se zdelo nič.
I don't like people.	Ne maram ljudi.
I want to believe her.	Želim ji verjeti.
This was once taught to him by his father.	To ga je nekoč naučil oče.
Everyone has a job.	Vsak ima delo.
Please, just don't.	Prosim, samo ne.
I know better.	vem bolje.
So much to say.	Toliko za povedati.
There was no one about it.	O tem ni bilo nikogar.
Absolutely that none of us will die.	Popolnoma, da nihče od nas ne bo umrl.
I'm so glad to be here.	Tako sem vesel, da sem tukaj.
We have a chance.	Imamo priložnost.
Something about it.	Nekaj ​​o tem.
You have to go back.	Moraš iti nazaj.
I'll only be gone for a while.	Odšel bom le nekaj časa.
Which he really likes.	Ki mu je res všeč.
I never wanted anything else from him.	Nikoli nisem hotel ničesar drugega od njega.
However, this did not happen.	Vendar se ni zgodilo tako.
I'm here for you.	Tukaj sem zate.
It’s so obvious, though.	To je tako očitno, pa vendar.
This was our first time.	To je bilo za nas prvič.
You don't have to tell us anything.	Ničesar nam ni treba povedati.
That was very good.	To je bilo zelo dobro.
Life for life.	Življenje za življenje.
I was pretty busy.	Bil sem precej zaposlen.
Not so mine.	Ne tako moj.
I wouldn’t be surprised if that happened.	Ne bi bil presenečen, če bi se to zgodilo.
I do not want to.	Nočem.
We are here again.	Spet smo tukaj.
That was really helpful.	To je bilo res v pomoč.
No one can see me.	Nihče me ne more videti.
That's the question, isn't it?	To je vprašanje, kajne?
That would be fine.	To bi bilo v redu.
I would go here.	Odšel bi do sem.
They were all there.	Vsi so bili tam.
I don't know what we did.	Ne vem, kaj smo naredili.
that's how I feel.	tako se počutim.
It simply cannot be done.	Tega preprosto ni mogoče narediti.
He didn't want to talk.	Ni hotel govoriti.
And so did he.	In tako on.
I didn't ask her.	Nisem je vprašal.
And you could.	In bi lahko.
You've definitely done this before.	To ste zagotovo že storili.
That was it, now he saw it.	To je bilo to, zdaj je to videl.
Why did you come here without telling us?	Zakaj si prišel sem, ne da bi nam povedal?
They would be.	Bili bi.
But now he wanted more.	Zdaj pa je hotel več.
He just doesn't know what it's about.	Samo ne ve za kaj gre.
And everyone will know what you did.	In vsi bodo vedeli, kaj si naredil.
They never did with me.	Z mano nikoli niso.
I am very happy about it.	Zelo sem vesel tega.
I'm really late here.	Res sem pozna.
I saw some of that from him.	Nekaj ​​tega sem videl od njega.
If you don't know what they are.	Če ne veš kaj so.
This is hard.	To je težko.
How nice of you to come.	Kako lepo, da si prišel.
I was surprised to find him there.	Bil sem presenečen, ko sem ga našel tam.
These things just are.	Te stvari preprosto so.
He found me earlier.	Prej me je našel.
The man did his job well.	Človek je dobro opravil svoje delo.
I wish I could.	Želim si, da bi lahko.
He is not there because he knew what he was.	Ni ga, ker je vedel, kaj je.
I haven't called him yet.	Nisem ga še poklical.
I was a child then.	Takrat sem bil otrok.
You will have nothing.	Ne boste imeli nič.
He didn't see her.	Ni je videl.
Nothing but.	Nič drugega kot.
He didn't know what to do either.	Tudi on ni vedel, kaj naj naredi.
I couldn't even.	Niti ne bi mogel.
And on.	In naprej.
Now something is happening, but we don’t know what and where.	Zdaj se nekaj dogaja, a ne vemo kaj in kje.
Everyone seems to.	Zdi se, da vsi.
And sometimes that's true.	In včasih je to res.
He really wanted to.	Res je hotel.
I felt better.	Počutil sem se bolje.
He really meant it.	Res je mislil.
Sometimes too much.	Včasih preveč.
He won't need it.	Ne bo je potreboval.
I just did the work.	Opravil sem samo delo.
I was there.	Bil sem tam.
I know you want kids.	Vem, da si želiš otroke.
I really don't need them.	Res jih ne potrebujem.
i wouldn't do that.	jaz tega ne bi naredil.
That's right.	To je to res.
Life was good.	Življenje je bilo dobro.
They were better.	Bili so boljši.
I talked to you.	govoril sem s tabo.
Simple but beautiful.	Preprosto, a lepo.
I think his work went well.	Mislim, da mu je delo dobro uspelo.
Now this happens every day.	Zdaj se to dogaja vsak dan.
I wonder what they did to him.	Zanima me, kaj so naredili z njim.
He told himself to go for it.	Rekel si je, naj gre za to.
It's as good as it is.	Tako dobro je, kot je.
This is not common, but it is important to know.	To ni običajno, vendar je treba vedeti.
And he never saw that.	In tega ni nikoli videl.
It is certainly only a matter of time.	Zagotovo je samo vprašanje časa.
She knew she couldn't do that.	Vedela je, da tega ne more storiti.
Now anything that was never possible is possible.	Zdaj je mogoče vse, kar nikoli ni bilo mogoče.
If anyone can help me.	Če mi kdo pomaga.
They did nothing.	Nič niso naredili.
Either way, you’ll be home soon.	Tako ali tako boste kmalu doma.
He doesn't know what to think.	Ne ve, kaj naj si misli.
There was more.	Bilo je tudi več.
I know you have a job.	Vem, da imaš delo.
I met him last night.	Sinoči sem ga srečal.
You can.	Lahko.
She wanted too much.	Želela je preveč.
We haven't seen each other in a long time.	Dolgo časa se nismo videli.
I have often seen this happen.	Pogosto sem videl, da se to dogaja.
I've never been there before.	Še nikoli nisem bil tam.
I was angry too.	Tudi jaz sem bil jezen.
Unfortunately, this is often not possible.	Žal to pogosto ni mogoče.
You won't know for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa ne boste vedeli.
It wasn't easy for him.	Ni mu bilo lahko.
You shouldn't do that either.	Tudi tega ne bi smel storiti.
You don't like this one.	Ta ti ni všeč.
Nothing was seen on the site.	Nič ni bilo videti na mestu.
No, it wasn't me.	Ne, nisem bil jaz.
In bi.	In bi.
I couldn't eat.	nisem mogel jesti.
Let s.	Naj s.
A lot of time.	Veliko časa.
He saw that.	To je videl.
He's not here either.	Prav tako ga ni tukaj.
I don't see anything.	ne vidim ničesar.
He must be too tired.	Mora biti preveč utrujen.
He is there .	Tam je .
Or tried.	Ali poskušal.
I have to do something.	Moram nekaj narediti.
I worked there.	Tam sem delal.
He died the way he wanted to.	Umrl je tako, kot je hotel.
Do we have to do something right?	Moramo nekaj narediti prav?
But there is more to it.	Vendar je na tem še več.
He knows you.	Pozna te.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Ali ste prepričani, da želite to storiti?
He loves them.	Rad jih ima.
There's nothing you can do.	Nič ne moreš narediti.
There is no one there either.	Tudi tam ni nikogar.
Apparently they didn't.	Očitno niso.
I mean never.	Mislim nikoli.
No one has met them yet.	Nihče jih še ni srečal.
I'm here with you.	Tukaj sem s tabo.
Apparently he just wanted to get out of there.	Očitno je hotel samo oditi od tam.
You know you will.	Veš, da boš.
and.	dan.
This is for both of us.	To je za oba.
I did a very good job.	Opravil sem zelo dobro delo.
He didn't come out, not even to eat.	Ni prišel ven, niti jesti ne.
Only you know.	Samo ti veš.
Life is good.	Življenje je dobro.
I will feel much better myself.	Sam se bom počutil veliko bolje.
Each in his own way.	Vsak po svoje.
And it is true, the more it is, the better.	In res je, več kot je, tem bolje.
And you too.	In tudi ti.
I called them too.	Tudi jaz sem jih poklical.
He knows he can help himself and help himself.	Ve, da si je mogoče pomagati in si pomagati.
I didn't think anyone else lived here.	Nisem si mislil, da tukaj živi še kdo.
But we also don't feel like it.	A tudi nam se ne zdi, kot da bi.
Not that anyone else would stay.	Saj ne, da bi jih kdo več ostal.
So be it.	Naj bo tako.
Maybe you let them stay.	Mogoče si jih pustil ostati.
I would do it right.	To bi naredil prav.
However, it is not.	Vendar pa ni.
I have to go soon.	Kmalu moram iti.
What are you going to tell him about me.	Kaj mu boš povedal o meni.
What he just said himself.	To, kar je pravkar rekel sam.
We had to do something else.	Morali smo narediti nekaj drugega.
No one learned anything.	Nihče se ni nič naučil.
Not once.	Ne enkrat.
In fact, it would be nice if I did.	Pravzaprav bi bilo lepo, če bi to naredil.
You were absolutely right.	Imel si popolnoma prav.
You should still be here.	Še vedno bi moral biti tukaj.
That's right.	Tako je.
I never want you to do anything else.	Nikoli ti ne želim, da bi naredil kaj drugega.
And now this.	In zdaj to.
This is hard.	To je težko.
He came alone.	Prišel je sam.
I never wanted that, you know.	Nikoli si tega nisem želel, veš.
He did not see where and how.	Ni videl kje in kako.
For fun.	Za zabavo.
I'm not going now.	zdaj ne grem.
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
Here is.	Tukaj je.
Someone will come.	Nekdo bo prišel.
I never came back out.	Nikoli se nisem vrnil ven.
Still common.	Še vedno pogosto.
I want to work for you.	Rad bi delal zate.
He was very angry.	Bil je zelo jezen.
And he will work on it right away.	In takoj bo delal na tem.
This is no time to party.	Ni čas za zabavo.
I never saw her again.	Nikoli več je nisem videl.
He won't tell me no.	Ne bo mi rekel ne.
really a lot.	res veliko.
I understand you very much.	Zelo te razumem.
No one should.	Nihče ne bi smel.
If ever.	Če bo kdaj.
Just be quick.	Samo hitro.
The opportunity was all she wanted.	Priložnost je bila vse, kar si je želela.
Everyone saw the other.	Vsak je videl drugega.
I liked it.	Všeč mi je bilo.
This is a man who knows how to do things.	To je človek, ki ve, kako narediti stvari.
Work.	Delo.
Or maybe it was just me.	Ali pa sem bil morda samo jaz.
Maybe he's right.	Mogoče ima prav.
We almost didn't see.	Skoraj nismo videli.
He will give it to you.	Dal vam ga bo.
I'll be fine.	Jaz bom v redu.
This was his first time.	To mu je bilo prvič.
There was nothing.	Nič ni bilo.
Now this question.	Zdaj pa to vprašanje.
He didn't think he would have it himself.	Ni si mislil, da ga bo imel sam.
But there is something else.	Je pa še nekaj.
I knew she would do it.	Vedel sem, da bo to storila.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Vendar se zdi, da temu ni tako.
Tell her.	Povej ji.
I hope you like them.	Upam, da so vam všeč.
Do nothing else.	Ne naredi nič drugega.
We need to do something and do it fast!	Nekaj ​​moramo narediti in to hitro!
Car	Avto
And now he knows nothing.	In zdaj ne ve ničesar.
Maybe, but not anytime soon.	Mogoče, a ne kmalu.
I wasn't there.	nisem bil tam.
I hope someone can help me.	Upam, da mi lahko kdo pomaga.
This is a very good car.	To je zelo dober avto.
I didn't tell him anything.	Nič mu nisem povedal.
He was good.	Bil je dober.
I really, really like it.	Zelo, zelo mi je všeč.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
We will have our work.	Imeli bomo svoje delo.
This is now before us.	To je zdaj pred nami.
I have nowhere to go.	nimam kam iti.
No, if I knew about it, I wouldn’t.	Ne, če bi vedela za to, ne bi.
I couldn’t believe it happened so fast.	Nisem mogel verjeti, da se je to zgodilo tako hitro.
Which is fine with me.	Kar je v redu z mano.
Things had to be done.	Treba je bilo stvari narediti.
But no one knows him there.	A tam ga nihče ne pozna.
You heard me.	Slišal si me.
But there is no one to do everything.	Vendar ni nikogar, ki bi naredil vse.
I'm here for the first time.	Prvič sem tukaj.
I mean, anything is possible.	Mislim, vse je mogoče.
Just say it the way it is.	Samo povej tako kot je.
He will die.	Umrl bo.
That's it.	To je to.
But he knew little about it.	A o tem je vedel malo.
Anything was better than being me.	Vse je bilo bolje kot biti jaz.
Not much.	Ne veliko.
Apparently he wasn't, I'd say.	Očitno ni bil, bi rekel.
He failed to do so.	To mu ni uspelo.
I'm not.	nisem.
To get better right away.	Da bo takoj bolje.
You were absolutely right.	Imel si popolnoma prav.
And maybe a lot more.	In morda še veliko več.
Not once did it happen.	Niti enkrat se ni zgodilo.
I loved spending time here.	Všeč mi je bil čas tukaj.
I probably wouldn't have expected that.	Verjetno tega ne bi pričakoval.
He says you know.	Pravi, da veš.
We know it can.	Vemo, da se da.
I saw he was home.	Videl sem, da je doma.
It wasn't very difficult.	Ni bilo zelo težko.
I think that's what it's about.	Mislim, da gre za to.
But obviously not true.	A očitno ni res.
And there are many.	In veliko jih je.
I need to know something.	Moram nekaj vedeti.
He told me he was tired.	Povedal mi je, da je utrujen.
I saw.	Videl sem.
He often has to stay home.	Pogosto mora ostati doma.
I had to come and see him to get them.	Moral sem priti in ga videti, da sem jih dobil.
So he still works.	Zato še vedno dela.
I just didn’t know it as a kid.	Samo kot otrok tega nisem vedel.
He keeps talking.	Kar naprej govori.
I think that may be the reason.	Mislim, da je to lahko razlog.
I was here.	Bil sem tukaj.
No one knew where they were.	Nihče ni vedel, kje so.
We are last night.	Sinoči smo.
But enough is enough.	A dovolj je dovolj.
He just didn't know where or how serious it was.	Samo ni vedel, kje in kako resno je.
I think we are.	Mislim, da smo.
My question is.	Moje vprašanje je.
You should probably go.	Verjetno bi morali iti.
Even sooner than he expected.	Tudi prej, kot je pričakoval.
But he couldn't do it himself.	A sam tega ni mogel.
Lots of it here.	Veliko tega tukaj.
Let him.	Naj mu.
And he knew.	In je vedel.
You were a great help.	Bila si v veliko pomoč.
Don’t be interested in what you think.	Naj vas ne zanima, kaj mislite.
I'm going to get something.	Grem po nekaj.
I better not go.	Bolje, da ne grem.
I don't know what to believe anymore.	Ne vem več, kaj naj verjamem.
It was much better.	Bilo je veliko bolje.
Because it is.	Ker je.
And so she did.	In tako je tudi storila.
He must have liked it.	Morali so mu biti všeč.
If we ever are.	Če smo kdaj.
It was probably so much better.	Verjetno je bilo tako bolje.
Now tell me.	Zdaj pa mi povej.
I do not know where it is.	Ne vem kje je.
You will be sorry.	Žal ti bo.
res.	res.
We have to go tonight.	Nocoj moramo iti.
Like that's going to happen.	Kot da se bo to zgodilo.
When he’s good, he’s really good.	Ko je dober, je res dober.
There is nothing there for us.	Tam ni ničesar za nas.
I have no doubt about that.	O tem ne dvomim.
I think anything is possible.	Mislim, da je vse mogoče.
However, it is clearly not that simple.	Vendar pa očitno ni tako preprosto.
He succeeded.	Uspelo mu je.
But that won't be enough.	Vendar to ne bo dovolj.
Sometimes it’s true and sometimes.	Včasih je res in včasih.
I just wanted to get out of there.	Samo hotel sem iti od tam.
But he is no more.	Vendar ga ni več.
Maybe we had.	Morda smo imeli.
You were right.	Prav si rekel.
No one had anything to say.	Nihče ni imel ničesar za povedati.
I played with him.	Igral sem se z njim.
A boy who knows nothing would have nothing to say there.	Fant, ki ne ve ničesar, tam ne bi imel ničesar povedati.
I know he knew.	Vem, da je vedel.
That would be wrong too.	Tudi to bi bilo narobe.
There was no time for that.	Za to ni bilo časa.
I didn't want to tell him.	Nisem mu hotel povedati.
I knew what they were.	Vedel sem, kaj so.
And it just isn't there.	In preprosto ga ni.
We don't know now.	Zdaj ne vemo več.
I know that well enough.	To vem dovolj dobro.
We were fine there for a while, but something happened last night.	Tam smo bili nekaj časa v redu, sinoči pa se je nekaj zgodilo.
It felt right.	Zdelo se je prav.
I am your friend	jaz sem tvoj prijatelj
It's going well.	Dobro gre.
It was forever.	Bilo je za vedno.
I just knew it would happen someday.	Vedel sem samo, da se bo to nekoč zgodilo.
Which is what it is.	Kar je to.
No one saw her.	Nihče je ni videl.
We should not do that.	Tega ne bi smeli početi.
So far, so is he.	Do zdaj je tudi on.
Or maybe there was something.	Ali pa je morda nekaj bilo.
They seem to be.	Zdi se, da so.
And not in a good way.	In ne na dober način.
I don't know, I don't want to know.	Ne vem, nočem vedeti.
It has to be there.	Tam mora biti.
I'm fine with that.	S tem sem v redu.
Not you, obviously.	Ne ti, očitno.
He couldn't leave.	Ni mogel oditi.
I didn’t have any of that.	Nič od tega nisem imel.
You have enough.	Dovolj imaš.
Want to see how it is?	Želite videti, kako je?
He stayed there all day.	Tam je ostal ves dan.
He was still there, thankfully.	Še vedno je bil tam, na srečo.
That was fine with me.	To mi je bilo v redu.
But he couldn't go back.	A nazaj ni mogel.
I will not be angry.	ne bom jezen.
There was always someone in the room with him.	Vedno je bil nekdo v sobi z njim.
She says she won't go.	Pravi, da ne bo šla.
My boyfriend is the one who always has something to do.	Moj fant je tisti, ki mora vedno nekaj narediti.
I've never seen him before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl.
He came back the next day and did it.	Naslednji dan se je vrnil in to naredil.
That is so true.	To je tako res.
This may or may not be a good thing.	To je lahko dobra stvar ali pa tudi ne.
But I wasn't too surprised.	Vendar nisem bil preveč presenečen.
Because you are.	Ker si.
This and much more.	To in še veliko več.
I saw he was scared.	Videl sem, da se boji.
You probably think so.	Verjetno si mislite.
Just because you can.	Samo zato, ker lahko.
What do you think we could do?	Kaj misliš, da bi lahko naredili?
And we have them.	In mi jih imamo.
I thought you'd like it.	Mislil sem, da ti bo všeč.
Nothing happened.	Nič se ni zgodilo.
He didn't just leave.	Ni samo odšel.
Why they had it all behind me.	Zakaj so imeli vse za mano.
But that's none of my business.	Vendar to ni moja stvar.
There is nothing there.	Tam ni ničesar.
Just like you were.	Tako kot si bil.
I've never heard of anything like that.	Še nikoli nisem slišal za kaj takega.
Maybe you will.	Mogoče boš.
And a lot of people.	In veliko ljudi.
I'm really sorry.	Res mi je žal.
It's simple.	To je preprosto.
You should see him.	Moral bi ga videti.
I asked him if anyone else knew about it.	Vprašal sem ga, ali še kdo ve za to.
That's what she said.	Tako je rekla.
They certainly were.	Zagotovo so bili.
A good opportunity.	Dobra priložnost.
She looked so alone.	Videti je bila tako sama.
That was probably enough.	To je bilo verjetno dovolj.
You will do more of what you like.	Počel boš več tega, kar ti je všeč.
I couldn't see anyone.	Nikogar nisem mogel videti.
You need to talk to me.	Moraš govoriti z mano.
I think really ahead and often.	Mislim res naprej in tudi pogosto.
Because I could.	Ker bi lahko.
There is someone here to help you.	Tukaj je nekdo, ki vam bo pomagal.
We can't know.	Ne moremo vedeti.
Probably had to be said.	Verjetno je bilo treba povedati.
He needed her there and he would have her there.	Tam jo je potreboval in tam bi jo imel.
I know he's there.	Vem, da je tam.
I can't tell you much.	Ne morem ti veliko povedati.
I didn't ask her.	Nisem je vprašal.
I certainly wasn't.	zagotovo nisem bil.
It just wouldn't happen.	To se preprosto ne bi zgodilo.
It’s actually pretty simple.	Pravzaprav je precej preprosto.
I'll tell you what they did.	Povedal vam bom, kaj so naredili.
And as hard as it is to believe, it is true.	In kot je težko verjeti, je res.
It could happen.	Lahko bi se zgodilo.
He knows perfectly well what he is doing.	Popolnoma dobro ve, kaj počne.
I want to know who thinks he did it.	Rad bi vedel, kdo misli, da je to storil.
I might like that.	To mi bo morda všeč.
Or not alone.	Ali pa ne sami.
No one talked much.	Nihče ni veliko govoril.
What you want.	Kar si želiš.
So I never made it.	Tako da mi nikoli ni uspelo.
And you are here.	In ti si tukaj.
He didn't leave.	Ni odšel.
Then you may have to stay at home.	Takrat boste morda morali ostati doma.
I definitely see that.	To zagotovo vidim.
He saw me coming back out.	Videl me je, kako sem se vrnil ven.
Do what you have to do.	Naredi, kar moraš.
It is still true today.	Še danes je res.
Maybe that was the problem.	Morda je bil to problem.
I'm busy this morning.	Danes zjutraj sem zaposlen.
A lot too.	Tudi precej.
So he will succeed.	Zato mu bo uspelo.
Who was she? 	Kdo je bila?
This is no longer true.	To ni več res.
Except it wasn't.	Le da ni bilo.
He was waiting for me to say something.	Čakal je, da bom kaj rekel.
He said he heard something.	Rekel je, da je nekaj slišal.
They would never have their thoughts again.	Nikoli več ne bi imeli svoje misli.
Something happened to him.	Nekaj ​​se mu je zgodilo.
I will not completely leave.	Ne bom popolnoma odšel.
There are not enough of them.	Ni jih dovolj.
Have you ever been there?	Ste kdaj bili tam?
You did that, he said.	To ste storili, je rekel.
Apparently it's fine.	Očitno je v redu.
It would be.	Bilo bi.
That can't be true!	To ne more biti res!
I had to talk to him.	Moral sem govoriti z njim.
Gone, gone.	Odšel, odšel.
No more playing.	Ne igra se več.
I saw it myself.	Sam sem to videl.
That will not be possible.	To ne bo mogoče.
Quite a while.	Kar nekaj časa.
For me, this was the first time.	Zame je bilo to prvič.
That’s when we knew he didn’t want us.	Takrat smo vedeli, da nas noče.
He was good at what he did.	Bil je dober v tem, kar je naredil.
He made it.	Naredil jo je.
Very few people know that.	Zelo malo ljudi to ve.
And you're right.	In prav imaš.
I told him there was something wrong with that.	Povedal sem mu, da je nekaj narobe s tem.
We failed last night.	Sinoči nam ni uspelo.
He is very good at what he does.	Zelo dober je v tem, kar počne.
A person or thing that.	Oseba ali stvar, ki.
And it was very difficult for me.	In bilo mi je zelo težko.
But we still had a few.	Nekaj ​​pa smo jih še imeli.
I want to work on it.	Želim delati na tem.
I had something to eat.	Imel sem nekaj za jesti.
Everything he did was right.	Vse, kar je naredil, je bilo prav.
Hope you have a nice time.	Upa, da se imaš lepo.
He was not ready.	Ni bil pripravljen.
I don't know her.	ne poznam je.
Your problem must be something else.	Tvoj problem mora biti nekaj drugega.
Why would you want that.	Zakaj bi si to želel.
But you should.	Moral bi pa.
That's what makes it so hard.	Zaradi tega je tako težko.
I think it was me.	Mislim, da sem bil to jaz.
You should do that.	To bi moral storiti.
You know how you can.	Saj veš kako lahko.
And it still was.	In še vedno je bilo.
I told her nothing happened.	Povedal sem ji, da se ni nič zgodilo.
This can be quite difficult.	To je lahko precej težko.
It was a hotel.	Bil je hotel.
There was nothing to do.	Nič ni bilo za narediti.
But it wasn't always like that.	Vendar ni bilo vedno tako.
Because he wants it done.	Ker želi, da se to naredi.
If it isn't already.	Če že ni.
Will everything be fine or not.	Ali bo vse v redu ali ne.
They did that.	To so storili.
I went tonight.	Nocoj sem šel.
This was just as difficult.	To je bilo prav tako težko.
I'd say yours.	Rekel bi tvoj.
This is nothing.	To ni nič.
I went and did it.	Šel sem in naredil.
That's better for you.	To je bolje zate.
I wish you all the best.	Vse dobro želim.
My money is on ‘no’.	Moj denar je na 'ne'.
She had wanted so much for so long.	Tako dolgo si je želela toliko.
I’d like to go back a little bit that way.	Rad bi se malo vrnil na ta način.
Talk to him like you would to me.	Govori z njim tako kot bi z mano.
He doesn't do anything.	Nič ne počne.
She was not well.	Ni ji bilo dobro.
I had to do the work.	Moral sem narediti delo.
It probably happened to her.	Verjetno se ji je to zgodilo.
Almost there now.	Zdaj že skoraj tam.
I knew you would come.	Vedel sem, da boš prišel.
It seemed that this was not going to happen now.	Zdelo se je, da se to zdaj ne bo zgodilo.
Not that he said when he would be here.	Ne, da je rekel, kdaj bo tukaj.
He did everything.	Naredil je vse.
That was a good time.	To je bil dober čas.
It's true.	Res je.
That it is wrong.	Da je narobe.
I could be there for a while.	Lahko bi bila tam nekaj časa.
I had to be the one who spoke.	Moral sem biti jaz tisti, ki je govoril.
But unfortunately that was not the case.	A žal temu ni bilo tako.
It has to be the right one.	Mora biti pravi.
He never wants to see them again.	Nikoli več jih ne želi videti.
I would never know now.	Zdaj ne bi nikoli vedel.
I wasn't there.	Nisem bil tam.
I'm glad you called me tonight.	Vesel sem, da si me nocoj poklical.
That was very good.	To je bilo zelo dobro.
Nothing more to do.	Nič več za narediti.
We didn’t know how many children we had.	Nismo vedeli, koliko otrok imamo.
Now someone had.	Zdaj je nekdo imel.
who will you meet 	koga boš srečal?
She didn't know anything anymore.	Ničesar več ni vedela.
That is the reason.	To je razlog.
So it will have to be done.	Zato bo treba storiti.
I'm nothing now.	Zdaj sem nič.
No matter what anyone said, he made that decision for himself.	Ne glede na to, kaj je kdo rekel, se je tako odločil sam.
He came out immediately.	Takoj je prišel ven.
No one wanted to play.	Nihče ni hotel igrati.
Maybe still.	Mogoče še vedno.
You can never tell.	Nikoli ne moreš povedati.
It was just a question of when.	Bilo je samo vprašanje kdaj.
But he saw nothing.	Vendar ni videl ničesar.
However, this is not enough.	Vendar to ni dovolj.
The money must still be there.	Denar mora biti še vedno tam.
Must be.	Mora biti.
He was very happy.	Bil je zelo vesel.
In fact, he thought everything was fine.	Pravzaprav se mu je zdelo vse v redu.
He doesn't do anything.	On ne dela ničesar.
There was so much to do.	Toliko je bilo treba narediti.
Which is not good.	Kar ni dobro.
It was something else.	Bilo je nekaj drugega.
He had to tell him.	Moral mu je povedati.
Soon.	Kmalu bo.
I know my father was there.	Vem, da je bil moj oče tam.
I didn’t know what was going on.	Nisem vedel, kaj se dogaja.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
You didn't see anything.	Nič nisi videl.
You did well, boy.	Dobro si naredil, fant.
I thought he was so lucky.	Mislil sem, da je imel tako srečo.
And he succeeded.	In uspelo mu je.
Just so often we can’t be seen.	Samo tako pogosto nas ni mogoče videti.
Maybe that's the reason.	Morda je to razlog.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar pa ni tako.
And neither do we.	In tudi mi ne.
How much, they didn't know yet.	Koliko, še niso vedeli.
The boy was angry.	Fant je bil jezen.
You must leave immediately.	Takoj moraš oditi.
He's not a good man.	On ni dober človek.
Instead, it is something else.	Namesto tega je nekaj drugega.
You have to do it this way.	To moraš narediti na ta način.
I doubt anyone will.	Dvomim, da bo kdo.
I heard what you did.	Slišal sem, kaj si naredil.
We only had a few.	Imeli smo le nekaj.
He's out of work.	Je brez dela.
Sometimes it’s just too much work.	Včasih je preprosto preveč dela.
First, it won't be the first time.	Prvič, ne bo prvič.
I really liked that.	To mi je bilo zelo všeč.
He didn't seem to have any.	Zdelo se je, da jih nima.
It was simply beautiful.	Bilo je preprosto lepo.
he said to himself.	si je rekel.
That could be serious.	To bi lahko bilo resno.
He has done this once before.	To je storil že enkrat.
They really, really are.	Res, res so.
There wouldn't be enough for everyone.	Ne bi bilo dovolj za vse.
I liked you better when you weren't talking.	Bolj si mi bil všeč, ko nisi govoril.
I needed it now.	Potreboval sem ga zdaj.
This may not be possible.	To morda ne bo mogoče.
And he never came back.	In nikoli se ni vrnil.
Maybe this isn't the time to ask.	Morda to ni čas za vprašanje.
I want that now.	To želim takoj.
It was obvious that he had more to say.	Očitno je bilo, da ima za povedati več.
It may not be that long.	To morda ne bo tako dolgo.
All right, tomorrow morning.	V redu, jutri zjutraj.
I like where we are.	Všeč mi je, kje smo.
Nobody will.	Nihče ne bo.
Like, really hard.	Kot, res težko.
So we are over it.	Tako smo nad tem.
I have it here.	Tukaj ga imam.
A child, she said.	Otrok, je rekla.
You did it yourself.	To si naredil sam.
Right now.	Takoj zdaj.
He couldn't believe what he had done.	Ni mogel verjeti, kaj je naredil.
A little.	Malo.
I know you can't help yourself.	Vem, da si ne moreš pomagati.
And that's just the thing.	In to je samo stvar.
He was sure he would get the job.	Bil je prepričan, da bo dobil službo.
They had to be.	Morali so biti.
I'm asking you.	sprašujem vas.
Which was good.	Kar je bilo dobro.
So glad to see you!	Tako vesel, da te vidim!
I would be better prepared.	Bolje bi bil pripravljen.
I really wanted to.	Zelo sem si želel.
But you could.	Lahko pa bi.
Everyone knew about it.	Vsi so vedeli za to.
He came.	Prišel je.
I know there is more to it than that.	Vem, da je več od tega.
You'll never get it.	Nikoli ga ne boš dobil.
I never would.	Nikoli ne bi.
Without help from anyone.	Brez pomoči od nikogar.
There's not much you can do about it.	Glede tega ne moreš veliko narediti.
And it’s not hard to see that.	In ni težko videti, da je.
She didn't know what to do and where to go.	Ni vedela, kaj naj naredi in kam naj gre.
Maybe I'll go out.	Mogoče grem ven.
It's pretty true.	Precej res je.
I was ready to go.	Bil sem pripravljen iti.
it really was.	res je bilo.
i really like it.	res mi je všeč.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mogoče je to dobra stvar.
Maybe it's me.	Morda ti sam.
I will not forget.	Ne bom pozabil.
And now he was gone.	In zdaj ga ni bilo več.
Too many don't.	Preveč jih ne.
I haven't and I won't.	Nisem in ne bom.
And more.	In še več.
That was all a long time ago.	Vse to je bilo dolgo nazaj.
I think he has a good reason.	Mislim, da ima dober razlog.
But he was not there.	Vendar ga ni bilo.
You did it.	Ti si naredil.
I'm not interested in that.	To me ne zanima.
Fortunately.	Na srečo.
Something we have as an option.	Nekaj, kar imamo kot možnost.
I don't see anyone here.	Tukaj ne vidim nikogar.
All this.	Vse to .
Maybe not forever.	Mogoče ne za vedno.
That was difficult.	To je bilo težko.
I did well.	Dobro mi je uspelo.
as it may be.	kot je morda.
I will be a man.	Človek bom.
I think so.	Mislim, da je tako.
I will not say.	ne bom povedal.
No one is sure.	Nihče ni prepričan.
We will do this for you.	To bomo naredili za vas.
We didn't like it.	Ni nam bilo všeč.
And that was right.	In to je bilo prav.
It seems not.	Zdi se, da ne.
Help for today.	Pomoč za danes.
Or maybe you can, but not tonight.	Ali morda lahko, vendar ne nocoj.
This is not a game.	To ni igra.
He knew a lot.	Veliko je vedel.
What seemed to be nothing else.	Kar je bilo videti, ni bilo nič drugega.
He didn't come.	Ni prišel.
Which he won.	Kar je zmagal.
You know that too.	Tudi ti to veš.
That was not good.	To ni bilo dobro.
He can speak, but he does not speak.	Lahko govori, a ne govori.
And now he's here again.	In zdaj je spet tukaj.
We always do.	Vedno se.
He didn't ask.	Ni vprašal.
I've never done that.	Tega nisem nikoli počel.
That was a good thing, he thought.	To je bila dobra stvar, je mislil.
He won't leave.	Noče oditi.
He didn't want to come.	Ni hotel priti.
Failed.	Ni uspelo.
it seems difficult to me.	težko se mi zdi.
I couldn't do any of that.	Nič od tega ne bi mogel narediti.
He did a very good job.	Opravil je zelo dobro delo.
I know a lot of people.	Poznam veliko ljudi.
He did it this morning.	To je storil danes zjutraj.
Anything was possible, but not in a good way.	Vse je bilo mogoče, a ne na dober način.
We know what to see.	Vemo, kaj videti.
A lot of almost.	Veliko skoraj.
You don't have to talk about me.	Ni ti treba govoriti o meni.
He did these things because he had to.	Te stvari je počel, ker je moral.
You've both been there and you both know.	Oba sta bila tam in oba veste.
And now, now she knew more.	In zdaj, zdaj je vedela več.
And that's not much.	In to ni veliko.
He's probably right.	Verjetno ima prav.
To be able to do that.	Da bi to lahko naredil.
Now, here it is.	Zdaj, tukaj je.
That's why he was here.	Zato je bil tukaj.
That was very serious.	To je bilo zelo resno.
Obviously I am.	Očitno sem.
There is a lot going on here.	Veliko se dogaja tukaj.
Life seems to happen that way.	Zdi se, da se življenje dogaja tako.
It wasn't as if he didn't know that himself.	Ni bilo tako, kot da tega sam ne bi vedel.
No one could help you.	Nihče ti ni mogel pomagati.
I could do it now.	Zdaj bi lahko to naredil.
You shouldn't either.	Tudi ti ne bi smel.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.	Žal temu ni tako.
My friend is here now.	Moj prijatelj je zdaj tukaj.
It's still there.	Še vedno je tam.
And if they were.	In če bi bili.
You have so much time.	Toliko časa imaš.
But it was too much.	Vendar je bilo preveč.
To believe her.	Da ji verjamem.
She went home.	Šla je domov.
I don't want to do anything about it.	Nočem storiti ničesar glede tega.
you would think.	bi si mislil.
She knew.	Vedela je.
Simple, but wrong.	Preprosto, a narobe.
More than you think.	Več, kot si mislite.
Keep going.	Še naprej in naprej.
It's being you and being confident.	To je biti ti in biti prepričan.
I didn’t feel too good at the time.	Takrat se nisem počutil preveč dobro.
It wasn’t something he did a lot.	To ni bilo nekaj, kar je naredil veliko.
That's the question.	To je vprašanje.
But this is not the case either.	A tudi temu ni tako.
What makes you do this.	Kaj vas zaradi tega naredi.
I really am.	Res sem res.
I shouldn't either.	Tudi ne bi smel.
He got the job.	Dobil je službo.
Let him be good.	Naj bo dober.
I certainly liked it a lot more.	Zagotovo mi je bilo veliko bolj všeč.
Maybe this is it.	Mogoče je to to.
And he can't do anything.	In nič ne more.
Talk about us.	Govori o nas.
Everyone will be here.	Vsi bodo tukaj.
They were together last night.	Sinoči sta bila skupaj.
He won't want anything.	Ne bo hotel za nič.
He felt fine today.	Danes se je počutil v redu.
I learned it myself.	Sam sem se naučil.
Unfortunately, this will not happen soon.	Žal se to ne bo zgodilo kmalu.
Just talk to me a little more.	Samo še malo govori z mano.
Soon, very soon.	Kmalu, zelo kmalu.
He will let us stay together.	Pustil nam bo ostati skupaj.
we were not.	nismo bili.
This is simply not right.	To preprosto ni v redu.
I loved that she was there.	Všeč mi je bilo, da je bila tam.
And more than once.	In to več kot enkrat.
Many are just for money and money.	Veliko jih je samo za denar in denar.
No one ever does.	Nihče nikoli ne.
That was fast.	To je bilo hitro.
I do not like.	ni mi všeč.
I didn't expect it to be like that.	Nisem pričakoval, da bo tako.
I wish he ever came to this house.	Žal, da je kdaj prišel v to hišo.
He came.	Prišel je.
This is not the right way.	To ni pravi način.
There was something.	Nekaj ​​je bilo.
I would be alone again.	Spet bi bil sam.
It's not about that.	Ne gre za to.
That's it.	Ta je.
I'm pretty tired.	Precej sem utrujen.
He decided it would be day.	Odločil se je, da bo dan.
He was angry.	Bil je jezen.
And he is not the only one.	In ni edini.
I have things to start with.	imam stvari za početi.
But he saw nothing.	Vendar ni videl ničesar.
She knew everything.	Vse je vedela.
I told you how it is.	Povedal sem ti, kako je.
Do you like me? 	Ali sem ti všeč?
They had time.	Imeli so čas.
I want to tell her what's going to happen.	Rad bi ji povedal, kaj se bo zgodilo.
He thinks wrong.	Misli narobe.
Now about the other.	Zdaj pa glede drugega.
I wanted to do it.	Hotel sem to narediti.
More work.	Več dela.
You don't know as much as you think.	Ne veš toliko, kot si misliš.
He is there.	Tam je.
We certainly don't know that.	Tega zagotovo ne vemo.
I keep wondering.	Kar naprej se sprašujem.
And they were probably right, he knew.	In verjetno so imeli prav, vedel je.
I am very happy about that.	Zelo sem vesel tega.
No, I won't say that.	Ne, tega ne bom rekel.
He did it for fun.	To je naredil za zabavo.
Or maybe someone.	Ali pa morda nekdo.
Maybe not.	Mogoče ni.
And it happened.	In to se je zgodilo.
Now he could only wait.	Zdaj je lahko le čakal.
I would never do anything else.	Nikoli ne bi naredil ničesar drugega.
He sings beautifully.	Lepo poje.
They were right.	Imeli so prav.
I would tell her everything.	Vse bi ji povedal.
This is very common.	To je zelo običajno.
He’s the one who told me to do it.	On je tisti, ki mi je rekel, naj to storim.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
However, they did none of this.	Vendar niso storili ničesar od tega.
If anyone could help him, they certainly could.	Če bi mu kdo lahko pomagal, bi zagotovo lahko.
And made his life.	In naredil svoje življenje.
I hope it's true.	Upam, da je res.
I didn't decide.	Nisem se odločil.
I think it would be better if no one.	Mislim, da bi bilo bolje, če nihče.
I have that.	to imam.
She didn't know what to say or not.	Ni vedela, kaj bi rekla ali ne.
None of us said anything.	Nihče od nas ni rekel ničesar.
Not just here.	Ne samo pri nas.
I let him see what would happen next.	Pustil sem ga, da vidim, kaj se bo zgodilo naprej.
, '.	, '.
Only this.	Samo to.
I stayed there for a while and just waited.	Tam sem ostal nekaj časa in samo čakal.
I do not have any children.	Nimam otrok.
Which he certainly was.	Kar je zagotovo bil.
It's nothing to me.	Zame ni nič drugega.
Neither do I.	Niti ti jaz.
I don't think he even knew.	Mislim, da sploh ni vedel.
No, he didn't forget.	Ne, ni pozabil.
It just has to be.	Samo mora biti.
All because I could.	Vse zato, ker bi lahko.
I was not home.	Nisem bil doma.
And even further back.	In še bolj nazaj.
He was ready for it.	Na to je bil pripravljen.
But he never had enough.	A nikoli ni imel dovolj.
He was the only child.	Bil je edini otrok.
It's hard to see.	Težko je videti.
I don't want you here.	Nočem te tukaj.
She could have done it, she had to do it.	To je lahko storila, to je morala narediti.
You should know these things.	Te stvari bi moral vedeti.
That's why we're here.	Zato smo tukaj.
Probably more.	Verjetno še več.
This here was wrong.	To tukaj je bilo narobe.
He must be angry.	Mora biti jezen.
It's not that simple.	Ni tako preprosto.
I want to move on.	Želim iti naprej.
I had a lot to say.	Imel sem veliko za povedati.
But they knew where it was.	Vendar so vedeli, kje je.
It's true and you know it.	Res je in to veš.
Or maybe he wasn’t.	Ali pa morda ni bil.
I've never heard of anything like it.	Še nikoli nisem slišal za kaj takega.
However, we cannot see this.	Vendar tega ne moremo videti.
He wants to be helpful.	Želi biti v pomoč.
Maybe you can.	Mogoče lahko.
There were too many people.	Bilo je preveč ljudi.
Everyone heard their own.	Vsak je slišal svoje.
It was true and it wasn't true.	Bilo je res in ni bilo res.
Not for a long time.	Že dolgo ne.
I am a man from another time.	Sem človek iz drugega časa.
You don't have to do anything!	Nič vam ni treba storiti!
He knows you.	On te pozna.
I really was.	res sem bil.
They had to do it.	To so morali storiti.
As it should be.	Tako kot mora biti.
I know it's him.	Vem, da je on.
Did he do the right thing? 	Je naredil prav?
I can't tell what he's thinking.	Ne morem povedati, kaj misli.
This was the first time he had seen her.	To je bilo prvič, da jo je videl.
Maybe she'll know soon enough.	Morda bo kmalu vedela.
I will make dinner.	Naredil bom večerjo.
She wanted to be there.	Tam je želela biti.
I’m sure he doesn’t.	Prepričan sem, da tega ne počne.
I've been there before.	Tam sem že bil.
I'm really not here.	res nisem tukaj.
He says it's very good.	Pravi, da je zelo dobro.
So it's actually going pretty well.	Tako da gre pravzaprav kar dobro.
It's a lot.	Je veliko.
It's the day before.	Dan prej je.
I met her the day before.	Spoznal sem jo dan prej.
I don't want to be.	Nočem biti.
You are so good to us.	Tako si dober do nas.
It made me feel good.	Zaradi tega sem se dobro počutil.
I didn't need to be told.	Ni mi bilo treba povedati.
And you are good.	In ti si dober.
It seemed so long ago.	Zdelo se je tako dolgo nazaj.
That was something.	To je bilo nekaj.
He had a few days.	Imel je nekaj dni časa.
I thought he would do it.	Mislil sem, da bo to naredil.
But he didn't give up.	A se ni dal.
You should do these things.	Moral bi narediti te stvari.
It's true.	Res je.
He was in me now.	Zdaj je bil v meni.
What else could it be.	Kaj bi še lahko bilo.
Dad seemed to think nothing could go wrong.	Zdelo se je, da je oče mislil, da ne more iti nič narobe.
This is all true.	To je vse res.
For now.	Za zdaj.
He was very good.	Bil je zelo dober.
Nothing else had to be there.	Nič drugega ni bilo treba tam.
I couldn't help it.	Ne bi mogel pomagati.
That can never be right.	To nikoli ne more biti prav.
And he didn't expect it to happen.	In ni pričakoval, da se bo to zgodilo.
I am yours as much as you are mine.	Tvoj sem toliko, kot si ti moj.
It's not just us either.	Tudi to nismo samo mi.
They will have children.	Imeli bodo otroke.
Nothing he would like.	Nič, kar bi mu bilo všeč.
It's just not possible.	Samo ni mogoče.
He's wasted enough time already.	Dovolj časa je že izgubil.
She was there.	Bila je tam.
Coming back soon.	Kmalu nazaj.
Now, since you didn't start out that way, we will.	Zdaj, ker ti nisi tako začel, bomo mi.
He was too.	Tudi on je bil.
He knew that now.	Zdaj je to vedel.
I didn't say that.	tega nisem rekel.
But that's not the case here.	Vendar tukaj ni tako.
Let it be so.	Naj bo tako.
I could do that.	Lahko bi to naredil.
But something seems to be wrong.	A zdi se, da je nekaj narobe.
Maybe they are.	Morda so.
She wanted to play again.	Želela je spet igrati.
The money was there.	Denar je bil tam.
Will have to see.	Bo treba videti.
I am totally in favor.	Popolnoma sem za.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu gre.
They will simply see what is right.	Preprosto bodo videli, kaj je prav.
And yet.	In vendar.
Life is now.	Življenje je zdaj.
She's never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni storila.
You did that.	To si naredil.
I still think we have that.	Še vedno mislim, da imamo to.
So he is better off with some money than nothing.	Zato mu je bolje z nekaj denarja kot nič.
I think that's true.	Mislim, da je to res.
You decided.	Ti si se odločil.
Maybe it’s just something that exists.	Morda je to preprosto nekaj, kar obstaja.
He felt better in the morning.	Zjutraj se je počutil bolje.
We are there these days.	Tam smo te dni.
I hope he gets better.	Upam, da mu bo bolje.
That was good, but it still wasn’t enough.	To je bilo dobro, a še vedno ni bilo dovolj.
I'm sure he will.	Prepričan sem, da bo.
No one, really.	Nihče ne, res.
It's pretty good.	Je kar dobro.
We have dinner tonight.	Nocoj imamo večerjo.
We really can’t do more than that.	Več kot to res ne moremo storiti.
I don’t know for sure and you definitely don’t know.	Ne vem zagotovo in ti zagotovo ne veš.
I asked if he did.	Vprašal sem, če je to naredil.
It doesn't do anything other than that.	Ne naredi nič drugega kot to.
He's afraid of me.	Boji se me.
A little is enough.	Malo je dovolj.
I learned so much there.	Tam sem se toliko naučil.
Like, I really like it.	Kot, res mi je všeč.
And fortunately it is.	In na srečo je tako.
You need to talk to me about this.	O tem moraš govoriti z mano.
And this is serious.	In to je resno.
To do this.	Če želite to narediti.
There is something we should do about it.	Nekaj ​​bi morali storiti glede tega.
Or you could just see what you know.	Ali pa bi lahko samo videli, kar veste.
She didn't do that.	Tega ni storila.
And we need to do more of that.	In tega moramo storiti več.
I couldn't and I shouldn't.	Ne bi mogel in ne bi smel.
You said you could.	Rekel si, da lahko.
Nice to see you.	Lepo te je videti.
Maybe so.	Mogoče je tako.
It would not be easy to do better.	Narediti bolje ne bi bilo lahko.
I feel like I’ve gotten a lot better.	Zdi se mi, da sem postal veliko bolje.
They did more than that.	Naredili so več kot to.
I know that's true.	Vem, da je to res.
What, she didn't know.	Kaj, ni vedela.
Here's the problem with that.	Tukaj je problem s tem.
You will meet her.	Spoznal jo boš.
However, we do not have to do that.	Vendar nam tega ni treba storiti.
Now that they were together, he didn't know what to do.	Zdaj, ko sta bila skupaj, ni vedel, kaj naj stori.
He had his day.	Imel je svoj dan.
And he is my friend.	In on je moj prijatelj.
He didn’t know who she was and where to find her again.	Ni vedel, kdo je in kje bi jo spet našel.
Maybe too much.	Mogoče preveč.
We managed to do that.	To nam je uspelo.
Maybe he knows something about it.	Mogoče ve kaj o tem.
I saw too much not too much.	Preveč sem videl ne preveč.
I learned so much from you.	Toliko sem se naučil od tebe.
More likely he just wasn’t up to it.	Bolj verjetno, da mu preprosto ni bilo do tega.
I asked if he needed help.	Vprašal sem, če potrebuje pomoč.
And you know it.	In ti to veš.
It's mine, you know.	Moj je, veš.
He said nothing more for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa ni rekel nič več.
You were just.	Bil si samo.
I won't forget that.	Tega ne bom pozabil.
Nobody has asked me that yet.	Tega me še nihče ni vprašal.
It's hard to see.	Težko je videti.
I would never have thought that would happen to me.	Nikoli si ne bi mislil, da se mi bo to zgodilo.
I still felt like a child myself.	Sam sem se še vedno počutil kot otrok.
What is wrong is wrong and wrong.	Kar je narobe, je narobe in ni v redu.
Apparently they didn't do that.	Očitno tega niso storili.
You should see.	Morali bi videti.
Everything must go.	Vse mora iti.
And yet, here we are.	In vendar, tukaj smo.
That's right, that's right.	Tako je, tako je.
He's here right now.	Trenutno je tukaj.
I actually learned things.	Pravzaprav sem se naučil stvari.
He just told me.	Pravkar mi je povedal.
I've always said that.	Vedno sem to govoril.
She no longer looked like a child.	Ni bila več videti kot otrok.
Do it now.	Naredi to takoj.
Is it okay if you	Ali je v redu, če ti.
However, this was not enough.	Vendar to ni bilo dovolj.
I'll help you tomorrow.	Pomagal ti bom jutri.
I know someone died.	Vem, da je nekdo umrl.
For me, this was never a problem.	Zame to nikoli ni bil problem.
They are not there to have them.	Ni jih, da bi jih imel.
That's a lot of work.	To je veliko dela.
Who and where, how and why, when and what.	Kdo in kje, kako in zakaj, kdaj in kaj.
Now he was mine.	Zdaj je bil moj.
Because he is a man.	Ker je človek.
Anything else? 	Še kaj drugega?
You told me that.	To si mi povedal.
You were the one who called me back and asked for help.	Ti si bil tisti, ki me je poklical nazaj in prosil za pomoč.
I can't even.	Sploh ne morem.
You once were.	Nekoč si.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
That's exactly what he wants to do with it.	Prav to želi narediti s tem.
We have enough.	Imamo dovolj.
No one knows where she went.	Nihče ne ve, kam je šla.
No, you don't have to do everything yourself.	Ne, ni vam treba vsega narediti sam.
Or could it be something else?	Ali pa bi lahko bilo kaj drugega?
I don't know what will happen.	Ne vem, kaj se bo zgodilo.
It might not be possible.	Morda ne bo mogoče.
I was angry.	bil sem jezen.
We know that too.	To tudi vemo.
I really am.	res sem.
He's just a friend.	On je samo prijatelj.
This is a really simple question.	To je res preprosto vprašanje.
In fact, they had a reason to do so.	Pravzaprav so imeli razlog za to.
He heard nothing again.	Spet ni slišal ničesar.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ni.
Something is obviously wrong.	Očitno je nekaj narobe.
That's right.	Tako je.
We know everything.	Vse vemo.
We are.	Mi smo.
That way no one would see you.	Tako te nihče ne bi videl.
That would not be right.	To ne bi bilo prav.
He was not in town long.	V mestu ni bil dolgo.
There was no time for anything.	Ni bilo časa za nič.
He became such a good friend.	Postal je tako dober prijatelj.
They didn't know he was here yet.	Niso še vedeli, da je tukaj.
It was not something one could forget.	To ni bila stvar, ki bi jo človek lahko pozabil.
Not from that.	Od tega pa ne.
She liked that.	To ji je bilo všeč.
But it doesn’t help.	Vendar ne pomaga.
He asked for more.	Prosil je za več.
You know where you want to eat, just tell me.	Veš, kje želiš jesti, samo povej mi.
He'll be at the party tonight.	Nocoj bo na zabavi.
It still worked.	Še vedno je uspelo.
He didn't say anyone.	Ni rekel nikogar.
Fine.	V redu.
But maybe it's just me.	Morda pa sem to samo jaz.
He went.	Šel je.
I haven't decided.	Nisem se odločil.
I'll call her right away.	Takoj jo bom poklical.
But it is a.	Ali je to a.
No, not that good.	Ne, ne tako dobro.
He promised her she would not be sorry.	Obljubil ji je, da ji ne bo žal.
Has it ever happened to you?	Se vam je kdaj zgodilo?
Right there.	Takoj in tam.
I called him.	poklical sem ga.
You are something to behold.	Ste nekaj za videti.
As if they didn't have enough.	Kot da ne bi imeli dovolj.
I do not understand that.	Tega ne razumem.
She actually wanted them.	Pravzaprav si jih je želela.
We wouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi storili.
And he knew it.	In to je vedel.
It just feels.	Preprosto se počuti.
First, this is not true.	Prvič, to ni res.
It neither lives nor is life.	Ne živi niti ni življenje.
I know, right.	Vem, kajne.
I was glad he was there.	Bil sem vesel, da je tam.
Tom will do it by tomorrow.	Tom bo to naredil do jutri.
And she was good to him.	In bila je dobra do njega.
And he thought he was going to tell her.	In mislil je, da ji bo povedal.
I know what he's doing.	Vem, kaj počne.
This is my job.	To je moje delo.
I am very sorry.	Zelo mi je žal.
Keep it up.	Kar tako naprej.
Just for fun.	Samo za zabavo.
All right, that's fine.	V redu, to je v redu.
I said he didn't do anything wrong.	Rekel sem, da ni nič naredil narobe.
He saw her there for the first time.	Tam jo je videl prvič.
I didn't tell her anything.	Nič ji nisem rekel.
Are you sure ?.	Ali si prepričan?.
he asked.	je vprašal.
I'm so sorry, he says.	Tako mi je žal, pravi.
He decided.	Odločil se je.
But he also doesn't want to help us.	A tudi on nam noče pomagati.
I need someone like that.	Potrebujem nekoga takega.
No, that's not right.	Ne, to ni prav.
Well, they did.	Pa so se.
This is what is wanted.	To je tisto, kar se želi.
But he is a very good teacher.	Je pa zelo dober učitelj.
It happened fast.	Zgodilo se je hitro.
You never know what you will find.	Nikoli ne veš, kaj boš našel.
You can't just do that.	Ne moreš kar tako.
They didn't have it.	Niso ga imeli.
I liked it there.	Tam mi je bilo všeč.
There’s a man there or he was.	Tam je človek ali pa je bil.
I am very happy.	Zelo sem vesel.
Why is he doing this?	Zakaj to počne?
I wanted to be of help.	Hotel sem biti v pomoč.
They were there then.	Takrat so bili tam.
This is not going to happen.	To se ne bo zgodilo.
A man only has so many years to do good.	Človek ima le toliko let, da naredi dobro.
If this is what you think, it can definitely be done.	Če je to tisto, kar mislite, je to zagotovo mogoče storiti.
I didn’t expect to do that.	Nisem pričakoval, da bom to storil.
And here we are.	In tukaj smo.
I like that so much.	To mi je tako zelo všeč.
That's why he liked her.	Zaradi tega mu je bila všeč.
And you probably will.	In verjetno boste.
I learned so much here.	Tukaj sem se toliko naučil.
It's about you.	Gre za vas.
Very good question.	Zelo dobro vprašanje.
That was not the question.	To ni bilo vprašanje.
They really are.	Res so.
Which they did without me being there.	Kar so storili, ne da bi bil jaz tam.
It shouldn't be.	Ne bi smel biti.
I've known him for quite some time.	Poznam ga že kar nekaj časa.
How could you.	Kako bi sploh lahko.
It was with him.	Z njim je bilo.
So simple.	Tako preprosto.
As if one could see and hear everything.	Kot da bi človek videl in slišal vse.
She wanted more time.	Želela je več časa.
Something she said was wrong.	Nekaj, kar je rekla, je bilo narobe.
They didn't really know.	Pravzaprav niso vedeli.
I saw.	Videl sem.
And on to the next and the next.	In na naslednji in naslednji.
I didn't have time for that.	Nisem imel časa za to.
He was fine with that.	To mu je bilo v redu.
I want you with me.	Želim te z mano.
He is.	On je.
I could come home.	Lahko bi prišel domov.
I'll tell you something else.	Povedal ti bom nekaj drugega.
He doesn't know why he's saying that.	Ne ve, zakaj to pravi.
We had nothing to do with it.	S tem nismo imeli nič.
It was too much for me.	Bilo mi je preveč.
And it does well.	In to naredi dobro.
you.	ti.
It was like she was there.	Bilo je, kot da je bila tam.
I can see why you would want that to be the case.	Razumem, zakaj bi si želel, da je tako.
But there was more.	A bilo je še več.
She didn't have to do that.	Ni ji bilo treba tega storiti.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
I don’t understand and I never have.	Ne razumem in nikoli nisem.
No, not just that day.	Ne, ne samo tisti dan.
I know it is.	Vem, da je.
Tell me who did it.	Povej mi, kdo je to naredil.
He has nothing to tell her.	Nima ji kaj povedati.
You have been doing this for a long time.	Pri tem ste že dolgo.
You will, boy.	Boš, fant.
Or maybe he couldn’t.	Ali pa morda ni mogel.
But he has to go home.	Vendar mora iti domov.
He tried to do that.	To je poskušal narediti.
And he knows that too.	In tudi on to ve.
I'm going to have to go to work.	moral bom v službo.
And they knew why.	In vedeli so zakaj.
Yes, it certainly isn't.	Da zagotovo ni.
It is and it should be.	Je in mora biti.
Even more so now than before.	Še bolj zdaj kot prej.
Both were more.	Oba sta bila več.
For me, this is not life.	Zame to ni življenje.
For a while.	Za čas.
He worked on the book for some time.	S knjigo je delal nekaj časa.
I just asked you what you want.	Pravkar sem te vprašal, kaj želiš.
Is easy.	Je lahko.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
He doesn't have to talk to you every day.	Ni mu treba govoriti s tabo vsak dan.
There can be no other.	Drugega ne more biti.
I'm just not sure what.	Samo nisem prepričan, kaj.
Apparently he has something else to say.	Očitno ima še kaj za povedati.
I am.	Jaz sem.
I really liked him.	Zelo mi je bil všeč.
It didn't seem to be.	Zdelo se je, da ni.
And here she was.	In tukaj je bila.
So could he.	Lahko bi tudi on.
I would like to ask again.	Še enkrat bi rad vprašal.
It was a game, he gave her so much.	Bila je igra, toliko ji je dal.
And maybe that’s actually the problem.	In morda je pravzaprav to problem.
They had a lot to say about it.	O tem so imeli veliko povedati.
I certainly haven't heard that before.	Tega zagotovo še nisem slišal.
I don't need anything money can buy.	Ne potrebujem ničesar, kar bi lahko kupil denar.
I want more time.	Želim si več časa.
I’m so sorry this happened.	Tako mi je žal, da se je to zgodilo.
I have.	Imam.
You will be next.	Ti boš naslednji.
I liked him.	Všeč mi je bil.
I wonder why.	Sprašujem se zakaj.
That's all he needs.	To je vse, kar potrebuje.
It will help me a lot.	Zelo mi bo pomagal.
I have to go back.	Moram nazaj.
I knew better than that.	Vedel sem bolje od tega.
maybe I won't.	morda ne bom.
It will never be anything.	Nikoli ne bo nič.
I thought it was just me.	Mislil sem, da sem samo jaz.
And if not, they are not.	In če ne, niso.
I can never be.	nikoli ne morem biti.
It will make you feel good.	Zaradi tega se bo počutil dobro.
They are still with me.	Še vedno so pri meni.
In fact, so do I.	Pravzaprav tudi jaz.
I have to.	Moram.
I wish I had.	Želim si, da bi imel.
Maybe not.	Mogoče tudi ne bo.
That's almost all.	To je skoraj vse.
I'm glad he's with me.	Vesel sem, da je z mano.
I'm so glad to be here.	Tako sem vesel, da sem tukaj.
I have to go.	Moram iti.
However, much remains to be done.	Vendar je treba še veliko narediti.
You haven't eaten.	Nisi jedel.
A lot actually.	Pravzaprav veliko.
He really meant it, he told me.	Res je mislil, mi je rekel.
That makes you better.	Zaradi tega si boljši.
I asked how she managed.	Vprašal sem, kako ji je uspelo.
So it was for me now.	Tako je bilo zdaj zame.
Learn more here and here.	Več o tem tukaj in tukaj.
I had to do something.	Moral sem nekaj narediti.
Not to be.	Ne biti.
No, that's not a good way to do it.	Ne, to ni dober način za to.
And even then.	In tudi takrat.
I should be with you.	Moral bi biti s tabo.
Or started.	Ali pa začel.
From us to you.	Od nas do vas.
He's here now.	Zdaj je tukaj.
Here and here.	Tukaj in tukaj.
I'll start right away.	Takoj bom začel.
He thought he had a chance.	Mislil je, da ima priložnost.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
As if anything was possible.	Kot da je bilo vse mogoče.
How much did he get.	Koliko je dobil.
He will come tonight.	Prišel bo nocoj.
You made me a better person.	Zaradi tebe sem postal boljši človek.
He will come.	Prišel bo.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Nič ni mogel storiti glede tega.
I thought it would.	Mislil sem, da bo.
It was me.	Bil si jaz.
We were together for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa sva bila skupaj.
I really wonder about that.	To se res sprašujem.
That was a good thing.	To je bila dobra stvar.
We know what we did.	Vemo, kaj smo naredili.
Maybe he's your friend.	Mogoče je tvoj prijatelj.
And she's very good at it.	In v tem je zelo dobra.
i'm there too.	tudi jaz sem tam.
He was too.	Tudi on je bil.
He wasn't happy about it.	Ni bil vesel tega.
Then we will have to eat.	Takrat bomo morali jesti.
I could sit here.	Lahko bi sedel tukaj.
I'm glad you have the money.	Vesel sem, da imaš denar.
They never saw him again.	Nikoli več ga niso videli.
Maybe too much.	Mogoče preveč.
We know we have to help ourselves.	Vemo, da si moramo pomagati sami.
I think we did quite well.	Mislim, da nam je to kar dobro uspelo.
I understand.	Razumem.
As well as here.	Pa tudi tukaj.
How many did you buy.	Koliko si jih kupil.
I haven’t heard much about it.	Nisem slišal veliko o tem.
It was here, right now.	Bilo je tukaj, prav zdaj.
He will come to me.	Bo prišel k meni.
I see you have this.	Vidim, da imaš tega.
Was that it? 	Je bilo to to?
He didn't wait.	Ni čakal.
I've worked for you long enough.	Dovolj dolgo sem delal zate.
Just like that time back.	Tako kot tisti čas nazaj.
This is often not the case.	Pogosto temu ni tako.
I don't see that.	Tega ne vidim.
But it is also something else.	Je pa tudi nekaj drugega.
It is and yet it is not.	Je in vendar ni.
So did everyone.	Tako so storili vsi.
Nothing is wrong.	Nič ni narobe.
I completely understand why.	Popolnoma razumem zakaj.
In this city.	V tem mestu.
I wasn't home at all.	Sploh me ni bilo doma.
He did it because he could.	To je storil, ker je lahko.
It seems to me that this must be right.	Zdi se mi, da mora biti to prav.
But you don't know that.	Tega pa ne veš.
Not you either.	Tudi ti ne.
I would hear something.	nekaj bi slišal.
Or maybe it really is.	Ali pa morda res.
That’s actually what he wants.	To je pravzaprav tisto, kar želi.
I think.	mislim.
Yesterday was that day.	Včeraj je bil ta dan.
You were right the first time.	Prvič si imel prav.
I have too much work to do.	Imam preveč dela.
I just got home when you came.	Pravkar sem se vrnil domov, ko si prišel.
There is	Ima
I heard about it.	Slišal sem o tem.
Everything we could have.	Vse, kar bi lahko imeli.
It didn't look good.	Ni bilo videti dobro.
He plays a lot.	Veliko igra.
We liked it very much.	Zelo nam je bil všeč.
I wanted out.	Hotel sem ven.
I am interested in this person.	Zanima me ta oseba.
He is with me all day.	Ves dan je z mano.
Not so.	Ne tako.
He was very tired.	Bil je zelo utrujen.
Or you had it.	Ali pa ste ga imeli.
There will be more of that.	Tega bo še več.
I'm a little interested.	Malo me zanima.
You have to tell us something.	Nekaj ​​nam moraš povedati.
I became good from working with him.	Od dela z njim sem postal dober.
You did them well.	Dobro si jih naredil.
The boy would never say.	Fant nikoli ne bi rekel.
Not good for that.	Ni dobro za to.
Nothing ahead of us.	Nič pred nami.
That's how it goes.	Tako to gre.
There is nothing more to go.	Ni kaj več za iti.
I certainly am.	zagotovo sem.
I'm asking too much.	Preveč sprašujem.
This has been a problem for some time.	To je problem že nekaj časa.
This is something you have.	To je nekaj, kar imaš.
I will ask him and I will go there immediately.	Ga bom vprašal in takoj grem tja.
That is	To je
Here you are.	Tukaj si.
I was a bit surprised.	Bil sem kar malo presenečen.
But even that was not enough.	A tudi to ni bilo dovolj.
And he said he wasn't the only one.	In rekel je, da ni edini.
There was no one here.	Tukaj ni bilo nikogar.
I know I can.	Vem, da lahko.
I didn't have to tell anyone anything.	Nikomur mi ni bilo treba ničesar povedati.
There was nothing more to say.	Nič več ni bilo za povedati.
Someone who didn't want to be here.	Nekdo, ki ga ni hotel tukaj.
It's actually not right.	Pravzaprav ni prav.
I really met you.	Res sem te spoznal.
Which could be just as good.	Kar bi lahko bilo prav tako dobro.
I knew.	sem vedel.
also,	prav tako,
I didn’t know how to do it.	Nisem vedel, kako to storiti.
I would call everyone tomorrow.	Jutri bi vse poklical.
Back to the hotel.	Nazaj v hotel.
She was in front of us today.	Danes je bila pred nami.
None of this will be easy.	Nič od tega ne bo lahko.
I thought you might like it.	Mislil sem, da vam bo morda všeč.
Just like it was.	Tako kot je bilo to.
I mean, you know what he's gonna say.	Mislim, veš kaj bo rekel.
I don’t go without once a week.	Ne grem brez enkrat na teden.
It’s hard to see what’s wrong with that.	Težko je videti, kaj je s tem narobe.
We have to get out.	Moramo ven.
He just wasn't right.	Preprosto ni bil pravi.
He said he would like that.	Rekel je, da bi mu bilo to všeč.
That's not good enough.	To ni dovolj dobro.
That would be it.	To bi bilo to.
We have to leave now.	Zdaj moramo oditi.
And he was angry, very angry.	In bil je jezen, zelo jezen.
However, this was not enough.	Vendar to ni bilo dovolj veliko.
Now let me go back.	Zdaj pa naj grem nazaj.
Maybe I shouldn't.	Mogoče ne bi smel.
She was fine with that, for once.	To ji je bilo v redu, za enkrat.
I'm going.	grem.
They are mine.	Moje so.
I'll just say that.	Samo še to bom rekel.
I wanted to help you.	hotel sem ti pomagati.
I really don't think so.	Res ne mislim tako.
I would do anything.	Vse bi naredil.
It's true.	Res je.
I'll see if he sees you.	Bom videl, če te bo videl.
It's a simple job.	To je preprosto delo.
It looked like he knew something.	Videti je bilo, kot da nekaj ve.
And so on.	In tako še naprej.
But who she was.	Ali kdo je bila.
I know there is more to this.	Vem, da je na tem več.
I wish I hadn't said that.	Želim si, da tega ne bi rekel.
We made.	Naredili smo.
In fact, she seemed to really like it.	Pravzaprav se je zdelo, da ji je res všeč.
That's my way or not.	To je moj način ali ne.
None of this is happening.	Nič od tega se ne dogaja.
It never will be.	Nikoli ne bo.
You really should.	Res bi morala.
A lot has happened.	Veliko se je zgodilo.
We are out of money now.	Zdaj smo brez denarja.
I think it will be fine.	Mislim, da bo v redu.
I wanted to go home.	Hotel sem iti domov.
But there was more to it than that.	Vendar je bilo več kot to.
It wasn't who it was supposed to be.	To ni bil tisti, ki naj bi bil.
He liked it very much.	Bilo mu je zelo všeč.
I should eat.	Moral bi jesti.
He made me.	Naredil me je.
If you don't like it, fine.	Če ti ni všeč, prav.
I knew this was it.	Vedel sem, da je to to.
Someone has to say that.	Nekdo mora to povedati.
Now we have to do it this way.	Zdaj moramo to narediti na ta način.
I did it once.	Enkrat sem.
But he found much more than that.	A našel je veliko več kot to.
I don't need them for anything.	Ne potrebujem jih za nič.
But it was so.	Ali je bilo tako.
That's all.	To je vse.
He decided he wanted me.	Odločil se je, da me želi.
I think I could do him good.	Mislim, da bi mu lahko naredil dobro.
She said maybe.	Rekla je, da morda.
But that's backwards.	Vendar je to za nazaj.
Bo.	Bo.
This is clearly nothing like that.	To očitno ni nič takega.
Of this .	Od tega .
I think that day will be soon.	Mislim, da bo ta dan kmalu.
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni več.
He plays us.	Igra nas.
Where is he now?	Kje je zdaj.
I don't need to talk to you.	Ni mi treba govoriti s tabo.
I've had enough of that too.	Tudi tega sem imel dovolj.
Now she knew that wasn't the case.	Zdaj je vedela, da ni tako.
You may or may not already know this.	Morda to že veste in morda ne.
And that's where a lot of it goes.	In tja gre veliko tega.
I don't want that.	tega ne želim.
That's because he has.	To je zato, ker ima.
Not much to say.	Ni veliko za povedati.
I have to get to.	Moram priti do.
I went on.	sem šel naprej.
Yes, he's back.	Da, vrnil se je.
Without that being a possibility.	Ne da bi bila to možnost.
Which is hard, man.	Kar je težko, človek.
Or a man.	Ali pa človek.
This is not easy for her.	To ji ni lahko.
I really don't want to see them either.	Tudi jaz jih res nočem videti.
I will be with you.	jaz bom s tabo.
It is unlikely to succeed.	Malo verjetno je, da bo uspelo.
For a while, that's all.	Za nekaj časa, to je vse.
I don't know who.	ne vem kdo.
She didn't even know what it was anymore.	Sploh ni več vedela, kaj je.
He said no.	Rekel je, da ni.
That's the only way to do it.	To je edini način za to.
Not in the afternoon.	Ne popoldne.
However, this is usually not the case.	Vendar običajno ni tako.
I know she loved it.	Vem, da ji je bilo všeč.
He knew what he had to do.	Vedel je, kaj mora storiti.
That has to go.	To mora iti.
He felt a little better now.	Zdaj se je počutil malo bolje.
Me, it's me.	Jaz, to sem jaz.
Or more than that.	Ali več kot to.
They went alone.	Šla sta sama.
Maybe never.	Mogoče ne nikoli.
You're still here.	Še vedno si tukaj.
He hasn't come in a while.	Že nekaj časa ni prišel.
Maybe there were more.	Mogoče jih je bilo več.
That would never happen now.	To se zdaj nikoli ne bi zgodilo.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
I don't see that.	Ne vidim tega.
Now we have a chance.	Zdaj imamo možnost.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
I wouldn't want that.	tega ne bi želel.
He found me.	Našel me je.
I think he'll be here soon.	Mislim, da bo kmalu tukaj.
She wasn't much better.	Ni ji bilo veliko bolje.
They are no more.	Niso več.
Good good!	Dobro dobro!
You should never do that.	Tega nikoli ne bi smel storiti.
Nobody saw him.	Nihče ga ni videl.
Or he, but he doesn’t care.	Ali pa ga, vendar ga ne zanima.
I will sit here.	sedel bom tukaj.
It's still there.	Še vedno je tam.
You knew it would.	Vedel si, da bo.
We don’t know what we could do.	Ne vemo, kaj bi lahko naredili.
I wanted to be sure.	Hotel sem biti prepričan.
Because he didn't think he could get there before.	Ker prej ni mislil, da bi lahko prišel tja.
That was right.	To je bilo prav.
She said you are the one.	Rekla je, ti si tisti.
He wanted to be human, but he didn’t.	Želel je biti človek, pa ni.
That much you should know.	Toliko bi moral vedeti.
Someone has to say what we did.	Nekdo mora povedati, kaj smo naredili.
I really am.	res sem.
we are there.	tam smo.
I had more of them.	Imel sem jih več.
I've never seen him look like that before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl tako videti.
I hope this is not true.	Upam, da to ni res.
It was just for fun.	Bilo je samo za zabavo.
Now she knew why.	Zdaj je vedela zakaj.
Or a car ?.	Ali avto?.
She was fine.	Bila je v redu.
There really isn’t too much going on here.	Tukaj se res ne dogaja preveč.
He thought he lived in the city.	Mislil je, da živi v mestu.
That seems right to me.	To se mi zdi prav.
This is actually not a good thing at all.	To pravzaprav sploh ni dobra stvar.
It seems like so much could have happened.	Zdi se, da bi se lahko zgodilo toliko.
You will be mine.	Moj boš.
He says he needs money.	Pravi, da potrebuje denar.
I wish we had more time there.	Želim si, da bi tam imeli več časa.
Maybe better than he knows himself.	Morda bolje, kot se sam pozna.
It's true, it's true.	Res je, res je.
You'll see him again.	Boš ga še videl.
I'm not sure what it is.	Nisem prepričan, kaj je.
Really, that's enough.	Res, to je dovolj.
What did you say?	Kaj si rekel?
No, he decided.	Ne, odločil se je.
How would anyone know for sure?	Kako bi kdo zagotovo vedel?
I've seen enough.	Dovolj sem videl.
That they are.	Da so.
Or maybe it wouldn't.	Ali pa morda ne bi.
I absolutely liked this one.	Ta mi je bil popolnoma všeč.
So very serious.	Tako zelo resno.
What is it?.	Kaj je to?.
We were there and we did it.	Bili smo tam in to smo storili.
That's such a good thing.	To je tako dobra stvar.
Or I would like to.	Ali pa bi želel.
It hasn't been for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa ni bilo.
I'm sure it was right.	Prepričan sem, da je bilo prav.
Don't talk to me like you used to.	Ne govori z mano kot nekoč.
I would be better.	Bil bi boljši.
And it comes and goes pretty fast.	In pride in gre precej hitro.
Only.	Samo.
If you can.	Če lahko.
I saw her again the following week.	Naslednji teden sem jo spet videl.
In fact, they weren't there at all.	Pravzaprav sploh niso bili tam.
I know how busy you are.	Vem kako si zaposlen.
That was a long time ago.	To je bilo pa že dolgo nazaj.
She was here.	Tukaj je bila.
I'm not sure what's wrong here.	Nisem prepričan, kaj je tukaj narobe.
I really don’t have much else to say.	Res nimam veliko drugega za povedati.
Nothing more than that.	Nič več kot to.
This has been going on for years.	To se dogaja že leta.
Because it wasn't just me.	Ker nisem bil samo jaz.
Im asking for help.	Prosim za pomoč.
In fact, it was true and they knew it.	Pravzaprav je bilo res in to so vedeli.
It’s about knowing how to eat.	To je vedeti, kako jesti.
Once is enough.	Enkrat je dovolj.
I don’t do that much.	Jaz tega ne počnem toliko.
You shouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi smel storiti.
I can see that for myself.	To lahko vidim sam.
What would happen?	Kaj bi se zgodilo?
You have so much to say.	Toliko imaš za povedati.
I certainly would.	Zagotovo bi.
This is not normal.	To ni običajno.
I don't want to stay here.	Nočem ostati tukaj.
I’m surprised she really liked it.	Presenečen sem, saj ji je bilo zelo všeč.
I'm really sorry.	Res mi je žal.
That's not for us.	To za nas ni ne.
Not here.	Ne tukaj.
She knew she had to work fast.	Vedela je, da mora hitro delati.
We've seen that before.	To smo že videli.
You are absolutely right.	Popolnoma prav imaš.
Good day everyone.	Dober dan vsem.
He wasn't good.	Ni bil dober.
You just haven't seen them.	Samo videl jih nisi.
It will never happen.	Nikoli se ne bo zgodilo.
More than good.	Več kot dobro.
Yes, she was.	Da, bila je.
I've never met him before.	Še nikoli ga nisem srečal.
I will not do anything wrong.	Ne bom naredil nič narobe.
He was glad to see him.	Bil je vesel, da ga je videl.
And we don’t know what to do.	In ne vemo, kaj narediti.
And yet something, something.	Pa vendar nekaj, nekaj.
I was surprised.	Bil sem presenečen.
The man just didn't say anything.	Človek preprosto ni rekel ničesar.
Everyone has things.	Vsak ima stvari.
It was just my life.	To je bilo samo moje življenje.
He too.	Tudi on.
.	.
We need to be here instead.	Namesto tega moramo biti tukaj.
But it's not about being alone.	Vendar ne gre za to, da si sam.
Soon they were behind me.	Kmalu so bili za mano.
He had to do that.	To je moral narediti.
Maybe I'll never see her again.	Mogoče je nikoli več ne bom videl.
You can't be.	Ne moreš biti.
How she knew she was supposed to be together.	Kako je vedela, da naj bi bila skupaj.
I have to leave soon.	Kmalu moram oditi.
We would never do that.	Tega ne bi nikoli naredili.
He wanted to stay.	Hotel je ostati.
I see again.	Spet vidim.
So, so true.	Tako, tako res.
You wont.	Ne boste.
Good to see you,” he said.	Lepo te je videti,« je rekel.
If there really was anything to eat there.	Če je bilo tam res kaj za jesti.
Everything was there.	Vse je bilo tam.
that's how I feel.	tako se počutim.
You know that too.	Tudi ti to veš.
I didn't need it.	Ni mi bilo treba.
We are not there yet.	Mi še nismo tam.
i really need you.	res te potrebujem.
I saw.	sem videl.
And there is nothing to eat.	In ni ničesar za jesti.
He knew what would happen.	Vedel je, kaj bi se zgodilo.
There were so many of us.	Toliko nas je bilo.
I was really happy about it.	Res sem bil vesel tega.
And it's all for me.	In vse je zame.
Do what you have to do.	Naredi, kar moraš.
And no one.	In nihče.
However, it is not.	Vendar pa ni.
If it wasn't, it will be.	Če ni bilo, pa bo.
i really need it.	res ga potrebujem.
He knew what to do.	Vedel je, kaj storiti.
He's lucky.	Ima srečo.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Vendar ni mogel nič storiti glede tega.
So long.	Tako dolgo.
Just to see if it's there.	Samo da vidim, če je tam.
I understand now.	Zdaj razumem.
There are a lot of them these days too.	Veliko jih je tudi te dni.
It will definitely get better.	Zagotovo bo bolje.
I don't know anyone else.	Za koga drugega ne vem.
Or it is.	Ali pa je.
He pretends not to be sure.	Dela se, da ni prepričan.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
And I would love nothing more.	In nič mi ne bi bilo bolj všeč.
To buy or not to buy is a question.	Kupiti ali ne kupiti, to je vprašanje.
It won't be good for me either.	Tudi meni to ne bo dobro.
It exists now.	Zdaj obstaja.
We knew right away.	Takoj smo vedeli.
We'll see what happens this week.	Bomo videli kaj bo ta teden.
More would be better.	Več bi bilo bolje.
There was something wrong here.	Tukaj je bilo nekaj narobe.
That's just why.	To je samo zato.
And maybe he was just surprised.	In morda je bil samo presenečen.
It was a good thing.	Bila je dobra stvar.
They are still here for you.	Še vedno so tukaj za vas.
You didn't come.	Nisi prišel.
They knew better.	Vedeli so bolje.
Maybe my father was right.	Mogoče je imel moj oče prav.
They both knew that.	To sta vedela oba.
He is not right about that yet.	Glede tega še nima prav.
I felt surprised.	Zdelo se mi je, da sem presenečen.
I was there this morning.	Danes zjutraj sem bil tam.
I was in place.	Bil sem na mestu.
I found it difficult enough.	Zdelo se mi je dovolj težko.
It can't just be me.	Ne morem biti samo jaz.
You will go without me.	Šel boš brez mene.
Lots and lots of money.	Veliko in veliko denarja.
I would get a good day's work.	Dobil bi dober dan za delo.
None of us are.	Nihče od nas ni.
Maybe so much better.	Morda toliko bolje.
It's much better.	Je veliko bolje.
Just do it.	Samo naredi to.
More than a man needs, for sure.	Več, kot človek potrebuje, zagotovo.
It wouldn't be anymore.	Ne bi bilo več.
Hard life.	Težko življenje.
I'm not now.	zdaj nisem.
He is right once.	Enkrat ima prav.
It was all mine.	Vse je bilo moje.
I'm afraid not.	Bojim se, da ne.
That's a good question.	To je dobro vprašanje.
That's not right then.	Takrat ni prav.
Dad still works so it's fine.	Oče še vedno dela, tako da je v redu.
he asked me.	me je vprašal.
Not anymore.	Ni več.
Yours too.	Tvoj tudi.
A long time from now.	Še dolgo od zdaj.
He doesn't want us to be alone.	Noče, da smo sami.
That's all.	Vse to je.
As if it were more than that.	Kot da bi bila več kot to.
He admitted.	Priznal je.
All right, baby, all right.	V redu, otrok, v redu.
She didn't know where to go.	Ni vedela, kam naj gre.
I can't stay.	ne morem ostati.
That.	To.
She won't do that to him.	Tega mu ne bo storila.
They just seem to be.	Samo zdi se, da so.
And she was good.	In bila je dobra.
He couldn't know.	Ni mogel vedeti.
No more people.	Nič več ljudi.
Good for everyone.	Dobro za vse.
That may not be good.	To morda ne bo dobro.
It was never much.	Nikoli ni bilo veliko.
He said what he had to say, and that was it.	Povedal je, kar je imel povedati, in to je bilo to.
Now that doesn't exist.	Zdaj to ne obstaja.
Or more than that.	Ali več kot to.
There is certainly nothing to know.	Ničesar zagotovo ni mogoče vedeti.
Man must be alone.	Človek mora biti sam.
I'm very sorry, "she said.	Zelo mi je žal,« je rekla.
You have to help me.	Moraš mi pomagati.
Someone was.	Nekdo je bil.
So much more.	Toliko več.
And so you can.	In tako lahko.
I was very happy to be able to help her.	Zelo sem bil vesel, da sem ji lahko pomagal.
He still didn't think so.	Tega še vedno ni mislil.
We will not.	Ne bomo.
He is not.	On ni.
I don't know what this is about.	Ne vem, za kaj gre.
It's just better.	Samo bolje je.
They didn't seem to be.	Zdelo se je, da niso.
Nothing needs to be done about it now.	Glede tega zdaj ni treba storiti ničesar.
It's very good.	Zelo je dobro.
In his own way.	Po svoje.
I did it myself.	Sam sem to naredil.
I'm sure he'll be fine.	Prepričan sem, da bo v redu.
You should work on that.	Moral bi delati na tem.
It was too much for us.	Za nas je bilo preveč.
Which is what happened.	Kar se je tudi zgodilo.
He likes it.	Všeč mu je.
I want to make sure you're okay.	Želim se prepričati, da si v redu.
You told me you weren't.	Rekel si mi, da nisi.
Feel like home.	Počuti se kot doma.
I think he's here.	Mislim, da je tukaj.
I sat back.	Sedel sem nazaj.
We're back right away.	Takoj smo nazaj.
I'm not asking.	ne sprašujem.
And yet it is here.	In vendar je tukaj.
He looked tired.	Videti je bil utrujen.
He can't stay.	Ne more ostati.
They didn’t have much of everything.	Niso imeli veliko vsega.
It worked well.	To je delal dobro.
I knew that day would come.	Vedel sem, da bo prišel ta dan.
All that there was no need to talk.	Vse, da ne bi bilo treba govoriti.
There are a lot of them now.	Zdaj jih je veliko.
Only not today.	Samo danes ne.
She was home.	Bila je doma.
Tell me that again.	Povej mi to še enkrat.
Yes, very nice.	Da, zelo lepo.
It seems too much to me.	Meni se zdi preveč.
Nothing comes out.	Nič ne pride ven.
No one will know.	Nihče ne bo vedel.
I wanted to know everything.	Hotel sem vedeti vse.
It has never been like that before.	Še nikoli ni bilo tako.
I don't know where to go from here.	Ne vem, kam naj grem od tukaj.
Nothing more than that.	Nič več kot to.
I had a job.	Imel sem delo.
He forgot about it.	Pozabil je na to.
That was not the case.	To ni bilo tako.
How will you get there?	Kako boš prišel?
That's how he stayed.	Tako je ostal.
It was never enough.	Nikoli ni bilo dovolj.
That never happened.	To se nikoli ni zgodilo.
I'm as good as you.	jaz sem tako dober kot ti.
Not from me.	Ne od mene.
I've actually heard that before.	To sem pravzaprav že slišal.
You will see many of them.	Veliko jih boste videli.
Keep it up.	S tem naprej.
He didn't know why either.	Tudi on ni vedel, zakaj je tako.
You don't know anything.	Ne veš nič.
She should have known that all along.	To bi morala vedeti ves čas.
I thought he was a good man.	Mislil sem, da je dober človek.
This is clearly wrong.	To je očitno narobe.
They were there now.	Zdaj so bili tam.
And it didn't.	In ni.
Mine was better.	Moj je bil boljši.
And you can't.	In ne moreš.
I haven't seen her in years.	Že leta je nisem videl.
You will know.	Vedeli boste.
That's right, z.	Tako je, z.
It's not him.	To ni on.
Good.	Bom.
She didn't have to do anything else.	Nič drugega ni morala storiti.
He is with me.	On je z mano.
The work is hard.	Delo je težko.
He knows better now.	Zdaj ve bolje.
We have to do something.	Nekaj ​​moramo narediti.
This is backwards.	To je za nazaj.
I haven't seen that yet.	Tega še nisem videl.
They were not in front of him, they were above him.	Niso bili pred njim, bili so nad njim.
I asked him what he was doing.	Vprašal sem ga, kaj počne.
I've never seen him before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl.
Get out with him.	Ven z njim.
Which still exists today.	Ki obstaja še danes.
You wanted, you got.	Želel si, dobil si.
There was nothing wrong.	Ni bilo narobe.
He knew nothing about it.	O tem ni vedel nič.
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
He will do everything possible.	Naredil bo vse, kar je mogoče.
Maybe someone will see.	Morda bo kdo videl.
Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened to us.	Žal se je pri nas zgodilo prav to.
I know it was good.	Vem, da je bilo dobro.
But he can't do anything.	Vendar ne more storiti ničesar.
He called you last night.	Sinoči te je poklical.
It is hard.	Težko je.
Problems for sure.	Težave zagotovo.
All this time.	Ves ta čas.
Even if you think it is, it probably isn’t.	Tudi če mislite, da je, verjetno ni.
Maybe I'll be lucky.	Mogoče bom imel srečo.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
I never met him.	Nikoli ga nisem srečal.
I can do anything for you.	Vse ti lahko storim.
She lives alone.	Živi sama.
I wanted them home.	Želela sem jih domov.
That probably won't be true	To verjetno ne bo res
What did you like to do?	Kaj si rad počel.
It was simple.	Bilo je preprosto to.
When he's gone, he's gone!	Ko ga ni več, ga ni več!
That's what I taught you.	To sem te naučil.
I’ve never seen anyone with this.	Nikoli nisem videl nikogar s tem.
Just really tired.	Samo res utrujen.
He doesn't talk.	On ne govori.
There was something wrong with me.	Z mano je bilo nekaj narobe.
But he knew there was nothing more he could do.	Vendar je vedel, da ne more storiti ničesar več.
That's the way it has to be.	Tako mora biti.
You wouldn't want that.	Tega si ne bi želel.
Time was like nothing.	Čas je bil kot nič.
And how much is.	In koliko je.
But I doubt a child like you is a lot.	Dvomim pa, da je otrok, kot si ti, veliko.
And that didn't happen very often.	In to se ni zgodilo prav pogosto.
There were far too many people now.	Zdaj je bilo ljudi veliko preveč.
I thought maybe he was doing it for fun.	Mislil sem, da morda to počne za zabavo.
I am my own problem.	Sam sem svoj problem.
If he's here, fine.	Če je tukaj, v redu.
I want it too.	jaz bi tudi.
you are my father	ti si moj oče.
A few things happened this week.	Ta teden se je zgodilo nekaj stvari.
We don't have that.	Tega pri nas ni.
However, this was not the case.	Vendar ni bilo tako.
And it was very fast.	In bilo je prav hitro.
I think you will like it very much.	Mislim, da ti bo zelo všeč.
He sat down again.	Spet je sedel.
It seemed like it was time for me to do it.	Zdelo se je, da je čas, da to storim.
No one knows who did it and why.	Nihče ne ve, kdo je to storil in zakaj.
He was angry.	Bil je jezen.
We really like something.	Nekaj ​​nam je zelo všeč.
Much needs to be done.	Veliko je treba narediti.
Therefore.	Zato.
If so, we had it.	Če je tako, smo ga imeli.
Maybe it's something.	Mogoče je nekaj.
Is it even possible to go back?.	Je sploh mogoče iti nazaj?.
I wouldn't find her here.	Tukaj je ne bi našel.
I probably should go now.	Verjetno bi moral iti zdaj.
There is.	Ima.
Me, me, me.	Jaz, jaz, jaz.
There could be more.	Lahko bi bilo več.
And something else.	In še nekaj.
If not.	Če le ne.
I did things.	Naredil sem stvari.
He had many.	Imel jih je veliko.
I'd like that, he said.	To bi rad, je rekel.
You thought wrong.	Narobe si mislil.
And they were.	In bili so.
He did what needed to be done.	Naredil je, kar je bilo treba.
He did not tell anyone what he saw.	Nikomur ni povedal, kaj je videl.
He was alone again.	Spet je bil sam.
I never can.	Nikoli ne morem.
He said little.	Malo je rekel.
I don't understand at all.	Sploh ne razumem.
What is it for you?	Kaj je za vas?
I wanted him to be scared.	Želela sem, da se boji.
They had to help.	Morali so pomagati.
It's not like a game.	To ni kot igra.
I am sure.	Prepričan sem.
And he may not be the only one.	In morda ni edini.
There's something wrong with that, you know.	Nekaj ​​je narobe s tem, veš.
So long.	Tako dolgo.
He had a job.	Imel je delo.
And it’s probably a good thing not to.	In verjetno je dobro, da ne.
There was nothing anyone could do then.	Takrat nihče ni mogel narediti ničesar.
It's so beautiful.	Tako lepo je.
You know he'll do it himself.	Veš, da bo to naredil sam.
This is not going to happen here.	Tukaj se to ne bo zgodilo.
I think that was the problem.	Mislim, da je bil to problem.
He needed some work.	Potreboval je nekaj dela.
way.	način.
So simple.	Tako preprosto.
I should never have come here.	Nikoli ne bi smel priti sem.
I wouldn’t be very good at it.	Ne bi bil zelo dober v tem.
We will be better.	Nam bo bolje.
And nobody did.	In nihče ni.
Maybe it will happen that way.	Mogoče se bo zgodilo tako.
My friend did it.	Moj prijatelj je to storil.
I'm fine now.	zdaj sem v redu.
Now I knew how to get there.	Zdaj sem vedel, kako priti tja.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.	Žal temu ni tako.
A lot of time.	Veliko časa.
I don't have to see anymore.	Ni mi treba več videti.
They were very helpful in getting me back.	Bili so mi v veliko pomoč pri tem, da sem se vrnil.
It's not that common.	To ni tako pogosto.
That's all it will be.	Samo to bo.
I never saw the children again.	Nikoli več nisem videl otrok.
Father who father.	Oče, ki oče.
And so tell me.	In tako mi povej.
He didn't say much.	Ni veliko povedal.
I could not.	Nisem mogel.
They already had my money.	Moj denar so že imeli.
He went straight to work.	Šel je kar na delo.
I would love to see him like that every week.	Rad bi ga videl tako vsak teden.
I'm surprised he didn't follow you.	Presenečen sem, da ni šel za tabo.
I'm just wondering what it is.	Me prav zanima kaj je.
That seemed likely.	To je bilo videti verjetno.
That really didn't happen here.	Pri nas se to res ni zgodilo.
Or if someone is there.	Ali če je tam nekdo.
Does not exist	Ne obstaja
I called them.	poklical sem jih.
Sometimes you have to be penniless, man.	Včasih moraš biti brez denarja, človek.
Nothing like this has ever happened to us.	Pri nas se še nikoli ni zgodilo kaj takega.
It's not just about school.	Ne gre samo za šolo.
And then.	In po tem.
Not much is going on there.	Tam se ne dogaja veliko.
Either way, I'm fine.	Tako ali tako mi je v redu.
It’s hard to know what’s right.	Težko je vedeti, kaj je prav.
He saw them today.	Danes jih je videl.
But maybe that wasn't true.	Morda pa to ni bilo res.
We didn't see him at all.	Sploh ga nismo videli.
I didn't say anything more.	Nič več nisem rekel.
No one will ever find them.	Nihče jih ne bo nikoli našel.
How long it seems.	Kako dolgo se zdi.
No one to talk to.	Nikomur, da bi govoril.
You'll feel better.	Počutil se boš bolje.
That's right.	Tako je.
It's okay to be tired.	V redu je biti utrujen.
We don't know more than that.	Več kot to ne vemo.
I don't know when you'll be here.	Ne vem, kdaj boš tukaj.
I hope it helps you.	Upam, da ti pomaga.
I don’t know if that will be a problem.	Ne vem, če bo to problem.
But he was not the only one.	A ni bil edini.
But we know it isn't.	Vendar vemo, da ni.
But I didn’t have to do that.	Vendar mi tega ni bilo treba storiti.
That will be a lot of work.	To bo veliko dela.
I knew quite a bit.	Precej sem vedel.
Now all that seemed to be gone.	Zdaj se je zdelo, da vsega tega ni več.
.	.
It was true.	Bilo je res.
You couldn't believe it.	Nisi mogel verjeti.
That didn't happen here.	To se ni zgodilo tukaj.
He felt tired.	Počutil se je utrujen.
He soon thought they should.	Kmalu je mislil, da bi morali.
He begged again.	Še enkrat je prosil.
You really liked it.	Res ti je bilo všeč.
I wanted to leave.	Hotel sem oditi.
That seemed to work.	Zdelo se je, da je to uspelo.
But I have a question.	Imam pa vprašanje.
No, that wasn't true either.	Ne, tudi to ni bilo res.
That was too much for you.	To je bilo preveč zate.
I understand.	razumem.
Home again, home again.	Spet doma, spet doma.
It seemed to him.	Zdelo se mu je.
I don't know.	sam ne poznam.
They should come get me.	Morali bi priti po mene.
I wanted more than that.	Želel sem več kot to.
He talked about it.	Govoril je o tem.
That was a lot for me.	To je bilo zame veliko.
I was surprised too.	Tudi jaz sem bil presenečen.
But here it is.	Tukaj pa je.
That's fine with me.	Meni je to prav.
Something was definitely not right.	Nekaj ​​zagotovo ni bilo v redu.
Who is that man?	Kdo je tisti človek?
He said it would not happen.	Rekel je, da se to ne bo zgodilo.
I would be ready for that.	Bi bil pripravljen na to.
Now he knows.	Zdaj ve.
He didn't tell her anything.	Nekaj ​​ji ni povedal.
But we have little time.	Imamo pa malo časa.
And you may know why.	In morda veste zakaj.
A few kids are playing.	Nekaj ​​otrok se igra.
We both knew what he was going to do with it.	Oba sva vedela, kaj bo naredil s tem.
She doesn't want him now, not like that.	Zdaj ga ne želi, ne tako.
You know, you.	Veš, da ti.
Just a minute.	Samo malo.
I know this may not be what you wanted.	Vem, da to ne more biti tisto, kar si želel.
I mean, there were a lot of them.	Mislim, veliko jih je bilo.
it's hard for me.	težko mi je.
It takes some time.	Potrebuje nekaj časa.
He's not the man he used to be.	Ni človek, kot je bil.
It also didn’t look good.	Prav tako ni bilo videti dobro.
I'll get it.	Dobil ga bom.
I don't know who they were.	Ne vem, kdo so bili.
Maybe it's as he says.	Mogoče je tako, kot pravi.
Do's and don'ts.	Stvari, ki jih je treba narediti in ne.
Many things still need to be done.	Veliko stvari je treba še narediti.
Maybe he would too.	Mogoče bi tudi on.
He succeeded here.	Tukaj mu je uspelo.
My child is happy.	Moj otrok je vesel.
I think you know.	Mislim, da veš.
I can’t believe he’s doing this.	Ne morem verjeti, da to počne.
He was waiting to be asked why.	Čakal je na vprašanje, zakaj.
I thought that was it.	Mislil sem, da gre za to.
I don't know much about that.	To malo poznam.
I had to stay.	Moral sem ostati.
No one really knows for sure.	Nihče res ne ve zagotovo.
It has nothing to do with it.	Nima nič s tem.
I think I can.	Mislim, da lahko.
That's not the case at all.	To sploh ni tako.
I think it's true.	Mislim, da je res.
If anyone could, it would be him.	Če bi kdo lahko, bi bil to on.
No one knew what happened.	Nihče ni vedel, kaj se je zgodilo.
I don't like him here.	Ne maram ga tukaj.
I always love him very much.	Vedno ga imam zelo rad.
This is very common.	To je zelo pogosto.
They never saw me.	Nikoli me niso videli.
Back to me.	Nazaj na meni.
I asked her.	Prosil sem jo.
And so on and so forth and so on.	In tako naprej in tako naprej in tako naprej.
Someone knows everything about us.	Nekdo ve vse o nas.
.	.
Because he does.	Ker to počne.
I think it was for me.	Mislim, da je bilo zame.
You both just know.	Oba samo veš.
She used to do that.	Včasih je to storila.
I just want to be home again.	Samo želim biti spet doma.
However, this is not right.	Vendar to ni prav.
He doesn't have time for that.	Za to nima časa.
He didn't even know how he got here.	Sploh ni vedel, kako je prišel sem.
It's not about that.	Ne gre za to.
I really mean it.	res to mislim.
He didn't say why.	Ni povedal zakaj.
Normally this would not be possible.	Običajno to ne bi bilo mogoče.
I realized how you were trying to help.	Spoznal sem, kako si poskušal pomagati.
I'm going home today.	danes grem domov.
I have not forgotten.	nisem pozabil.
Please do it for me.	Prosim, naredi to zame.
It seemed right.	Zdelo se je prav.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Vendar se zdi, da temu ni tako.
That's the way it has to be.	Tako mora biti.
I like this guy.	Všeč mi je ta fant.
This will never work.	To nikoli ne bo uspelo.
There were so many things that could have been done better.	Bilo je toliko stvari, ki bi jih bilo mogoče narediti bolje.
I know right away what he's talking about.	Takoj vem, kaj govori.
We really saw him.	Res smo ga videli.
That's all I want to say.	Samo to želim povedati.
We had nothing left to eat.	Za jesti nismo imeli več ničesar.
That's what it is.	To je, kar je.
No help.	Ni pomoči.
I'm so tired.	Tako sem utrujen.
I'm better now.	zdaj sem bolje.
That's what she said.	To je rekla.
He didn't even have to say much that way.	Na ta način mu niti ni bilo treba veliko povedati.
neither can I.	jaz tudi ne morem.
All right with me.	V redu z mano.
Learn more about why.	Več o tem zakaj.
He was really here.	Res je bil tukaj.
I like it that way.	Všeč mi je tako.
You have to be what you are.	Moraš biti to, kar si.
I didn't talk to him.	Nisem govoril z njim.
What he meant.	Kaj je mislil.
I don't really like it.	Ni mi zelo všeč.
It's actually here.	Pravzaprav je tukaj.
We shouldn't either.	Tudi mi ne bi smeli.
No one could have done it better.	Nihče tega ne bi mogel narediti bolje.
No one was willing to talk.	Nihče ni bil pripravljen govoriti.
There wasn't much time.	Ni bilo veliko časa.
It's not good to talk.	Ni dobro govoriti.
No one has ever decided for sure.	Nihče se ni nikoli zagotovo odločil.
Are you ready?	Si pripravljen?
I met him there.	Tam sem ga srečal.
Both are very good.	Oba sta zelo dobra.
Everyone is there.	Vsak je tam.
I don't think they will.	Mislim, da ne bodo.
Then you'll know.	Takrat boš vedel.
I've only been here a few days.	Tukaj sem bil le nekaj dni.
I could have it all.	Lahko bi imel vse.
This was not the case at all when mine arrived.	Temu sploh ni bilo tako, ko je prišel moj.
It is done this way.	To se naredi na ta način.
You can't and you won't win.	Ne moreš in ne boš zmagal.
I can never stay.	Nikoli ne morem ostati.
Not that you'll ever see him.	Saj ne, da ga boš kdaj videl.
In fact, I never would.	Pravzaprav nikoli ne bi.
But he didn't have one.	Vendar ga ni imel.
He was never friends with me.	Nikoli ni bil prijatelj z mano.
If you will, you will.	Če boš, boš.
Obviously, he would have much more than that.	Očitno bi imel veliko več kot to.
I know you want to come with me.	Vem, da želiš z mano.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
So something is going on.	Zato se nekaj dogaja.
Everything is getting better.	Vse gre na bolje.
He was right about everything.	Glede vsega je imel prav.
He became a man.	Postal je človek.
But not this one.	Vendar ne ta.
How it should be.	Kako mora biti.
This is your problem and not mine.	To je tvoj problem in ne moj.
It wasn't that one.	Ni bil ta.
It's just a game.	To je samo igra.
And maybe that's a good thing.	In to morda dobro.
I never wanted anything more than that.	Nikoli si nisem želel nič več kot to.
But it didn't.	Vendar se ni.
And he's not the only one.	In ni edini.
I asked him how much money he wanted.	Vprašal sem ga, koliko denarja želi.
That's what you have to eat.	To pa moraš jesti.
Maybe nothing like that happened.	Morda se ni zgodilo nič takega.
It's still good.	Še vedno je dobro.
We may never know.	Morda nikoli ne bomo vedeli.
My father was waiting.	Moj oče je čakal.
I'm sorry this is happening to you.	Žal mi je, da se ti to dogaja.
If so, so be it.	Če je tako, naj bo.
Until then, there is still work to be done.	Do takrat je še dela.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
That was my chance.	To je bila moja priložnost.
I probably will.	verjetno bom.
I found it again.	Spet sem našel.
A a.	A a.
I thought of my children.	Mislil sem na svoje otroke.
He is ready to do it.	Pripravljen je to narediti.
We just knew something was wrong.	Vedeli smo le, da nekaj ni v redu.
As it happened.	Kot se je zgodilo.
He was such a real guy.	Bil je tako pravi fant.
But he has no regrets.	Vendar mu ni žal.
I want to work with you.	Želim delati s tabo.
I understand what happened there.	Razumem, kaj se je tam zgodilo.
That's good, "he says.	To je dobro,« pravi.
Let it be.	Naj bo.
He didn't know what else he could do.	Ni vedel, kaj bi še lahko naredil.
I need you now.	zdaj te potrebujem.
I know what you mean.	Vem kaj misliš.
You can't be my friend anymore.	Ne moreš biti več moj prijatelj.
There is something wrong there.	Tam je nekaj narobe.
That's not why.	Ni pa zato.
I want you to know something.	Želim, da nekaj veš.
I still never have.	Še vedno nisem nikoli.
It's not possible now.	Zdaj ni mogoče.
You did the right thing	Prav ste naredili
Simple, what?	Preprosto, kaj?
He was not surprised to see them.	Ni bil videti presenečen, ko jih je videl.
And there was something else.	In bilo je nekaj drugega.
I left everything.	Vse sem pustil.
I still want to.	še vedno želim.
It usually plays well here.	Tukaj se običajno dobro igra.
I thought you were the only one.	Mislil sem, da si edini.
If you can’t, that’s fine too.	Če ne moreš, je tudi to v redu.
There must be something ahead.	Naprej mora biti nekaj.
You know what you got.	Veš kaj imaš.
You never know!.	Nikoli ne veš!.
And there seem to be a lot of them.	In zdi se, da jih je veliko.
And they were right.	In imeli so prav.
I don’t even know how to do that.	Sploh ne vem, kako bi to naredil.
now.	zdaj.
Now he can talk.	Zdaj lahko govori.
I left.	odšel sem.
I didn't want to come here at all.	Sploh nisem hotel priti sem.
I can't be.	Ne morem biti.
But he did nothing.	Vendar ni naredil ničesar.
What about .	Kaj pa o .
But none of this is enough.	Vendar nič od tega ni dovolj.
He never wanted anything else.	Nikoli si ni želel ničesar drugega.
We have to.	Moramo .
I want to be a teacher.	Želim biti učitelj.
I am absolutely ready to talk about everything.	Popolnoma sem pripravljen govoriti o vsem.
It was something she could definitely do.	To je bilo nekaj, kar je zagotovo lahko storila.
You know what needs to be done.	Veš, kaj je treba narediti.
At the time, no one even knew who he was.	Takrat niti nihče ni vedel, kdo je.
But he wouldn't tell us.	Vendar nam ni hotel povedati.
Just a child.	Samo otrok.
Can anyone help me with this.	Ali mi lahko kdo pomaga pri tem.
I didn't know you were.	Nisem vedel, da si.
He says no.	Pravi, da ne.
But nothing happened.	Vendar se ni zgodilo nič.
It was simple.	Bilo je preprosto.
But it was more than that.	Vendar je bilo več kot to.
You said it wasn't enough for you anymore.	Rekel si, da ti to ni več dovolj.
And it's a little better there.	In tam je malo bolje.
you weren't.	nisi bil.
However, this was not the case at all.	Vendar temu sploh ni bilo tako.
I would never have her.	Nikoli je ne bi imel.
Very long.	Zelo dolgo.
He will tell you what he saw.	Povedal vam bo, kaj je videl.
You wouldn't tell me why.	Ne bi mi povedal zakaj.
That's a lot of money.	To je veliko denarja.
And that's hard.	In to je težko.
You know or.	Veste ali.
It was not.	Ni bilo.
I still have them.	Še vedno jih imam.
The boy saw nothing.	Fant ni videl ničesar.
Nothing is that hard.	Nič ni tako težko.
But something was wrong.	Vendar je bilo nekaj narobe.
That's quite a bit.	To je kar malo.
That is the question here.	To je vprašanje tukaj.
I will do it.	Naredil bom to.
And we were right.	In imeli smo prav.
I don’t know how he managed that.	Ne vem, kako mu je to uspelo.
I was just thinking.	Samo mislil sem.
It's so good.	Tako je dobro.
It's very nice.	Zelo lepo je.
There was no one else there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar drugega.
I’m not sure it will ever be.	Nisem prepričan, da bo kdaj.
We can't know.	Ne moremo vedeti.
You're here a lot.	Veliko si tukaj.
You will see them here.	Tukaj jih boste videli.
But something was wrong.	Vendar je bilo nekaj narobe.
I've never seen her before.	Še nikoli je nisem videl.
When we're home, no.	Ko smo doma, ne.
I didn't mean.	nisem mislil.
You can do it yourself.	Lahko tudi sami.
You can’t, you just won’t.	Ne moreš, preprosto ne boš.
Maybe I'm alone on this one.	Morda sem sam pri tem.
How can you even know that?	Kako lahko to sploh veš?
This is not a matter of children.	To ni stvar otrok.
No, into that.	Ne, v to.
There's a lot of them.	Veliko jih je.
Which was fine.	Kar je bilo v redu.
He didn't know how or when.	Ni vedel kako in kdaj.
This is true.	To je res.
It was very hard work.	Bilo je zelo težko delo.
I don’t think anyone even knew he was there.	Mislim, da nihče sploh ni vedel, da je tam.
He learned a lot.	Naučil se je veliko.
This is someone you love.	To je nekdo, ki ga imaš rad.
No one can do it for you.	Nihče ne more tega narediti namesto vas.
That would be it.	To bi bilo.
And here you are.	In tukaj ste.
Learn more here.	Več o tem tukaj.
I don't want to talk to you.	Nočem govoriti s tabo.
No, not really.	Ne, res ne.
''.	''.
I'm not too much for that.	Nisem preveč za to.
If anyone can help please.	Če lahko kdo pomaga prosim.
That happened to him.	To se mu je zgodilo.
No one died.	Nihče ni umrl.
But it was not.	Vendar ni bilo.
Very nice.	Zelo lepo.
Which it was.	Kar je bilo.
Not anymore.	Ne več.
They could be me.	Lahko bi bili mi.
No, it doesn’t feel right at home.	Ne, to se ne počuti kot doma.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
This is not a game.	To ni igra.
Not like you.	Ne kot ti.
He didn't need to be told that.	Tega mu ni bilo treba povedati.
Is that your car over there?	Je to tvoj avto tam?
It was quite difficult for us.	Bilo nam je kar težko.
It was actually very nice.	Pravzaprav je bilo zelo lepo.
He is a good man.	On je dober človek.
If it goes on, it needs to get better.	Če gre naprej, mora biti boljši.
No, it's true.	Ne, res je.
It could be something else.	Lahko bi bilo kaj drugega.
I have to go now, he said.	Zdaj moram iti, je rekel.
I have to do it.	moram to narediti.
Mine came to me like that.	Moj je prišel k meni tako.
We had a good time.	Imeli smo se dobro.
And so he was left with nothing.	In tako je ostal brez ničesar.
I wasn't good enough.	Nisem bil dovolj dober.
We did it today.	Danes smo to storili.
I don't think it should be.	Mislim, da ne bi smel biti.
I'd like to ask him a few things.	Rad bi ga vprašal nekaj stvari.
You're probably right.	Verjetno imaš prav.
He will love it.	Všeč mu bo.
I felt really good.	Res sem se dobro počutil.
He doesn't want me.	Noče me.
I really hope so.	res upam.
I don’t know if that’s the reason.	Ne vem, če je to razlog za to.
I am your teacher.	jaz sem tvoj učitelj.
But they didn't do that.	Vendar tega niso storili.
There seemed to be nothing.	Zdelo se je, da ni nič.
Or because there aren’t many of them.	Ali pa zato, ker jih ni veliko.
That sounds really good to you.	To se vam zdi res dobro.
It really was.	Res je bilo.
I just got back from him.	Pravkar sem se vrnil od njega.
She likes everything she does.	Všeč ji želi vse, kar počne.
It will never get better than this.	Nikoli ne bo bolje od tega.
He didn't like that at all.	To mu sploh ni bilo všeč.
If he wanted out.	Če bi hotel ven.
It was simple, really.	Bilo je preprosto, res.
However, it was not that simple.	Vendar ni bilo tako preprosto.
I'm doing very well.	Zelo dobro mi gre.
I like what you have to say.	Všeč mi je, kar imaš za povedati.
I didn't know you'd be here.	Nisem vedel, da boš tukaj.
That's not the case.	Tako ni tako.
Both would.	Oba bi.
It was difficult.	Bilo je težko.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
Better than nothing.	Bolje kot nič.
Learn more in a bit.	Več o tem v malo.
That's my business now.	To je zdaj moja stvar.
You have seen this happen before.	Videli ste, da se je to zgodilo že prej.
She needs him.	Potrebuje ga.
I do not understand why.	Ne razumem zakaj.
Just because you can, you are.	Samo zato, ker si lahko, si.
You can not.	Ne moreš.
And it's not good.	In ni dobro.
You will not die.	Ne boš umrl.
That was not the case.	To ni bilo.
He never called.	Nikoli ni poklical.
It definitely worked out for me.	Zame je zagotovo uspelo.
It seemed right.	Zdelo se je prav.
This won't be pretty.	To ne bo lepo.
He has to talk.	Mora govoriti.
They had enough money then.	Takrat so imeli dovolj denarja.
I am very sorry how hard it was.	Zelo mi je žal, kako težko je bilo.
He didn't do the job very well.	Dela ni opravil zelo dobro.
I was ready to go.	Bil sem pripravljen iti.
He certainly knew better than that.	Zagotovo je vedel bolje od tega.
And much more.	In še veliko več.
That's what it's about.	Prav za to gre.
No one knows what and how much.	Nihče ne ve, kaj in koliko.
Only time will tell !.	Samo čas bo povedal!.
I was lucky today.	Danes sem imel srečo.
Because you will have.	Ker boste imeli.
I would see her for the first time.	Prvič bi jo videl.
We don't.	Mi ne.
It's not true.	Ni res.
You'd never know.	Nikoli ne bi vedel.
I did something right.	Nekaj ​​sem naredil prav.
It's good to know, to be with this way.	Dobro je vedeti, biti z na ta način.
And he's right about that.	In glede tega ima prav.
He was there for a while.	Tam je bil nekaj časa.
You have a life.	Imaš življenje.
I will never ask you again.	Nikoli več te ne bom vprašal.
I said he wouldn't lose it.	Rekel sem, da ga ne bo izgubil.
He couldn't see anything wrong.	Nič ni mogel videti narobe.
He didn't know what to think.	Ni vedel, kaj naj si misli.
I never was.	nikoli nisem bil.
I lost once.	Enkrat sem izgubil.
We have to work now.	Zdaj moramo delati.
Maybe that's true.	Mogoče je to res.
We could be here forever.	Lahko bi bili tukaj za vedno.
it's really nice.	res je lepo.
Good at what he does.	Dober v tem, kar počne.
He always works too much.	Vedno dela preveč.
Dad will try to get here.	Oče bo poskušal priti sem.
But that didn't happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
If he wanted to do it, so be it.	Če je hotel to storiti, naj bo tako.
I just thought you should know.	Samo mislil sem, da bi moral vedeti.
therefore	zato
Because we are not there.	Ker nas ni.
She knew he knew.	Vedela je, da on ve.
v.	v.
We have to leave now.	Zdaj moramo oditi.
You don't even know how I feel.	Sploh ne veš, kako mi je.
He won't let go.	Ne bo pustil.
He is at home all the time.	Ves čas je doma.
I could play everything.	Lahko bi igral vse.
I could see.	Lahko bi videl.
But he is not.	Vendar ga ni.
Maybe he.	Mogoče on.
I'd put money on that.	Na to bi dal denar.
No one ever is.	Nihče ni nikoli.
Your father would want that.	Tvoj oče bi to želel.
There seemed to be nowhere to go.	Zdelo se je, da ni kam iti.
He thought he had succeeded.	Mislil je, da mu je uspelo.
We've seen him try to do that.	Videli smo, da je to poskušal narediti.
You said something this morning.	Danes zjutraj si nekaj rekel.
No one would need to know.	Nikomur ne bi bilo treba vedeti.
You should go there.	Moral bi iti tja.
He has everything there.	Tam ima vse.
Even better, no one knew who he was.	Še bolje je bilo, da nihče ni vedel, kdo je.
He was here instead.	Namesto tega je bil tukaj.
Not enough time.	Ni dovolj časa.
We're all here now.	Zdaj smo vsi tukaj.
I wonder if this is a good thing.	Sprašujem se, če je to dobro.
Nice of you to tell me.	Lepo, da si mi povedal.
You really gotta go, man.	Res moraš iti, človek.
You were a boy.	Bil si fant.
I still don't understand why.	Še vedno ne razumem zakaj.
It wasn't long.	Ni bilo dolgo.
That's what he told us.	To nam je povedal.
Don't be interested in anything else.	Naj vas nič drugega ne zanima.
He tried.	Poskušal je.
It must be good.	Mora biti dobro.
I can't, my friend.	Ne morem, prijatelj.
Does not exist.	Ne obstaja.
You don't like that.	To ti ni všeč.
That might be me.	To sem morda jaz.
She didn't say.	Ni rekla.
Here is the reason.	Tukaj je razlog.
I can't stay.	Ne morem ostati.
None of this is enough.	Nič od tega ni dovolj.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
But they had a good day.	Vendar so imeli dober dan.
I have to say that.	to moram povedati.
I'll be back here again.	Spet se bom vrnil sem.
You can't do everything by yourself.	Vsega ne moreš narediti sam.
From him who is not.	Od njega, ki ni.
Not that I wanted to be.	Ne da bi hotel biti.
He was very good.	Bil je zelo dober.
We are doing better now.	Zdaj nam gre bolje.
This is what she wanted.	To je tisto, kar je želela.
He bought it.	Kupil ga je.
It's that simple for me.	Zame je tako preprosto.
It's good for you.	Je dobra zate.
I'm in.	Jaz sem v.
And he knew they were.	In vedel je, da so.
It really is what you think it is.	Res je to, kar misliš, da je.
And indeed it was.	In res je bilo tako.
There were too many of them.	Preveč jih je bilo.
We haven't seen each other in a long time!	Dolgo časa se nismo videli!
And here I am now.	In tukaj sem zdaj.
I would come back.	Vrnil bi se.
That's when she said it.	Prav takrat je to rekla.
He thought not.	Mislil je, da ne.
So simple.	Tako preprosto.
This has happened before.	To se je zgodilo že prej.
I haven't decided whether to go out.	Nisem se odločil, ali bi šel ven.
You did everything.	Naredil si vse.
Is nice.	Je lepo.
I didn't know what to do with him.	Nisem vedel, kaj naj storim z njim.
I don't believe in that.	Ne verjamem v to.
You did it today.	Danes ti je uspelo.
I knew that was not the case.	Vedel sem, da ni tako.
Nothing like that, ever again.	Nič takega, nikoli več.
It was never hard.	Nikoli ni bilo težko.
There is someone who had to see something.	Obstaja nekdo, ki je moral nekaj videti.
He's been there before.	Tam je bil že prej.
They were there and they did it.	Bili so tam in to naredili.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I'm ready.	Pripravljen sem.
It's been a while.	Bilo je nekaj časa.
I'll tell you that.	To vam bom povedal.
In that room.	V tisti sobi.
It just doesn't help.	Samo ne pomaga.
That was your father.	To je bil tvoj oče.
It's not that there's anything wrong with that.	Ne gre za to, da je s tem kaj narobe.
I really didn't have it.	res nisem imel.
It was still good.	Še vedno je bilo dobro.
He had tried something else before, but it didn't work.	Prej je poskušal nekaj drugega, a ni uspelo.
Every person does it.	Vsak človek to počne.
Even more seems true.	Še več se zdi res.
This was the way to do it.	To je bil način za to.
I'm really not like that.	res nisem tako.
It was for me too, but nothing like what you went for.	Bilo je tudi zame, a nič takega, kar si šel ti.
I don't see many people.	Ne vidim veliko ljudi.
It was always a little, good.	Vedno je bilo malo, dobro.
Something should be done about this.	Nekaj ​​bi bilo treba narediti glede tega.
Waiting for something else.	Čakal še nekaj.
Once is not enough.	Enkrat ni dovolj.
You were actually better than good, you were good.	Pravzaprav si bil boljši kot dober, bil si dober.
I don't have to tell you what happened.	Ni mi treba povedati, kaj se je zgodilo.
maybe I am.	mogoče sem.
Just maybe, but not here.	Samo morda, vendar ne tukaj.
But he was here.	Vendar je bil tukaj.
It was really hard.	Bilo je res težko.
There is right and wrong.	Obstaja prav in narobe.
That's how it's done.	Tako se to naredi.
You'll have to tell her.	Moral ji boš povedati.
I really like it.	Res mi je všeč.
No, not just someone.	Ne, ne samo nekdo.
We didn't make it.	Ni nam uspelo.
It can be done.	To je mogoče storiti.
I never went back to it.	Nikoli se nisem vrnil k temu.
I will really never forget that.	Tega res nikoli ne bom pozabil.
It always is.	Vedno je.
no no	ne ne
She might not do that.	Tega morda ne bo storila.
It's not about that at all.	Sploh ne gre za to.
He knew he was right.	Vedel je, da ima prav.
He lives here.	Živi tukaj.

I would not buy this again.	Tega ne bi več kupil.
That's why he felt so good.	Zato se je počutil tako dobro.
I hope any of you can help me.	Upam, da mi lahko kdo od vas pomaga.
He said nothing more.	Ni rekel nič več.
I can see now.	Zdaj lahko vidim.
I quickly decided on something else.	Hitro sem se odločil za nekaj drugega.
I would say that.	to bi rekel.
I have that too.	To imam tudi jaz.
Sometimes he was there, sometimes not.	Včasih je bil tam, včasih pa ne.
Who died and who did it.	Kdo je umrl in kdo je to storil.
He knew he would never come back here.	Vedel je, da se ne bo nikoli vrnil sem.
We'll know.	Bomo vedeli.
I am very angry.	zelo sem jezen.
No, that wasn't right either.	Ne, tudi to ni bilo prav.
So it was today.	Tako je bilo danes.
Not too sure what that was.	Nisem preveč prepričan, kaj je bilo to.
I know people there.	Tam poznam ljudi.
There is nowhere to go now.	Zdaj ni kam iti.
It could be tomorrow.	Lahko bi bilo jutri.
Nobody ever gets out of there.	Nihče nikoli ne pride od tam.
She knew she was in trouble.	Vedela je, da ima težave.
Few people live there.	Tam živi malo ljudi.
What's going on here? 	Kaj se dogaja tukaj?
He was right.	Imel je prav.
It’s not just because it’s just a game.	To ni samo zato, ker je to le igra.
I can't do anything right.	Ne morem narediti nič prav.
I used to do it that way.	Včasih sem to delal tako.
I find it hard to understand.	Težko jo razumem.
He has too much work.	Preveč dela ima.
It still was.	Še vedno je bilo.
And I shouldn't leave.	In ne bi smel oditi.
In fact, I did it quite often.	Pravzaprav sem to počel precej pogosto.
If I could get to him.	Če bi lahko prišel do njega.
I hope it works out for you.	Upam, da ti bo uspelo.
I heard them talking.	Slišal sem jih govoriti.
And I couldn't believe it.	In nisem mogel verjeti.
I should never have left.	Nikoli ne bi smel oditi.
And many of them.	In veliko jih.
I would be very happy.	zelo bi bil vesel.
Why so much? 	Zakaj toliko?
You're not.	Nisi.
No one knows where he is.	Nihče ne ve, kje je.
I did it.	Uspelo mi je.
Do nothing.	Ne naredi nič.
Not here, not now.	Ne tukaj, ne zdaj.
In my opinion, it's just better.	Po moje je samo bolje.
It was as if it wasn’t.	Bilo je, kot da ne bi bilo.
I think so.	Mislim, da.
I don’t know why and how this happened.	Ne vem zakaj in kako se je to zgodilo.
We're doing well here.	Tukaj nam gre dobro.
I saw everything.	Videl sem vse.
It may go, it may not.	Lahko gre, lahko ne.
This morning, really.	Danes zjutraj, res.
She was never that.	Nikoli ni bila to.
Maybe you could.	Mogoče bi lahko.
No, don't tell me.	Ne, ne povej mi.
He met with.	Srečal se je z.
And that wasn't all.	In to še ni bilo vse.
He does nothing for nothing.	Nič ne naredi za nič.
But he saw none of that.	Vendar ni videl nič od tega.
I had quite a few.	Imel sem jih kar nekaj.
It almost worked.	Skoraj je uspelo.
It could be that.	Lahko bi bilo to.
And so it will be.	In tako bo.
And maybe it is.	In morda je.
She knew what had happened to her.	Vedela je, kaj se ji je zgodilo.
I've known him for years.	Poznam že leta.
He obviously doesn't want to help me.	Očitno mi ne želi pomagati.
None of this worked.	Nič od tega ni uspelo.
I have to go again.	Spet moram oditi.
I have encountered this before.	S tem sem se že srečal.
It was a good afternoon.	Bilo je dobro popoldne.
They will have to work.	Morali bodo delati.
Why not have it all?	Zakaj ne bi imeli vsega?
Probably too much.	Verjetno preveč.
He needed something more.	Potreboval je nekaj več.
That's what we're going to do.	Tako bomo naredili.
He won't talk to us.	Ne bo govoril z nami.
They are out of work now.	Zdaj so brez dela.
I'm so glad you could come.	Tako sem vesel, da si lahko prišel.
v.	v.
I'm fine now.	zdaj sem v redu.
I've never seen that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem videl.
He was angry and that.	Bil je jezen in to.
It's you, isn't it?	To si ti, kajne?
That was not true.	To ni bilo res.
She had to get out.	Morala je ven.
And not many people do that.	In tega ne počne veliko ljudi.
It's not me.	To nisem jaz.
Years and years of work.	Leta in leta dela.
I'm here, man.	Tukaj sem, človek.
It could not be done.	Ni bilo mogoče storiti.
Why are you so sure?	Zakaj si tako prepričan?
What it is now.	Kar je zdaj.
He seems to have forgotten.	Zdi se, da je pozabil.
I left feeling much better.	Odšel sem se počutil veliko bolje.
I had that.	Imel sem to.
I was out of town last week.	Prejšnji teden me ni bilo v mestu.
What is it.	Kaj je to.
Did you know what?	Ali ste vedeli kaj?
At the site of.	Na mestu.
Very simple again.	Spet zelo preprosto.
I didn't want to either.	Tudi jaz nisem hotel.
We know they are not.	Vemo, da niso.
He told me.	Povedal mi je.
She knew something was wrong.	Vedela je, da je nekaj narobe.
Just one more time.	Samo še enkrat.
But it can be.	Lahko pa je.
This is a big job.	To je veliko delo.
And this is mine.	In to je moje.
Or if they did, they didn’t know what to do with it.	Ali če so, niso vedeli, kaj bi s tem.
Just a car.	Samo avto.
He stayed there for a while.	Tam je ostal nekaj časa.
There was a lot of work.	Bilo je veliko dela.
There is so much I could say.	Toliko bi lahko povedal.
I got you.	Imam te.
No one spoke for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa ni nihče govoril.
And he did it very well.	In to je naredil zelo dobro.
You should know that.	To bi moral vedeti.
He is simple.	On preprosto je.
He was gone for several days.	Več dni ga ni bilo.
He did a lot.	Veliko je naredil.
He was just tired.	Bil je samo utrujen.
But it only happened once before.	A zgodilo se je le enkrat prej.
It was something like that.	To je bil nekaj takega.
I just wish I could leave.	Samo želim si, da bi odšel.
I just wanted to say.	Hotel sem samo povedati.
Three for three.	Tri za tri.
No, there was no time.	Ne, ni bilo časa.
You tried to help.	Poskušal si pomagati.
This is about me now.	To je zdaj o meni.
I think a lot.	Mislim, da veliko.
Would not.	Ne bi.
You just can't see them.	Samo videti jih ne moreš.
Was that even possible? 	Je bilo to sploh mogoče?
That will never happen.	To se ne bo nikoli zgodilo.
I couldn't do more.	Nisem mogel storiti več.
Let it not be.	Naj ne bo.
As if to do it.	Kot da bi to naredil.
Good is good.	Dobro je dobro.
That is true, very true.	To je res, zelo res.
Yes, he meant it.	Da, resno je mislil.
Was he your friend?	Je bil tvoj prijatelj?
I thought he was going to die.	Mislil sem, da bo umrl.
They did everything.	Vse so naredili.
Or so I would like to believe.	Ali pa bi hotel verjeti.
It just has to be a chance.	Mora biti samo priložnost.
Nobody found it.	Nihče ga ni našel.
He left.	Odšel je.
I really don't know why.	Res ne vem zakaj.
I think it was really good.	Mislim, da je bilo res dobro.
He's back now.	Zdaj se je vrnil.
I asked her why.	Vprašal sem jo zakaj.
I know there is more.	Vem, da je še več.
What would you do there.	Kaj bi počel tam.
I think it is.	Mislim, da je.
They had to stay.	Morali so ostati.
He had a good life here.	Tukaj je imel dobro življenje.
There 's nothing I can do for you.	Ne morem storiti ničesar zate.
It wasn’t really that good back then.	Takrat pravzaprav ni bilo tako dobro.
Unfortunately not.	Žal ni.
Maybe he died.	Morda je umrl.
I knew it would.	Vedel sem, da bo.
Maybe just a little.	Morda samo malo.
He said and did nothing.	Rekel je in naredil nič.
That will be enough.	To bo dovolj.
Now I have to buy more things.	Zdaj moram kupiti več stvari.
He needs help now.	Zdaj potrebuje pomoč.
I had children.	Imel sem otroke.
I tried and I failed.	Poskušal sem in mi ni uspelo.
That's really true.	To je res tako.
We shouldn't either.	Tudi mi ne bi smeli.
No one knew where he was going.	Nihče ni vedel, kam je šel.
That's not what you have.	To ni tisto, kar imaš.
I don't care what he said.	Ne zanima me, kaj je rekel.
They immediately went out.	Takoj sta šla ven.
It wasn't me.	Nisem bil jaz.
He was a boy.	Bil je fant.
Okay, okay.	V redu, v redu.
He might never see her again.	Mogoče je ne bo nikoli več videl.
And he knows it.	In to ve.
He saw me a week before everything he did.	Videl me je teden dni pred vsem, kar je naredil.
I was convinced it was something else.	Prepričan sem bil, da je nekaj drugega.
He can't come home.	Ne more priti domov.
He liked it very much.	Bilo mu je zelo všeč.
I thought you might like to see him.	Mislil sem, da bi ga morda rad videl.
Sometimes too much.	Včasih preveč.
I'm going back to school.	Grem nazaj v šolo.
That's when he lost me.	Takrat me je izgubil.
I've never seen anything like it.	Nikoli nisem videl nič takega.
That would be fine.	To bi bilo v redu.
It's been like this for a few days.	Nekaj ​​dni je tako.
He just wants to make sure.	Samo se želi prepričati.
No one looked surprised.	Nihče ni bil videti presenečen.
Quick question.	Hitro vprašanje.
There's a lot of that right now.	Tega je trenutno veliko.
It will be fine.	V redu bo.
I don't believe it myself.	Sam ne verjamem.
He didn't see how he could.	Ni videl, kako bi lahko.
There is something like that.	Obstaja nekaj takega.
So it was, just like she said.	Tako je bilo, tako kot je rekla.
And that's exactly what's happening.	In prav to se dogaja.
A little more, please?	Še malo, prosim?
Not much.	Ne veliko.
Or you don’t have to.	Ali pa vam ni treba.
This has been happening since I was a child.	To se že kot otrok dogaja.
Certainly	Zagotovo,
I knew that very well.	To sem dobro vedel.
I've never heard of anything like it.	Nikoli nisem slišal za kaj takega.
I don't know what it was.	Ne vem, kaj je bilo.
It won't be long now.	Zdaj ne bo dolgo.
В.	V.
He heard nothing.	Nič ni slišal.
It's too much.	Preveč je.
Or almost nothing.	Ali pa skoraj nič.
She would be better off.	Bi ji bilo bolje.
They will do anything for you.	Za vas bodo naredili vse.
Or a car.	Ali pa avto.
We would be fine.	Bili bi v redu.
Sometimes it helps by not helping.	Včasih pomaga tako, da ne pomaga.
This is my question for you.	To je moje vprašanje za vas.
I definitely needed to know you were right.	Zagotovo sem moral vedeti, da si ti pravi.
He wanted to know where it might be.	Želel je vedeti, kje bi lahko bilo.
You don't have to help.	Ni vam treba pomagati.
There was something wrong with that.	Nekaj ​​na tem ni bilo v redu.
v	v
It used to be.	Prej je bilo.
And almost no one knows who they are.	In skoraj nihče ne ve, kdo so.
He decided enough was enough.	Odločil se je, da je dovolj.
I hope I could help.	Upam, da sem lahko pomagal.
Nobody told me about it.	Nihče mi ni povedal o tem.
I don't think there's anything we can do about it.	Mislim, da ne moremo ničesar storiti glede tega.
That's right.	Tako je.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
Probably no one.	Verjetno nihče ne.
Everything works for us.	Vse nam gre.
He is everything and more.	On je vse in še več.
They are here.	Tukaj so.
He was convinced now.	Zdaj je bil prepričan.
I really did it.	Res si mi uspelo.
It's not easy, it really isn't.	Ni lahko, res ni.
He had nowhere to go, the people he saw.	Imel je kam iti, ljudi, ki jih je videl.
I didn't think it was possible.	Nisem mislil, da je mogoče.
He's going home.	On gre domov.
I know it will.	Vem, da bo.
I don't know why that is.	Ne vem zakaj je tako.
I go alone, which is fine.	Grem sam, kar je v redu.
I think what will happen.	Mislim, kaj se bo zgodilo.
So it was now.	Tako je bilo zdaj.
I never asked him.	Nikoli ga nisem vprašal.
He always had time for his children.	Vedno je imel čas za svoje otroke.
He didn't speak.	Ni govoril.
You should do, or you would.	Morala bi narediti, ali bi.
This may be an option for you.	To je morda možnost za vas.
Apparently that didn't happen.	Očitno se to ni zgodilo.
You are absolutely right about everything.	Glede vsega imaš popolnoma prav.
I hope it helps you.	Upam, da ti pomaga.
None of this seems possible at the moment.	Nič od tega se trenutno ne zdi mogoče.
He's your friend.	On je tvoj prijatelj.
And yet it is also that.	Pa vendar je tudi to.
My father is good.	Moj oče je dober.
I really do.	Jaz res.
I didn't do that often.	Tega nisem počel pogosto.
No, that didn't happen.	Ne, to se ni zgodilo.
He was angry and wanted to stay that way.	Bil je jezen in tako je hotel tudi ostati.
It was about time.	Bil je že čas.
Maybe he doesn't know.	Morda ne ve.
It wasn't today.	Danes ni bilo.
That there is nothing wrong.	Da nič ni narobe.
I was sure it was him.	Prepričan sem bil, da je to on.
Fortunately, this has not happened to date.	Do danes se to na srečo ni zgodilo.
I'm in trouble here.	Tukaj imam težave.
The things she said.	Stvari, ki jih je rekla.
I want everything you have.	Želim si vse, kar imaš.
However, it must be said.	Vendar je treba povedati.
Tell me about it.	Povej mi o tem.
I think you know that.	Mislim, da to veš.
I believe it is time now.	Verjamem, da je čas zdaj.
In fact, it was really good.	Pravzaprav je bilo res dobro.
I have them now.	Zdaj jih imam.
He never asked for anything.	Nikoli ni ničesar prosil.
He also admitted.	Tudi on je priznal.
No, we have you here.	Ne, imamo te tukaj.
I'm happy for you.	Vesel sem zate.
This is a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
That doesn't work.	Tega ne gre.
If it were possible.	Če bi bilo mogoče.
Time is money.	Čas je denar.
He only wanted me.	Želel je samo mene.
That is really true.	To je res res.
So I was from here.	Tako sem bil od tukaj.
It seems right to me.	Zdi se mi prav.
It's a.	To je a.
That it doesn't help.	Da ne pomaga pomagati.
He has a lot to say.	Veliko ima za povedati.
She said no.	Rekla je, da ni.
Everyone is very sorry for what happened.	Vsem je zelo žal za to, kar se je zgodilo.
What do you think we should do?	Kaj misliš, da bi morali narediti?
I want to know what he knows.	Želim vedeti, kaj on ve.
But he knew it was more than that.	A vedel je, da je več kot to.
You did the right thing.	Prav ste naredili.
It took him a long time to die.	Dolgo je potreboval, da je umrl.
I don't mean that.	Ne mislim tega.
That was a good reason.	To je bil dober razlog.
I need to know more.	Vedeti moram več.
That could have been earlier.	To bi lahko bilo že prej.
You had a pretty good life.	Imel si kar dobro življenje.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
I don't want to know.	nočem vedeti.
I haven't found it yet.	Nisem še našel.
It would be good to be home.	Dobro bi bilo biti doma.
It would never be enough.	Nikoli ne bi bilo dovolj.
It's really nice to see.	Res je lepo videti.
That was not right.	To ni bilo prav.
So good, so good.	Tako dobro, tako dobro.
I don't understand that.	jaz tega ne razumem.
We did it.	Naredili smo to.
I just met you.	Pravkar sem te spoznal.
He lives there now.	Zdaj živi tam.
It's so common.	Tako je pogosto.
Maybe we would be lucky.	Mogoče bi imeli srečo.
That is not what we have here.	To ni tisto, kar imamo tukaj.
But it's still there.	Je pa še vedno tam.
And not just alone.	In ne samo sama.
It can be, it can be not.	Lahko je, lahko ne.
I really don't know.	res ne vem.
That didn't work either.	Tudi to ni uspelo.
It's always been that way.	Vedno je bilo tako.
It's nice to be here.	Lepo je biti tukaj.
Sometimes it's true.	Včasih je res.
I immediately feel in place.	Takoj se počutim na mestu.
She was alone now.	Zdaj je bila sama.
I think so too.	Tudi jaz mislim tako.
I'm going for help.	grem po pomoč.
There are actually a few of us.	Pravzaprav nas je nekaj.
That it's hard for me	Da mi je težko
I didn't waste time.	nisem izgubil časa.
I don't think he can.	Mislim, da ne more.
I'm not so sure now.	Zdaj nisem tako prepričan.
Don't tell him what he thought the first time.	Ne povej mu, kaj je mislil prvič.
I can do that now.	To lahko storim zdaj.
I waited long enough.	Čakal sem dovolj dolgo.
And in doing so, everything got better.	In pri tem je bilo vse bolje.
That's right.	Tako je .
There is nothing more to do here.	Tukaj ni več kaj početi.
That was enough for that time.	To je bilo za tisti čas dovolj.
You couldn't.	Nisi mogel.
She said she was feeling well.	Rekla je, da se počuti dobro.
He didn't know if they were even alive.	Ni vedel, ali so sploh še živi.
I am a teacher.	jaz sem učitelj.
He didn't know what was going to happen.	Ni vedel, kaj se bo zgodilo.
You know where he is.	Veš kje je.
It's not like it is now.	Ni tako, kot je zdaj.
I would succeed.	bi mi uspelo.
I don't know where to go from here.	Ne vem, kam naj grem od tukaj.
I'd rather not know.	raje ne vem.
It might be for you too.	Morda bo tudi za vas.
There just isn’t much there.	Tam preprosto ni veliko.
However, there is something to this.	Vendar pa je nekaj na tem.
It was hard for me.	Težko mi je bilo.
Nothing and never.	Nič in nikoli.
She wanted to know where she was.	Želela je vedeti, kje je.
He's absolutely right.	Ima popolnoma prav.
I just want to see them.	Samo videti jih želim.
I just went ahead.	Preprosto sem šel naprej.
No one is over it.	Nihče ni nad tem.
She still did it.	Še vedno je to storila.
I would do anything for you.	Vse bi naredil zate.
You'll feel much better by then.	Do takrat se boš počutil veliko bolje.
He needs to be better than he ever was before.	Mora biti boljši, kot je bil kdaj prej.
We will do everything.	Vse bomo naredili.
I think he must be very good.	Mislim, da mora biti zelo dober.
He didn't do it, you know.	On tega ni storil, veš.
Maybe it would be nice if I could.	Mogoče bi bilo lepo, če bi lahko.
I would see you.	jaz bi te videl.
You have to help me.	Moraš mi pomagati.
There is a good reason for this.	Za to obstaja dober razlog.
As if he just knew he had done his thing.	Kot da je pravkar vedel, da je opravil svoje.
And he would know.	In on bi vedel.
Tell me what you know.	Povej mi, kaj veš.
With everything you've got.	Z vsem kar imaš.
And it will.	In bo.
It happened on the spot.	Zgodilo se je na mestu.
I know he would say that too	Vem, da bi tudi on to rekel
I was no longer human	Nisem bil več človek
That should be done well.	To bi morali narediti dobro.
I heard this is happening here	Slišal sem, da se to dogaja tukaj
It wasn't enough.	Ni bilo dovolj.
That's why the man died.	Zato je človek umrl.
I need to talk to you	Moram govoriti s tabo
You always knew where you were with him	Vedno si vedel, kje si z njim
I feel perfectly fine	Počutim se popolnoma v redu
Still not really.	Še vedno res ne.
I wouldn't do that to you	Jaz ti ne bi naredil nič takega
I would like to go and I would like to stay again.	Rad bi šel in spet bi rad ostal.
I'll be alone.	Sam bom.
I didn't expect any of that	Nič od tega nisem pričakoval
I would not allow it.	ne bi dovolil.
We also know who did it.	Vemo tudi, kdo je to storil.
No one can come, no matter how good a friend.	Nihče ne more priti, ne glede na to, kako dober prijatelj.
I'm ready to do it	Pripravljen sem to narediti
Maybe they were, a little.	Morda so bili, malo.
I mean really, really good	Mislim res, res dobro
It could not be said.	Ni bilo mogoče povedati.
And I was ready when he called	Jaz pa sem bil pripravljen, ko je poklical
You were just.	Bil si samo.
This can't be it.	To ne more biti to.
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.	Mislim, da s tem ni nič narobe.
We have to.	Moramo.
I know he wasn't.	Vem, da ni bil.
That is what we are.	To smo, kar smo.
A little more time to do what he has to	Malo več časa, da naredi, kar mora
I wouldn't be angry	ne bi bil jezen
It's perfectly fine.	Popolnoma v redu je.
I know everything that's going on here	Vem vse, kar se tukaj dogaja
That's a lot.	To je kar veliko.
Just like he would.	Tako kot bi on.
He wasn't alone.	Ni bil sam.
I didn't let her know that	Tega ji nisem dal vedeti
But she didn't want that.	Vendar tega ni želela.
I would.	Jaz bi.
Or not at all.	Ali pa niti ne.
And it's time.	In čas je.
He was probably right.	Verjetno je imel prav.
I'd actually like to have that.	Pravzaprav bi to rad imel.
I need to see something	Moram nekaj videti
We know this and we should be.	To vemo in bi moral biti.
I'm not sure yet.	Nisem še prepričan.
But I didn’t think it was going to happen	Nisem pa mislil, da se bo to zgodilo
Not to us at all.	Nam pa sploh ne.
Just come on, that's the thing.	Samo pride, to je stvar.
I hope you know that	Upam, da to veš
And this is not obvious.	In to ni očitno.
That's a good thing for me.	To je zame dobra stvar.
I never saw him at all.	Nikoli ga sploh nisem videl.
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
I don’t think he even knew about it.	Mislim, da sploh ni vedel za to.
I didn’t even see him waiting there	Nisem ga niti videl, da bi tam čakal
I said a lot of time	Rekel sem, da je veliko časa
I doubt they ever will.	Dvomim, da bodo kdaj.
I'm so sorry, really not	Zelo mi je žal, res ne
We don't know what it was.	Ne vemo, kaj je bilo.
I know you didn't mean that	Vem, da nisi mislil tako
Maybe I know "a".	Mogoče "a" poznam.
I didn't want to know anymore	Nisem hotel vedeti več
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ni.
And here it must be so.	In tukaj mora biti tako.
I will be here	jaz bom tukaj
I will definitely succeed	zagotovo mi bo uspelo
I didn't have to tell anyone	Nikomur mi ni bilo treba povedati
Nobody needs you here.	Tukaj te nihče ne potrebuje.
Just me.	Samo meni.
I don’t know who started this	Ne vem, kdo je to začel
As is everyone.	Tako kot so vsi.
I wonder where we are	Sprašujem se, kje smo
Dad was sitting.	Oče je sedel.
I spoke to him this afternoon	Danes popoldne sem govoril z njim

He can have a job.	Ima lahko delo.

I just know where you are	Samo vem kje si
I didn't see you at all	Sploh te nisem videl
I'm pretty sure he can't	Skoraj prepričan sem, da ne more
I never want to know	Nikoli ne želim vedeti
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
They are not like that.	Niso kaj takega.
Mine doesn't have that.	Moj tega nima.
He used to be him and he will be me soon.	Nekoč sem bil on in on bo kmalu jaz.
Obviously this was not the case.	Očitno temu ni bilo tako.
But there was no one to see him.	Vendar ga ni bilo nikogar, ki bi ga videl.
I just wish it hadn’t been that long	Samo želim si, da ne bi bilo tako dolgo
I also met something else	Spoznal sem tudi nekaj drugega
This is because there were none.	To je zato, ker jih ni bilo.
I know someone is helping her	Vem, da ji nekdo pomaga
I don't like it now	zdaj mi ni všeč
No one needs to know.	Nikomur ni treba vedeti.
Not like he had.	Ne tako kot je imel.
And he's right.	In ima prav.
Just do these things.	Samo naredi te stvari.
I'm not interested in anything else	Nič drugega me ne zanima
I felt at home there	Tam sem se počutil kot doma
I met him once, a very long time ago	Spoznal sem ga enkrat, zelo dolgo nazaj
I told her no last week.	Prejšnji teden sem ji rekel ne.
It's still there.	Še vedno je tam.

And, needless to say, buy more stuff.	In, treba je povedati, kupiti več stvari.
They are just thoughts.	So samo misli.

I didn’t like talking about it.	Ni mi bilo všeč govoriti o tem.

And that can't be good.	In to ne more biti dobro.

I never do.	Jaz pa nikoli ne.
I didn’t ask what was going on	Nisem vprašal, kaj se dogaja
I hope he succeeds soon	Upam, da mu bo kmalu uspelo
Sometimes you will see them doing things.	Včasih jih boste videli delati stvari.

He told me to do it again.	Rekel mi je, naj to storim še enkrat.
I came to tell him that.	Prišel sem mu to povedati.
I was a good boy.	Bil sem dober fant.
He liked that.	To mu je bilo všeč.
I wanted you to know what was going on	Želel sem, da veš kaj se dogaja

That's how it looks.	Tako je videti.
I didn't expect that	Tega nisem pričakoval
I didn't really have anything to do	Pravzaprav nisem imel kaj početi
I was sure he was right again	Bil sem prepričan, da ima spet prav
They always have been and always will be.	Vedno so bili in vedno bodo.
I waited for him to come.	Čakal sem, da pride.
That's what he said.	Tako je rekel.
Angry, but not at all surprised.	Jezen, a niti malo presenečen.
A few a week is more than enough	Nekaj ​​na teden je več kot dovolj
I hope someone is there	Upam, da je kdo tam

In bi.	In bi.
I really thought he died.	Res sem mislil, da je umrl.
I didn't tell him everything	Nisem mu povedal vsega
I just didn’t expect it so quickly.	Samo nisem pričakoval tako hitro.
I may not know today	Danes morda ne vem
I would love to see you	zelo bi te rad videl
I have something to tell you.	Nekaj ​​ti moram povedati.
As you know.	Kot veš.
You didn't have to come.	Ni ti bilo treba priti.
Not always, but usually.	Ne vedno, običajno pa.
It's earlier, isn't it? 	Prej je, kajne?
I didn't do it.	Jaz tega nisem storil.
The child began to eat too much.	Otrok je začel jesti preveč.
I didn't always want a baby	Nisem si vedno želela otrok
None of us are.	Nihče od nas ni.
I wish someone would help me or I like it	Želim si, da bi mi kdo pomagal ali mi je všeč
I hope she's not home now	Upam, da je zdaj ni doma
I want to help you	rad bi ti pomagal
I waited, which seemed like a very long time	Čakal sem, kar se je zdelo zelo dolgo
You can't be sure.	Ne moreš biti prepričan.
Even now he wasn't sure why.	Tudi zdaj ni bil prepričan, zakaj.
It's not nice.	Ni lepo.
I'm fine with that.	S tem sem v redu.
No one to help you.	Nihče, ki bi ti pomagal.
There were many here and I would have more soon.	Tukaj je bilo veliko in kmalu bi jih imel še več.
I think it was obvious	Mislim, da je bilo očitno
I mean, they used to be	Mislim, včasih so bili
I've had enough of that.	Tega imam dovolj.
You are out of place.	Nisi na mestu.
The man promised.	Človek je obljubil.
He knew who he was.	Vedel je, kdo je.
I asked them not to	Prosil sem jih, naj ne
Much needs to be done.	Veliko je treba narediti.
There was nothing you could do.	Nič nisi mogel storiti.
I just want to stay together	Želim samo ostati skupaj
I thought you might like them	Mislil sem, da ti bodo morda všeč
Talk if you're interested.	Govori, če te zanima.
I never met him.	Nikoli ga nisem srečal.
I also knew he was right	Vedel sem tudi, da ima prav
I shouldn't have gone	Ne bi smel iti
It won't be my first time.	Ne bo mi prvič.
He knows we are.	Ve, da smo.
I learned so much	Toliko sem se naučil
I don't understand that yet	jaz tega še ne razumem
I didn't want to tell anyone about it either.	Tudi o tem nisem hotel nikomur povedati.
There is also a lot of talk about this.	O tem se tudi veliko govori.
It's not hard for anyone.	Nikomur ni težko.
I just wanted to make sure you weren't with him	Hotel sem se samo prepričati, da nisi z njim
He wasn't sure what to do next.	Ni bil prepričan, kaj naj naredi naprej.
I was not.	Nisem bil.
I really like it here	Tukaj mi je res všeč
It's really very good.	Res je zelo dobro.
I wasn't sure if you were here before	Nisem bil prepričan, če si že bil tukaj
Maybe it took time for something else.	Mogoče je čas potreboval nekaj drugega.
I wonder how many of us know him	Sprašujem se, koliko nas ga pozna
Or he would.	Ali pa bi.
We can't do that.	Tega ne moremo storiti.
He didn't say anything for a long time.	Dolgo časa ni rekel ničesar.
No, not really, he said.	Ne, res ne, je rekel.
I had to do something.	Nekaj ​​sem moral narediti.
It's okay now.	Zdaj je v redu.
Do it fast.	Naredi to hitro.
I want you here with me	Želim te tukaj z mano
I was the only person there	Bil sem edina oseba tam
I didn’t have anyone to help me	Nisem imel nikogar, ki bi mi pomagal
He just said he saw you a lot.	Rekel je samo, da te je veliko videl.
I can't believe he didn't come home with us.	Ne morem verjeti, da ni prišel domov z nami.
Here and now.	Tukaj in zdaj.
But he did none of that.	Vendar ni storil nič od tega.
No one knew where he was.	Nihče ni vedel, kje je.
I couldn’t speak the right way	Nisem mogel govoriti na pravi način
I'm glad you're here!	Vesel sem, da ste tukaj!
I’ve been there before and I did	Tam sem že bil in to storil
I didn't do well	Nisem dobro opravil
Just tell me that.	Samo povej mi to.
He's having fun.	Ima zabavo.
We have you.	Imamo te.
All that.	Vse to.
He doesn't like anyone.	Nikogar ne mara.
I never want to see her again	Nikoli več je ne želim videti
But he did not find him.	Vendar ga ni našel.
They knew what it was all about.	Vedeli so, za kaj gre.
I wonder what else he knows.	Sprašujem se, kaj še ve.
Dad, you didn't hear anything.	Oče, nič nisi slišal.
I knew it was wrong.	Vedel sem, da je narobe.
I completely understand	popolnoma razumem
I loved it, everything	Všeč mi je bilo, vse
I know you're very busy	Vem, da si zelo zaposlen
I'm here now, with you	Zdaj sem tukaj, s tabo
You did what you could.	Naredil si, kar si lahko.
I should tell you that	To bi ti moral povedati
Everything can be done.	Vse se da narediti.
He told her not to come.	Rekel ji je, naj ne pride.
We're not there yet.	Nismo še tam.
It really isn’t an option.	Res ni možnost.
There's something about it.	Nekaj ​​je na tem.
I just need to know what it is	Samo vedeti moram, kaj je
I went.	Šel sem.
Not very good after that.	Po tem ni zelo dobro.
I wanted to talk to you about last night	Želel sem govoriti s tabo o sinoči
I think they are a good thing	Mislim, da so dobra stvar
I feel better there.	tam mi je bolje.
You know what will happen if you don't.	Veš, kaj se bo zgodilo, če ne boš.
And that wasn't good enough.	In to ni bilo dovolj dobro.
It's actually nothing.	Pravzaprav ni nič.
I am you.	Jaz sem ti.
I have something to do tonight	Nocoj imam nekaj za početi
No one knows everything about me.	Nihče ne ve vsega o meni.
I wasn’t sure at the time	Takrat nisem bil prepričan
Which I would do.	Kar bi naredil.
Or she was.	Ali pa je bila.
Maybe more.	Morda je več.
You are absolutely right.	Imaš popolnoma prav.
I just will.	samo bom.
I will say that.	to bom rekel.
But I really wished I would.	Vendar sem si res želel, da bi.
I spoke to him this morning	Danes zjutraj sem govoril z njim
I know he must be sorry	Vem, da mu mora biti žal
About what happened to you.	O tem, kaj se ti je zgodilo.
He would be a good father.	Bil bi dober oče.
Above all and nothing.	Nad vsem in nič.
I know it's not.	Vem, da ni.
It's been since then.	Od takrat je.
And we did that.	In to smo naredili.
Like never before.	Kot še nikoli.
Now he knows where to put it.	Zdaj ve, kam naj ga da.
But if it isn't.	Če pa ni.
I just saw it happen	Pravkar sem videl, da se je zgodilo
He was so sorry.	Bilo mu je tako žal.
I haven’t had it in almost three years	Nisem ga imel skoraj tri leta
Like home.	Kot doma.
And now it was like that.	In zdaj je bilo tako.
I want to do everything with you	Vse želim narediti s tabo
Everything must be fine.	Vse mora biti v redu.
Actually a few things	Pravzaprav nekaj stvari
I'm just asking you to do that	Samo to prosim od vas
Do it the right way.	Narediti to na pravi način.
I didn’t do this just for me	Tega nisem naredil samo zame
Years after it happened.	Leta po tem, ko se je zgodilo.
It's not true.	Ni res.
I'm sure he succeeded	Prepričan sem, da mu je to uspelo
It was a little like.	Malo je bilo všeč.
You heard him.	Slišal si ga.
I have to work on it	Moram delati na tem
I was glad to be back	Vesel sem bil, da sem se vrnil
Please don't speak for me.	Prosim, ne govori namesto mene.
You will love it here.	Tukaj vam bo všeč.
I hope it won't be like that again	Upam, da ne bo več tako
I wasn't ready to talk	Nisem bil pripravljen govoriti
He was waiting for her.	Čakal jo je.
He will leave when the time is right.	Ko bo čas, bo odšel.
I understand how much that is	Razumem, kako veliko je to
Maybe more than we should.	Mogoče več, kot bi morali.
I heard what happened today	Slišal sem, kaj se je zgodilo danes
I don't know if that's true.	Ne vem, če je to res.
I didn't want to go back	Nisem hotel nazaj
I want to do something about it.	Želim nekaj storiti glede tega.
She wasn't here.	Ni je bila tukaj.
Like being a kid again.	Kot bi bil spet otrok.
I don't think he really likes me	Mislim, da me res ne mara
But she didn't know anything.	A ni vedela ničesar.
He would never succeed.	Nikoli mu ne bi uspelo.
I had to talk to you	Moral sem govoriti s tabo
I can not see.	ne vidim.
I wasn’t ready to talk about it	Nisem bil pripravljen govoriti o tem
I promised him that	To sem mu obljubil
He was so angry.	Bil je tako jezen.
I hope you know that	Upam, da to veš
I forgot to tell you last night	Sinoči sem ti pozabil povedati
I had nothing to say	Nisem imel kaj povedati
I wasn't even sure who your father was	Sploh nisem bil prepričan, kdo je tvoj oče
I believe he is absolutely right	Verjamem, da ima popolnoma prav
This is not easy.	To ni lahko.
I didn't need to see.	Ni mi bilo treba videti.
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
He just likes it too much here.	Tukaj mu je preprosto preveč všeč.
I don’t know how he managed that.	Ne vem, kako mu je to uspelo.
I don't know where he got them	Ne vem, kje jih je dobil
I know how hard it is for you	Vem, kako težko ti je
What I did.	Kaj sem naredil.
And nobody was happy.	In nihče ni bil vesel.
He has to.	On mora.
He has something about us.	Ima nekaj o nas.
I see her a lot.	Veliko jo vidim.
What will happen?	Kaj se bo zgodilo?
I didn't do that today.	Danes tega nisem storil.
I had nowhere to go	Nisem imel kam iti
I knew he was really just like him	Vedel sem, da je res tako kot on
I feel like I have it now.	Počutim se, da imam to zdaj.
I really started to like it	Res mi je začel biti všeč
I wanted him to do that.	Hotel sem, da to stori.
He didn't need me anymore.	Ni me več potreboval.
He is doing well with the house.	S hišo mu gre dobro.
Maybe a question.	Mogoče vprašanje.
I didn't have time to tell you	Nisem ti imel časa povedati
In fact, there are many	Pravzaprav jih je veliko
There was no time now.	Zdaj ni bilo časa.
There was something else.	Bilo je še nekaj.
I just wanted you to know this was going on	Hotel sem samo, da veš, da se to dogaja
I didn't want you to know what my father did.	Nisem hotel, da veš, kaj je storil moj oče.
And you found me.	In našel si me.
It wasn't fast enough.	Ni bilo dovolj hitro.
Either you are or you aren't.	Ali si ali pa nisi.
Or he had them there.	Ali pa jih je imel tam.
Too much of it.	Preveč tega.
I wanted to know what was wrong with me	Hotel sem vedeti, kaj je narobe z mano
He knew he had to say it.	Vedel je, da mora to povedati.
I'm just going to leave.	Samo odšel bom.
Maybe that's right.	Morda je to prav.
I thought it was okay with that	Mislil sem, da je v redu s tem
Actually nothing.	Pravzaprav nič.
I'm going there tonight	Nocoj bom šel tja
It was hard.	Bilo je težko.
I didn't give it.	Nisem ga dal.
I would love to know	Zelo bi rad vedel
This is not true.	To ni res.

Everyone will know.	Vsi bodo vedeli.
We knew why he was so angry.	Vedeli smo, zakaj je bil tako jezen.
I feel better now.	Zdaj se počutim bolje.
You'll be fine here.	Tukaj boš v redu.
You should know better.	Moral bi vedeti bolje.
I haven't helped much yet	Nisem še veliko pomagal
I want to make them now	Želim jih narediti zdaj
You haven't seen many of them.	Nisi jih videl veliko.
And sat there.	In sedel tam.
He had a good life.	Imel je lepo življenje.
What could happen.	Kaj bi se lahko zgodilo.
I know everything that's going on here	Vem vse, kar se dogaja tukaj
I don't know if it is.	Ne vem, če je.
It was more than I saw.	Bilo je več, kot sem ga videl.
I know you were there last night	Vem, da si bil sinoči tam
I mean, if so, that's fine	Mislim, če že, je v redu
I wish we had more	Želim si, da bi imeli več
Everything you think is true.	Vse, kar mislite, je res.
This is no longer a problem.	To ni več problem.
What if not.	Kaj pa, če ne.
And it happened.	In zgodilo se je.
Which is probably not much.	Kar verjetno ni veliko.
I think you're right	Mislim, da imaš prav
I had to make it my own again	Spet sem jo moral narediti svojo
I haven't managed that yet	Tega mi še ni uspelo
I'm so sorry.	Tako zelo mi je žal.
I didn't hear anything from home.	Nič nisem slišal od doma.
That's why I'm here.	Zato sem tukaj.
I know you are, obviously you are	Vem, da si, očitno si
There's nothing wrong with a little help.	Nič ni narobe z malo pomoči.
It was now.	Zdaj je bilo.
It's just not true.	Preprosto ni res.
I don't like going out now.	Zdaj ne maram iti ven.
I did a lot of things wrong	Naredil sem veliko stvari narobe
I couldn’t do that for him	Tega nisem mogel storiti namesto njega
I really wanted out.	Res sem hotel ven.
I want to see something soon	Rad bi kaj kmalu videl
You too, not like that.	Tudi ti, ne tako.
I may not get there with you	Morda ne bom prišel tja s tabo
I wouldn't eat.	Ne bi jedel.
I didn't expect that	Tega nisem pričakoval
Something wasn't right.	Nekaj ​​ni bilo v redu.
It was nice to see them.	Lepo jih je bilo videti.
It's not just about tonight.	Ne gre samo za nocoj.
Matter.	Glede na to.
I'm not interested in anything else.	Nič drugega me ne zanima.
I had nothing	Nisem imel ničesar
I thought it was too much	Mislil sem, da je preveč
I didn’t even know he was there.	Sploh nisem vedel, da je tam.
I saw what was possible	Videl sem, kaj je mogoče
We could do more.	Lahko bi naredili več.
You did that.	To si naredil.
I want to be with him all the time	Ves čas želim biti z njim
It is now.	Zdaj je.
To not come back here.	Da se ne bi vrnil sem.
You knew what was going to happen.	Vedel si, kaj se bo zgodilo.
I decided to sit down and do nothing	Odločil sem se, da bom sedel in nič ne naredil
I would never know.	Nikoli ne bi vedela.
I haven't told anyone yet.	Nisem še nikomur povedal.
I think she's interested	Mislim, da jo zanima
I didn't want to see that	Tega nisem hotel videti
I just wanted to see how you were	Hotel sem samo videti, kako si
He won't say anything.	Ne bo rekel nič.
This is not an easy life.	To ni lahko življenje.
I haven't been able to reach anyone for a few days	Že nekaj dni ne morem priti do nikogar
But I really didn't know anything	Res pa nisem nič vedel
I just didn't tell you	Samo nisem ti povedal
However, this is not always the case.	Vendar ni vedno tako.
I think he really likes it here.	Mislim, da mu je tukaj res všeč.
I had to say something	Nekaj ​​sem moral povedati
There was nothing I could do.	Nič nisem mogel storiti.
Looks like you're almost there.	Videti je, da ste skoraj tam.

That's not much.	To ni veliko.
He taught them quickly.	Hitro jih je naučil.
we really are.	res smo.
If you know anything, tell me.	Če kaj veš, mi povej.
The question, however, is whether it would.	Vprašanje pa je, ali bi.
I think it should work	Mislim, da bi morala delati
I was sorry for that.	To mi je bilo žal.
And you will do it tonight.	In to boš storil nocoj.
I'm still sorry about that today	To mi je še danes žal
I 'm actually that person.	Pravzaprav sem ta oseba.
That's right.	Tako so.
Who knows.	Kdo pa ve.
Not much time.	Ni veliko časa.
I will never speak of it again.	Nikoli več ne bom govoril o tem.
Some of this is for sure.	Nekaj ​​tega je zagotovo.
I couldn't take it anymore	Nisem je mogel več
Because he told me.	Ker mi je povedal.
It worked really well.	Delal je res dobro.
He would come back and tell me.	Vrnil bi se in mi povedal.
However, this is not enough for me.	Vendar mi to ni dovolj.
There was something wrong with all of this.	Pri vsem tem nekaj ni bilo v redu.
She never was.	Nikoli ni bila.
I had so much work to do yesterday	Včeraj sem imel toliko dela
I'd rather play.	raje bi igral.
He was sitting in a place he was not.	Sedel je na mestu, ki ga ni bilo.
I will learn a lot from you.	Veliko stvari se bom naučil od vas.
I never had anything to do with it.	Nikoli nisem imel nič s tem.
Maybe you have too.	Mogoče imaš tudi ti.
I love my work.	Všeč mi je moje delo.
I don't like that.	To mi ni všeč.
But it is clearly more than that.	Je pa očitno več kot to.
I also learned a lot this way	Tudi na ta način sem se veliko naučil
Just like eating well.	Tako kot dobro jesti.

We should go out.	Morali bi iti ven.
I had very good help	Imel sem zelo dobro pomoč
He did it so well.	To je naredil tako dobro.
This is not what you want.	To ni tisto, kar si želiš.
I wasn't happy about that at all	Sploh nisem bil vesel tega
I would be surprised.	Bil bi presenečen.
It was from me.	Bilo je od mene.
Nothing nothing.	Nič nič.
The next day.	Naslednji dan.
You probably didn't have to tell me that	Verjetno ti tega ni bilo treba povedati
I wanted more time with you	Želel sem več časa s tabo

I am tired.	Utrujen sem.
I went back and forth	Šel sem naprej in nazaj
He met them.	Srečal jih.

I wasn’t even sure what was going to happen	Sploh nisem bil prepričan, kaj se bo zgodilo
I couldn't have known that	Tega ne bi mogel vedeti
She knows it herself.	Sama to ve.
I couldn’t eat right now	Trenutno nisem mogel jesti
Here is.	Tukaj je.
I wanted to see what would happen	Hotel sem videti, kaj se bo zgodilo
You never know what might happen.	Nikoli ne veš, kaj bi se lahko zgodilo.
He knew something was going to happen.	Vedel je, da se bo nekaj zgodilo.
It just seemed that way.	Samo tako se je zdelo.
I see him there.	Vidim ga tam.
In fact, this is not true.	Pravzaprav to ni res.
I wonder what he will do now	Zanima me, kaj bo zdaj naredil
I wish this would never happen	Želim si, da se to nikoli ne bi zgodilo
You're a good man.	Ti si dober človek.
I told him it was my car	Rekel sem mu, da je to moj avto
She wanted more and more.	Želela si je še in še.
I need to see you now	Zdaj te moram videti
I want to tell him something	Rad bi mu nekaj povedal
I want to stay here for a while	Nekaj ​​časa želim ostati tukaj

Someone will see it.	Nekdo bo to videl.
I will go and not return	odšel bom in se ne vrnil
I couldn't tell him	Nisem mu mogel povedati
If you like someone, you like it.	Če ti je nekdo všeč, ti je všeč.

I just realized something	Pravkar sem spoznal nekaj
I don’t think anyone even knew he was there	Mislim, da nihče sploh ni vedel, da je tam
She never made it there.	Nikoli ji ni uspelo tja.
He couldn't speak.	Ni mogel govoriti.
Really forward.	Res naprej.
I want them there too.	Tudi jaz jih želim tam.
Life, that is.	Življenje, to je.
Until today.	Do danes.
I'll be waiting for you here	Tukaj te bom čakal
I just see.	Samo vidim.
I know it doesn't work that way	Vem, da ne gre tako
He loved to play.	Zelo rad je igral.
You may or may not like this.	To vam je morda všeč ali pa ne.
I was the one who found her	Jaz sem bil tisti, ki jo je našel
I was just there.	Pravkar sem bil tam.
I would never have succeeded without him	Nikoli mi ne bi uspelo brez njega
Just a lot of things are happening.	Samo veliko stvari se dogaja.
We've seen enough.	Videli smo dovolj.
There is a lot to go.	Veliko je za iti.
That was the real problem.	To je bil pravi problem.
He's not as angry as he used to be.	Zdaj ni tako jezen, kot je bil.
Yes, he left.	Da, odšel je.
I don't see what it is	Ne vidim, kaj je
It is not simply that this is no longer an option.	Ne gre preprosto za to, da to ni več možnost.
I can't help it.	Ne morem pomagati.
I liked it.	Všeč mi je bilo.
It was my whole life.	Bilo je vse moje življenje.
He's gone.	Odšel je.
She had to buy some time.	Morala je kupiti nekaj časa.
Just a thing, maybe.	Samo stvar, morda.
Maybe he still wants me.	Morda me še vedno želi.
I want to help.	Rad bi pomagal.
That was all he told us.	To je bilo vse, kar nam je povedal.
It's not me.	To nisem jaz.
I have to.	Moram.
Even more than sometimes.	Še bolj kot včasih.
I saw you when you didn't know	Videl sem te, ko nisi vedel
I was there.	Bil sem tam.
I've never had that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem imel.
It's not what it seems.	Ni to, kar se zdi.
Matter.	Glede na to.
It was all mine.	Vse je bilo moje.
And apparently that was true.	In očitno je bilo to res.
I just wanted to.	Samo hotel sem.
And there's a reason for that.	In obstaja razlog za to.
So glad to be here.	Tako vesel, da sem tukaj.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
It’s hard to see these things.	Težko je videti te stvari.
I believe this to be true.	Verjamem, da je to res.
I believe she knew something	Verjamem, da je nekaj vedela
I need him so badly.	Tako zelo ga potrebujem.
I am not sure	Nisem prepričan
You just did it.	Preprosto si to naredil.
That’s when I knew what happened	Takrat sem vedel, kaj se je zgodilo
He helped me see.	Pomagal mi je videti.
It still seems to be the case.	Zdi se, da je še vedno tako.
I knew he wanted to come	Vedel sem, da želi priti
We need to know where we are.	Vedeti moramo, kje smo.
No one should know.	Nihče ne bi smel vedeti.
I think you'll like it.	Mislim, da ti bo všeč.
Only.	Samo.
I think there will be problems when there will be	Mislim, da bodo težave, ko bo
I was not okay at all	Sploh mi ni bilo v redu
I didn't want to work	Nisem hotel delati
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I didn’t even know he was there	Sploh nisem vedel, da je tam
It's really okay.	Res je v redu.
It just doesn’t go together.	Samo ne gre skupaj.
He was at home.	Bil je doma.
And so it seems we are.	In tako se zdi, da smo.
I haven't seen them in a while	Že nekaj časa jih nisem videl
I wanted that to be a question	Hotel sem, da bi bilo vprašanje
It's about people.	Gre za ljudi.
I had to talk to him	Moral sem govoriti z njim
I went.	Šel sem.
I didn’t even know how to play it	Sploh nisem vedel, kako ga igrati
She didn't have to talk.	Ni ji bilo treba govoriti.
I was left with nothing	ostal sem brez ničesar
Maybe it's true.	Mogoče je res.
And she wanted him.	In želela si ga je.
He plays well.	Dobro igra.
And he will ask you.	In vprašal vas bo.
I'm glad he's here.	Vesel sem, da je tukaj.
It's been a long time since that.	Je že dolgo od tega.
I want you back with me	Želim te nazaj z mano
You will like it.	Všeč ti bo.
Both would be what it was, both have been since.	Oba bi, kaj je bilo, oba sta od takrat naprej.
In fact, you can.	Pravzaprav lahko.
I saw them '.	Videl sem jih'.
I wonder.	Sprašujem se.
I could leave.	Lahko bi odšel.
He thought it was enough.	Dovolj se mu je zdelo.
I'm supposed to work.	Jaz naj bi delal.
I want you, everything	Želim te, vse
I was seriously tired again	Spet sem bil resno utrujen
I'm going with him tonight	Nocoj bom šel z njim
I didn't want that at all.	Tega si sploh nisem želela.
But they are much more than that.	So pa veliko več kot to.
It never will be and never has been.	Nikoli ne bo in nikoli ni bilo.
I'm just having a good time.	Samo lepo se imam.
I knew when you were thinking	Vedel sem, kdaj si mislil
I also didn’t feel well at the moment	Prav tako se trenutno nisem dobro počutil
I would really like that	res bi si to želel
I just couldn’t take it anymore	Preprosto nisem mogel več
I don’t know what is more true	Ne vem, kaj je bolj res
This is clearly wrong.	To je očitno narobe.
I had nothing to do.	Ničesar mi ni bilo za narediti.
He thinks he knows everything.	Misli, da ve vse.
He will, if he can.	Bo, če bo lahko.
I still have a lot of them	Še vedno jih imam veliko
The man was my friend and he didn't know.	Človek je bil moj prijatelj in ni vedel.
I see you have a problem.	Vidim, da imaš problem.
I need to know how she's doing	Moram vedeti, kako ji gre
He started.	Začel je.
I'll be better tomorrow.	Jutri mi bo bolje.
But there was more to it than that.	A bilo je tudi več kot to.
I know you tried to come to me	Vem, da si mi poskušal priti
He couldn't believe what was happening to him.	Ni mogel verjeti, kaj se mu dogaja.
I have to go out for a while	Za nekaj časa moram iti ven
It happened before that.	Zgodilo se je pred tem.
I didn't want her, not yet	Nisem ji želela, še ne
I learned a lot from you	Od tebe sem se veliko naučil
I mean, someone had to do it.	Mislim, nekdo je to moral narediti.
Maybe he didn't even know about it.	Morda sploh ni vedel za to.
He wants to stay for a few days.	Nekaj ​​dni želi ostati.
He told you that.	To ti je povedal.
We have you now.	Zdaj te imamo.
I wanted him to live	Hotel sem, da živi
He really doesn't need me.	Res me ne potrebuje.
There would be no money for me.	Zame ne bi bilo denarja.
I'm not coming home tonight	Nocoj ne bom prišel domov
He stayed for more than a week.	Ostal je več kot teden dni.
You will know who you are and you will know what you have done for me.	Vedel boš, kdo si in vedel boš, kaj si naredil zame.
There were always more of them.	Vedno jih je bilo več.
We will never see you again and you will never see us again.	Nikoli več te ne bomo videli in ti nas ne boš nikoli več videl.
When he is good, he is good.	Ko je dober, je dober.
i really don't like it that much.	res mi ni tako všeč.
And that just doesn’t seem right.	In to se preprosto ne zdi prav.
I think there are more.	Mislim, da jih je več.
You got me'.	Imaš mene'.
I just told you that	To sem ti pravkar povedal
But it isn't.	Vendar ni.
I hope everyone was fine	Upam, da so bili vsi dobro
Many people.	Veliko ljudi.
You are a true friend.	Ti si pravi prijatelj.
He did a good job.	Opravil je dobro delo.
And got it.	In dobil.
Or we should.	Ali pa bi morali.
I wasn't in the room.	Nisem bil v sobi.
We went out for a while.	Malo sva šla ven.
I didn't want to leave.	Nisem hotel oditi.
I forgot about that.	Pozabil sem na to.
I never asked him to come here	Nikoli ga nisem prosil, naj pride sem
I would love to see that.	Rad bi to videl.
They just didn’t have the money.	Preprosto niso imeli denarja.
In their own way.	Po svoje.
There was nothing that I could do about it	Nič nisem mogel storiti glede tega
Tell me again.	Povej mi še enkrat.
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
I didn’t think it was possible	Nisem si mislil, da je to mogoče
She really was.	Res je bila.
If you will.	Če boš.
With this, as	S tem, kot.
Here it is, he said.	Tukaj je, je rekel.
But it happened.	Vendar se je zgodilo.
Not sure if it will.	Nisem prepričan, če bo.
You saw that.	To ste videli.
I wish you were here with me	Želim si, da bi bil tukaj z mano
I have children.	imam otroke.
I haven’t seen enough of them to tell	Nisem jih videl dovolj, da bi povedal
That's what he does.	To počne.
I really wanted to go	Res sem hotel iti
I just want to help you	Samo pomagati ti želim
That must be obvious.	To mora biti očitno.
Maybe we really have all this behind us.	Mogoče imamo res vse to za nazaj.
I found a way.	Našel sem način.
Maybe you should.	Mogoče bi morala.
I left feeling much better	Odšel sem se počutil veliko bolje
Not the way you like it.	Ne tako, kot ti je všeč.
Not either.	Tudi ne.
And you know what, that's okay.	In veste kaj, to je v redu.
This is my chance.	To je moja priložnost.
It's not what you think.	Ni to, kar misliš.
To be.	Biti.
He loved being there.	Rad je bil tam.
There is nothing more to say.	Ni kaj več za povedati.
I'll call him tonight.	Poklical ga bom nocoj.
I see you're busy	Vidim, da si zaposlen
Maybe no one.	Mogoče nihče.
Just forward.	Samo naprej.
I started doing that.	To sem začel delati.
I think she would like it	Mislim, da bi ji bilo všeč
That was not what he needed.	To ni bilo tisto, kar je potreboval.
I saw myself doing it.	Videl sem, da to počnem.
We don't even have to talk about it.	O tem nam ni treba niti govoriti.
I wish I could see that	Želim si, da bi to videl
That's right.	To je prav.
That's not it.	To ni to.
We shouldn't talk like that.	Ne bi smeli tako govoriti.
This is no longer true.	To ni več res.
I'm pretty sure	Precej sem prepričan
I would need a lot of help.	Potreboval bi veliko pomoči.
I want to be absolutely sure.	Želim biti popolnoma prepričan.
I confessed.	Priznal sem.
I love that you're here	Všeč mi je, da si tukaj
And that's fine.	In to je v redu.
He was and still is my friend.	Bil je in je še vedno moj prijatelj.
I immediately felt better	Takoj sem se počutil bolje
That was not the real problem.	To ni bil pravi problem.
I think it's obvious	Mislim, da je očitno očitno
I really wasn't.	res nisem bil.
They did everything right.	Vse so naredili prav.
In fact, a few	Pravzaprav jih nekaj
He came home with me.	Z mano je prišel domov.
We were there.	Tam smo bili.
I'm not entirely sure	Nisem popolnoma prepričan
Now you are alone.	Zdaj si sam.
I thought my dad was a good boy	Mislil sem, da je moj oče dober fant
That's it.	To je to.
I didn't like it.	Ni mi bilo všeč.
I believe they would do that	Verjamem, da bi to storili
He would die soon	Kmalu bi umrl
A lot of them were true	Veliko jih je bilo res
It wasn't like that now.	Zdaj ni bilo tako.
I decided to play nice.	Odločil sem se igrati lepo.
I do not like.	Ni mi všeč.
He knew where.	Vedel je kje.
I got angry.	Postal sem jezen.
Looking busy helps.	Videti zaposlen pomaga.
I just wanted to from there	Hotel sem samo od tam
You won’t have to do much.	Ne bo vam treba narediti veliko.
It's hard to do.	Težko je narediti.
I didn’t want to see what happened next	Nisem hotel videti, kaj se je zgodilo naprej
I'm not sure what to do.	Nisem prepričan, kaj naj storim.
We don't know what this is about.	Ne vemo, za kaj gre.
And yet there it was.	In vendar je bilo tam.
And I have to.	In moram.
We have this at my home.	To imamo pri meni doma.
I saw for myself that it was so	Sam sem videl, da je tako
I knew then.	takrat sem vedel.
Sometimes for the better, but not always.	Včasih na bolje, vendar ne vedno.
It made me feel so little.	Zaradi njega sem se počutil tako malo.
Not without me.	Ne brez mene.
I don't believe that	temu ne verjamem
You don't have to.	Ni vam treba.
You're going to have to do something with it.	Nekaj ​​boš moral narediti s tem.
My child.	Moj otrok.
I couldn't help myself	Nisem si mogel pomagati
I didn't expect it at all	Sploh nisem pričakoval
No, I wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
I have to go to work soon	Kmalu moram v službo
I already know all this	Vse to že vem
He has many years ahead of him.	Pred njim je veliko let.
I thought not.	Mislil sem, da ne.
When he returned, he was perfectly fine.	Ko se je vrnil, je bil popolnoma v redu.
There is no need to just move on.	Ni treba iti samo naprej.
You don't have to.	Ni vam treba.
It was just me now.	Zdaj sem bil samo jaz.
Not too good either.	Tudi ni preveč dobro.
He was obviously lucky.	Očitno je imel srečo.
I would love to see her again.	Rad bi jo spet videl.
There is no need.	Ni treba.
Really, the only one.	Res, edini.
It's not always like that.	Ni vedno tako.
I mean, we can't be alone	Mislim, ne moremo biti sami
Because you just never know.	Ker preprosto nikoli ne veš.
Like you can't even talk about it.	Kot da o tem ne moreš niti govoriti.
Or very, very little.	Ali zelo, zelo malo.
I would have time for that	Imel bi čas za to
I told you that.	To sem ti povedal.
I had a job	Imel sem delo
That doesn't seem right.	Zdi se, da to ni prav.
I still have a lot of time	Imam še veliko časa
It will be there.	Tam bo.
It's always about that.	Vedno gre za to.
We know he's with you.	Vemo, da je s tabo.
Or too much of me.	Ali preveč od mene.
Maybe he doesn't have one.	Morda ga nima.
He wants to talk about us	Rad bi govoril o nas
I asked what he meant	Vprašal sem, kaj je mislil
I'll just say that.	Samo to bom rekel.
Things must be done.	Stvari je treba narediti.
I've been here before.	Tukaj sem že bil.
No surprise, really.	Nič presenečen, res.
It is and it is not.	Je in ni.
I am very sorry for all this	Zelo mi je žal za vse to
I need to know how it is	Moram vedeti, kako je
I was busy.	Bil sem zaposlen.
You should go after him	Moral bi iti za njim
I liked this man.	Všeč mi je bil ta človek.
I shouldn't have seen that at all.	Tega sploh ne bi smel videti.
My work is so good.	Moje delo je tako dobro.
Again he heard nothing.	Spet ni slišal ničesar.
I was glad to be back and had this opportunity.	Vesel sem bil, da sem se vrnil in imel to priložnost.
I could work with that	Lahko bi delal s tem
No one talked about it.	Nihče ni govoril o tem.
Maybe I could do it.	Mogoče bi mi uspelo.
I think he knows that	Mislim, da on to ve
I could do something	Nekaj ​​bi lahko naredil
She needs him.	Potrebuje ga.
I wish he hadn't said that	Želela sem si, da tega ni rekel
He didn't hear.	Ni slišal.
I left, but not much	Odšel sem, vendar ne veliko

Actually more.	Pravzaprav več.
If only that were true.	Ko bi le bilo to res.
Life was good.	Življenje je bilo lepo.
Tell us everything.	Povedati nam vse.
He didn't want them.	Ni jih hotel.
I will never know that either.	Tudi tega ne bom nikoli vedel.
It might not.	Morda ne bo.
I wonder where he is now	Sprašujem se, kje je zdaj
Do something about it.	Naredi nekaj glede tega.
He was there, he did it.	Bil je tam, to je naredil.
He died well.	Dobro je umrl.
I could do it myself at home	Sam bi to lahko počel doma
Only time will tell.	Samo čas bo povedal.
I didn’t think anyone would do this for someone	Nisem si mislil, da bo kdo to storil za nekoga
You would never think that	Tega si nikoli ne bi mislil
I didn't know then	takrat nisem vedel
I didn't want them	Nisem jih želel
I loved it together	Všeč mi je bilo skupaj
Now everything goes.	Zdaj gre vse.
I never thought you'd do something like that	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da boš naredil kaj takega

I did everything yesterday and today	Vse sem naredil včeraj in danes

I will never see them again.	Nikoli več jih ne bom videl.
I can't believe she's mine	Ne morem verjeti, da je moja
Now do it.	Zdaj pa naredi to.
Like you.	Tako kot ti.
I knew he was up to something.	Vedel sem, da nekaj namerava.
Not like it is now.	Ne tako kot je zdaj.
I have time.	Imam čas.
This is probably wrong.	To je verjetno narobe.
I can't tell you anything more	Ne morem vam povedati ničesar več
I will never be better at this.	V tem ne bom nikoli boljši.
I never saw myself being good	Nikoli se nisem videl, da bi bil dober
He's doing well.	Dobro mu gre.
You looked like you really wanted to.	Videti si bil, kot da si to res želiš.
I was so angry the whole time	Ves čas sem bil tako jezen
If he's still here.	Če je še tukaj.
We saw that.	To smo videli.
I decided not to do that	Odločil sem se, da tega ne bom storil
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
It's not nice.	Ni lepo.

I didn’t think it would be that hard	Nisem si mislil, da bo tako težko
Just wrong for me.	Samo narobe zame.
No, it was something else.	Ne, nekaj drugega je bilo.
I wouldn't do that	ne bi naredil
You can be sure.	Lahko ste prepričani.
Do what you think is right.	Naredi, kar misliš, da je prav.
I found that.	To sem našel.
That's me for the day.	To sem jaz za ta dan.
I think that was the reason	Mislim, da je bil to razlog

I will keep telling you this	To vam bom še naprej govoril
good.	dobro.
Sam went ahead.	Sam je šel naprej.

I wanted to be able to say that	Hotel sem, da bi to lahko povedal
I didn't want to anymore	Nisem hotel več
We cannot know.	Ne moremo vedeti.
I didn't want to know	Nisem hotel vedeti
The day has begun.	Dan se je začel.
I don’t know how they knew so fast	Ne vem, kako so vedeli tako hitro
I don't know why, just her.	Ne vem zakaj, samo jo.
I don’t believe this is going to happen	Ne verjamem, da se bo to zgodilo
It's hard for me to go anywhere.	Težko mi je kam iti.
I think you brought me back to life.	Mislim, da si me vrnil v življenje.
That's what my father taught me.	To me je naučil oče.
I haven't seen him since	Od takrat ga nisem več videl
He was always such a happy child.	Vedno je bil tako vesel otrok.
I won't anymore	ne bom več
It actually happened to us.	Pravzaprav se nam je to zgodilo.
If not more.	Če ne več.
Nothing happened.	Se ni nič zgodilo.
Sometimes I am like a child	Včasih sem, kot otrok
I need to get out more	Več moram ven
I thought everything you did was right	Mislil sem, da je vse, kar si naredil, prav
I shouldn't have left	Ne bi smel oditi
I knew you would be good	Vedel sem, da boš dober
A little for us.	Malo za nas.
I didn’t know how much time he still had	Nisem vedel, koliko časa še ima
It was a lot today.	Danes je bilo veliko.
He was not prepared for that.	Na to ni bil pripravljen.
I don't think it was that long ago	Mislim, da ni bilo tako dolgo nazaj
Currently.	Trenutno.
I'm afraid that day will never come	Bojim se, da ta dan nikoli ne pride
I need help	potrebujem pomoč
I was there the whole time	Ves čas sem bil tam
It usually was.	Običajno je bilo.
I thought you'd never ask	Mislil sem, da ne boš nikoli vprašal
He was angry.	Bil je jezen.
Not like it used to be.	Ne tako, kot je bila prej.
I was glad to see him	Vesel sem bil, da sem ga videl
I don't know why he did it.	Ne vem zakaj je to storil.
I'll be alone.	Sam bom.
I told him all about it	Povedal sem mu vse o tem
Keep up the good work.	Samo tako naprej.
I'll call you.	Poklical te bom.
I still think so.	Še vedno tako mislim.
I want to believe in people	Želim verjeti v ljudi
I wish we could do that today	Želim si, da bi to lahko storili danes
A little back, maybe	Malo nazaj, morda
That's the way to do it.	To je način, kako to storiti.
I didn’t ask how much he got	Nisem vprašal, koliko je dobil
That was obvious.	To je bilo očitno.
I forgot all that	Vse to sem pozabil
I only met him once.	Samo enkrat sem ga srečal.
I would really like to see that	To bi res rad videl
I never even knew it had happened	Nikoli nisem niti vedel, da se je to zgodilo
I know how you like them	Vem, kako so ti všeč
This is not going to happen to me.	To se mi ne bo zgodilo.
I don’t believe he did what he seems to have done.	Ne verjamem, da je naredil to, kar se zdi, da je storil.
He never did anything to you.	Nikoli ti ni nič naredil.
Everything my father did.	Vse, kar je naredil moj oče.
It might be helpful.	Morda bo v pomoč.
I knew it was going to be very difficult	Vedel sem, da bo zelo težko
It's all back.	Vse je nazaj.
No one heard anything.	Nihče ni nič slišal.
In fact, I made up my mind this morning	Pravzaprav sem se danes zjutraj odločil
Sometimes they are.	Včasih so.
She should go.	Morala bi iti.
He told her.	Povedal ji je.
He told me he would come back for me.	Rekel mi je, da se bo vrnil po mene.
No, he wasn't.	Ne, ni bil.
I will never do anything.	Nikoli ne bom naredil ničesar.
So glad to know you're back.	Tako vesel, da vem, da si se vrnil.
After that, okay, nothing more.	Po tem, v redu, nič več.
He's right.	Ima prav.
Never again.	Nikoli nič več.
I think that made him a better man	Mislim, da je bil zaradi tega boljši človek
We just don't know.	Samo ne vemo.
They're both fine.	Oba sta v redu.
When it comes.	Ko pride.
Maybe he had to.	Mogoče je moral.
I know what this is about.	Vem, za kaj gre.
I am, a lot.	Sem, veliko.
He didn't want us.	Ni nam želel.
I know it will be someday	Vem, da bo nekoč
It was time to work.	Čas je bil za delo.
I think I'd like to see you	Mislim, da bi te rad videl
You could say something is wrong	Lahko bi rekel, da je nekaj narobe
These are all problems.	Vse to so težave.
Tell him he can come to me.	Povej mu, da lahko pride k meni.
Something like this will be possible from today.	Kaj takega bo mogoče od danes naprej.
I don't want them now	Zdaj jih ne želim
And it didn't work.	In ni uspelo.
But I had to go.	Moral sem pa iti.
Just like a car.	Tako kot avto.
I didn't put him there	Nisem ga dal tja
But I didn't have to do anything.	Vendar mi ni bilo treba storiti ničesar.
It was everything.	Bilo je vse.
I ask for help.	Jaz prosim za pomoč.
In fact, there are very few things that need to be done.	Pravzaprav je treba narediti zelo malo stvari.
I can't help it.	Ne morem pomagati.
You were almost there.	Skoraj ste bili tam.
I thought you might have told her something	Mislil sem, da si ji morda kaj rekel
Keep it up.	Kar tako naprej.
I'll be leaving early.	Odšel bom zgodaj.
I will do something for you	nekaj bom naredil zate
But there was much more to it.	Vendar je bilo na tem veliko več.
You know, man.	Saj veš, človek.
I just want to see him	Samo videti ga želim
He never went out to them.	Nikoli ni šel ven k njim.
It must be so.	Tako mora biti.
I understand that time is money	Razumem, da je čas denar
I thought some of it was still pretty good.	Mislil sem, da je nekaj od tega še kar dobro.
It really could be one of us	Res bi lahko bil kdo od nas
The whole time we were there, we didn’t see anyone.	Ves čas, ko smo bili tam, nismo videli nikogar.
I have a few things for you	Imam ti nekaj stvari
I'll pay you back this week.	Ta teden ti bom vrnil.
He kept going.	Še naprej je šel.
I thought there was something wrong with that	Mislil sem, da je nekaj narobe s tem
I want to see if this can be done.	Želim videti, če je to mogoče storiti.
I didn't know he was coming	Nisem vedel, da bo prišel
He didn't usually do that.	Običajno tega ni počel.
I have to go home for a while	Moram iti domov za malo
If you are.	Če ste.
But I saw a lot of him today	Danes pa sem ga veliko videl
I went with him	Z njim sem šel na
If not for you, then for me.	Če ne zaradi tebe, pa zame.
I think that in a good way.	To mislim na dober način.
I mean forever.	mislim za vedno.
I wished I hadn't said that	Želel sem si, da tega ne bi rekla
i would do that	jaz bi to naredil
Right with me.	Prav pri meni.
I hope to see him someday	Upam, da ga bom nekoč videl
And that's something.	In to je nekaj.
There is nothing here.	Tukaj ni ničesar.
That's why you lost me.	Zaradi tega si me izgubil.
He didn't say how much it would be.	Ni povedal, koliko bo.
I didn’t go every day	Nisem šel vsak dan
I really wanted to tell him	Zelo sem mu hotel povedati
Apparently he's not afraid of anything either.	Očitno se tudi ne boji ničesar.
She'll be better for a while.	Za nekaj časa ji bo bolje.
I wouldn't be there long.	Ne bi bil dolgo tam.
I had it with him	Imel sem ga z njim
Who is good.	Ko je dobro.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ne vem, kaj se mu je zgodilo.
So are we.	Tudi mi smo.
What.	Kaj.
I don’t believe he knew what he was doing	Ne verjamem, da je vedel, kaj počne
I'm so tired today.	Danes sem tako utrujen.
It was something he was not prepared for.	To je bilo nekaj, na kar ni bil pripravljen.
Always.	Vedno.
I'm not afraid of anything.	Ničesar se ne bojim.
He never called again	Nikoli več ni poklical
But that seems to have happened.	A zdi se, da se je to zgodilo.
It was me, just me.	Bil sem jaz, samo jaz.
I've never seen her look like that before	Še nikoli je nisem videl tako videti
I really want to be your friend too	Res bi rad bil tudi tvoj prijatelj
I just need a little help	Potrebujem samo malo pomoči
I mean more wrong than usual	Mislim bolj narobe kot običajno
However, this is not enough.	Vendar to ni dovolj.
I will not buy them from you	Ne bom jih kupil pri vas
I expected not to be able to help everyone	Pričakoval sem, da ne bom mogel pomagati vsem
I knew right away that he wanted to leave	Takoj sem vedel, da želi oditi
And so it is forever.	In tako je za vedno.
I didn't know anything myself	Sama nisem vedela ničesar
And he's probably right.	In verjetno ima prav.
A lot of things.	Veliko stvari.
And now it works.	In zdaj dela.
It wouldn't be money.	Ne bi bil denar.
I think you worked with him	Mislim, da si delal z njim
I can't get there	Ne morem priti tja
No one ever asked.	Nihče ni nikoli vprašal.
All right, she said.	V redu, je rekla.
I have to leave early today	Danes moram zgodaj oditi
And you wouldn't want that.	In tega si ne bi želel.
There wasn't much time to eat.	Ni bilo veliko časa za jesti.
I didn't do anything wrong	Nič nisem naredil narobe
I told him I was leaving tomorrow	Povedal sem mu, da grem jutri
That was a very long time ago.	To je že zelo dolgo nazaj.
I thought you wanted to be more than that	Mislil sem, da želiš biti več kot to
I hope someone will help me.	Upam, da mi bo kdo pomagal.
It was not possible.	Ni bilo mogoče.
I see now.	zdaj vidim.
I should never have done that	Tega nikoli ne bi smel storiti
We often are.	Pogosto smo.
I wonder why he does that	Sprašujem se, zakaj to počne
And she did.	In to je storila.
It’s about getting it done.	Gre za to, da se to naredi.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nič nisem naredil narobe.
I'll tell you what she said.	Povedal ti bom, kaj je rekla.
He is still my father.	Še vedno je moj oče.
It really happened at home.	To se je res zgodilo doma.
I wanted to know things	Želel sem vedeti stvari
I asked him what he was doing and if he needed help.	Vprašal sem ga, kaj počne in ali potrebuje pomoč.
I thought it was in place again	Mislil sem, da je spet na mestu
He has a lot of work to do.	Ima veliko dela.
I want to talk about it.	Želim govoriti o tem.
I was also really angry	Bil sem tudi res jezen
My life is mine.	Moje življenje je moje.
I just know it will happen someday	Samo vem, da se bo nekoč zgodilo
I also believe in fun	Verjamem tudi v zabavo
But there was no need to do that.	Vendar tega ni bilo treba storiti.
You know.	Ti veš.
I didn't see anything anymore	Ničesar nisem več videl
That didn't work.	To ni uspelo.
I could never actually do that	Tega pravzaprav nikoli ne bi mogel narediti
And he never lost that.	In tega ni nikoli izgubil.
I hope everything is fine	Upam, da bo vse v redu
I don't want to say	ne bi rad rekel
He's never here.	Nikoli ni tukaj.
To be human.	Biti človek.
I just have to get out	Samo ven moram
Because not much happened.	Ker se ni zgodilo kar nekaj.
He tells me we have to go.	Pravi mi, da moramo iti.
I am very glad that you all succeeded	Zelo sem vesel, da vam je vsem uspelo
I couldn't do this without you	Brez tebe tega ne bi mogel narediti
I just wanted to go out for a while	Samo nekaj časa sem hotel iti ven
That's not even a problem.	To niti ni problem.
As of today, this is no longer possible.	Od danes naprej to ni več mogoče.
Probably from this morning.	Verjetno od danes zjutraj.
His father wouldn't let him.	Oče mu ni dovolil.
It was very hard to believe her	Zelo težko ji je bilo verjeti
It was there.	Tam je bilo.
I made it myself.	Naredil sem ga sam.
But even that is not happening.	A tudi to se ne dogaja.
I don't understand, really.	Ne razumem, res.
I had to see her this morning	Danes zjutraj sem jo moral videti
Any father would be.	Vsak oče bi bil.
If not, there is nothing.	Če ni, ni nič.
I don't understand you anymore.	ne razumem te več.
I know enough people to know that	Poznam dovolj ljudi, da to vem
I have nothing to tell you, nothing and neither.	Nimam vam kaj povedati, nič in tudi ne.
There was little time for anything else.	Za kaj drugega je bilo malo časa.
I don’t know what else it could be.	Ne vem, kaj bi še lahko bilo.
I could see it all again	Vse sem lahko še enkrat videl
Maybe not even then.	Mogoče niti takrat ne.
He needs so much help.	Toliko potrebuje pomoč.
I can’t believe this is happening again	Ne morem verjeti, da se to spet dogaja
To understand her.	Da jo razumem.
Now nothing again.	Zdaj spet nič.
A friend for his work.	Prijatelj za svoje delo.
Nobody has.	Nihče nima.
To.	Da bi.
i would be angry too	tudi jaz bi bil jezen
It wasn't very nice.	Ni bilo zelo lepo.
I have to do it my way.	Moram narediti na svoj način.
You know, you know.	Veš, veš.
It feels good that way.	Na ta način se dobro počuti.
No one here is willing to help.	Nihče tukaj ni pripravljen pomagati.
You're right there.	Prav tam si.
Not angry at all.	Prav nič jezen.
I couldn't do it.	Ne bi mogel storiti.
I can't do anything on my own	Sama ne morem nič
It didn’t seem right to me to decide for myself	Ni se mi zdelo prav, da sem se odločil sam
This is very, very unlikely.	To je zelo, zelo malo verjetno.
That's why he came back.	Zato se je vrnil.
More and more people are out of work.	Vse več ljudi je brez dela.
I went back to the house.	Šla sem nazaj v hišo.
I mean, that's obvious	Mislim, to je očitno
No no.	Ne, ne.
As if they didn't know it.	Kot da tega ne bi vedeli.
I still wonder about that.	Še vedno se sprašujem o tem.
He will be very happy to hear that you are not.	Zelo bo vesel, ko bo slišal, da niste.
Or maybe a friend.	Ali pa morda prijatelj.
And your money.	In tvoj denar.
Someone was still waiting.	Nekdo je še vedno čakal.
I didn't need any of that	Nič od tega nisem potreboval
But that was not the only reason.	A to ni bil edini razlog.
Now back to me.	Zdaj pa nazaj k meni.
They did that for me too.	To so naredili tudi zame.
I didn’t know who he was at the time.	Takrat nisem vedel, kdo je.
Do it.	Naredi to.
I didn't even hear him speak	Sploh ga nisem slišal govoriti
I like the way things are now.	Všeč mi je, kako so stvari zdaj.
There was no question if that would happen.	Ni bilo vprašanje, če se bo to zgodilo.
I never go out with him	Nikoli ne grem ven z njim
She often did.	Pogosto je to storila.
I haven't seen you here yet	Še nisem te videl tukaj
I think we'll have to see	Mislim, da bomo morali videti
I completely forgot	Popolnoma sem pozabil
I would help him.	Pomagal bi mu.
I never saw him again.	Nikoli več ga nisem videl.
You have it too.	Tudi ti ga imaš.
I didn't see who he was	Nisem videl, kdo je bil
He wouldn't tell me what was going on.	Ni mi hotel povedati, kaj se dogaja.
I didn't want to talk	Nisem hotel govoriti
I know it might be hard to believe	Vem, da bo morda težko verjeti
If not, fine.	Če ni, v redu.
However, it is not.	Pa vendar ni.
He told me about it.	O tem mi je povedal.
I couldn't	ne bi mogel
I don't know why not.	Ne vem zakaj ne.
I was sure we would not succeed	Prepričan sem bil, da nam ne bo uspelo
I would do anything, he said.	Vse bi naredil, je rekel.
You have to do these.	Te moraš narediti.
Maybe you can.	Mogoče lahko.
I feel good.	Dobro se počutim.
He said he would.	Rekel je, da bo.
is	je
I want to say it again	Želim še enkrat povedati
It's much better.	Je veliko bolje.
That was the problem.	To je bil problem.
I never wanted to do that.	Tega nisem nikoli hotel narediti.
I want you to like it here	Želim, da ti je tukaj všeč
You know where we have to go.	Veš, kam moramo iti.
Someone told me that the day before	Nekdo mi je to povedal prejšnji dan
I think he did.	Mislim, da je to počel.
I wish it was time for everything to be okay	Želim si, da bi bil čas, da bi bilo vse v redu
I never wanted to be a father	Nikoli nisem hotel biti oče
I was still very angry	Še vedno sem bil zelo jezen
I knew I could and would do it	Vedel sem, da lahko in bo to storil
We all have our likes and dislikes.	Vsi imamo stvari, ki so nam všeč in ne.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
And now I would expect him to know everything.	In zdaj bi pričakoval, da bo vedel vse.
But they were lucky.	Vendar so imeli srečo.
You should stay on this.	Moral bi ostati na tem.
I don’t even need him to love me	Sploh ne potrebujem, da bi me imel rad
He did nothing wrong.	Nič ni storil narobe.
He knew when he had done too much.	Vedel je, kdaj je naredil preveč.
He certainly didn't need to tell anyone now.	Zdaj mu zagotovo ni bilo treba nikomur povedati.
That's why we have.	Zato imamo.
I had to do it myself	To sem moral narediti sam
I'm sorry it happened.	Žal mi je, da se je zgodilo.
And they are still a problem.	In še vedno so problem.
And so he said nothing.	In tako ni rekel nič.
I understand everything	vse razumem
I always wanted to know	Vedno sem želel vedeti
Fortunately, there is a better one.	Na srečo obstaja boljši.
I hope we succeeded.	Upam, da nam je uspelo.
I really like them very much.	Res so mi zelo všeč.
No one spoke.	Nihče ni govoril.
I understand what he meant	Razumem, kaj je mislil
There is so much of it.	Toliko je tega.
I just need some time	Potrebujem le nekaj časa
He's been gone for a long time.	Že dolgo ga ni bilo.
Not only.	Ne samo.
And they knew.	In vedeli so.
But I had a lot of work to do tonight	Nocoj pa sem imel veliko dela
Will probably be back to get more.	Verjetno se bo vrnil, da bo dobil več.
Maybe I should go here.	Morda bi odšel tukaj.
And we're not there yet.	A še nismo tam.
I have school tomorrow	Jutri imam šolo
However, there are many of them and more every day.	Vendar jih je veliko in vsak dan več.
But they had to eat.	Vendar so morali jesti.
I have decided	Odločil sem se
But we knew we had to.	Vendar smo vedeli, da moramo.
I didn’t know what was going on.	Nisem vedel, kaj se dogaja.
I've been here before	Tukaj sem že bil
Here is the reason.	Tukaj je razlog.
And that's not even a reason.	In to niti ni razlog.
But now I really have to go	Zdaj pa res moram iti
I knew what needed to be done.	Vedel sem, kaj je treba narediti.
I want to go with you	Želim oditi s tabo
I don't know why you thought that.	Ne vem zakaj si tako mislil.
I did this once.	To sem naredil enkrat.
You know.	Saj veš.
I think this would be the first time	Mislim, da bi bilo to prvič
What is not, is not.	Kar ni, ni.
Tell you more.	Povedati ti še več.
I didn't know you heard	Nisem vedel, da si slišal
I don't know about that.	ne vem o tem.
I said you can't.	Rekel sem, da ne moreš.
All because of me.	Vse zaradi mene.
I wish I could stay	Želim si, da bi ostal
That could be it too.	To bi lahko bilo tudi to.
I can't help her.	Ne morem ji pomagati.
It was big.	Bilo je veliko.
I doubt he'll be back	Dvomim, da se bo vrnil
I didn't leave right away.	Nisem takoj odšel.
I fully understand that.	To popolnoma razumem.
I couldn’t tell how many there were	Nisem mogel povedati, koliko jih je bilo
We may have to see him someday.	Morda ga bomo morali kdaj videti.
I needed them.	Potreboval sem jih.
There was nothing for me to do.	Nič mi ni bilo za narediti.
How good is that?	Kako dobro je to?
It's too simple.	To je preveč preprosto.
This can be done and can be done very well.	To je mogoče narediti in lahko se naredi zelo dobro.
It's obviously wrong.	Očitno je narobe.
Without money.	Brez denarja.
He'll think he doesn't want to talk to him.	Mislil bo, da noče govoriti z njim.
I can't believe what's going on	Ne morem verjeti, kaj se dogaja
It’s actually very nice.	Pravzaprav je zelo lepo.
I've never seen that before	Tega še nikoli nisem videl
Maybe I just need to see her	Morda jo moram samo videti
I wouldn't do that.	Ne bi naredil.
I'm afraid not much	Bojim se, da ni veliko
I had to stay that way	Moral sem ostati tako
And the reason for that is this.	In razlog za to je ta.
I thought he was right	Mislil sem, da ima prav
Or almost nothing.	Ali skoraj nič.
I can't even believe it.	To niti ne morem verjeti.
You have to move on.	Moraš iti naprej.
Should not	Ne bi smel
I would be at home.	Bil bi doma.
I didn’t know it happened	Nisem vedel, da se je to zgodilo
Everything happens.	Vse se dogaja.
Maybe he wasn't even sure.	Mogoče sploh ni bil prepričan.
I am a.	jaz sem a.
We know that now.	Zdaj to vemo.
He has to go out.	Mora iti ven.
You were very, very happy about that.	Bil si zelo, zelo vesel tega.
It will get better.	Bo bolje.
I just had a question	Imel sem samo vprašanje
Maybe he's doing it wrong.	Morda dela narobe.
Obviously this is not the case.	Očitno temu ni tako.
I decided not to tell anyone	Odločil sem se, da ne bom nikomur povedal
I would like to see you tomorrow if possible	Rad bi se videl jutri, če je mogoče
I didn’t even think it was possible	Sploh si nisem mislil, da je to mogoče
I expected more from you	Od tebe sem pričakoval več
That's what he told me.	Tako mi je rekel.
Until this morning.	Do danes zjutraj.
I knew that right away	To sem takoj vedel
I wanted to know what was going on	Hotel sem vedeti, kaj se dogaja
No, you didn't.	Ne, nisi.
I loved my father.	Všeč mi je bil oče.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
I left immediately.	Takoj sem šel.
Everyday.	Vsak dan.
This is a good life.	To je dobro življenje.
And money too.	In denar tudi.
I have to see him.	Moram ga videti.
I need to talk to him	Moram govoriti z njim
It will never be again.	Nikoli več ne bo.
I doubt he will ever return	Dvomim, da se bo kdaj vrnil
It used to be.	Včasih je bilo.
She said maybe she should both.	Rekla je, da bi morda morala oba.
Did any of us think that would be the case.	Je kdo od nas mislil, da bo tako.
I love how it feels	Všeč mi je, kako se počuti
I'm glad it's you.	Vesel sem, da si to ti.
I wasn’t yet sure what would happen after that	Nisem še bil prepričan, kaj se bo zgodilo po tem
And what do you think?	In kaj mislite?
I should help you sooner	Moral bi ti pomagati prej
I haven't seen him like that	Nisem ga videl takega
I just did that and moved on.	Pravkar sem to naredil in šel naprej.
I didn't expect you so early	Nisem te pričakoval tako zgodaj
But they didn't have time.	A niso imeli časa.
Just say when and where.	Samo povej kdaj in kje.
I could do that.	To bi lahko naredil.
If so, do something.	Če je tako, naredi nekaj.
The reason is that he has done this before.	Razlog je v tem, da je to storil že prej.
He didn't leave because of me.	Ni odšel zaradi mene.
That worked.	To je uspelo.
I want to be there when you are.	Rad bi bil tam, ko boš.
I haven't seen her in a while.	Že nekaj časa je nisem videl.
I don't want anything else	Ne želim ničesar drugega
I almost didn't	skoraj nisem
I couldn't do more.	Več nisem mogel narediti.
And it is even more common.	In še bolj pogosto je.
I wanted to know what he knew.	Želel sem vedeti, kaj on ve.
I like that about it.	Všeč mi je to pri tem.
I didn’t have to say too much	Ni mi bilo treba povedati preveč
I understand better than you know	Razumem bolje kot ti veš
I couldn't reach you	Nisem mogel priti do tebe
It exists just because it exists.	Obstaja samo zato, ker obstaja.
I went back and forth and back again	Šel sem naprej in nazaj in spet nazaj
But I knew he was right	Vedel sem pa, da ima prav
I still don't understand him	Še vedno ga ne razumem
He left again.	Spet je odšel.
If not, fine.	Če ne, v redu.
Happened to me too.	Zgodilo se je tudi meni.
he asked himself.	se je vprašal.
She has never looked better.	Nikoli ni bila videti bolje.
I won't have to.	Ne bo mi treba.
I know.	Vem.
It was fast.	Bilo je hitro.

I wanted to tell you	hotel sem ti povedati
As a father should.	Kot bi oče moral.
I saw her this afternoon	Videl sem jo danes popoldne

I'm moving on.	grem naprej.
Because there was nothing to see.	Ker ni bilo kaj videti.

He was just like me.	Bil je tako kot jaz.
I think life is good	Mislim, da je življenje dobro

I knew you would find him	Vedel sem, da ga boš našel
Not often, but the opportunity exists.	Ne pogosto, a priložnost obstaja.
But I don't understand why you wouldn't tell me	Ne razumem pa, zakaj mi ne bi povedal

He started back.	Začel je nazaj.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ni.
I would get nothing.	Nič ne bi dobil.
I couldn't believe it	Tega nisem mogel verjeti

And now he has learned.	In zdaj se je naučil.
I thought he was going to be angry	Mislil sem, da bo jezen

I have a good reason for that	Za to imam dober razlog
That's the way it has to be.	Tako mora biti.
Which they are not.	Kar pa niso.
I wish there was someone else	Želim si, da bi bil še kdo

That's what I thought.	To sem mislil.
That was enough for her.	To ji je bilo dovolj.
I just know he did it	Vem samo, da je to storil

Just something.	Samo nekaj.
We should do something.	Morali bi nekaj narediti.
I really, really am	Res, res sem
It was so long ago.	Bilo je tako dolgo nazaj.

I still haven't said anything	Še vedno nisem rekel nič

Obviously this is not the case.	Očitno temu ni tako.
I knew there was so much more to you	Vedel sem, da je zate še veliko več

I didn't see it that way either	Tudi jaz tega nisem videl tako
There was nothing out of it.	Iz tega ni bilo nič.
You know nothing.	Nič ne veš.
I have some work to do here	Tukaj imam nekaj dela

I forgot earlier when you called	Prej sem pozabil, ko si poklical
This is going to happen completely.	To se bo popolnoma zgodilo.
That would be hard to do	Tega bi težko naredil

That day has not yet come.	Ta dan še ni prišel.
I was always busy, too busy.	Vedno sem bil zaposlen, preveč zaposlen.
I've managed that so far	To mi je uspelo do zdaj
This makes it more likely that someone will find a job.	Zaradi tega je bolj verjetno, da bo nekdo našel delo.
I was there alone.	Tam sem bil sam.
I promised him it would have to be done	Obljubil sem mu, da bo to treba storiti
I need to know something	nekaj moram vedeti
I hope this can help you.	Upam, da vam to lahko pomaga.
This one did.	Ta je naredil.
Money comes and goes.	Denar pride in gre.
She may or may not have children.	Lahko ima otroke, lahko pa tudi ne.
You are not enough.	Nisi dovolj.
She wanted to be alone.	Želela je biti sama.
I was just surprised he played.	Bil sem samo presenečen, da je igral.
I never forgot you	nikoli te nisem pozabil
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
I didn't like it at all	Niti malo mi ni bilo všeč
He decided not to tell her.	Odločil se je, da ji ne bo povedal.

I couldn’t do any of that	Nič od tega nisem mogel storiti
And maybe they were right.	In morda so imeli prav.
I can't believe it's really mine	Ne morem verjeti, da bo res moja
I never had any of that	Nikoli nisem imel ničesar od tega

Tell me what you think.	Povej mi, kaj misliš.
I was never too sure about that.	Nikoli nisem bil preveč prepričan o tem.

I think he's been there a long time	Mislim, da je tam že dolgo
I had it in the morning.	Imel sem ga zjutraj.
What's more, everyone.	Še več, vsi.
I knew this very well since it was at home	To sem zelo dobro vedel, saj je bil to doma
He was just sitting there.	Samo sedel je tam.
He's not coming.	Ne pride.
That made me like her even more	Zaradi tega mi je bila še bolj všeč

I’m glad I made the decision myself.	Vesel sem, da sem se o tem odločil sam.
I would see her again.	Spet bi jo videl.
She had to do something.	Nekaj ​​je morala narediti.
There aren't that many of them.	Ni jih tako veliko.
As if no one really knows.	Kot da res nihče ne ve.

I just had to say	Samo povedati sem moral

But I think it must be hard	Mislim pa, da mora biti težko

I’m going to ask someone where I could get this book.	Nekoga bom vprašal, kje bi lahko dobil to knjigo.

I asked him what he was doing.	Vprašal sem ga, kaj počne.
Good boy.	Dober fant.
I could call him	Lahko bi ga poklical
The reason had nothing to do with it.	Razlog ni imel nič s tem.
I felt a little tired	Počutil sem se malo utrujen
They did that too.	To so tudi storili.
I want to keep telling you	Kar naprej ti želim povedati

I can't believe this guy is me	Ne morem verjeti, da sem ta fant jaz

I wasn't sure where.	Nisem bil prepričan, kje.

I wouldn't want to do that	Tega ne bi želel narediti
You probably know that too.	To verjetno tudi veš.
He said he didn't.	Rekel je, da ni.

It's been a while.	Je že nekaj časa.
This is its own.	To je svoje.
I can't do anything on my own	Sam ne morem nič
And that's okay.	In s tem je v redu.
And he saw me tonight.	In nocoj me je videl.
He did a lot of things right, too.	Veliko stvari je naredil tudi prav.

I also had some work to do	Imel sem tudi nekaj dela
You could, you know	Lahko bi, veš
I called you earlier	Poklical sem te prej
It wasn't me.	To nisem bil jaz.
I will do it again	To bom naredil še enkrat
I had to do it myself	Moral sem to narediti sam
I've been waiting for you for a long time	Dolgo sem te čakal
That helps too.	Tudi to pomaga.
no but yes.	ne ali da.
I know the things you need to know	Vem stvari, ki jih moraš vedeti
It has to be good for something.	Za nekaj mora biti dobro.
I probably won't at all	Verjetno me sploh ne bo
He's not there either.	Tudi njega ni tam.
I haven't had another since.	Od takrat nisem imel drugega.
I mean really see	Mislim res videti
I would tell you what he thinks.	Povedal bi ti, kaj misli.
I didn't want that	Tega si nisem želel
He doesn't even know where they are.	Sploh ne ve, kje so.
Now it seems to be here.	Zdaj se zdi, da je tukaj.
I know that's true	Vem, da je to res
I wouldn't need it.	Ne bi mi bilo treba.
You know how it plays.	Veste, kako se igra.
I've done this before.	To sem storil že prej.
You should be there.	Moral bi biti tam.
I didn't know he was coming either	Tudi jaz nisem vedela, da bo prišel
I really couldn't tell	Res ne bi mogel povedati
I'm glad you're my friend too	Vesel sem, da si tudi ti moj prijatelj
He is very interested.	Zelo zanima.
I can't do it alone	Sama ne morem
And even now.	In še zdaj.
You don’t know how this is going to happen.	Ne veš, kako se bo to zgodilo.
He was good and you were better.	On je bil dober, ti pa boljši.
And they won't.	In ne bodo.
I did something for you	Nekaj ​​sem naredil zate
I loved it when it happened	Všeč mi je bilo, ko se je to zgodilo
He's having a good time.	Ima se lepo.
I'm good at it.	jaz sem dober v tem.
I know something is going on	Vem, da se nekaj dogaja
And someone will do just that.	In nekdo bo storil prav to.
I didn't ask for any of that	Nič od tega nisem prosil
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
I know about these things	Vem za te stvari
I didn't mean to tell you	Nisem ti hotel povedati
It probably will too.	Verjetno bo tudi.
I don't understand why	Ne razumem pa zakaj
I think you're going to have to do it for tonight.	Mislim, da boš moral narediti za nocoj.
I can't tell you more now	Več vam zdaj ne morem povedati
I don't know many people.	Ne poznam veliko ljudi.
He simply died.	Preprosto je umrl.
I’m not sure if that’s still the case.	Nisem prepričan, če je še vedno tako.
I've heard the party before	Zabavo sem že slišal
I don't want that.	jaz tega nočem.
He can do that.	To lahko stori.
It was so beautiful.	Tako je bilo lepo.
I sat and expected him to sit.	Sedel sem in pričakoval, da bo sedel.
There was no one there for some time.	Tam že nekaj časa ni bilo nikogar.
I said yes, we really were	Rekel sem, da, res smo bili
That's how it was, for sure.	Tako je bilo, zagotovo.
Maybe he wasn't as alone as he thought.	Morda ni bil tako sam, kot je mislil.
Like it's not tomorrow.	Kot da jutri ni.
You have to say something about it.	Nekaj ​​moraš povedati o tem.
I just know who he is	Samo vem, kdo je
I could get a job here.	Lahko bi dobil službo tukaj.
I knew you would	Vedel sem, da boš
He did what he had to do.	Naredil je, kar je moral narediti.
I will not.	ne bom.
Apparently we know everything.	Očitno vemo vse.
More next week.	Več naslednji teden.
I knew you didn't want that either	Vedel sem, da tudi tega ne želiš
Apparently you didn't find them.	Očitno jih nisi našel.
Now I see what he thinks	Zdaj vidim, kaj misli
I didn’t know what to do with it	Nisem vedel, kaj naj s tem
I didn't do that for me	Tega nisem naredil zame
I've done this before.	To sem naredil že prej.
I could see she was really sorry.	Videl sem, da ji je res žal.
He wished he was alone.	Želel si je, da bi bil sam.
That must be enough	Mora biti dovolj
We are much more now.	Zdaj smo veliko več.
I am no longer a child	Nisem več otrok
I didn't even know he was here for a while	Nekaj ​​časa sploh nisem vedel, da je tukaj
i'm just a.	jaz sem samo a.
I’m not going to go back and forth with this	Ne bom šel naprej in nazaj s tem
I'd be pissed too.	Tudi jaz bi bil jezen.
You don't really need that.	Tega človek pravzaprav ne potrebuje.
I didn't have to tell her where to go	Ni mi bilo treba ji povedati, kam naj gre
He knows he said too much.	Ve, da je rekel preveč.
Just like we did.	Tako, kot smo to storili.
It's just me.	To sem samo jaz.
I almost made it	To mi je skoraj uspelo
And nothing more.	In nič ni več.
But I don't believe that	Tega pa ne verjamem
That is a lot.	To je veliko.
Because she really wanted to.	Ker si je res želela.
I used to be too	Tudi jaz sem bil kdaj
I understand, also angry	Razumem, tudi jezen
Maybe I could find someone who knows me	Mogoče bi našel nekoga, ki me pozna
Which is true, you can.	Kar je res, lahko.
He decided to stay here.	Odločil se je ostati tukaj.
Tell me they're here.	Povej mi, da so tukaj.
Sometimes this is the case.	Včasih je temu tako.
She obviously knew.	Očitno je vedela.
It wasn't just me either.	Tudi nisem bil samo jaz.
I was just a kid.	Bil sem samo otrok.
But not anymore.	Vendar ne več.
However, this is not the case here.	Vendar tukaj ni tako.
You said so yourself.	Sam si tako rekel.
That's how he knew he'd be here.	Tako je vedel, da bo tukaj.
I will do everything.	naredil bom vse.
I haven't heard anything about it	Nič nisem slišal o tem
I'm not home anymore.	Ni mi več doma.
I heard them talk about it	Slišal sem jih govoriti o tem
However, it seems that was not the case.	Vendar se zdi, da ni bilo tako.
It just didn’t seem right to me.	Preprosto se mi ni zdelo prav.
Tell me a little about it.	Povej mi malo o tem.
This is life here.	To je življenje tukaj.
It doesn't help.	Ne pomaga.
I know what you told him	Vem, kaj si mu rekel
He was happy with that.	S tem je bil vesel.
I wouldn't expect anything else!	Nič drugega ne bi pričakoval!
I hope it continues to be good !.	Upam, da bo še naprej dobro!.
Go ahead, you know you want to.	Kar naprej, saj veš, da si želiš.
He said he has been gone since then.	Rekel je, da od takrat ni več.
Where is he ?.	Kje je on?.
I'm all for it too.	Tudi jaz sem za to.
I mean, we have to work together every day	Mislim, vsak dan moramo delati skupaj
That's not right.	To ni prav.
I always knew that	Vedno sem vedel za to
I've had enough of all that.	Vsega tega imam dovolj.
No, it's more than that.	Ne, več kot to je.
No one would do that here.	Tukaj tega ne bi storil nihče.
No one wanted to.	Nihče ni hotel.
I’ve never felt this way about anyone else	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil do nikogar drugega
That's what he wanted.	To si je želel.
And they weren't.	In niso bili.
No one told her.	Nihče ji ni povedal.
I wanted to know how it was	Hotel sem vedeti, kako je bilo
You will love it.	Všeč vam bo.
I couldn't get into it.	Nisem mogel priti v to.
I don't need that thing	Ne potrebujem te stvari
Everyone will know.	Vsi bodo vedeli.
It won't.	Ne bo.
I want you, you're mine	Želim te, moj si
We are better than that.	Boljši smo od tega.
I only need a few days	Potrebujem le nekaj dni
I really like how nice it all looks	Res mi je všeč, kako lepo je vse videti
She knew what was going on.	Vedela je, kaj se dogaja.
I never expected to be that lucky	Nikoli nisem pričakoval, da bom imel to srečo
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
He wants to talk to you about it.	Želi govoriti s tabo o tem.
I asked him if he was a father	Vprašal sem ga, če je oče
We could have that here.	To bi lahko imeli tukaj.
Maybe she said something.	Mogoče je kaj rekla.
This has never happened to me before.	To se mi še nikoli ni zgodilo.
I think everyone should know better	Mislim, da bi morali vsi vedeti bolje
I am yours as much as you are mine	Tvoj sem toliko, kot si ti moj
I couldn't do it without you	Brez tebe ne bi mogel
You win, okay.	Zmagal si, v redu.
I need to know that.	To moram vedeti.
They don't care how or where.	Ne zanima jih kako in kje.
It's not a game anymore.	To ni več igra.
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
I used to know it was	Nekoč sem vedel, da je
I really don't know.	Res ne vem.
It wasn't big enough.	Ni bilo dovolj veliko.
You thought.	Si mislil .
It's not just me.	To nisem samo jaz.
I wanted things my way	Želel sem stvari po svoje
I was a.	Jaz sem bil.
I couldn't believe it	Nisem mogel verjeti
But he did not know.	Vendar ni vedel.
But you.	Ali ti.
I need a job.	Potrebujem službo.
They knew that.	To so vedeli.
That was fine with him.	To je bilo v redu z njim.
I wasn't sure it would always be like this.	Nisem bil prepričan, da bo vedno tako.
Maybe it's good.	Mogoče je dobro.
I decided to go to my room	Odločil sem se, da grem v svojo sobo
But it is also something else.	Je pa tudi nekaj drugega.
But that was all.	Vendar je bilo vse.
This can be done as follows.	To je mogoče storiti na naslednji način.
I think it is very, very likely.	Mislim, da je zelo, zelo verjetno.
Not wrong.	Ni narobe.
If you want to stay here.	Če želiš ostati tukaj.
Car.	Avto.
I knew that right away	To sem takoj vedel
I want to help you get there.	Rad bi ti pomagal priti tja.
You gave me a reason to live.	Dal si mi razlog za življenje.
That's what I told him.	Tako sem mu rekel.
That's good, very good.	To je dobro, zelo dobro.
That would be something.	To bi bilo nekaj.
But something else happened.	A zgodilo se je nekaj drugega.
That's what I did.	Tako sem naredil.
I didn't get anything there.	Tam nisem dobil ničesar.
And yet he didn't do it.	Pa vendar tega ni storil.
I was convinced of that	V to sem bil prepričan
Which you had to be.	Kar si moral biti.
I have nothing more to say	Nimam več kaj povedati
He meant what he said.	Resno je mislil, kar je rekel.
This is only for a while.	To je samo za nekaj časa.
It never happened.	Nikoli se ni zgodilo.
I'll be here with you.	Tukaj bom s tabo.
Just a thing.	Samo stvar.
I would really like that.	To bi si zelo želel.
I wanted more than that	Hotel sem več kot to
It has never been easy for me since then.	Od takrat mi ni bilo nikoli lahko.
You should tell him	Moral bi mu povedati
It just seemed possible.	Zdelo se je le mogoče.
There were more of them.	Bilo jih je več.
I didn't expect it, really	Nisem pričakoval, res
I need to be with him right now.	Takoj moram biti z njim.
There were a few.	Nekaj ​​jih je bilo.
I could say no	Lahko bi rekel ne
You’re sure you knew who he was.	Ste prepričani, da ste vedeli, kdo je bil.
I think everyone has it, so it can’t be	Mislim, da ga ima vsak, tako da ne more biti
Never, she said.	Nikoli ne, je rekla.
But I was already tired	Bil sem pa že utrujen
We knew we couldn’t stay long.	Vedeli smo, da ne moremo ostati dolgo.
I still went with him	Še vedno sem šel z njim
I don’t know why that didn’t happen.	Ne vem zakaj se to ni zgodilo.
I still have school in the morning	Zjutraj imam še šolo
Does it really exist ???.	Ali res obstaja???.
It just didn’t seem right.	Samo ni se zdelo prav.
He was a person.	Bil je oseba.
It will be good.	Dobro bo.
I knew he was afraid he would lose me	Vedela sem, da se boji, da me bo izgubil
It wasn't enough, but we had to do something.	Ni bilo dovolj, vendar smo morali nekaj narediti.
You're going to ask me something.	Nekaj ​​me boš vprašal.
No one spoke to him.	Nihče ni govoril z njim.
I know it's hard	Vem, da je težko
I still haven’t seen who did it	Še vedno nisem videl, kdo je to storil
And no, maybe not.	In ne, morda ne.
She was there for a few days.	Tam je bila nekaj dni.
I think that was too obvious	Mislim, da je bilo to preveč očitno
I shouldn't have seen him	Nisem ga smel videti
That doesn't help.	To ne pomaga.
I immediately saw that he was angry	Takoj sem videl, da je jezen
He's afraid of me.	Boji se zame.
It should be enough for you	Moral bi biti dovolj zate
I have to work tonight	Nocoj moram delati
I think it will be fine	Mislim, da bo v redu
Now I understand that is not the case.	Zdaj razumem, da ni tako.
I won't tell everyone	Ne bom rekel vsem
I want my money to be yours too	Želim, da je tudi moj denar tvoj

You know they will.	Saj veš, da bodo.
I didn’t learn what happened to him	Nisem se naučil, kaj se mu je zgodilo
I feel confident.	Počutim se prepričan.
I stayed with him	Ostal sem z njim

What happened.	Kaj je bilo.
I don’t know why anyone would want this job.	Ne vem, zakaj bi si kdo želel to službo.
I can’t tell you much about it	Ne morem vam povedati veliko o tem
It's like a game.	To je kot igra.
I was glad I didn’t say anything	Vesel sem bil, da nisem ničesar rekel
I am very happy about that.	Zelo sem vesel tega.
That's not right.	To ni prav.

You have it now.	Zdaj ga imaš.
I didn't mean any of that	Nič od tega nisem mislil

I can't talk about that at the moment	O tem trenutno ne morem govoriti

I knew all about it	Za vse to sem vedel

I'm glad he came home.	Vesel sem, da je prišel domov.

I was too then.	Tudi jaz sem takrat.
I keep asking if there is anything else to do	Kar naprej sprašujem, če je še kaj za narediti

I can’t believe he’s doing all this	Ne morem verjeti, da počne vse to
It's too much now.	Zdaj ga je preveč.
I wish I could hear that.	Želim si, da bi to slišal.

But it may not be so.	Morda pa tudi ni tako.
I won't tell you at all	Sploh ti ne bom povedal

I can't see him now.	Zdaj ga ne morem videti.
He's like my father again.	Spet je kot moj oče.
And he's right.	In prav ima.
Neither is that.	Niti to ni to.
It was like being a kid again.	Bilo je, kot bi bil spet otrok.
This is not the time.	To ni pravi čas.

I always wanted to be like my father.	Vedno sem želel biti kot moj oče.
This may or may not be what you want.	To je morda tisto, kar želite ali pa tudi ne.
I didn't ask him anything	Nič ga nisem vprašal
The child had them too.	Tudi otrok jih je imel.

Something tells me he needs or wants something from us.	Nekaj ​​mi govori, da potrebuje ali želi nekaj od nas.

I just went to dinner	Šla sem samo na večerjo
I haven't seen it yet	še nisem videl
I forgot they were still in the room with us	Pozabil sem, da so še vedno v sobi z nami
But I wouldn’t say he’s going to do much here.	Ne bi pa rekel, da bo tukaj naredil veliko.

Better to look with more money	Bolje videti z več denarja

He's in trouble.	Ima težave.
I could do that	To bi lahko naredil

I wish you were here with me	Želim si, da bi bil tukaj z mano
I really didn't expect that	Tega res nisem pričakoval
I could help you	Lahko bi ti pomagal
I’m not sure how he got there.	Nisem prepričan, kako je prišel tja.
I always felt in place	Vedno sem se počutil na mestu
I didn't expect anything	Nič nisem pričakoval
I just didn't want to say anything	Samo ničesar nisem hotel povedati
In fact, it seemed nothing.	Pravzaprav se ni zdelo nič.
It's up to me.	Na meni je.
Not like it is now.	Ne tako kot je zdaj.
And you should too.	In tudi ti bi moral.
I need to see her again	Moram jo spet videti
You haven't met them at all.	Sploh jih nisi srečal.
I told her what had happened to me	Povedal sem ji, kaj se mi je zgodilo
I've never done that before.	Še nikoli tega nisem storil.
I should tell you	Moral bi ti povedati
It's not just this morning.	Ni samo danes zjutraj.
I've never seen her before	Še nikoli je nisem videl
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
Come to me.	Pride do mene.
I hope they help you	Upam, da so vam v pomoč

I didn’t like that he knew where everything was	Ni mi bilo všeč, da je vedel, kje je vse
I see it still is	Vidim, da je še vedno
I see why you did that	Vidim, zakaj si to naredil
I know it wasn't easy for you	Vem, da ti to ni bilo lahko

I just want to be my own	Želim biti samo svoj
I can do this all day with you	To lahko počnem ves dan s tabo
I had to help him.	Moral sem mu pomagati.
That was never an issue.	To nikoli ni bilo vprašanje.
I should say something	Nekaj ​​bi moral povedati
And that seems right.	In to se zdi prav.
I didn't want to talk	Nisem hotel govoriti
Unfortunately, not everyone will do this.	Žal tega ne bodo storili vsi.
Let him be angry.	Naj bo jezen.
He knew how to do things.	Vedel je, kako narediti stvari.
He didn't get them.	Ni jih dobil.
I was glad he still lives there	Vesel sem bil, da še vedno živi tam
I know where they are.	Vem kje so.
I will never know if that happened	Nikoli ne bom vedel, če se je zgodilo tako
I knew this was not going to happen	Vedel sem, da se to ne bo zgodilo

It's just.	Samo je.
I wouldn't get anything.	ne bi dobil ničesar.
I was actually pretty good at it	V tem sem bil pravzaprav kar dober

I could say that.	To bi lahko rekel.
I will do everything for you	Zate bom vse
I think he really loves me	Mislim, da me ima res rad
You like where you are.	Všeč ti je, kje si.
I wouldn't do that.	tega ne bi storil.
Now I'm left alone here	Zdaj sem ostal sam tukaj
You will do anything to have them.	Naredili boste vse, da jih boste imeli.
It's obvious.	Očitno je.
You're right.	Prav imaš.
I can not do it anymore.	Ne morem več.
I did it.	Uspelo mi je.
I didn’t know there was so much of it	Nisem vedel, da je toliko tega
It's all something.	To je vse nekaj.
Maybe you're right.	Mogoče imaš prav.
We're all fine.	Vsi smo v redu.
I didn’t try, but it happened	Nisem poskušal, vendar se je zgodilo
That's what we did.	Tako smo naredili.
He can't, he can't, he can't.	Ne more, ne more, ne more.
I was still too angry	Še vedno sem bil preveč jezen
But there was no one.	Vendar ni bilo nikogar.
I learned a lot.	Naučil sem se veliko.
I didn't think it was me	Nisem si mislil, da sem jaz
No matter how busy he is.	Ne glede na to, kako zaposlen je.
We are doing very well.	Zelo dobro nam gre.

I can't tell you.	ne morem ti povedati.
I was there once too	Tudi jaz sem bil enkrat tam
I know tomorrow morning	Vem jutri zjutraj
There's just more of it.	Samo več ga je.
I already feel much better	Počutim se že veliko bolje
I wouldn't want to do that.	Tega ne bi želel storiti.
I'm not gone now	Zdaj nisem odšel
That's how to go out.	Tako je treba iti ven.
I needed time alone	Potreboval sem čas sam
That just doesn’t seem right.	To se preprosto ne zdi prav.
He knows more than we do.	On ve več kot mi.
I didn’t get much help there	Tam nisem dobil veliko pomoči
I've seen it all	Vse to sem videl

I think he was right	Mislim, da je imel prav

I was angry about that too	Tudi jaz sem bil jezen zaradi tega
I feel much better	Počutim se veliko bolje
I decided he was right	Odločil sem se, da ima prav

He just didn't say that.	Samo tega ni rekel.
I didn’t want or need either	Tudi jaz nisem hotel ali potreboval

It was a little big.	Bilo je malo veliko.
If you do, it will work out quickly.	Če boš, bo hitro uspelo.
I would never do anything to you	Nikoli ti ne bi naredil ničesar
I can't do more than that	Več kot to ne morem
More than problems.	Več kot težave.
Maybe he was a father.	Mogoče je bil oče.

I want to go with you	želim iti s tabo
That was too much.	To je bilo preveč.
I thought it was you	Mislil sem, da si to ti

I had a lot of fun	Imel sem veliko veliko zabavo
I was ready to go home	Bil sem pripravljen iti domov
You need to know.	Moraš vedeti.
I almost died.	skoraj sem umrl.
He just came.	Pravkar je prišel.
He knows nothing.	On nič ne ve.
He wanted more.	Želel je več.
We have .	Imamo  .
I see her.	Vidim jo.
I wonder if he still has them.	Zanima me, ali jih še ima.
In fact, it was a good thing.	Pravzaprav je bila to dobra stvar.
I just want to know what you think	Želim samo vedeti, kaj misliš
You are in place.	Ste na mestu.
You are the one who makes them.	Ti si tisti, ki jih naredi.
And please.	In prosim.
It was hard to know for sure.	Težko je bilo kaj zagotovo vedeti.
It could be.	Bi lahko bilo .
I fully understand that.	To popolnoma razumem.
I can see so much this way.	Toliko lahko vidim na ta način.
I know enough to do that	Vem dovolj, da to storim
I didn't know what it was about	Nisem vedel, za kaj gre
It's like my father is here.	Kot da je moj oče tukaj.
I think we need to see this, believe it	Mislim, da moramo to videti, verjeti
I didn’t know what to think and what to believe	Nisem vedel, kaj naj si mislim in kaj naj verjamem
And it probably was, but you’re the reason for it.	In verjetno je bilo, vendar ste razlog za to.
I know what it is	Vem, kaj je to
I did that too	Tudi to sem naredil
No one learned anything.	Nihče se ni nič naučil.
I hope this was helpful.	Upam, da je bilo to v pomoč.
I knew what would happen next	Vedel sem, kaj se bo zgodilo naprej
Always do this.	Vedno naredi to.
We need to move on here.	Tukaj moramo iti naprej.
I can’t believe this happened	Ne morem verjeti, da se je to zgodilo
I was a kid, you know	Bil sem otrok, veš
I'm so sorry they did that to you	Zelo mi je žal, da so ti to naredili
you do not know.	ne veš.
I hardly saw him	Malo verjetno sem ga videl
I still can't.	še vedno ne morem.
This is a beautiful life.	To je lepo življenje.
Or it will happen.	Ali pa se bo zgodilo.
I did what you wanted.	Storil sem, kar si želel.
That's not much.	To ni veliko.
I was ready for anything	Bil sem pripravljen za vse
I need you with me here	Potrebujem te z mano tukaj
Now I see what he thinks	Zdaj vidim, kaj misli
I know that	Vem pa to
I love you all very much	vse vas imam zelo rad
He told me that.	To mi je povedal.
I don't understand that either	Tudi jaz tega ne razumem
I wonder if that's true	Zanima me, če je to res
I need money today.	Danes potrebujem denar.
He could be.	Lahko bi bil.
Not once did this happen.	Niti enkrat se to ni zgodilo.
Please, he said.	Prosim, je rekel.
I haven't seen him in years	Že leta ga nisem videl
I had to do something right	Moral sem nekaj narediti prav
I felt almost at home	Počutil sem se skoraj kot doma
Tell me.	Povej mi.
I didn't make it either	Niti tega mi ni uspelo
We've had enough of this.	Dovolj imamo tega.
I think he's heard that before.	Mislim, da je to že slišal.
And so she did.	In tako je tudi storila.
I didn’t want to talk about it	Nisem hotel govoriti o tem
I never forgot that	Tega nisem nikoli pozabil
I'm fine with that.	S tem sem v redu.
I don't know who told you that.	Ne vem, kdo ti je to rekel.
I didn't like what she said	Ni mi bilo všeč, kar je rekla
I was a little surprised that they haven’t yet	Malo sem bil presenečen, da še niso
I know it was for me.	Vem, da je bilo zame.
I couldn't see him.	Nisem ga mogel videti.
I asked him why he wanted to know	Vprašal sem ga, zakaj želi vedeti
Now that we know what it is, we have a chance.	Zdaj, ko vemo, kaj je, imamo priložnost.
He heard about it from me.	Za to je slišal od mene.
But one has to believe something.	Človek pa mora nekaj verjeti.
She had to do it.	Morala je to storiti.
I could also say yes	Lahko bi tudi rekel da
I have to do something for myself	Moram nekaj narediti zame
I think it just takes time	Mislim, da potrebuje samo čas
That it is nothing else.	Da ni nič drugega.
Keep going.	Še naprej in naprej.
I did everything myself.	Vse sem naredil sam.
I could go there every day	Lahko bi šel tja vsak dan
I heard that there.	To sem slišal tam.
That made me feel better	Tako sem se počutil bolje
And no, still no money.	In ne, še vedno ni denarja.
We have to leave now.	Zdaj moramo oditi.
I'd like to be here.	Rad bi bil tukaj.
That's right.	Prav je.
But he needed to know more.	Vendar je moral vedeti več.
I did that to myself	To sem si naredil
She liked the boy.	Fant ji je bilo všeč.
He wanted a lot.	Želel je veliko.
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
That's true.	To je res tako.
He doesn't like them.	Ne mara jih.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
I could also tell.	Lahko bi tudi povedal.
I don’t understand why he does that.	Ne razumem, zakaj to počne.
I just wish it was you and me	Želim si samo, da sva ti in jaz
He needed something to work with.	Potreboval je nekaj za delo.
I didn't have to see anymore.	Ni mi bilo treba več videti.
Oh man, if you will hear	O človek, če boš slišal
It used to not be like that.	Včasih ni bilo tako.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
I think this is probably also wrong	Mislim, da je to verjetno prav tako narobe
I mean, it's nice to see you again and you know it	Mislim, lepo te je spet videti in veš
She was here today.	Danes je bila tukaj.
I did it myself	To sem naredil sam
I just didn’t want to be alone all the time	Preprosto nisem hotel biti ves čas sam
If he stayed, he knew what would happen.	Če bi ostal, je vedel, kaj se bo zgodilo.
This is simply wrong.	To je preprosto narobe.
We really were in it.	Res smo bili v tem.
That was enough.	Tega je bilo dovolj.
I will never forget that.	Tega ne bom nikoli pozabil.
He can be busy.	Lahko je zaposlen.
I said he wouldn't.	Rekel sem, da ga ne bo.
I'm a little surprised by that.	Malo sem presenečen nad tem.
Didn't anyone tell me.	Ali mi nihče ni povedal.
I didn’t even know what was going to happen	Sploh nisem vedel, kaj se bo zgodilo
He learned a lot.	Naučil se veliko.
I mean, we're fine together	Mislim, dobro nam je skupaj
I have a reason.	jaz imam razlog.
I still do that.	To še vedno počnem.
I've been for quite some time	Sem že kar nekaj časa
I understand why you want to do it this way	Razumem, zakaj želiš to narediti na ta način
He gave him everything he had.	Dal mu je vse, kar je imel.
I mean, more than usual	Mislim, bolj kot običajno
Lots and lots of them.	Veliko in veliko jih.
I know you'll like it	Vem, da ti bo všeč
I know her very well.	Poznam jo zelo dobro.
That's what she said.	To je rekla.
I knew something was going to happen	Vedel sem, da se bo nekaj zgodilo
They are not supposed to do that.	Tega naj ne bi storili.
He wasn't sure himself.	Sam ni bil prepričan.
I haven't been in three days	Ni me že tri dni
That was not good.	To ni bilo dobro.
I know everything.	poznam vse.
I wish it was really fast	Želim si, da bi bilo res hitro
I thought you knew your stuff	Mislil sem, da veš svoje stvari
I was there the next day	Tam sem bil naslednji dan
And she knew he meant well.	In vedela je, da misli dobro.
I want to talk about it	želim govoriti o tem
In fact, this happens quite often.	Pravzaprav se to dogaja precej pogosto.
He really was.	Res je bil.
And she said yes.	In rekla je da.
No, that was not possible.	Ne, to ni bilo mogoče.
I want to be ready for anything	Želim biti pripravljen na vse
And that's exactly what happened.	In prav to se je zgodilo.
And he couldn't go back.	In ni mogel nazaj.
It will be there.	Tam bo.
Because I wouldn't.	Ker ne bi.
She didn't know.	Ni vedela.
I asked for it	Prosil sem za to
Everything.	Vse.
It makes me feel better.	Zaradi tega se počutim bolje.
I hope it looks better.	Upam, da bo videti bolje.
I was really good at this	V tem sem bil res dober
I knew like a book.	Vedel sem kot knjigo.
You didn't ask yourself.	Sam nisi vprašal.
He saw things he shouldn’t have seen.	Videl je stvari, ki jih ne bi smel videti.
None of this is true.	Nič od tega ni res.
I knew nothing about it	Nič nisem vedel o tem
He can't tell us.	Ne more nam povedati.
I won't have it.	Ne bom ga imel.
Now I went on	Zdaj sem šel naprej
But it's good.	Je pa dobro.
Everything is too simple.	Vse je preveč preprosto.
I can't tell anyone about this	O tem ne morem nikomur povedati
I have both.	Jaz imam oba.
I really don't know why.	res ne vem zakaj.
So willing to believe.	Tako pripravljen verjeti.
I would never meet you	Nikoli te ne bi srečal
I learned that once	To sem se enkrat že naučil
That he will do it.	Da bo to naredil.
I told her to move on	Rekel sem ji, naj gre naprej
I didn’t know what to think or do	Nisem vedel, kaj naj si mislim ali storim
I want to be with you	Želim biti s tabo
He's not here.	Ni ga tukaj.
Perhaps he had.	Morda je imel.
I would have done it sooner	To bi storil prej
He said nothing.	Nič ni rekel.
What you did is right.	Kar ste storili, je prav.
I am not alone in this	V tem nisem sam
Either way, I couldn’t get to work	Tako ali tako nisem mogel priti v službo
He was not here.	Tukaj ga ni bilo.
That's because.	To je zato, ker.
All right, we're fine.	V redu, v redu smo.
You should tell him.	Moral bi mu povedati.
It was a long time ago.	Bilo je že dolgo nazaj.
And yet you saw.	In vendar ste videli.
I've known him for several years	Poznam ga že nekaj let
I had to be there then	Takrat sem moral biti tam
I couldn't talk to him anymore	Nisem mogel več govoriti z njim
That's my problem, not yours.	To je moj problem, ne tvoj.
I didn't want to go without you	Nisem hotel iti brez tebe
I can understand that	To lahko razumem
I would see things you couldn't	Videl bi stvari, ki jih ti ne bi mogel
I can’t say much without seeing it.	Ne morem povedati veliko, ne da bi videl.
More likely he didn't hear.	Bolj verjetno, da ni slišal.
I understand.	Razumem.
I could do without it	Lahko bi naredil brez tega
I didn't hear anyone	Nikogar nisem slišal
It's not about that.	Ne gre za to.
Always, you know	Vedno, veš
I didn’t expect to see him again	Nisem pričakoval, da ga bom spet videl
I learned, never again	Naučil sem se, tega nikoli več
He still has work to do.	Še vedno ima dela.
No one has done that yet.	Nihče tega še ni storil.
I was very busy	Bil sem zelo zaposlen
He left it to us.	Pustil nam je to.
No they are not.	Ne niso.
I want him to know everything about me	Želim, da ve vse o meni
I knew it would be good to come here	Vedel sem, da bi bilo dobro priti sem
It makes me feel so much better.	Zaradi tega se počutim veliko bolje.
Maybe they never are.	Mogoče jih nikoli ni.
I wonder what else he knows	Sprašujem se, kaj še ve
I hope everything is allright	upam, da je vse v redu
I told her what happened to you	Povedal sem ji, kaj se ti je zgodilo
I did everything I could.	Naredil sem vse, kar je bilo mogoče.
She had to do it herself.	To je morala narediti sama.
I always have time for you	Vedno imam čas zate
Everything was like that.	Vse je bilo tako.
I sometimes.	Jaz včasih.
I've always had it	Vedno sem jo imel
It seemed good enough.	Zdelo se je dovolj dobro.
Everything is fine with him.	Z njim je vse v redu.
I suspect she wanted more out of it	Sumim, da je od tega želela več
And no one did that either.	In tudi tega ni storil nihče.
I just had to make sure	Moral sem se samo prepričati
I would never do that	Nikoli tega ne bi storil
What would I do at all.	Kaj bi sploh naredil.
I knew you'd be here	Vedel sem, da boš tukaj
I just needed something else, something else.	Potreboval sem le nekaj drugega, nekaj drugega.
It is increasingly likely to be seen.	Vse bolj verjetno je videti.
That was simple.	To je bilo preprosto.
It may go, it may not.	Morda bo šla, morda ne.
But I never was	Nikoli pa nisem bil
And my question is.	In moje vprašanje je.
Something like this is going to happen.	Kaj takega se bo zgodilo.
I was no longer happy	Nisem bil več vesel
We never got it right.	Nikoli nam ni uspelo prav.
I don't see them.	ne vidim jih.
I am all that it was	Jaz sem vse kar je bilo
I didn't want to tell him	Nisem mu hotel povedati
I will not say anything else	Ne bom rekel nič drugega
But you should do it.	Vendar bi morali storiti.
Did he know? 	Ali je vedel?
I wanted to do something for you	Hotel sem narediti nekaj zate
I think we'll see.	Mislim, da bomo videli.
About what really happened.	O tem, kaj se je res zgodilo.
I couldn't see anyone else but him	Nikogar drugega nisem mogel videti, samo njega
I didn’t even know what it was	Sploh nisem vedel, kaj je to
He didn't ask her what it was for.	Ni je vprašal, za kaj je to.
I don't want them anymore	Ne želim si jih več
And so we should.	In tako bi morali.
I wish he could speak for me now.	Želim si, da bi zdaj lahko govoril zame.
I really liked it.	Prav všeč mi je bilo.
I only got them for you	Dobil sem jih samo zate
I didn't want to do that.	Nisem hotel tega storiti.
I heard everything in that room	Vse sem slišal v tisti sobi
All nice and right.	Vse lepo in prav.
And I saw where he lived.	In videl sem, kje živi.
but I will help you	pa ti bom pomagal
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
And is.	In je.
I will be here no matter what	Ne glede na vse bom tukaj
There is talk.	Govori se .
There must be something else.	Nekaj ​​drugega mora biti.
I would go alone.	Sam bi šel.
What about Fr.	Kaj pa o.
I want to be your friend too	Tudi jaz želim biti tvoj prijatelj
I think she liked you	Mislim, da si ji bila všeč
What to do?.	Kaj storiti?.
We can't go out.	Ne moremo iti ven.
I'll just go call her	Samo šel jo bom poklical
No one really did.	Nihče res ni storil.
I've never done that before	Tega še nikoli nisem storil
I never got to know her well	Nikoli je nisem dobro spoznal
No one is ever right or wrong.	Nihče nima nikoli prav ali narobe.
And she knew.	In vedela je.
Who is it.	Ko to.
I said it was hard for me	Rekel sem, da mi je bilo težko
It wasn't much.	Ni bilo veliko.
I will never give it to you	Nikoli ti ga ne bom dal
We're still at it.	Še vedno smo pri tem.
I never did that again	Nikoli več tega nisem storil
I tried to talk to him.	Poskušal sem govoriti z njim.
But he was no longer the man who left.	Vendar ni bil več človek, ki je odšel.
I would never go out, I would never come home.	Nikoli ne bi šel ven, nikoli ne bi prišel domov.
He said a few things.	Govoril je nekaj stvari.
I'm sure yours isn't.	Prepričan sem, da tvoj ni.
I didn't play well.	Nisem dobro igral.
But it wasn't like that.	Vendar ni bilo tako.
No one came home.	Nihče ni prišel domov.
I don't know who my father is	Ne vem, kdo je moj oče
I'm doing well.	Dobro mi gre.
I want to do it this way	Želim to narediti na ta način
I believe this is a good thing.	Verjamem, da je to dobra stvar.
You should be like me.	Moral bi biti kot jaz.
I'm surprised to see you	Presenečen sem, ko te vidim
It is for us and about us.	Je za nas in o nas.
Even when you are.	Tudi ko si.
Not for the money.	Ne zaradi denarja.
It's not mine.	To ni moje.
I'll sit on it.	Sedel bom na tem.
He always won.	Vedno je zmagal.
Much better than me.	Veliko boljši od mene.
And we can't do that.	In tega ne moremo storiti.
I mean, I would never be a teacher	Mislim, nikoli ne bi bil učitelj
This is not the case here.	Tukaj ni tako.
I just need something	Samo nekaj potrebujem
This is much simpler.	To je veliko bolj preprosto.
If we weren’t, we would be today.	Če ne bi bili, bi bili danes.
It's okay, she'll be fine.	Ni kaj, dobro ji bo.
It was very good for us.	Bilo nam je zelo dobro.
I forgot what was right and what was wrong	Pozabil sem, kaj je prav in kaj narobe
And very soon.	In zelo kmalu.
They saw, but they did not see.	Videli so, pa niso videli.
I still believe in it.	Še vedno verjamem v to.
I still can’t believe he did that	Še vedno ne morem verjeti, da je to storil
That was more than enough for you.	To je bilo več kot dovolj za vas.
I don't know what happened.	Ne vem, kaj se je zgodilo.
I wished I wouldn’t	Želel sem si, da ne bi
Now, however, this does not seem to be the case.	Zdaj pa se zdi, da temu ni tako.
You might be lucky.	Morda imaš srečo.
I hope there is nothing wrong with me	Upam, da ni nič narobe z mano
All she had to do was get there.	Vse, kar je morala storiti, je bilo, da pride tja.
I think it makes you feel better	Mislim, da se zaradi tega počuti bolje
I just realized something	Pravkar sem spoznal nekaj
I have a job for you.	Za vas imam delo.
She didn't like something.	Nekaj ​​ji ni bilo všeč.
He asked her for help.	Prosil jo je za pomoč.
He is your father.	On je tvoj oče.
But no, no, no.	Ali ne, ne, ne.
I wouldn’t think that would be possible	Ne bi si mislil, da bi bilo to mogoče
But we have to go.	Vendar moramo oditi.
Or maybe them.	Ali pa jih morda.
Dad did it all the time and never learned.	Oče je to počel ves čas in nikoli se ni naučil.
I understand that.	Razumem, da.
And that must be me.	In ta moram biti jaz.
Now they both knew.	Zdaj sta oba vedela.
I believe it doesn't work.	Verjamem, da ne dela.
It just doesn't work.	Preprosto ne gre.
I won't talk to him anymore	Ne bom več govoril z njim
I didn’t know what he was going to do	Nisem vedel, kaj bo naredil
I felt at home very quickly	Zelo hitro sem se počutil kot doma
However, this did not happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
He stayed there for a while.	Tam je ostal nekaj časa.
I actually have to go home	Pravzaprav moram domov
I liked the work.	Delo mi je bilo všeč.
I said that back then.	To sem rekel že takrat.
You have to see that.	To moraš videti.
i really like it that way	res mi je tako všeč
He didn't look good.	Ni bil videti dobro.
now i know everything.	zdaj vem vse.
I would never say anything like that.	Nikoli ne bi rekla kaj takega.
So was I, about that	Tudi jaz sem bil, glede tega
I heard everything	Slišal sem vse
I feel much better.	Počutim se veliko bolje.
I'm really sorry about that, you know	Res mi je zelo žal za to, veš
Because they didn't have any.	Ker niso imeli.
This, here.	To, tukaj.
I know what he means	Vem, kaj misli
There are so few of us now.	Zdaj nas je tako malo.
I went there and again nothing	Šel sem tja in spet nič
I waited and waited	Čakal sem in čakal
We had a very nice time.	Imeli smo se zelo lepo.
From here.	Od tukaj.
I had problems with a	Imel sem težave z a
I knew right away where we were	Takoj sem vedel, kje smo
He doesn’t do that too much.	Tega ne počne preveč.
Do what you have to do.	Naredi, kar moraš.
I need to know what's happening to me	Moram vedeti, kaj se mi dogaja
He didn't want to go last night.	Sinoči ni hotel iti.
I found them the day before	Našel sem jih prejšnji dan
I understand, but it's not right	Razumem, vendar ne gre prav
And we've seen him do it.	In videli smo ga, da je to naredil.
He heard it as a child.	Slišal ga je kot otrok.
I can not believe	Ne morem verjeti
I waited.	Čakal sem.
You should go get something.	Moral bi iti po nekaj.
She wasn't there.	Ni je bila tam.
I already knew then.	Že takrat sem vedel.
I asked her how she was feeling	Vprašal sem jo, kako se počuti
We knew he did it.	Vedeli smo, da je to storil.
I didn't expect that	Tega nisem pričakoval
That could be true.	To bi lahko bilo res.
I hope you can be here	Upam, da si lahko tukaj
I would do anything to get her back	Naredil bi vse, da bi jo vrnil
Something is wrong.	Nekaj ​​je narobe.
I quit my job and left	Pustil sem službo in šel
I have nothing more to do than that.	Več kot to mi ni za početi.
I'll do it anyway.	Tako ali tako bom naredil.
I know how much you want that	Vem, kako zelo si tega želiš
I would never do that to you	Tega ti nikoli ne bi storil

However, it is very difficult.	Vendar je zelo težko.
However, this can be done.	Vendar je to mogoče storiti.
I've heard all about it	Slišal sem vse o tem

I forgot what was there now, if anything	Pozabil sem, kaj je zdaj tam, če sploh kaj
I don’t know, that’s a very good question.	Ne vem, to je zelo dobro vprašanje.

I can not do it anymore	Ne morem več
I wish we had something like this here.	Želim si, da bi imeli kaj takega tukaj.
We have to go with him.	Moramo iti z njim.
I never heard him again	Nikoli več ga nisem slišal
It wasn't a good look.	Ni bilo dobro videti.
It's not really true.	Ni res res.
Make him want more.	Naj si želi več.
We need to do more.	Moramo narediti več.
I can't do without him	Ne morem brez njega
It has never been easy for me.	Nikoli mi ni bilo lahko.

It will.	Bo .

I wanted to be that stuff	Hotel sem biti te stvari
I did everything for you	Vse sem naredil zate
Now that she’s gone, I have a lot of work to do.	Zdaj, ko je ni več, imam veliko dela.
But I learned a lot	Sem se pa veliko naučil
I could tell everyone.	Lahko bi vsem povedal.
I thought maybe everything would be fine	Mislil sem, da bo morda vse v redu
I knew why he wanted to go to the house.	Vedel sem, zakaj je hotel iti v hišo.
I wonder what he thinks	Zanima me, kaj si misli
And so we knew.	In tako smo vedeli.
I knew what they were going to do to her	Vedel sem, kaj ji bodo naredili
I wanted more from you	Hotel sem več od tebe
That's why you really came here.	Zato si res prišel sem.
However, this did not have to be done.	Vendar tega ni bilo treba storiti.
He did what was right.	Naredil je, kar je bilo prav.
He just forgot here.	Samo pozabil je tukaj.
Which they may have had.	Kar so morda imeli.
I got a lot done today.	Danes sem naredil veliko.
He heard, and yet he did not hear.	Slišal je, pa vendar ni slišal.
I wouldn't want to do that.	Ne bi rad tega naredil.
I asked what was going on	Vprašal sem, kaj se dogaja
From what you did.	Od tega, kar si naredil.
I wanted to do everything myself	Vse sem hotel narediti sam
I can not believe	Ne morem verjeti
I'll be there soon	Kmalu bom tam
I really didn't think it could be you	Res si nisem mislil, da si to lahko ti
I had to.	Moral sem.
And now it won't.	In zdaj ne bo.
I will not return.	ne bom se vrnil.
After what we just saw.	Po tem, kar smo pravkar videli.
She wasn't now.	Zdaj ni bila.
There was nothing else he could do because he knew nothing else.	Ničesar drugega ni mogel narediti, ker drugega ni vedel.
I think you'll be fine.	Mislim, da boš v redu.
It's as good as it gets.	Dobro je, kot je.
But he wanted it.	Vendar si je to želel.
I'll be back here soon	Kmalu se bom vrnil sem

I told her she didn't have to do that	Rekel sem ji, da ji tega ni treba storiti
That money is gone now.	Tega denarja zdaj ni več.
I will do this every day forever	To bom počel vsak dan za vedno

I really didn’t want anything like that to happen	Res si nisem želel, da bi se kaj takega zgodilo

I forgot how he came.	Pozabil sem, kako je prišel.
They knew who we were.	Vedeli so, kdo smo.

As she knew it always was.	Kot je vedela, da je vedno.

He knows everything about us.	On ve vse o nas.
I preferred not to.	Raje nisem imel.
But I don't think so.	Mislim pa, da ni.
Instead, I just wanted more.	Namesto tega sem si samo še bolj želela.

I still find it hard to believe.	Še vedno težko verjamem.

I’m sure they shouldn’t be, but they shouldn’t be.	Prepričan sem, da ne bi bili, a ne bi smeli biti.
And it happened.	In zgodilo se je.
I told myself to move on	Rekel sem si, naj grem naprej
It was good when I said that.	Bilo je dobro, ko sem to rekel.
Just like she was.	Tako kot je bila.
I still like it there, simply or not	Tam mi je še vedno všeč, preprosto ali ne
I will never work again	Nikoli več ne bom delal
Whatever.	Kar bo.
That was what he managed to do.	To je bilo tisto, kar mu je uspelo.
He was well prepared.	Bil je dobro pripravljen.
I did it once.	Enkrat sem to naredil.
And that's the problem.	In to je problem.
You should see.	Moral bi videti.
Maybe it was just him.	Mogoče je bil samo on.
He went on.	Šel je naprej.
I was expecting you a little earlier	Pričakoval sem te malo prej
Here is.	Tukaj je.
I couldn’t tell what it was	Nisem mogel povedati, kaj je bilo
I knew immediately who he was	Takoj sem vedel, kdo je

I have to do this now, please	To moram storiti takoj, prosim
We are sure.	Prepričani smo.

Too much money, my friend.	Preveč denarja, prijatelj.
I can’t help but feel alone	Ne morem si pomagati, da se počutim sam
And there it is.	In tam je.
I feel like something is wrong with me	Počutim se, kot da je nekaj narobe z mano
This has been said for years.	To se govori že leta.
I was not the only one	nisem bil edini
Maybe we can make it there.	Mogoče nam bo tam uspelo.
I heard it myself once.	Enkrat sem jo tudi sam slišal.
I'm afraid we should, but she had to do something.	Bojim se, da bi se morali, vendar je morala nekaj storiti.
I can't stay here without you	Ne morem ostati tukaj brez tebe
I wouldn’t expect you to ever see them	Ne bi pričakoval, da jih boš kdaj videl
I left with almost nothing	Odšel sem s skoraj nič
That was me all along	To sem bil ves čas
That's all she wanted.	Samo to je želela.
You are something.	Ti si nekaj.
The man who lost everything	Človek, ki je izgubil vse
Wouldn't that be nice?	Ali ne bi bilo lepo?
I am very, very good at this	V tem sem zelo, zelo dober
He was still with me.	Še vedno je bil z mano.
It's just not for me.	Samo ni zame.
I often thought so.	Pogosto sem tako mislil.
I can be here for you.	Lahko sem tukaj zate.
I was sorry to see her leave	Žal mi je bilo, ko sem jo videl oditi
That seems like a good reason to have fun.	To se mi zdi dober razlog za zabavo.
I had to go to work then	Takrat sem moral v službo
We had problems.	Imeli smo težave.
Not like it was.	Ne kot je bilo.
You know it's nothing.	Veš, da ni nič.
I haven't seen anyone seriously in a long time	Že dolgo nisem nikogar resno videl

I'd like to go home.	Rad bi šel domov.
He thought it was so good.	Mislil je, da je tako dobro.
I didn't want it to be true.	Nisem želel, da bi bilo to res.
And if not, why not ?.	In če ne, zakaj ne?.
I wish it was that simple	Želim si, da bi bilo tako preprosto
I saw a lot of people in this place	Na tem mestu sem videl veliko ljudi
He was back.	Bil je nazaj.
As a person.	Kot oseba.
He's still my father, you know, and he doesn't know anything about me.	Še vedno je moj oče, veš, in ne ve ničesar o meni.
I want to do what is right	Želim narediti, kar je prav
I was sure he had heard all about it before	Prepričan sem bil, da je že slišal vse o tem
Not too much.	Ne preveč.
It was very good.	Bilo je zelo dobro.
I just wanted to ask.	Rad bi samo vprašal.
He seems to know his job.	Zdi se, da pozna svoje delo.
I want to know about what's going on.	Želim vedeti o tem, kar se dogaja.
I had to know what was going on.	Moral sem vedeti, kaj se dogaja.
In fact, it already is.	Pravzaprav je že.
More than you think.	Več kot si mislite.
In fact, we would already be there.	Pravzaprav bi že bili tam.
He said it was.	Rekel je, da je.
It seems to be really fine.	Zdi se, da je res v redu.
It's the only thing he can do.	To je edina stvar, ki jo lahko naredi.
I was trying to be busy	Poskušal sem biti zaposlen
That's why.	Zato je.
She told him to go, so he left.	Rekla mu je, naj gre, zato je odšel.
I could leave, go for help	Lahko bi odšel, šel po pomoč
I think that's right	Mislim, da je to prav
I just wish you were here with us.	Želim si samo, da bi bil tukaj z nami.
He never succeeded.	Nikoli mu ni uspelo.
I didn't know why.	Nisem vedel zakaj.
It's okay to be there.	V redu je, da je tam.
I almost did it myself.	Skoraj sem naredil sam.
I know you want it.	Vem, da si tega želiš.
I was ready to help.	Bil sem pripravljen pomagati.
That's right.	Tako je.
You did it yourself.	To si naredil sam.

I doubt it.	Dvomim.

I told you that when you met her	To sem ti povedal, ko si jo spoznal
I just found you.	Pravkar sem našel te.
I have no choice but time	Nimam drugega kot čas
Nobody knows that.	Tega nihče ne ve.
I never expected you to do anything	Nikoli nisem pričakoval, da boš kaj naredil
I know where you are	vem kje si
No one seems to be home at the moment.	Trenutno se zdi, da ni nikogar doma.
He played very well.	Igral je zelo dobro.
Things we just haven’t seen.	Stvari, ki jih preprosto nismo videli.
It was afternoon again.	Spet je bilo popoldne.
She needed to know.	Morala je vedeti.
Or the way.	Ali način.
If you really want to.	Če res želite.
I wonder what he will do about it.	Zanima me, kaj bo naredil glede tega.
You know, and this is the first time.	Veste in to je prvič.
However, these may not be enough.	Vendar pa ti morda ne bodo dovolj.

Not for me.	Ni zame.
I never met him	Nikoli ga nisem spoznal
I can't do that right now	Tega trenutno ne morem storiti
I mean, that just can’t be done.	Mislim, tega preprosto ni mogoče storiti.
I'm fine.	Dobro sem.
I think I could have done better.	Mislim, da bi lahko naredil bolje.
He will be home tomorrow.	Jutri bo doma.
I wonder if she would be here	Sprašujem se, ali bi bila tukaj
I just wish there was more	Preprosto si želim, da bi bilo več
He tried to speak.	Poskušal je govoriti.
I said something like that.	Rekel sem nekaj takega.
Just a little.	Le malo.
I haven't seen her in years	Nisem je videl že leta
I love them there	Rad jih imam tam

I don’t even know what happened.	Sploh ne vem, kaj se je zgodilo.
I can't be mine	Ne morem biti po moje
All I want is to be with you again.	Vse kar želim je, da sem spet s tabo.
I've done that before	To sem tudi že naredil
It's every day.	Vsak dan je.
How was he.	Kako je bil.
I still shouldn't be here	Še vedno ne bi smel biti tukaj
A lot is happening to me	Veliko se mi dogaja
You are not a father.	Nisi oče.
I wasn't ready for that yet	Na to še nisem bil pripravljen
I want to do something	želim nekaj narediti
I'm glad you said that.	Vesel sem, da si to rekel.
I didn't have to talk.	Ni mi bilo treba govoriti.
They were always there for me.	Vedno so bili tam zame.
She said she knew.	Rekla je, da ve.
I could go alone.	Lahko bi šel sam.
Something was right.	Nekaj ​​je bilo prav.
I didn't say anything.	Nič nisem rekel.
I was amazed at how good he felt	Presenečen sem bil, kako dobro se je počutil
He can't go home.	Ne more domov.
I think you should buy us something	Mislim, da bi nam moral nekaj kupiti
I didn't see anyone, I didn't hear anything	Nikogar nisem videl, nič slišal
I think it is.	Mislim, da je.
Like she's never seen before	Tako, kot še nikoli ni bila videti
And that seemed true.	In to se je zdelo res.
I don't understand what's going on here.	Ne razumem, kaj se tukaj dogaja.
I heard before I saw	Sem prej slišal kot videl
I can't go with you	Ne morem iti s tabo
Now I knew where he lived	Zdaj sem vedel, kje živi
You have to do it yourself.	To moraš narediti sam.
It all seemed pretty obvious to him.	Vse se mu je zdelo precej očitno.
He would do anything for the people he loves.	Za ljudi, ki jih ima rad, bi naredil vse.
Not enough money.	Ni dovolj denarja.
I really don’t know where the time has gone.	Res ne vem, kam je šel čas.
I didn't know you'd be here	Nisem vedel, da boš tukaj

I would never do something like that	Nikoli ne bi naredil kaj takega
You expected it.	Saj si pričakoval.
I want you there with me	Želim te tam z mano
I think you're something else	Mislim, da si nekaj drugega
I really like it.	Res mi je všeč.
It simply seems that this is possible.	Preprosto je videti, da je to mogoče.
I wanted to make sure	Hotel sem se prepričati
I was working.	Delal sem.
I never thought it would be me.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da bom to jaz.
I started early this morning	Danes zjutraj sem začel zgodaj
So tired of everything.	Tako utrujen od vsega.
Probably for the money.	Verjetno za denar.
I can understand why.	Lahko razumem zakaj.
Really, she wasn't.	Res, ni bila.
i don't need you anymore	ne potrebujem te več
That was a serious question.	To je bilo resno vprašanje.
I have someone right away	Takoj imam nekoga
And life is not for that.	In življenje ni za to.
He has to say everything.	Povedati mora vse.

I see them every day	Vidim jih vsak dan

So we did a lot of that.	Tako smo naredili veliko tega.
I see no one has	Vidim, da nihče nima
I wouldn't want him	Ne bi mu želela
He just said he did it.	Pravkar je rekel, da je to storil.
I don't think so	Mislim, da ni
She has no children.	Nima otrok.
And there is something else.	In še nekaj je.
I hope he's not playing with me	Upam, da se ne igra z mano
I used to work.	Prej sem delal.
And maybe not for long.	In morda ne za dolgo.

Nobody works here.	Nihče ne dela tukaj.
The money came and went.	Denar je prišel in odšel.
I said wrong again	Spet sem rekel narobe

I won't stay there at all	Sploh ne bom ostal tam
So is he.	Tudi on.
You and me.	Ti in jaz.
What you saw is what you got.	Kar si videl, je to kar si dobil.
I had to get there	Moral sem priti tja

That's how I was.	Tako sem bil.
I know enough not to do that.	Vem dovolj, da tega ne storim.
I have to go back to school	Moram nazaj v šolo
He didn't like it.	Ni mu bilo všeč.
I thought he was leaving the next day	Mislil sem, da bo naslednji dan odšel
I would like to do that	rad bi to naredil
Apparently there was something very, very wrong there.	Očitno je bilo tam nekaj zelo, zelo narobe.
Maybe you're right.	Morda imaš prav.
I told him what my father had just said	Povedal sem mu, kar je pravkar rekel moj oče
I know what I want to say if I could	Vem, kaj bi rad povedal, če bi lahko
I didn't know you meant it.	Nisem vedel, da si mislil.

I know it's going to happen	Vem, da se bo zgodilo

I have to go.	moram oditi.
Know you shouldn't.	Vedeti, da ne bi smel.
I couldn't see him now	Zdaj ga nisem mogel videti
I've never seen that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem videl.
He is in everything.	On je v vsem.
That's right.	Tako je prav.
He knew something he was going to do.	Vedel je nekaj, kar bo.
I would have known for sure before.	Zagotovo bi vedel že prej.
I expected everything, just not this one	Pričakoval sem vse, samo ne tega
This is work.	To je delo.
I've been waiting for this	Čakal sem na to
I am all that you are	jaz sem vse, kar si ti
Only.	Samo.
I was still.	Bil sem še vedno.
He doesn't play anymore	Ne igra se več
I know it and he knows it	Jaz to vem in on to ve
It will probably be fine.	Verjetno bo v redu.
I like that about it	Všeč mi je to pri tem
I should have said something earlier	Nekaj ​​bi moral povedati prej
I completely forgot about it	Popolnoma sem pozabil na to

I had to do that	To sem moral narediti
For very, very many years, my life has been simple.	Zelo, zelo veliko let je bilo moje življenje preprosto.
Yes, we have.	Da, imamo.
I've decided where I'm going to put you.	Odločil sem se, kam te bom dal.
She was mine.	Bila je moja.
I don't know anymore.	ne vem več.

I was ready for it	Bil sem pripravljen na to
I can not believe.	Ne morem verjeti.
Something like this has never happened to me before.	Kaj takega se pri meni še ni zgodilo.
I knew it was for me	Vedel sem, da je zame
Being just a man, he wasn’t ready to look that way.	Ker je samo človek, ni bil pripravljen na to videti tako.
He could be there when he is.	Lahko bi bil tudi tam, ko bo.
Really very long	Res zelo dolgo
I'm sure not	Prepričan sem, da ne
What he does.	Kar počne.
I didn't see anyone	Nikogar nisem videl

I will be good for nothing	Za nič bom dober
I wasn’t ready for that	Nisem bil pripravljen na to

I hope we're fine	Upam, da bomo v redu

We didn’t have anyone else to do them.	Nismo imeli nikogar drugega, ki bi jih opravil.
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
I wish they knew about you sooner	Želim si, da bi že prej vedeli zate
I spoke to him.	Govoril sem z njim.
I know them.	Poznam jih.
However, this was not true.	Vendar to ni bilo res.
We will not .	Ne bomo .
He saw nothing.	Nič ni videl.
That was a boy.	To je bil fant.
I had to talk to you	Moral sem govoriti s tabo
She was a little more.	Bila je malo več.
I just wasn’t ready yet	Samo še nisem bil pripravljen
I'm glad he's back.	Vesel sem, da se je vrnil.
I expected to ask myself.	Pričakoval sem, da se bom vprašal.
I know where he is	Vem kje je
Good work, boy.	Dobro delo, fant.
I had it here	Imel sem ga tukaj
I've been waiting for him for quite some time	Čakal sem ga kar nekaj časa
I can only hope this is true	Lahko samo upam, da je to res
And it will be fast.	In hitro bo.
Apparently he said yes	Očitno je rekel da
He said he liked it very much.	Rekel je, da mu je bilo zelo všeč.
I didn't want you to know.	Nisem hotel, da veš.
That’s what he wants to do.	To je tisto, kar želi narediti.
The reason for this.	Razlog za to.
I don't think he's home	Mislim, da ga ni doma
He wants to help us.	Želi nam pomagati.
He said he didn't know too much about it.	Rekel je, da ne ve preveč o tem.
And that's when he saw it.	In takrat je to videl.
This is a very good thing.	To je zelo dobra stvar.
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
I know and that needs to be said	Vem in to je treba povedati
All this is true.	Vse to je res.
Maybe he's having trouble.	Morda ima težave.
I can't be here.	Ne morem biti tukaj.
I knew he was going into it	Vedel sem, da gre v to
I can be completely alone.	Popolnoma sem lahko sam.
It was so nice to see him again.	Tako lepo ga je bilo spet videti.
I mean, before all that	Mislim, pred vsem tem
I didn't expect it.	Nisem pričakoval.
I decided to play with me	Odločil sem se, da se igra z mano
I haven't seen anyone there in a while	Že nekaj časa tam nisem videl nikogar
It never would be.	Nikoli ne bi bilo.
It wasn't hard.	To ni bilo težko.
That's my only reason.	To je moj edini razlog.
I didn’t know what to do with it.	Nisem vedel, kaj naj s tem.
No one could see them.	Nihče jih ni mogel videti.
This is you.	To si ti.
I'm your real friend	Jaz sem ti pravi prijatelj
A lot.	Veliko.
I just really need to know	Samo res moram vedeti
So many years and years.	Toliko let in let.
I know you will get it	Vem, da boš dobil
He's working on it.	Dela na tem.
I don't even know you.	Sploh te ne poznam.
He's here.	On je tukaj.
And there was something else.	Pa še nekaj je bilo.
You don't have to come.	Ni ti treba priti.
He said something.	Nekaj ​​je rekel.
Not like that anymore.	Ne več tako.
You really can't eat this.	Tega se res ne da jesti.
I'm going to have to do something about it	Nekaj ​​bom moral narediti glede tega
It's just who we are.	Preprosto to smo mi.
I know everything here	Poznam vse tukaj
I think that's how he found us	Mislim, da nas je tako našel
I just want to help you	Samo pomagati ti želim
I went to the room, but he was not there	Šla sem v sobo, a ga ni bilo
I will try to do it fast.	Poskušal bom narediti to hitro.
I didn't allow myself	Nisem si dovolil
And now it is so.	In zdaj je tako.
I want to be there.	Želim si biti tam.
Let them be.	Naj bodo.
I'll tell you something.	Nekaj ​​ti bom povedal.
No one knew that better than he.	Nihče tega ni vedel bolje kot on.
I still didn't know anything	Še vedno nisem vedel nič
I know how things are.	Vem, kako so stvari.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Preprosto nisem mogel verjeti.
There are more of them.	Več jih je.
I haven't been there in a while	Tam me že nekaj časa ni bilo
Probably nothing.	Verjetno nič.
that is	to je
You have to tell me what happened.	Povedati mi moraš, kaj se je zgodilo.
I didn't know why then.	Takrat nisem vedel zakaj.
That was the thing.	To je bila stvar.
I think he can help me	Mislim, da mi lahko pomaga
And he would, well, not, go.	In bi, pa ne, šel.
I have a very hard time with this.	Zelo težko imam s tem.
He's my dad too, you know.	Tudi on je moj oče, veš.
I’m not sure if that’s possible	Nisem prepričan, če je to mogoče
We are convinced of that.	Prepričani smo v to.
Just like us.	Tako kot mi.
We don't know it is.	Ne vemo, da je.
I just wanted to see you	Samo videti sem te hotel
I have never met anyone like him.	Še nikoli nisem srečal nikogar, kot je on.
All this is neither here nor there.	Vsega tega ni ne tukaj ne tam.
I almost didn’t feel like finding her	Skoraj se mi ni zdelo, da bi jo našel
I can't do that, not like that	Ne morem narediti tega, ne tako
I’ll get to that as soon as I can.	Prišel bom do tega, takoj ko bom lahko.
I'll be back.	Vrnil se bom.
That's what's there.	To je tisto, kar je tam.
I'm not afraid of anyone.	Nikogar se ne bojim.
I learned a lot from him	Od njega sem se veliko naučil
You have to play.	Moraš igrati.
I didn't know how long	Nisem vedel, kako dolgo
I should never have done that	Tega ne bi smel nikoli storiti
I thought you were coming to me	Mislil sem, da boš prišel k meni
I was just a kid when I was a kid	Bil sem samo otrok, ko sem bil otrok
Even if they are.	Tudi če so.
I haven't eaten in three days	Nisem jedel tri dni
I know what you mean.	Vem kaj misliš.
I haven't seen her myself in years	Sam je že nekaj let nisem videl
He won't find you here.	Tukaj te ne bo našel.
This continues to be difficult.	To je še naprej težko.
I know nicely	Poznam lepo
There was nothing else you could do.	Nič drugega nisi mogel storiti.
She is not at home.	Ni je doma.
I'm sorry I made that decision for you	Žal mi je, ker sem se tako odločil namesto vas
I wanted to go somewhere	Hotel sem kam iti
He was there.	Bil je tam.
I didn’t stay to hear more	Nisem ostal, da bi slišal več
This is out of place.	To ni na mestu.
He must be gone.	Mora biti odšel.
You don't need to know.	Ni vam treba vedeti.
He has lived there ever since.	Od takrat živi tam.
It used to be.	Nekoč je bilo.
I will tell her that too	To ji bom tudi povedal
I wanted to see more	Hotel sem videti več
But it was so beautiful.	Vendar je bilo tako lepo.
I would like to go with you	rad bi šel s tabo
You won't like that.	To ti ne bo všeč.
I learned very quickly	Zelo hitro sem se naučil
Rather than.	Raje kot.
I didn't know anyone else was here	Nisem vedel, da je še kdo tukaj
I want to make it my own	Želim jo narediti svojo
That's what I want to be for you	To želim biti zate
I want to go alone	Želim iti sam
I feel like I couldn’t help myself.	Zdi se mi, da si nisem mogel pomagati.
We have work to do.	Imamo delo.
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
I think he's playing with us	Mislim, da se igra z nami
I didn’t actually have it	Pravzaprav ga nisem imel
I still didn’t know what he did, what he did	Še vedno nisem vedel, kaj je naredil, kaj je naredil
I didn't want money	Nisem hotel denarja
I forgot he was here at all	Pozabil sem, da je sploh bil tukaj
I know you are.	Vem, da si.
I need money, and a lot of it	Potrebujem denar, in to veliko
It wasn't that good.	Ni bilo tako dobro.
It's about us.	Gre za nas.
I think you should go with me	Mislim, da bi moral iti z mano
I couldn't go on like this	Nisem mogel tako naprej
He felt better when he decided what he was going to do.	Bolje se je počutil, ko se je odločil, kaj bo storil.
I don't want to know what you did	Nočem vedeti, kaj si naredil
We know who did it.	Vemo, kdo je to storil.
I know it’s not that simple.	Vem, da ni tako preprosto.
I will help him	Pomagal mu bom
I knew what you were thinking	Vedel sem, kaj misliš
You're here, it's there.	Ti si tukaj, tam je.
I didn’t know she was going to do it	Nisem vedel, da bo to storila
I've never met him before	Še nikoli ga nisem srečal
I mean, you found me.	Mislim, našel si me.
I think this is the right time	Mislim, da je to pravi čas
I need to get out, please.	Potrebujem ven, prosim.
A friend was with me	Prijatelj je bil z mano
I just need to say a few things	Samo nekaj stvari moram povedati
That's not right.	To ni prav.
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
I definitely thought this would never happen	Zagotovo sem mislil, da se to ne bo nikoli zgodilo
You should have come earlier	Moral bi priti prej
They won't, here.	Ne bodo naredili, tukaj.
If that was anything at all.	Če bi bilo to sploh nekaj.
I really wanted to help you	Res sem ti želel pomagati
I ask, but I do not ask	Sprašujem, a ne sprašujem
I will always do all this	Vedno bom naredil vse to
And you are.	In ti si.
I know what's going on here	Vem, kaj se dogaja tukaj

There is a possibility for that.	Za to obstaja možnost.
Nobody wants you here.	Nihče te noče tukaj.
She was there today.	Danes je bila tam.
He really wanted it.	Zelo si je želel.
I would just stay for a while.	Samo nekaj časa bi ostal.
I did not return home this morning	Danes zjutraj se nisem vrnil domov
I can't believe he's really gone	Ne morem verjeti, da ga res ni več
That just happened to me.	To se mi je pravkar zgodilo.
There was no need to do that.	Tega ni bilo treba storiti.
She knew what she was doing.	Vedela je, kaj počne.
I know it wasn't that hard for you	Vem, da ti ni bilo tako težko
You didn't make it	Nisem ti uspelo
I don't feel so good.	Ne počutim se tako dobro.
I didn’t know he had any of that	Nisem vedel, da ima kaj od tega
I already told you what happened	Sem že povedal, kaj se je zgodilo
I have not forgotten what to do	Nisem pozabil, kaj storiti
I was so surprised by this and I still am	Bil sem tako presenečen nad tem in še vedno sem
It's true.	Res je.
I didn't like it here either	Tudi tukaj mi ni bilo všeč
I'm not going home tonight	Nocoj ne bom šel domov
I didn’t even know if that was a good thing	Sploh nisem vedel, če je to dobra stvar

That is, it is getting better.	Se pravi, gre na bolje.
Like, really, really good.	Kot, res, res dobro.
I hope there will be more.	Upam, da jih bo več.
There are three.	Ima tri.
That's really it.	To je res to.
That's wrong.	To je narobe.
I will stay here.	ostal bom tukaj.

Now I wonder about everything	Zdaj se sprašujem o vsem
No, not once.	Ne, niti enkrat ne.
I knew you would come to us	Vedel sem, da boš prišel do nas
He had nothing to tell her.	Ni ji imel kaj povedati.
I will never forget you.	Nikoli te ne bom pozabil.
He was not here when it happened.	Ko se je zgodilo, ga ni bilo tukaj.
And he would be right.	In prav bi imel.
This can't be a good thing, she told herself.	To ne more biti dobra stvar, si je rekla.
Or not what he wanted for his life.	Ali pa ne tisto, kar je želel za svoje življenje.
I don't think we saw him	Mislim, da ga nismo videli
It’s not up to you to know, not yet.	Ni na vas, da veste, še ne.
I failed.	Ni mi uspelo.
I had to stay home and work	Moral sem ostati doma in delati
I wish you would go with me	Želim si, da bi šel z mano
This man obviously knew very little.	Ta človek očitno ni vedel zelo malo.
Just me, alone again.	Samo jaz, spet sama.
I do that sometimes.	To včasih počnem.

I still am.	Še vedno sem.
A lot, just today	Veliko, samo danes
I will try to do this at home	To bom poskušal narediti doma
I think it will be fine	Mislim, da bo v redu
This did not happen here.	Tukaj se to ni zgodilo.
Not that it would.	Ne da bi.

I've never heard of it before.	Še nikoli prej nisem slišal za to.

I have to leave immediately	Takoj moram oditi
Not all, no.	Ne vsi, ne.
I have no doubt about that.	V to ne dvomim.
He liked that too.	Tudi to mu je bilo všeč.
I didn't think that was right	Glede tega se mi ni zdelo prav
I just need time	Potrebujem samo čas
That this is no longer the case.	Da temu ni več tako.

Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.	Mogoče je, morda ni.

I have to believe that	To moram verjeti

That was something I should have done.	To je bilo nekaj, kar bi morala storiti.
Everyone saw it.	Vsi so to videli.
It wasn't like that.	Ni bilo tako.
I couldn't know	Nisem mogel vedeti
He learned quickly.	Hitro se je naučil.
He didn't mean anything by that.	Nič ni mislil s tem.
It was nice working with you.	Lepo je bilo delati s tabo.
I asked why.	Vprašal sem zakaj.
I just don't know who.	Samo ne vem kdo.
I probably would.	Verjetno bi.
I didn't ask him at all	Sploh ga nisem prosil
There is no such thing.	Nič takega ni.
I already know why you came here	Že vem, zakaj si prišel sem
I think it would be better if I stayed here	Mislim, da bi bilo bolje, če bi ostal tukaj

I want to be there right away	Tam želim biti takoj
I think they still are	Mislim, da so še vedno

I can't do this alone	Tega ne morem storiti sam
I don't see who started it.	Ne vidim, kdo je začel.

That's what my father taught me.	To me je naučil oče.
He never wants to talk to me again.	Nikoli več noče govoriti z mano.
Can anyone help me with this ?.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga pri tem?.

He has done this before.	To je storil že prej.
You have to.	Moraš.

I didn't see anyone or anything	Nisem videl nikogar ali ničesar
He will call her again.	Spet jo bo poklical.

It was too much.	Bilo je preveč.
It really has to be.	Res mora biti.
That's the only way.	To je edini način.
I want some time alone with you	Želim si nekaj časa sam s tabo

Not with him.	Ne z njim.
I still have some time	Imam še nekaj časa
I won't wait any longer	ne bom več čakal

Someone was sitting there waiting for him.	Nekdo je tam sedel in ga čakal.
I don't know anyone anymore	nikogar več ne poznam

They had no one else.	Niso imeli nikogar drugega.
Nobody knows anything.	Nihče nič ne ve.
I know him well.	dobro ga poznam.
I heard about you.	Slišal sem zate.
And this was not the first time.	In to ni bilo prvič.
It was life as usual.	To je bilo življenje kot običajno.
You won't do anything.	Nič ne boš naredil.
That was not good.	To ni bilo dobro.
I shouldn't have seen him	Nisem ga smel videti
I would never know what he wants	Nikoli ne bi vedel, kaj si želi

He just didn't let us do that.	Samo tega nam ni dovolil.
I sat and waited.	Sedel sem in čakal.
But there is something else.	Je pa še nekaj.
Obviously you are.	Očitno si.
I need to talk to you	Moram govoriti s tabo
The question was what to do with it.	Vprašanje je bilo, kaj narediti s tem.
It could be something like having a better time.	Lahko bi bilo nekaj takega, kot da bi se imeli bolje.
I lost him	Izgubil sem ga
Must be.	Mora biti.
I love seeing it.	Rad to vidim.
There was work for a week or more.	Dela je bilo teden dni ali več.
That happened.	To se je zgodilo.
I am also serious at the moment	Tudi jaz trenutno mislim resno
I think he will win more.	Mislim, da bo zmagal več.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
She was so often alone these days.	Te dni je bila tako pogosto sama.

Even without me.	Tudi brez mene.
I think you just need to talk to him	Mislim, da moraš govoriti samo z njim

I knew what was going on.	Vedel sem, kaj se dogaja.
That's how he lives and that for three years.	Tako in to živi in ​​tri leta.
I still need something from you	Še vedno potrebujem nekaj od tebe
He had a chance.	Imel je priložnost.
Without you people, none of this is possible.	Brez vas ljudi nič od tega ni mogoče.
He wanted to do something.	Želel je nekaj narediti.
And he says no.	In pravi, da ne.
It's nice to be here.	Lepo je biti tukaj.
That's it and more.	To je to in še več.
We still have some time.	Imamo še nekaj časa.
I don't know, man.	Ne vem, človek.
I haven't been there in a few years	Že nekaj let nisem bil tam
Either way, I'm fine.	Tako ali tako mi ni nič.
It sure is.	Zagotovo je.
I haven't seen them in years	Nisem jih videl že nekaj let
I know what he's thinking.	Vem, kaj si misli.
I believe.	Verjamem .
I told her no, you can't do that here	Rekel sem ji ne, tega ne moreš storiti tukaj
Very nice of you.	Zelo lepo od tebe.
We can.	Mi lahko.
I want them back.	Želim jih nazaj.
You're like me.	Ti si kot jaz.
Not everyone likes it.	Ni vsem všeč.
He said.	Rekel je.
I knew what he was up to	Vedel sem, kaj namerava

I felt very little.	Počutil sem se zelo malo.
I was surprised he didn’t know yet	Bil sem presenečen, da še ni vedel

I always waited for her	Vedno sem jo čakal
Actually you can.	Pravzaprav lahko.
I would know what to do.	Vedela bi, kaj storiti.
There was no one at home.	Ni bilo nikogar doma.
I would help you	jaz bi ti pomagal
Once again he decided to do it.	Še enkrat se je odločil, da bo to storil.
I can’t talk about it at the moment	Trenutno ne morem govoriti o tem
There's a lot of that.	V to je veliko tega.
So are we.	Tudi mi smo.
I haven't heard anything since	Od takrat nisem nič slišal
And maybe glad to see her.	In morda vesel, da jo vidim.
I didn't do anything in the morning	Zjutraj nisem počel prav nič
This seems to have happened here.	Zdi se, da se je to zgodilo tukaj.
Or expected.	Ali pa pričakoval.
I mean, it is.	Mislim, je.
Now I know he would want that for me	Zdaj vem, da bi to želel zame
I knew there had to be a reason	Vedel sem, da mora biti razlog
I don't think that's anymore	Mislim, da tega ni več
I think you have a good thing here	Mislim, da imaš dobro stvar tukaj
He told me what he needed.	Povedal mi je, kaj potrebuje.
It was really nice to see them again.	Res lepo jih je bilo spet videti.
I didn't like that.	To ni bilo všeč.
I believe not.	Verjamem, da ni.
You are my Everything.	Ti si moje vse.
I probably won't even need you	Verjetno te niti ne bom potreboval
I knew you wouldn't be here long	Vedel sem, da ne boš dolgo tukaj
I wonder why he knows these things	Sprašujem se, zakaj ve te stvari
I know he knows what's going on	Vem, da ve, kaj se dogaja
Maybe not.	Morda ne.
I didn't do anything wrong here	Tukaj nisem naredil nič narobe
These things may be true.	Te stvari so morda res.
He bided his time.	Čakal je svoj čas.
I had to go after him	Moral sem iti za njim
He had a job.	Imel je delo.
Or as fine as it gets.	Ali tako v redu, kot bo.
I'm glad to hear from you.	Vesel sem, da sem se slišal od vas.
I'm sorry.	Žal mi je.
I haven't met him in years	Že leta ga nisem srečal
That's probably enough for now.	To je verjetno dovolj za zdaj.
I really like it here	Tukaj mi je zelo všeč
We had it last week.	Prejšnji teden smo ga imeli.
It’s not what you think it is.	Ni to, kar mislite, da je.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
I was next.	jaz sem bil naslednji.
It was still there now.	Zdaj je bilo še vedno.
I think we should stay here	Mislim, da bi morali ostati tukaj
Or maybe it was more than that.	Ali pa je bilo morda več kot to.
I haven't seen him since	Od takrat ga nisem več videl
I've never seen that either	Tudi tega nisem nikoli videl
I was completely alone, just me and my thoughts	Bila sem popolnoma sama, samo jaz in svoje misli
I see.	Vidim.

I always thought so	Vedno sem mislil, da je tako
You came right.	Pravi si prišel.
That's how life is now.	Tako je zdaj življenje.
It happened to me once.	Enkrat se mi je to zgodilo.
If you did, you wouldn't be here.	Če bi, te ne bi bilo tukaj.
It's not him.	To ni on.
A child also needs a lot of things	Otrok potrebuje tudi veliko stvari
I know you know how it is	Vem, da veš kako je
I wish it weren't so	Želim si, da ne bi bilo tako
I wouldn't hear of it.	Ne bi slišal za to.
It can help.	Lahko pomaga.
There will be more.	Več jih bo.
I do not think so	Mislim, da ne
I was a kid back then and I came like this	Takrat sem bil otrok in sem prišel kot ta
I have to get back to work.	Moram nazaj v službo.
That's the whole problem.	To je ves problem.
No, nothing is good enough.	Ne, nič ni dovolj dobro.
Maybe he never goes out.	Mogoče nikoli ne gre ven.
I would never forget him	Nikoli ga ne bi pozabil
I didn't ask where he was going	Nisem vprašal, kam gre
This is a man.	To je človek.
I knew what he could do	Vedel sem, kaj lahko naredi
I didn't want to do that	Tega nisem hotel narediti
I should do so much.	Toliko bi moral narediti.
Nobody likes that.	Nihče ne mara tega.
I did the work myself	Delo sem opravil sam
It seems so obvious now.	Zdaj se zdi tako očitno.
Right above me.	Prav nad mano.
Is it for everyone? 	Je vsem?
I was just wondering, that's all	Samo vprašal sem se, to je vse
I was a very good teacher.	Bil sem zelo dober učitelj.
And that's a lot.	In to je veliko.
I couldn't even go to school	Niti v šolo nisem mogel iti
I just want to know what happened to him	Želim samo vedeti, kaj se mu je zgodilo
I think it's good.	Mislim, da je dobro.
It still doesn't work.	Še vedno ne gre.
I didn’t expect to meet anyone like me	Nisem pričakoval, da bom srečal še koga, kot sem jaz
I won't anymore	Ne bom več
There was no need.	Ni bilo treba.
A good man, as she said	Dober človek, kot je rekla
Someone will hear it.	Nekdo bo to slišal.
I hope you succeed!	Upam, da vam bo uspelo!
If you stay with it, you will too !!!!!!.	Če boš ostal pri tem, boš tudi!!!!!!.
It's never nice.	Nikoli ni lepo.
He couldn't play outside.	Ni se mogel igrati ven.
I understand you have to do what you have to do.	Razumem, da moraš narediti, kar moraš.
I know it’s hard to believe, but it’s true.	Vem, da je težko verjeti, vendar je res.
He had never seen it like that before.	Še nikoli tega ni videl tako.
I thought you were.	Mislil sem, da si.
I can see that, everyone can	To vidim, vsi lahko
I understand you very well.	zelo dobro te razumem.
I didn’t find much about it.	Nisem našel veliko o tem.
Obviously I would like to know why.	Očitno bi rad vedel zakaj.
I don't need money.	Ne potrebujem denarja.
I'm sorry to do that.	Žal mi je, da to počnem.
I just didn't know why	Samo nisem vedel, zakaj
It wasn't much more than that.	Ni bilo veliko več kot to.
He could stay or come back	Lahko bi ostal ali pa se vrnil
And you didn't.	In nisi.
No, that really wasn't a possibility.	Ne, to res ni bila možnost.
He knows that.	On to ve.
He did very, very well.	Zelo, zelo dobro mu je uspelo.
I didn't want to be that man	Nisem hotel biti ta človek
I didn’t know something like this was going to happen	Nisem vedel, da se bo kaj takega zgodilo
No one will forget you.	Nihče vas ne bo pozabil.
I think he knows what he's doing	Mislim, da ve, kaj počne
I couldn't believe it	Tega nisem mogel verjeti
And that is.	In to je.
You want to.	Želiš si.
And maybe she was.	In morda je bila.
He will make things happen.	On bo naredil stvari.
I really had.	res sem imel.
From there I knew we were going to be in trouble.	Od tam sem vedel, da bomo imeli težave.
He could not see anything or things.	Ničesar ali stvari ni mogel videti.
I think she succeeded.	Mislim, da ji je uspelo.
They have done this before.	To so storili že prej.
You should go.	Moral bi iti.
Maybe you could.	Mogoče bi lahko.
I knew he wouldn't give him anything	Vedel sem, da mu ne bo dal ničesar
And now it all happened.	In zdaj se je vse zgodilo.
I wasn't happy about that.	Nisem bil vesel tega.
He has to go home now.	Zdaj mora domov.
'I !.	' JAZ !.
The next day.	Naslednji dan.
That's why he's busy.	Zaradi tega je zaposlen.
I shouldn't have done that	Tega ne bi smel storiti
We may not know it, but we are.	Morda tega ne vemo, a smo.
I wonder why he was here	Sprašujem se, zakaj je bil tukaj
I hope all is well.	Upam, da je vse dobro.
I have to stay here a little longer	Tukaj moram ostati še malo
I never asked where	Nikoli nisem vprašal, kje
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
I let her go her own way	Pustil sem ji, da gre po svoje
I feel like he is very angry	Počutim se, kot da je zelo jezen
It wasn't always like that.	Ni bilo vedno tako.
I tried to convince her	Poskušal sem jo prepričati
I'm really interested.	Res me zanima.
I had to do it just to see	Moral sem to narediti samo zato, da sem videl
There was nothing else.	Nič drugega ni bilo.
I shouldn't be here at all, really	Sploh ne bi smel biti tukaj, res
It really is that simple.	Res je tako preprosto.
I didn’t even know what was wrong with him	Sploh nisem vedel, kaj je narobe z njim
We have time.	Imamo čas.
It's not that common.	To ni tako pogosto.
I shouldn't do anything at all	Sploh ne bi smel storiti ničesar
I think you might like it	Mislim, da ti bo morda všeč
He looked as usual.	Videti je bil kot običajno.
None of us have.	Nihče od nas nima.
I didn't see you there	Nisem te videl tam
He says nothing happened.	Pravi, da se ni nič zgodilo.
better.	bolje.
It's all me.	Vse sem jaz.
He was absolutely right.	Imel je popolnoma prav.
That's life.	Tako je življenje.
I never even made it	Niti nikoli mi ni uspelo
I couldn't do that to her	Tega ji nisem mogel storiti
We've been here long enough.	Dovolj dolgo smo tukaj.
Obviously the problem is something else.	Očitno je problem nekaj drugega.
A good way to do that	Dober način za to
I knew you were fine	Vedel sem, da si v redu
i like that too.	tudi meni je to všeč.
A lot of what he says is unfortunately true.	Veliko tega, kar pravi, je žal res.
I heard you.	Slišal sem te.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar.
I forgot how well he knows me	Pozabil sem, kako dobro me pozna
Let it be so.	Naj bo tako.
He just quit his job.	Pravkar je pustil službo.
I didn't mean anything	Nisem mislil ali nič
You and me.	Ti in jaz.
They were all here.	Vsi so bili tukaj.
I need to tell you more	Več ti moram povedati
I mean, he has it all.	Mislim, ima vse.
I'm not feeling well today.	Danes se ne počutim dobro.
I think it takes some time	Mislim, da potrebuje nekaj časa
You're right.	Prav imaš.
It was very hard work.	Bilo je zelo težko delo.
I really need to know	res moram vedeti
And some of it was.	In nekaj od tega je bilo.
Money, money, money.	Denar, denar, denar.
It would be better for both of us to stay there.	Za oba bi bilo bolje, če bi ostal tam.
Something should be done about this	Nekaj ​​bi bilo treba narediti glede tega
Would definitely stay here again.	Zagotovo bi spet ostal tukaj.
That's pretty nice.	Precej lepo to.
And that's just it.	In to je samo to.
I'd like to play some more.	Rad bi še nekaj igral.
Maybe, maybe not.	Mogoče, morda ne.
And it certainly is.	In zagotovo je.
I want to make sure he's well out.	Želim se prepričati, da je dobro ven.
No one needed to know.	Nikomur ni bilo treba vedeti.
I would if it were me	Bi, če bi bil jaz
I don't have to say that	Tega mi ni treba povedati
Yes, he said.	Lahko, je rekel.
He said nothing.	Nič ni rekel.
I have never been, nor do I know, anyone living there	Nikoli nisem bil, niti poznam nikogar, ki tam živi
I know you have to do it yourself	Vem, da moraš to storiti sam
I didn't speak.	Nisem govoril.
Maybe that was it.	Mogoče je bilo to to.
I totally understand why I would feel that way	Popolnoma razumem, zakaj bi se tako počutil
He just got lost.	Pravkar se je izgubil.
Tell him that for me.	Povej mu to zame.
I couldn’t believe this was really happening	Nisem mogel verjeti, da se to res dogaja
I won't promise you that	Tega ti ne bom obljubil
Everyone saw what happened.	Vsi so videli, kaj se je zgodilo.
I've talked about this before.	O tem sem že govoril.
He's not here tonight.	Nocoj ga ni.
He called himself.	Poklical je sam.
I knew something had happened	Vedel sem, da se je nekaj zgodilo
How well I did it.	Kako dobro sem to naredil.
He knew he would not decide soon.	Vedel je, da se ne bo kmalu odločil.
We knew what was going on, but no one talked about it.	Vedeli smo, kaj se dogaja, a nihče ni govoril o tem.
He's never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni naredil.
It's still there.	Še vedno je tam.
I don't have time for that.	Nimam časa za to.
I heard about it this morning	Zjutraj sem slišal za to
I don't think there's anything wrong with me.	Mislim, da z mano ni nič narobe.
There are so many of them.	Toliko jih je.
I'm there with you, man.	Tam sem s tabo, človek.
You used to love school.	Včasih si imel rad šolo.
We really don't know for sure.	Res ne vemo zagotovo.
I saw it happening	Videl sem, da se to dogaja
I didn't even hear him come into the room	Sploh ga nisem slišal, da je prišel v sobo
I see.	vidim.
Good, he said.	Dobro, je rekel.
He had to tell her.	Moral ji je povedati.
I still have a lot of work to do	Imam še veliko dela
I will never forget him.	Nikoli ga ne bom pozabil.
I mean, he had it for me.	Mislim, imel je zame.
He's going out.	On gre ven.
Tell him, baby.	Povej mu, otrok.
Now we are going to do something you want to do.	Zdaj bomo naredili nekaj, kar želite storiti.
I don't want anymore.	Nočem več.
That's what I wanted to see.	To sem hotel videti.
You're never home.	Nikoli nisi doma.
I hope it's not because of me	Upam, da ni zaradi mene
He looked tired and weary.	Videti je bil utrujen in utrujen.
I thought you were my friend too	Tudi jaz sem mislil, da si moj prijatelj
They are not.	Niso.
I was like a boy sitting down	Bil sem kot fant, ki bi sedel
I know what you mean	Vem, kaj misliš
You won't come back.	Ne boš se vrnil.
Man, he couldn't go home now.	Človek, zdaj ni mogel domov.
You should see everything.	Vse bi moral videti.
He was lucky and really found it.	Imel je srečo in ga je res našel.
I couldn’t believe what I just saw	Nisem mogel verjeti, kaj sem pravkar videl
I realized he was right	Spoznal sem, da ima prav
I think maybe someone else	Mislim, da je morda še kdo
Obviously this was not true.	Očitno to ni bilo res.
It was actually nice.	Pravzaprav je bilo lepo.
I hope nothing happened	Upam, da se ni nič zgodilo
I am yours and you are mine	Jaz sem tvoj in ti si moj
I didn’t know how to feel about it	Nisem vedela, kako naj se ob tem počutim
It's pretty simple.	To je precej preprosto.
Now we have to do it.	Zdaj moramo to storiti.
Good is not good enough.	Dobro ni dovolj dobro.
I can see everything, you know	Lahko vidim vse, veš
I didn't even know	sploh nisem vedel
I want you to tell me	Želim si, da bi mi povedal
I still haven't found it	Še vedno ga nisem našel
All this is true.	Vse to je res.
Maybe I could help her.	Mogoče bi ji lahko pomagal.
A little here, a little there.	Malo tukaj, malo tam.
I just didn't say anything.	Samo nisem rekel nič.
He didn't eat.	Ni jedel.
I think that's a good thing	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar
I don't know what that was	Ne vem, kaj je to bilo
I knew it would never work	Vedel sem, da nikoli ne bo uspelo
I can't help you with that	Pri tem ti ne bom mogel pomagati
I think it was a possibility	Mislim, da je bila možnost

I was very sorry to see them leave	Zelo mi je bilo žal, ko sem jih videl oditi
It was you.	To si bil ti.
It still won't be long enough.	Še vedno ne bo dovolj dolgo.
She will want to know what happened.	Želela bo vedeti, kaj se je zgodilo.
That's what he said.	To je tudi rekel.
And that's what we're going to do today.	In to bomo storili danes.
The only way to do that is to work.	Edini način za to je delo.
I probably could.	Verjetno bi lahko.
I seem to have done everything right too	Zdi se, da sem tudi jaz naredil vse v redu
There weren't many of them.	Ni jih bilo veliko.
I'm not afraid of you	ne bojim se te
Or it would.	Ali pa bi se.
I loved being with him	Všeč mi je bilo z njim
I know it's hard.	Vem, da je težko.
I learned a lot.	Naučil sem se veliko.
I told him never to talk to me again.	Rekel sem mu, naj nikoli več ne govori z mano.
I think we'll have to see.	Mislim, da bomo morali videti.
That’s why it was so hard for her.	Prav zaradi tega ji je bilo tako težko.
It's true.	Res je.
He is absolutely right.	Ima popolnoma prav.
This is obvious.	To je očitno.
I found a lot of them.	Našel sem jih veliko.
He had such a good day too.	Tudi on je imel tako dober dan.
Everyone is at it.	Vsi so pri tem.
You won't get that.	Tega ne boš dobil.
Maybe a little better.	Mogoče malo bolje.
I will never see her again.	Nikoli več je ne bom videl.
But it's none of my business.	Ni pa moja stvar.
Don’t think you will have time or luck.	Ne mislite, da boste imeli čas ali srečo.
It never comes forward again.	Nikoli ne pride več naprej.
He did it.	On je to storil.
I'm going here.	Grem sem.
And she wasn't the only one.	In ni bila edina.
Someone is doing it.	Nekdo to počne.
They both wanted them.	Oba sta si jih želela.
I wanted to stay busy	Hotel sem ostati zaposlen
Everyone.	Vsak.
She wanted to see people.	Želela je videti ljudi.
Not for me, he thinks.	Ne zame, misli.
I couldn't stay there	Nisem mogel ostati tam
I don't care how.	Ne zanima me, kako.
I couldn't reach him	Nisem mogel priti do njega
That's the problem.	To je problem.
It may be enough for both.	Morda bo dovolj za oba.
I just want to know how it is	Želim samo vedeti, kako je
I've never seen anything like it.	Še nikoli nisem videl takega.
However, it can only be me.	Vendar pa sem to lahko samo jaz.
Unfortunately, that is not the case.	Žal ni tako.
I thought it would be nice.	Mislil sem, da bo lepo.
Again, there is nothing wrong with that.	Spet s tem ni nič narobe.
He was actually an okay guy.	Pravzaprav je bil v redu fant.
Life is not like that.	Življenje ni tako.
I knew it well.	Dobro sem vedel.
I was sure it would be okay	Prepričan sem bil, da bo to v redu
I had a lot of them too	Tudi jaz sem jih imel veliko
You know it's me.	Veš, da sem jaz.
I think you did it here	Mislim, da si to naredil tukaj
They're all there.	Vsi so tam.
I knew he had a lot of them.	Vedel sem, da jih ima veliko.
I thought maybe it was yours	Mislil sem, da je morda tvoj
I was still waiting for him to come home	Še vedno sem čakal, da pride domov
I shouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi smel početi.
I never wanted to leave	Nikoli nisem hotel oditi
I was a father	Bil sem oče
I waited and waited.	Čakal sem in čakal.
What can I do about it? 	Kaj lahko storim za to?
I didn't see what it was	Nisem videl, kaj je bilo
There was no time when it wouldn’t be for me.	Ni bilo časa, ko je ne bi bilo zame.
I understand you had a hard time too	Razumem, da si imel tudi ti težko
That's how it was here.	Tako je bilo tukaj.
They always are and always will be.	Vedno so in vedno bodo.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
Or maybe so.	Ali pa morda tako.
He didn't seem to know her anymore.	Zdelo se je, da je ne pozna več.
For a lot of people, that would be it.	Za veliko ljudi bi bilo to to.
i believe in it.	verjamem v to.
He failed.	Ni mu uspelo.
It doesn't get any better than that.	Ne gre bolje od tega.
I'm afraid.	Bojim se.
No, I wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
I couldn’t see who he was	Nisem mogel videti, kdo je bil
He had known for a long time.	Že dolgo je vedel.
It was a beautiful life for us here.	Za nas je bilo tukaj lepo življenje.
He doesn't know how good he is.	Ne ve, kako dober je.
I was never very good at that either	Tudi v tem nisem bil nikoli zelo dober
I didn’t even know he had it	Sploh nisem vedel, da ga ima
It's like it's .	Kot da je .
I couldn't even tell you what's in there	Sploh ti ne bi mogel povedati, kaj je tam

I couldn't eat.	Nisem mogel jesti.
I went there once	Enkrat sem šel tja
He will always find time.	Vedno si bo našel čas.
I expected a lot and got so much more.	Pričakoval sem veliko in dobil toliko več.
There are too many of them.	Preveč jih je.
A man who has a job is a good thing	Človek, ki ima službo, je dobra stvar
And we shouldn't.	In ne bi smeli.
Sometimes it is.	Včasih je.
He actually loved them.	Pravzaprav jih je imel rad.
I have never met anyone like myself	Nisem še srečal nikogar, kot je sam
I asked where he was	Vprašal sem, kje je
Everything he said was true.	Vse, kar je rekel, je bilo res.

I knew you would leave	Vedel sem, da boš odšel
That wouldn’t happen right away.	To se ne bi zgodilo takoj.
I hope you can do it today	Upam, da ti bo danes lahko

I should do something now.	Zdaj bi morala nekaj narediti.
I gave it to her.	Dal sem ji ga.
I couldn't tell you any of that	Nič od tega ti ne bi mogel povedati
I told him to do it for me	Rekel sem mu, naj to naredi namesto mene
I hope he's not gone yet	Upam, da ni že odšel
I was already pretty sure, but I wasn’t sure who	Bil sem že precej prepričan, vendar nisem bil prepričan, kdo
If at all possible.	Če je sploh mogoče.
He will never return.	Nikoli se ne bo vrnil.
You really like it.	Ti je res všeč.
I was never good enough	Nikoli nisem bil dovolj dober
That's what it's for.	Za to je.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
I could never do without him	Nikoli ne bi mogel brez njega
Maybe no one knew who he was.	Mogoče nihče ni vedel, kdo je.
I can't believe you came for me	Ne morem verjeti, da si prišel po mene
How about I go from there, please.	Kaj če bi šel od tam, prosim.
I was here a few years ago, but I had to leave	Tukaj sem bil nekaj let nazaj, a sem moral oditi
I almost lost it.	Skoraj sem ga izgubil.
I can't believe you did this to me	Ne morem verjeti, da si mi to naredil
I think we'll be fine	Mislim, da bomo v redu
Just because you could.	Samo zato, ker bi lahko.
I lost so many things.	Izgubil sem toliko stvari.
He's not doing it now.	Zdaj tega ne počne.
I called her out	Poklical sem jo ven
I'd rather work for.	Raje bi delal za.
I like it in almost everything.	Všeč mi je v skoraj vsem.
What you said.	Kar si rekel.
I didn't need anything else	Nič drugega nisem potreboval
Maybe the only thing.	Mogoče edina stvar.
I couldn't be sure.	Nisem mogel biti prepričan.
But who is convinced that we should not.	Kdo pa je prepričan, da ne bi smeli.
I can't tell you anymore	Več vam ne morem povedati
She knew immediately that she was right.	Takoj je vedela, da ima prav.
I didn't see anyone come out	Nisem videl, da bi kdo prišel ven
For a few years.	Za nekaj let.
He knew so well.	Tako dobro je vedel.
Good, good, good.	Dobro, dobro, dobro.
I was really surprised	Bil sem res presenečen

This is happening.	To se dogaja.

I didn’t expect to be home so soon.	Nisem pričakoval, da bom tako kmalu domov.
They also knew that.	To so tudi vedeli.

I just wish everything was okay	Želim samo, da bi bilo vse v redu
I wasn't ready to know	Nisem bil pripravljen vedeti
This has been going on for quite some time.	To se dogaja že kar nekaj časa.

I see you're back	Vidim, da si se vrnil
Why.	Zakaj .
I asked what you think, that's all	Vprašal sem, kaj misliš, to je vse
But it happened.	Ali se je to zgodilo.

This is true.	To je res.
I didn’t know what was going to happen to me	Nisem vedel, kaj se bo zgodilo z mano

I completely understand that.	To popolnoma razumem.
That's not enough for me.	To mi ni dovolj.
I knew you'd be angry, that's why	Vedel sem, da boš jezen, zato

We'll see how it goes.	Bomo videli kako bo.
He wanted her to know he heard her.	Želel je, da ve, da jo je slišal.
They won't.	Ne bodo.
We should move on.	Morali bi iti naprej.

But I had to do it	Vendar sem moral to storiti
It's so nice to see.	Tako lepo je videti.
There was too much work.	Bilo je preveč dela.
I like you very much	Zelo si mi všeč
He hasn't been here in a while.	Že nekaj časa ga ni bilo.
But I know you know that	Vem pa, da to veš
She said ok.	Rekla je v redu.
And he probably liked what he saw.	In verjetno mu je bilo všeč, kar je videl.
I'm glad to see you	vesel sem da te vidim
However, we have not seen this.	Vendar tega nismo videli.
I want to do this, but I don’t have the money	To želim narediti, vendar nimam denarja
This is not the first time this has happened.	To se ni zgodilo prvič.
It's all together.	Vse skupaj je.
I wonder if she was someone who worked here	Zanima me, ali je bila nekdo, ki je delal tukaj
Where to go.	Kam iti.
I wanted you to know a few things about it.	Želel sem, da veš nekaj stvari o tem.
I wanted to eat more of them.	Želel sem jih jesti več.
I know what happened.	Vem, kaj se je zgodilo.
I will tell you everything	Povedal vam bom vse
There were a lot of people here tonight.	Nocoj je bilo tukaj veliko ljudi.
I don't know anything about that	Ne vem nič o tem
I have to believe that	To moram verjeti
I'm sure we will.	Prepričan sem, da bomo.
He had plenty of time.	Imel je veliko časa.
I actually like that I don’t have it	Pravzaprav mi je všeč, da ga nimam
Nothing has ever been so simple.	Nič ni bilo nikoli tako preprosto.
I have to move on.	Moram naprej.
No.	Ne.
It's all before.	Je vse prej kot.
The teacher said he wouldn't do that.	Učitelj je rekel, da tega ne bo naredil.
'to'.	'do'.
He waited three days.	Tri dni je čakal.
I didn’t know what he was thinking at the time	Takrat nisem vedel, kaj je mislil
I usually wouldn’t do that.	Običajno tega ne bi storila.
I knew you were with me every day	Vedel sem, da si z mano vsak dan
Not for this one.	Ne za tega.
You were right I was not feeling well.	Prav si imel, da mi ni dobro.
I didn't know you were interested in the baby	Nisem vedela, da te zanima otrok
I know where he lives because he told me	Vem, kje živi, ​​ker mi je povedal
I don't think anyone wants to	Mislim, da nihče noče
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
She said no one was home.	Rekla je, da ni nikogar doma.
He didn't look good.	Ni bil videti dobro.
I wanted him to be with me	Želela sem, da bi bil z mano
No one would ever want that.	Nihče si tega ne bi nikoli želel.
It wasn't hard.	Ni bilo težko.
I just need a little more time	Potrebujem le malo več časa
The man has my stuff.	Človek ima moje stvari.
In fact, this is almost never done.	Pravzaprav se to skoraj nikoli ne naredi.
Isn't that a lot?	Ali ni to kar veliko?
He is a good teacher.	Je dober učitelj.
I tried to walk away from him	Poskušal sem oditi od njega
But I would like to	Bi pa želel
But that didn't happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
I heard what happened	Slišal sem, kaj se je zgodilo
There really wasn’t much work.	Res ni bilo veliko dela.
I don't even have a home.	Nimam niti doma.
I see them here all the time	Ves čas jih vidim tukaj
I thought it was him	Mislil sem, da je on
And no one went.	In nihče ni šel.
Every child has their own book.	Vsak otrok ima svojo knjigo.
I'm sure he's fine	Prepričan sem, da je v redu
I mean, obviously.	Mislim, očitno.
I'm sure it's nothing	Prepričan sem, da ni nič
I wanted to tell you.	Hotel sem ti povedati.
Really gotta go!!!.	Res je treba iti!!!.
It could be you.	To si lahko ti.
Or one.	Ali pa takega.
You should be happy about that.	Moral bi biti vesel tega.
Nothing would happen.	Nič se ne bi zgodilo.
Probably both of us.	Verjetno sva oba.
I'm sorry about that.	Žal mi je za to.
I did too much	Počel sem preveč
I was still trying to help	Še vedno sem poskušal pomagati
I really wonder how true that is.	Res se sprašujem, koliko je to res.
That was not the case.	To ni bilo tako.
I didn't need anyone	Nikogar nisem potreboval
I know how it happened	Vem, kako se je to zgodilo
I won't play with me anymore	Ne bom se več igral z mano
I know him.	Poznam ga.
I’m just not sure what that will be.	Samo nisem prepričan, kaj bo to.
I spoke to him yesterday	Včeraj sem se slišal z njim
I didn't call him at all	Sploh ga nisem poklical
I really need a job	Zelo potrebujem službo
I would like to ever give, give, give.	Rad bi kdaj dal, dal, dal.
I go there all the time	Ves čas grem tja
You have to do something for me.	Moraš nekaj narediti zame.
I would know that	To bi vedel
I was just a boy.	Bil sem samo fant.
Now I am the only one who can help her	Zdaj sem edini, ki ji lahko pomaga
I was completely alone	Bila sem popolnoma sama
You, if necessary.	Ti, če je treba.
He was a good kid.	Bil je dober otrok.
I did it once	Enkrat sem to naredil
All of this can be like that.	Vse to je lahko tako.
Probably right about that too.	Verjetno tudi glede tega prav.
that's how I want to see you	tako te želim videti
I want a simple room	Želim si preprosto sobo
I would see her	Videl bi jo
At the moment, I can't tell you why	Trenutno vam ne morem povedati zakaj
I need to make sure you're serious	Moram se prepričati, da misliš resno
If they are lucky.	Če bodo imeli srečo.
I think he liked you	Mislim, da si mu bil všeč
I didn’t think it would be that long	Nisem si mislil, da bo tako dolgo
I really saw you that way	Res sem te videl tako
I just want to be.	samo želim biti.
I wish he was here to teach you too	Želim si, da bi bil tudi on tukaj, da bi te naučil
I had so many once	Enkrat sem jih imel toliko
I have something to tell you.	Nekaj ​​ti moram povedati.
That will be true.	To bo res.
I was expecting you	Pričakoval sem te
I will do as he asked	Naredil bom, kot je prosil
But she did nothing.	Vendar ni storila ničesar.
I know that pretty much	To precej vem
Not so fast.	Ne tako hitro.
Perhaps there is more to it.	Morda je na tem še kaj več.
And it will.	In bo.
Your father, and now this.	Tvoj oče, zdaj pa še to.
I'll probably get back to that.	Verjetno se bom k temu še vrnil.
And maybe it was, just a little.	In morda je bilo, samo malo.
We have to be.	Moramo biti.
I don't know how it was	Ne vem, kako je bilo
These are the things we need to do.	To so stvari, ki jih moramo narediti.
He likes to talk.	Rad govori.
I'm afraid that won't be enough either	Bojim se, da tudi to ne bo dovolj
I mean, you're right.	Mislim, imaš prav.
I fully understand that	To popolnoma razumem
I loved working with him	Všeč mi je bilo delati z njim
But I've never seen anyone there	Tam pa še nikoli nisem videl nikogar
No one ever had.	Nihče nikoli ni imel.
I know both of them.	Poznam oba.
I've never felt this way before	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil
I haven't even asked him yet	Sploh ga še nisem vprašal
I have to do it myself	To moram narediti sam
They didn't do that.	Tega niso storili.
I completely understand	popolnoma razumem
I want to be a little alone	Želim biti malo sam
But I don't know what happened to that.	Ne vem pa, kaj se je zgodilo s tem.
I wonder what he meant by that.	Zanima me, kaj je mislil, da je s tem mislil.
I didn’t want to do anything wrong.	Nisem hotel narediti nič narobe.
he said.	rekel je.
This is unlikely to happen.	To se verjetno ne bo zgodilo.
Apparently pretty fast.	Očitno precej hitro.
That needs to be done.	To je treba storiti.
We should be there.	Morali bi biti tam.
It was all behind us.	Vse to je bilo za nami.
I should have done something to keep this from happening	Moral bi narediti nekaj, da se to ne bi zgodilo
Don't say anything.	Ne govori ničesar.
I know a lot of things	Poznam veliko stvari
In fact, there is nothing more than that.	Pravzaprav ni nič več od tega.
I can’t believe there’s nothing we can do about it	Ne morem verjeti, da ne moremo kaj storiti glede tega
I needed to know how he was doing	Moral sem vedeti, kako mu gre
I've known them for a long time	Poznam jih že dolgo
I think it's better.	Bolje se mi zdi.
I need you to be you	Potrebujem te, da si ti
there you are.	tam ste.
It helps a lot.	Zelo pomaga.
I did my job.	Opravil sem svoje delo.
There was something, but not so much.	Nekaj ​​je bilo, a ne toliko.
It's really simple now.	Zdaj je res preprosto.
I told him what was going on	Povedal sem mu, kaj se dogaja
And rightly so.	In tako je prav.
It seemed to be him.	Zdelo se je, da je to on sam.
That's a lot of people.	To je veliko ljudi.
I believe.	Verjamem.
Something here and something there	Nekaj ​​tukaj in nekaj tam
I did something today	Danes sem nekaj naredil
Maybe he was just surprised.	Morda je bil preprosto presenečen.
I'm sorry I ever did that.	Žal mi je, da sem to kdaj storil.
What did he do.	Kaj je naredil.
He said that was fine.	Rekel je, da je to v redu.
If I could go back and tell her.	Če bi se lahko vrnil in ji povedal.
I mean, it was.	Mislim, bilo je.
He's right behind me.	On je takoj za mano.
He won't be back for a long time.	Ne bo se vrnil še dolgo časa.
And there he was.	In tam je bil.
I didn’t expect him to say that	Nisem pričakoval, da bo to rekel
She went on.	Šla je naprej.
I almost wanted her	Skoraj sem jo želel
It's okay, it was good.	Ni kaj, bilo je dobro.
That's what he told us.	To nam je povedal.
However, I was glad she did	Vendar sem bil vesel, da je to storila
No, it's not true.	Ne, ni res.
I wish him that forever	To mu želim za vedno
I suspect you wouldn't like it	Sumim, da ti ne bi bila všeč
Now tell me.	Zdaj pa mi povej.
I can not believe	Ne morem verjeti
I can't say what he thinks	Ne morem povedati, kaj si misli
I was a little surprised	Bil sem malo presenečen
It seems good to me.	Zdi se mi dobro.
v	v
I didn't say anything	Nič nisem rekel
You want to see everything.	Želiš videti vse.
I thought you were my friend	Mislil sem, da si moj prijatelj
Nobody called me after that	Po tem me ni nihče poklical
Good for you.	Dobro zate.
I called her quickly	Hitro sem jo poklical
He didn't say much about it.	O tem ni veliko povedal.
I have no home	nimam doma
But that's not all, there's more.	A to še ni vse, je še več.
I didn't expect him to give me anything	Nisem pričakoval, da mi bo kaj dal
You should be angry.	Moral bi biti jezen.
I have no doubt it will be fine	Ne dvomim, da bo v redu
Who knows how long.	Kdo bi vedel, kako dolgo.
Together or not.	Skupaj ali ne.
This is very unlikely.	To pa je zelo malo verjetno.
I don't believe that anymore	Tega ne verjamem več
I could never do that	Tega nikoli ne bi mogel storiti
And he's still at home.	In doma je še vedno.
I don’t care what a man can do.	Ne zanima me, kaj človek lahko naredi.
He saw her.	Videl jo je.
That was not enough.	To ni bilo dovolj.
And that would be for me.	In to bi bilo zame.
I kept trying to do something	Kar naprej sem poskušal nekaj narediti
That’s how I saw and heard things	Tako sem videl in slišal stvari
I still have this problem	Še vedno imam ta problem
Anyone interested in going ?.	Se kdo zanima iti?.
Even if only a little.	Tudi če je le malo.
I think they are.	Mislim, da so.
You know, you know.	Veš, veš.
I need to know you're okay	Moram vedeti, da si v redu
I would like to.	Jaz bi si želel.
No one will come back to him.	Nihče se mu ne bo vrnil.
I think it could be something else	Mislim, da je lahko kaj drugega
I've seen enough.	Dovolj sem videl.
I'd rather work as a teacher than here	Raje bi delal kot učitelj kot tukaj
Not for us.	Ne za nas.
I'm just thinking about my kids.	Samo mislim na svoje otroke.
You really should see that	Res bi moral to videti
I think I should leave now	Mislim, da bi moral zdaj oditi
And it's still better than nothing.	In še vedno je bolje kot nič.
I never thought so	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da je tako
I said no again.	Spet sem rekel ne.
I have children there.	Tam imam otroke.
It was hard for him to be alone.	Težko mu je bilo biti sam.
You'd know someone was here anyway.	Tako ali tako bi vedeli, da je nekdo tukaj.
It really wouldn’t be right to see him here.	Res ne bi bilo prav, da bi ga videli tukaj.
They had a job.	Imeli so delo.
He is something more.	On je nekaj več.
I hope you work so he can come home	Upam, da boš delal, da bo lahko prišel domov
I just didn’t expect it	Preprosto nisem pričakoval
I mean, you can, if you want	Mislim, lahko si, če želiš
Life at home was not that hard after that.	Življenje doma po tem ni bilo tako težko.
It wasn't easy for me.	Ni mi bilo lahko.
Obviously good	Očitno dober
I told you about it once	Enkrat sem ti povedal o tem
I have more thoughts.	Imam več misli.
Not from me, you won't.	Ne iz mene, ne boš.
It's happening to me now.	Zdaj se mi dogaja.
I think I would do that.	Mislim, da bi to storila.
I hope to be a better self	Upam si biti boljši jaz
I thought something was wrong.	Mislil sem, da je nekaj narobe.
I wouldn't die.	Ne bi umrl.
I would, as soon as I had the chance.	Bi, takoj ko bi imel priložnost.
I went back, but I couldn't find her	Vrnil sem se nazaj, vendar je nisem našel
That time is not now.	Ta čas ni zdaj.
I really didn’t expect that to be possible.	Res nisem pričakoval, da bo to mogoče.
But he couldn't be sure.	Vendar ni mogel biti prepričan.
I used to be.	Včasih sem bil.
I wish he never would	Želim si, da ga nikoli ne bo
I didn't want to see	Nisem hotel videti
I could do it myself	Lahko bi to naredil sam
Now she knew this was not going to happen.	Zdaj je vedela, da se to ne bo zgodilo.
Only.	Samo.
Everyone is everyone.	Vsi so vsi.
He never talked about it.	Nikoli ni govoril o tem.
They did what they had to.	Naredili so, kar so morali.
I didn't hear them come	Nisem jih slišal priti
I've never seen this before	Še nikoli prej tega nisem videl
I didn't know if they were alive	Nisem vedel, če so živi
He realized how little he knew him.	Spoznal je, kako malo ga pozna.
He is very happy about that.	Zelo je vesel tega.
He could never be a real father.	Nikoli ne bi mogel biti pravi oče.
There was no more work.	Ni bilo več dela.
You did this to us.	To si nam naredil.
I'm glad to have you.	Vesel sem, da te imam.
He said he couldn't believe it.	Rekel je, da ne more verjeti.
We had little money.	Imeli smo malo denarja.
I really like it	Res mi je všeč
That’s when I knew there was something wrong with me	Takrat sem vedel, da je z mano nekaj narobe
I know there are a lot of them.	Vem, veliko jih je.
There is also a lot of play.	Veliko se tudi igra.
I had to say a few things	Moral sem povedati nekaj stvari
I think they're on me	Mislim, da so na meni
You obviously don't know that.	Tega očitno ne veš.
She knew that.	To je vedela.
He said he wouldn't forget to tell you.	Rekel je, da ti ne bo pozabil povedati.
And he liked it.	In všeč mu je bilo.
I had something else	Imel sem nekaj drugega
I haven't for a long time	že dolgo nisem
Just once.	Samo enkrat.
Why? 	Zakaj?
And maybe they still are.	In morda so še vedno.
I hadn't met them here before that day	Še pred tisti dan jih nisem srečal tukaj
I didn't stay there because of you	Nisem ostal tam zaradi tebe
I didn’t have to be happy about it	Ni mi bilo treba biti vesel zaradi tega
What did they have.	Kaj so imeli.
I don't want money	Ne želim denarja
I'm not going to do that here.	Tukaj tega ne bom storil.
It's here.	To je tukaj.
I was very lucky	Imel sem veliko srečo
Maybe I don't have much time	Morda nimam veliko časa
I didn’t know where to go from there.	Nisem vedel, kam naj grem od tam.
I’m not even sure how.	Sploh nisem prepričan, kako.
I just knew he would be there	Samo vedel sem, da bo tam
As it has been all my life.	Kot je bilo vse življenje.
I'm going out.	grem ven.
The father is not afraid of work.	Oče se dela ne boji.
I think he knows what he's doing	Mislim, da ve, kaj dela
I wasn’t surprised he was already gone	Nisem bil presenečen, da je že odšel
I had to see him again	Moral sem ga spet videti
On	Na
I learned that there is a lot in me	Naučil sem se, da je v meni veliko
Maybe that will be okay.	Mogoče bo to v redu.
Why I would do that, I don’t know either.	Zakaj bi to storil, tudi jaz ne vem.
We did it right then and there.	To smo storili prav takrat in tam.
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
I always thought you'd come back	Vedno sem mislil, da se boš vrnil
That would be something.	To bi bilo nekaj.
I think it is.	Mislim, da je.
He will know what to do.	Vedel bo, kaj storiti.
I don't think that would be easy	Mislim, da to ne bi bilo lahko
I wasn’t so sure anymore	Nisem bil več tako prepričan
I was not so surprised	Nisem bil tako presenečen
They were there.	Tam so bili.
I just wouldn't.	Samo ne bi.
I didn’t have many	Nisem jih imel veliko
That nothing will happen.	Da se ne bo nič zgodilo.
I understand what it is.	Razumem, kaj je.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ni mogel več.
To and from work.	Na delo in z dela.
You were right there.	Prav tam si bil.
Which is probably very true.	Kar je verjetno zelo res.
That's not a problem.	To ni problem.
He won't say that.	Ne bo rekel tega.
So I wonder why this is happening.	Zato se sprašujem, zakaj se to dogaja.
More than you know.	Več kot veste.
Someone would talk.	Nekdo bi govoril.
I think this guy will be good for you	Mislim, da bo ta fant dober zate
He did what he could.	Naredil je, kar je mogel.
And a lot of people do that.	In veliko ljudi to počne.
I know what he knows	Vem, kaj on ve
Not like him.	Ne kot on.
I knew all about it	O tem sem vedel vse
He saw that.	To je videl.
Not everyone, no.	Ne vsi, ne.
Maybe we will.	Mogoče bomo.
But he didn't come.	Vendar ni prišel.
I couldn’t believe what was going on	Nisem mogel verjeti, kaj se dogaja
I hope he became a better man.	Upam, da je postal boljši človek.
I can see it from here.	To lahko vidim od tukaj.
I hope you admit it soon	Upam, da boš kmalu priznal
Sometimes it's nice.	Včasih je lepo.
He always said that.	Vedno je to rekel.
I have to do a few things	Moram narediti nekaj stvari
I was also glad to be back here.	Prav tako sem bil vesel, da sem se vrnil sem.
I don't see that as a problem	Ne vidim, da je problem
You should be there already	Moral bi biti že tam
I think he went there	Mislim, da je tja šel
Not much of that.	Ni veliko tega.
I have decided	Odločil sem se
I didn't have to go back	Ni mi bilo treba iti nazaj
No, that wouldn't be right.	Ne, to ne bi bilo prav.
Maybe it already is.	Morda je že.
Probably tonight or tomorrow.	Verjetno nocoj ali jutri.
He saw it too.	Tudi on je to videl.
I didn’t know what was happening to me	Nisem vedel, kaj se mi dogaja
It simply wasn't like that.	Preprosto ni bilo tako.
And soon everyone would know.	In kmalu bi vsi vedeli.
I wasn’t the one doing any of this.	Nisem bil jaz tisti, ki je delal kaj od tega.
And a little more for another.	In še malo za drugega.
You often are.	Pogosto ste.
It lives on.	To živi naprej.
I didn’t know what was going on behind it	Nisem vedel, kaj se dogaja za tem
The work was not difficult.	Delo ni bilo težko.
I knew what was there	Vedel sem, kaj je tam
I need to know if he's still here	Moram vedeti, če je še tukaj
I never knew what it was.	Nikoli nisem vedel, kaj je to.
I see him doing this every day	Vidim ga, da to počne vsak dan
I haven't seen you in a long time	že dolgo te nisem videl
It was not like that with us.	Pri nas ni bilo tako.
If true.	Če je res.
I heard about everything that happened	Slišal sem za vse, kar se je zgodilo
I just had to see	Samo videti sem moral
Seriously, nothing can be done.	Resno, nič se ne da narediti.
He succeeded	To mu je uspelo
It was him.	Bila je on.
I know you will be good	Vem, da boš dober
I wouldn't without telling you	Ne bi, ne da bi ti povedal
I think it should be me	Mislim, da bi moral biti jaz
He was no longer convinced of anything today.	Danes ni bil več prepričan v nič.
And they had good reason.	In imeli so dober razlog.
I told him he had to help me	Rekel sem mu, da mi mora pomagati
I wish that was not the case	Želim si, da temu ni tako
It's nothing.	Pa ni nič.
I needed her here.	Potreboval sem jo tukaj.
I didn’t know what was wrong	Nisem vedel, kaj je narobe
I thought he liked you	Mislil sem, da si mu všeč
I do not have any children.	Nimam otrok.
I knew he was right	Vedel sem, da ima prav
It doesn't just come from me.	Ne gre samo od mene.
Or maybe it still is.	Ali pa je morda še vedno.
Maybe not all.	Mogoče ne vse.
I was very happy.	Bil sem zelo vesel.
I can’t talk about it at the moment	Trenutno ne morem govoriti o tem
I haven't seen him in a while.	Že nekaj časa ga nisem videl.
Really little.	Res malo.
I’ve never seen a time when it wouldn’t be	Še nikoli nisem videl časa, ko ga ne bi bilo
I did everything myself	Vse sem naredil sam
I know what you mean	vem kaj misliš
So much money.	Toliko denarja.
I wonder how much he heard.	Sprašujem se, koliko je slišal.
And yet not a boy.	Pa vendar ne fant.
We have to go home.	Moramo iti domov.
I said my thing	Povedal sem svoje
I'm not leaving here	ne bom odšel od tukaj
When you're not in it, you're not there.	Ko nisi v tem, te tam ni.
I don’t know if this thing exists or not.	Ne vem, če ta stvar obstaja ali ne.
I loved the way he talked about it.	Všeč mi je bilo, kako je govoril o tem.
Many still do.	Veliko jih še vedno počne tako.
I don't do that anymore	tega ne počnem več
And how do you know he's going to die?	In kako veš, da bo umrl?
That's what she wanted.	To je želela.
Not like that anymore.	Ne več tako.
I mean really, really a lot of things	Mislim res, res veliko stvar
And that's hard.	In to je težko.
It didn't feel right for her to go into that room.	Ni se ji zdelo prav, da bi šla v to sobo.
Long time.	Dolgo časa.
I also think we should leave tonight	Tudi jaz mislim, da bi morali oditi nocoj
I just expected to be alone again	Samo pričakoval sem, da bom spet sam
He felt tired.	Počutil se je utrujen.
I may not know tomorrow	Jutri morda ne vem
That's why we're here.	Zato smo tukaj.
I saw what was going on	Videl sem, kaj se dogaja
It used to be.	Prej je bilo.
I didn't see well	Nisem dobro videl
How much per day? 	Koliko na dan?
he asked.	je vprašal.
I see this very well now	Zdaj to zelo dobro vidim
He had no children.	Ni imel otrok.
And that was enough.	In to je bilo dovolj.
I never said any of that	Nikoli nisem rekel ničesar od tega
I wanted to help right away	Želel sem pomagati takoj
I really believe in that	V to zelo verjamem
I like that, he says.	To mi je všeč, pravi.
I don't know how.	Jaz ne vem, kako.
You will know.	Vedel boš.
And he looked angry.	In bil je videti jezen.
I really liked it	Res mi je bila zelo všeč
Let me see her.	Naj jo vidim.
I hope he was good	Upam, da je bil dober
I thought you'd make it.	Mislil sem, da ti bo uspelo.
He can't do anything.	Nič ne more.
As if you knew.	Kot bi vedel.
I've never seen him lose like that	Še nikoli ga nisem videl, da bi tako izgubil
I wouldn't say much.	Ne bi rekel veliko.
I tried and it wasn’t easy for me.	Poskušal sem in mi ni bilo lahko.
I want someone to know	Želim, da nekdo ve
I just have to be ready	Samo pripravljen moram biti
It was a good day.	Bil je dober dan.
Maybe I'm going for it wrong.	Morda grem na to narobe.
I will be with you forever and ever	Vedno in za vedno bom s tabo
I thought he knew what you did.	Mislil sem, da ve, kaj si naredil.
I forgot why.	Pozabil sem zakaj.
And you should go.	In bi moral iti.
I don't know why that is.	Ne vem, zakaj je temu tako.
I won't like it.	Ne bo mi všeč.
We know, we know.	Vemo, vemo.

I wanted what they had	Hotel sem, kar so imeli
I may not go at all tomorrow	Jutri morda sploh ne bom šel
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will happen.	Mogoče ne danes, morda ne jutri, a zgodilo se bo.
Coming soon.	Kmalu.
I will never forget that	Tega ne bom nikoli pozabil
You have to tell me what you want.	Povedati mi moraš, kaj si želiš.
Would.	Bi.
I did what he did.	Naredil sem kar on.
I knew he needed help	Vedel sem, da potrebuje pomoč
I have nothing to do today	Danes nimam kaj početi
I promised her she wouldn't tell anyone.	Obljubil sem ji, da ne bo nikomur povedal.
I just wanted to help him	Želela sem mu samo pomoč
I will definitely buy more.	Zagotovo bom kupil več.
We would be fine.	Mi bi bili v redu.
I just have to tell you	Samo povedati ti moram
There’s really not much to say.	Pravzaprav ni veliko za povedati.
I couldn't tell who he was	Nisem mogel povedati, kdo je bil
However, he did not come for help.	Vendar ni prišel po pomoč.
I'm sorry about that.	Žal mi je za to.
Please if anyone can help me with this.	Prosim, če mi kdo pomaga pri tem.
I still haven’t decided	Še vedno se nisem odločil
I bought some time	Kupil sem nekaj časa
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Morda, morda, morda.
I was very good at it	Bil sem zelo dober pri tem

They have never been alone.	Sami še nikoli niso bili.
I didn’t have too much to do with him.	Nisem imel preveč dela z njim.
I've told everyone that before	To sem že vsem povedal
I can't do everything.	Ne morem narediti vsega.
I'll tell you something.	ti bom nekaj povedal.
I don't have to tell you.	Ni mi treba povedati.
It's really okay.	Res je v redu.
I don't want to talk now.	Zdaj ne želim govoriti.

Nobody wants to play with him.	Nihče se noče igrati z njim.
I am a child.	jaz sem otrok.
I have to convince you of that	V to vas moram prepričati
That cannot be possible.	To ne more biti mogoče.
I thought maybe the one who did it would come back	Mislil sem, da se bo morda vrnil tisti, ki je to storil
I know people.	poznam ljudi.
I didn't find them	Nisem jih našel
I just don't understand that	Samo tega ne razumem
No, she said.	Ne, je rekla.
More than a little.	Več kot malo.
I've never seen them	Nikoli jih nisem videl
You know it's not.	Saj veš, da ni.
I can't believe you made it this far	Ne morem verjeti, da ti je uspelo do sem
A child, she said	Otrok, tako je rekla
I would simply call them and ask this question.	Preprosto bi jih poklical in vprašal to vprašanje.
I hope you continue to enjoy it!	Upam, da vam bo še naprej všeč!
If they only knew.	Ko bi le vedeli.
This is not possible.	To ni mogoče.
I wasn’t sure of anything	Nisem bil prepričan v nič
There is enough time for that.	Za to je dovolj časa.
That does not seem to be the case.	Zdi se, da ni tako.
I didn't expect that	Tega nisem pričakoval
I knew and was willing to help	Vedel sem in bil pripravljen pomagati
I am nobody.	jaz sem nihče.
I really wouldn't know	res ne bi vedel
I did so many things wrong	Toliko stvari sem naredil narobe
I would just know what to do.	Vedel bi le, kaj storiti.
I could tell you that	To bi ti lahko povedal
He's not mine either.	Tudi on ni moj.
Or it is.	Ali pa je.
I think he's home alone	Mislim, da je sam doma sam
I didn't know where you were going	Nisem vedel, kam si šel

Here is.	Tukaj je.
I couldn't be here.	Ne bi mogel biti tukaj.
And maybe not.	In morda ne.
I mean, and it feels like it helped	Mislim, in počuti se, kot da je pomagal
I don't want to stay here	Nočem ostati tukaj
I will never forget that.	Tega ne bom nikoli pozabil.
I really wanted to	Res sem si želela
Sometimes right, sometimes wrong.	Včasih je prav, včasih narobe.
All he needs is money.	Vse kar potrebuje je denar.
I just wanted to tell you	Hotel sem ti samo povedati
I'm only interested in the work.	Zanima me samo delo.
I didn’t do anything wrong last night	Sinoči nisem naredil nič narobe
I was not for nothing	Nisem bil za nič
There are a lot of things together.	Skupaj je veliko stvari.
It's been here a long time.	Tukaj je že dolgo.
You shouldn't either.	Tudi ti ne bi smel.
I'm sure they were right about that.	Prepričan sem, da so imeli glede tega prav.
I had nothing to do	Nisem imel kaj narediti
It took me a long time to get here.	Dolgo sem potreboval, da sem prišel sem.
I didn't expect it.	Nisem pričakoval.
That's better than nothing.	To je bolje kot nič.
I can't tell you for sure	Ne morem ti povedati zagotovo
I saw that right away	To sem takoj videl
That would be fine.	To bi bilo v redu.
She knew.	Vedela je.
I didn't call them at all last night	Sinoči jih sploh nisem poklical
Nothing more than that.	Nič več kot to.
Maybe that's the way it should be.	Mogoče pa tako mora biti.
And not so long ago.	In ne tako dolgo nazaj.
She was everything.	Bila je vse.
I thought it would be for a while.	Mislil sem, da bo za nekaj časa.
He was right.	Imel je prav.
I mean, never.	Mislim, nikoli.
I can't, she said.	Ne morem, je rekla.
No, I wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
Everyone liked her.	Vsem je bila všeč.
That's why you came here.	Zato si prišel sem.
What's happening?.	Kaj se dogaja?.
This is still my game.	To je še vedno moja igra.

I doubt he'll be back	Dvomim, da se bo vrnil
I know a lot of people	Poznam veliko ljudi
You still could, you know	Še vedno bi lahko, veš
However, this is a bit more work.	Vendar je to malo več dela.
It was none of my business.	To ni bila moja stvar.
I had to get out.	Moral sem ven.
I just have to do something	Samo nekaj moram narediti
I don't want to be alone again	Nočem biti spet sam
I know it's true	Vem, da je res
I didn't have time for that	Nisem imel časa za to
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
There is a lot of money.	Denarja je veliko.
They did not have.	Niso imeli.
You should know this is going to happen	Moral bi vedeti, da se bo to zgodilo
Not everyone was in favor of it.	Niso bili vsi za to.

But it didn’t happen.	Vendar se ni zgodilo.
It doesn't have to be that hard.	Ni treba, da je tako težko.
I wasn’t sure what it was at the time	Takrat nisem bil prepričan, kaj je to
The next day he came and said he had bought it.	Naslednji dan je prišel in rekel, da ga je kupil.
I thought he was serious	Mislil sem, da resno misli
I was talking about knowing what to do	Govoril sem o tem, da bi vedel, kaj storiti
I shouldn't be there	Ne bi smel biti tam
Sometimes they weren't there at all.	Včasih jih sploh ni bilo.
No one has done that yet.	Tega še nihče ni storil.
That was difficult.	To je bilo težko.
I had to know for sure	Moral sem vedeti zagotovo
I started to help myself	Začel sem si pomagati

I had to make sure it was okay	Moral sem se prepričati, da je v redu
I'm here with you	Tukaj sem s tabo

You and me.	Jaz in ti.

He can't even play.	Tudi igrati se ne more.
I know they are here	Vem, da so tukaj
He saw something else there.	Tam je videl nekaj drugega.
I thought he might not have heard me	Mislil sem, da me morda ni slišal
That was really it.	Res je bilo to.
It will be fine.	V redu bo.
Dad has already said that.	Oče je to že rekel.
I didn't have to eat anything	Nič nisem moral jesti

I didn't want anyone to talk to me	Nisem hotel, da bi kdo govoril z mano
He was surprised.	Bil je presenečen.
I'm afraid it's serious.	Bojim se, da je resno.
That happened.	To se je zgodilo.
And he doesn't come.	In ne pride.
We can't anymore.	Ne moremo več.
I thought everyone already knew	Mislil sem, da so že vsi vedeli
You should have seen him sooner	Moral bi ga videti prej
But I was glad to see them.	Vendar sem bil vesel, da sem jih videl.
Just like us, ”she said.	Tako kot mi,« je rekla.
Maybe he didn't.	Morda ni imel.
We would be home soon.	Kmalu bi bili doma.
It makes her feel better.	Zaradi tega se počuti bolje.
I had nothing else to do	Nisem imel kaj drugega početi
I really don't understand that.	Tega res ne razumem.
It’s so much better because he would never want me.	Tako je bolje, ker me nikoli ne bi hotel.
I could know that all day	To bi lahko vedel ves dan
I have to.	Moram.
I know what you mean	Vem kaj si mislil
I wasn’t sure it would be anything	Nisem bil prepričan, da bi bilo kaj
I hope it never comes	Upam, da nikoli ne pride
I think he's pretty angry	Mislim, da je precej jezen
I'm going out for a while.	Za nekaj časa grem ven.
I'll be leaving soon.	Kmalu bom odšel.
We need to go together and we need to stay together.	Moramo iti skupaj in moramo ostati skupaj.
I have to leave early tomorrow	Jutri moram zgodaj oditi

He knew it would be soon.	Vedel je, da bo tudi kmalu.
I loved going there, just like all of us	Rad sem šel tja, tako kot vsi mi
I didn't even know	Sploh nisem vedel
He waited long enough.	Čakal je dovolj dolgo.
What happened and what can be done about it.	Kaj se je zgodilo in kaj je mogoče storiti glede tega.
I was a little above him now	Zdaj sem bil nekoliko nad njim
It wasn’t like he needed money.	Ni bilo tako, kot da bi potreboval denar.
Okay, now tell me something.	V redu, zdaj pa mi nekaj povej.
It is now.	Zdaj je.
But we are here.	Vendar smo tukaj.
That needs to be worked on.	Na tem je treba delati.
He is.	on je.
I couldn’t work for days	Več dni nisem mogel delati
He says he doesn't know.	Pravi, da ne ve.
They just aren't there yet.	Samo še niso tam.
Obviously none of this is good.	Očitno nič od tega ni dobro.
It won't happen.	Ne bo se zgodilo.
I would never want to do that	Tega ne bi nikoli želel narediti
I never did that	Nikoli tega nisem storil
And we don't know what.	In ne vemo za kaj.
I didn't have that	Tega nisem imel

I ask you for that	za to vas prosim
I know he knows.	Vem, da ve.
I just have a question	Imam samo vprašanje

I hope she's doing well	Upam, da ji gre dobro

I really liked it	Res mi je bilo všeč
I can't stay here	Ne morem ostati tukaj
I didn’t even ask for these things	Sploh nisem prosil za te stvari

I was glad to see him	Vesel sem bil, da sem ga videl
I shouldn't talk to you at all	Sploh ne bi smel govoriti s tabo
It's just beautiful.	Preprosto je lepo.
I have several.	Imam jih več.
I definitely love the people there.	Zagotovo imam rad ljudi tam.
I hope you like it	Upam, da vam bo všeč
I knew about it.	Vedel sem za to.
He also seems to have done what he wanted.	Zdi se, da je tudi on naredil, kar je hotel.
I need to know how things are with him	Moram vedeti, kako so stvari z njim
I just wanted you to know that.	Samo hotel sem, da to veš.
Really, you can.	Res, lahko.
We have enough time now.	Zdaj imamo dovolj časa.
That's more than that.	To je več kot to.
There is something wrong with all of this.	Pri vsem tem nekaj ni v redu.
I wouldn't anymore	ne bi več
I already know what he will tell me	Že vem, kaj mi bo povedal
I still think it's better	Še vedno mislim, da je to bolje
Because it doesn't help anyone.	Ker nikomur ne pomaga.
He really said that.	Res je to rekel.
Or it should be.	Ali pa naj bi bilo.
But no one seems to care.	A zdi se, da nikogar ne zanima.
I haven't found it yet	Nisem še našel
Very, very wrong.	Zelo, zelo narobe.
I thought he was into it	Mislil sem, da je v to
I was surprised at that	Bil sem presenečen nad tem
I see what he means.	Vidim, kaj misli.
I won some, but not much	Nekaj ​​sem zmagal, a ne veliko

I lost three days	Izgubil sem tri dni

I can't tell you all this	Vsega tega ti ne morem povedati
I already forgot you	sem te že pozabil
I could never do that.	Tega nikoli ne bi mogel storiti.
I had to say something.	Nekaj ​​sem moral povedati.
It's you.	To je vas.
I wanted to see.	Hotel sem videti.
I never knew what he did	Nikoli nisem vedel, kaj je naredil
And he wanted to help.	In hotel je pomagati.
I didn't really mean it.	Nisem res mislil.
I like what you said	Všeč mi je, kar si rekel
If they were lucky.	Če so imeli srečo.
I was the one who left	Jaz sem bil tisti, ki je odšel
The thing he had	Stvar, ki jo je imel
He had been waiting for this for years.	Na to je čakal leta.
I hope you like it.	Upam, da vam je všeč.
I could do so much for you	Lahko bi naredil toliko zate
I think we should move on	Mislim, da bi morali iti naprej
Some time ago.	Nekaj ​​časa nazaj.
I became very, very good very, very fast	Zelo, zelo dobro sem postal zelo, zelo hitro
But he could learn.	Vendar se je lahko naučil.
There they are.	Tam so.
I didn't know who he was	Nisem vedel, kdo je
The person must be perfect or not	Oseba mora biti popolnoma ali ne
I wanted to be yours	Hotel sem biti tvoj
Much more than once.	Veliko več kot enkrat.
He didn't speak.	Ni govoril.
It could be years.	Lahko bi bila leta.
Do you know.	Ali veš.
I will go with him	odšel bom z njim
We still know what is true.	Še vedno vemo, kaj je res.
I thought you'd like it	Mislil sem, da ti bo všeč
I had to convince him	Moral sem ga prepričati
I know what to say.	Vem, kaj bi rekla.
It's okay that he's here.	V redu je, da je tukaj.
Everything is here.	Vse je tukaj.
He didn't see her even then.	Tudi takrat je ni videl.
Something knows you something.	Nekaj ​​vas pozna nekaj.
Which she did.	Kar je storila.
That's what we did.	Tako smo naredili.
Like many.	Kot veliko.
Not even here.	Niti tukaj.
And he never succeeded.	In nikoli mu ni uspelo.
I think I could do something	Mislim, da bi lahko nekaj naredil
Not too much.	Ne preveč.
It was all just that.	Vse je bilo samo to.
This was not the first time either.	Tudi to ni bilo prvič.
Who would have thought?	Kdo bi si mislil?
This is what happened here.	To se je zgodilo tukaj.
I have too much work to do	Za to imam preveč dela
I didn't think it would be like that	Nisem si mislil, da bo tako
In fact, this is not the case.	Pravzaprav temu ni tako.
No one even knows where he is.	Nihče niti ne ve, kje je.
I have to get out for a while	Za nekaj časa moram ven
He's like.	On je kot.
I wanted to stay with him	Želela sem ostati z njim
It was not possible	Ni bilo mogoče
I'm really not sure about that.	V to res nisem prepričan.
Maybe you never did.	Mogoče nisi nikoli.
The question is whether you mean business or not.	Vprašanje je, ali misliš resno ali ne.
No, it's just you.	Ne, samo ti si.
You should be back.	Moral bi biti nazaj.
I gave it all back and went home	Vse sem dal nazaj in odšel domov
There's nothing I can do	Ne morem nič delati
I will ask for help.	Prosil bom za pomoč.
I want the guy to go with me	Želim, da gre fant z mano
I hope so.	Upam, da bo.
I have so much work to do tomorrow	Jutri imam toliko dela
I love you very much	zelo te imam rad
I really like it.	Res mi je všeč.
So, so, so lucky.	Tako, tako, tako srečo.
He gave me that opportunity.	Dal mi je to priložnost.
I've been in this city all this time	Ves ta čas sem bil v tem mestu
He was glad he did.	Bil je vesel, da je.
They went together.	Šla sta skupaj.
He was very good at what he did.	Bil je zelo dober v tem, kar je počel.
Because he didn't know what else to say.	Ker ni vedel, kaj bi še rekel.
Probably that was it.	Verjetno je bilo to to.
I don't want to go without you.	Nočem iti brez tebe.
Let him think.	Naj misli.
It didn't seem difficult.	Ni se zdelo težko.
I still haven't said anything	Še vedno nisem rekel ničesar
That's not a problem.	To ni problem.
I know how it is	Vem kako je
I've never heard of it.	Nikoli nisem slišal za to.
I know he has.	Vem, da ima.
You, child.	Ti, otrok.
You know what you did.	Veš kaj si naredil.
Maybe that's the case here.	Morda je tukaj tako.
He won't come.	Ne bo prišel.
You will be fine.	Dobro ti bo.
I thought he could play	Mislil sem, da zna igrati
Because you can.	Ker lahko.
.	.
And so it goes.	In tako to gre.
He didn't want to know, but he knew.	Ni hotel vedeti, a je vedel.
In the morning it was as if nothing had happened.	Zjutraj je bilo, kot da se ni nič zgodilo.
I could do it myself	Lahko bi to naredil sam
The time was right.	Čas je bil pravi.
I'll leave for the day.	Pustil bom za dan.
I haven't met her since	Od takrat je nisem več srečal
To this morning, I didn’t even know it existed	Do danes zjutraj nisem niti vedel, da obstaja
And that's almost all of them.	In to so skoraj vsi.
And so it happened.	In tako se je tudi zgodilo.
I tried to help, but no one let me	Poskušal sem pomagati, a mi nihče ni dovolil
I wanted to know a lot more	Želel sem vedeti veliko več
And that's good enough.	In to je dovolj dobro.
I think you've asked enough	Mislim, da si dovolj vprašal
He just has to.	Samo mora.
I needed help, but it wasn’t there	Potreboval sem pomoč, a je ni bilo
I had to see if you were okay,	Moral sem videti, če si v redu,
I didn’t think this was possible for you.	Nisem si mislil, da je to mogoče zate.
I just didn't say	Samo nisem rekel
I didn’t even think he wanted to talk to me	Nisem si niti mislil, da bi hotel govoriti z mano
That was not good enough.	To ni bilo dovolj dobro.
I would be home alone all the time	Ves čas bi bil sam doma
I've never heard of you	Nikoli nisem slišal zate
So I want to see them again	Tako si jih želim spet videti
You already left.	Ti si že odšel.
She said it was mine.	Rekla je, da je moj.
I was very happy to see her	Bil sem zelo vesel, da sem jo videl
It's going again.	Spet gre.
I thought of it as my luck	Mislil sem na to kot na svojo srečo
It's so beautiful.	Tako lepo je.
I really have nothing to say in this	V tem res nimam kaj povedati
I won't be long now	Zdaj ne bom dolgo
This is something else.	To je nekaj drugega.
That's right.	Tako tudi res.
I worked too hard to get here	Preveč sem delal, da sem prišel sem
I need more help here	Potrebujem več pomoči tukaj
If only that were true.	Ko bi le bilo to res.
I never felt that way.	Nikoli se nisem tako počutil.
This is a good friend.	To je dober prijatelj.
He was there for a long time.	Dolgo je bil tam.
I am not and cannot be	nisem in ne morem biti
I asked him where he got the book.	Vprašal sem ga, kje je dobil knjigo.
I don't think so	Mislim, da res ni
You don't have to be sorry.	Ni vam treba biti žal.
I was ready to do it	Bil sem pripravljen to storiti
Not even that.	Tudi to ne.
I wouldn’t need anything else	Ne bi potreboval ničesar drugega
I've never seen myself like that	Nikoli se nisem videl takega
We just have to do it.	Samo to moramo narediti.
And even that would not be enough.	Pa tudi to ne bi bilo dovolj.
He told him he had no one to make him.	Rekel mu je, da nima nikogar, ki bi ga naredil.
So far it is.	Do zdaj je.
I asked her what was wrong with me	Vprašal sem jo, kaj je narobe z mano
She did nothing.	Nič ni storila.
I just haven't seen her in a long time	Samo dolgo je nisem videl
I've told you too much already	Preveč sem ti že povedal
I'm not sure if you knew that.	Nisem prepričan, če si to vedel.
I have so much to tell you	Toliko ti moram povedati
You know, I've never been to this day	Veste, do danes nisem nikoli
I always knew that day would come	Vedno sem vedel, da bo prišel ta dan
I love it when he does that	Všeč mi je, ko to počne
I would ask him myself	Tudi sam bi ga vprašal
Today, tomorrow, next week.	Danes, jutri, naslednji teden.
No more of that.	Nič več tega.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
I wanted her right away	Takoj sem si jo želel
We like it.	Všeč nam je.
I know the real reason	Poznam pravi razlog
I've never met them before	Še nikoli jih nisem srečal
How could I.	Kako bi lahko.
I was just helping you	Jaz sem ti samo pomagal
No one has ever seen him.	Nihče ga ni nikoli videl.
I know them, okay	Poznam jih, v redu
That was what was so hard.	To je bilo tisto, kar je bilo tako težko.
He felt very tired.	Počutil se je zelo utrujen.
I did what needed to be done.	Naredil sem, kar je bilo treba.
I knew something was wrong	Vedel sem, da nekaj ni v redu
It's hard work.	To je težko delo.
I didn't expect that much	Nisem pričakoval toliko
There were a few.	Nekaj ​​jih je bilo.
He really wanted to believe her.	Zelo ji je želel verjeti.
I loved the time here	Všeč mi je bil čas tukaj
However, it is more likely not to be that simple.	Vendar je bolj verjetno, da ne bo tako preprosto.
He had to believe.	Moral je verjeti.
But more than that is happening.	A dogaja se več kot samo to.
I know where he lives	Vem, kje živi
I haven't heard anything in a few days.	Že nekaj dni nisem slišal ničesar.
I hope they are alive	Upam, da so živi
We're probably fine.	Verjetno smo v redu.
I decided to keep talking.	Odločil sem se, da bom še naprej govoril.
It's true, he said.	Res je, je rekel.
He was just a good man.	Bil je samo dober človek.
i will tell you about everything	govoril vam bom o vsem
That's right.	To je takoj.
Which again failed.	Kar spet ni uspelo.
He didn't hear anything.	Ničesar ni slišal.
I just played with you	Pravkar sem se igral s tabo
It's been a long time.	To je dolgo časa.
I couldn't eat anything.	Ničesar nisem mogel jesti.
I walked around the room	Šla sem po sobi
He has to me.	Mora me.
He could buy what he needed.	Lahko je kupil, kar je potreboval.
I have enough time	Imam dovolj časa
No one spoke because they didn’t know what was going on.	Nihče ni govoril, saj ni vedel, kaj se dogaja.
He's not so sure.	On, ni tako prepričan.
I know enough things to say	Vem dovolj stvari za povedati
I wonder what he thinks	Zanima me, kaj si misli
Boy, you got it.	Fant, imaš to.
I didn't know he was in this city.	Nisem vedel, da je v tem mestu.
He went on.	Šel je naprej.
I could have it.	Lahko bi ga imel.
He said he couldn't.	Rekel je, da ne more.
If he's that good.	Če je tako dober.
I already have it together.	Jaz ga že imam skupaj.
I could leave tonight.	Lahko bi odšel nocoj.
I'm not so sure about that	V to nisem tako prepričan
I had to see her.	Moral sem jo videti.
I had a lot of time	Imel sem veliko časa
He does absolutely nothing.	Popolnoma nič ne naredi.
Good thing you're interested.	Še dobro, da te zanima.
I never made that	Tega mi nikoli ni uspelo
I once felt that way myself	Enkrat sem se tudi sam počutil tako
We are together now.	Zdaj sva skupaj.
That was better.	Tako je bilo bolje.
I am very happy to see here	Zelo sem vesel, da vidim tukaj
I wasn’t sure what was supposed to happen	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj naj bi se zgodilo
I never knew about it.	Nikoli nisem vedel za to.
I want to stay home with you	Želim ostati doma s tabo
Don't tell yourself anything.	Nič si ne povej.
You and me.	Ti in jaz.
I think it's true	Mislim, da je res
He heard nothing.	Nič ni slišal.
I should tell you that	To bi ti moral povedati
And we still have that today.	In to imamo še danes.
I did it for us	Počel sem to za nas
I can't since	Od takrat ne morem več
That's right.	Tako je.
I had to help her	Moral sem ji pomagati
I'd rather stay here	Raje bi ostal tukaj
I didn’t come back just for the money.	Nisem se vrnil samo zaradi denarja.
He didn't do that.	Tega ni storil.
And it's true.	In res je.
From.	Od.
You are a true friend.	Ti si pravi prijatelj.
I don't see anything wrong with that	V tem ne vidim nič narobe
I wasn’t sure if it worked or not.	Nisem bil prepričan, ali dela ali ne.
I was a long time ago	Sem že dolgo nazaj
I couldn't be better	Ne bi mogel biti boljši
Just like last night.	Tako kot sinoči.
I wonder if anything can be done	Zanima me, če se da kaj narediti
I mean, it happened right after that	Mislim, zgodilo se je takoj za tem
I know something is wrong now	Vem, da je zdaj nekaj narobe
He really was home.	Res je bil doma.
Not them today.	Danes jih ne.
He promised me that.	To mi je obljubil.
I said it was going to happen	Rekel sem, da se bo to zgodilo
She went out.	Šla je ven.
I need someone like you	Potrebujem nekoga, kot si ti
She will never know.	Nikoli ne bo vedela.
I don't know where he is here	Ne vem, kje je tukaj
I was left alone again	Še enkrat sem ostal sam
Because you know, none of us do it alone.	Ker veste, nihče od nas tega ne naredi sam.
I was the only child there	Bil sem edini otrok tam
This is also wrong	To je tudi narobe
You came for more.	Prišel si po več.
They should both be there.	Oba bi morala biti tam.
I've heard enough.	Slišal sem dovolj.
I never knew you came	Nikoli nisem vedel, da si prišel
would not.	ne bi.
I wanted to know what was going on	Hotel sem vedeti, kaj se dogaja
I didn’t expect him to do that	Nisem pričakoval, da bo to storil
Everyone was fine.	Vsi so bili v redu.
Someone was here.	Nekdo je bil tukaj.
I do not.	Jaz ne.
There is something more there.	Tam je nekaj več.
I want to see you soon	Želim te kmalu videti
You will get it.	Dobil boš.
I don't know what's going on.	Ne vem kaj se dogaja.
Who would say such a thing.	Kdo bi rekel kaj takega.
That seems to be the case.	Zdi se, da je temu tako.
I don’t know what it is or would be.	Ne vem, kaj je to ali bi bilo.
It was here.	Tukaj je bilo.
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni več.
A lot had to be done.	Veliko je bilo treba narediti.
It is much more than that.	To je precej več kot to.
I can't get out of what's going on	Ne morem ven s tem, kar se dogaja
It just happened.	Pravkar je bilo.
I will never forget him, ever	Nikoli ga ne bom pozabil, nikoli
I don't think that's possible.	Mislim, da to ni mogoče.
I didn’t know what was going to happen	Nisem vedel, kaj se bo zgodilo
And yet, this thing must be.	In vendar, ta stvar mora biti.
He can't help it.	Ne more se pomagati.
If that's what you want.	Če si to želiš.
I went back to the house	Vrnil sem se v hišo
I see how it is.	Vidim, kot je.
I really am.	res sem.
I began to believe	Začel sem verjeti
I had to do something	Nekaj ​​sem moral narediti
I knew he couldn’t do much	Vedel sem, da ne more narediti veliko
But we have a lot of them.	Imamo pa jih veliko.
And something else.	In še nekaj.
I don't believe it is.	Ne verjamem, da je.
There is still a lot of work to be done.	Dela je še veliko.
There was no need to believe.	Ni bilo treba verjeti.
I could sit there and work or I could sit there.	Lahko bi sedel tam in delal ali pa bi sedel tam.
How could he be.	Kako bi lahko bil.
I would do more to you than he does	Naredil bi ti več kot on
I thought you'd like it.	Mislil sem, da ti bo všeč.
I will get to know you better	se bom bolje spoznal
It could be.	Bi lahko bilo.
I didn't think he wanted me	Nisem si mislil, da me želi
We still can't.	Še vedno ne moremo.
She wanted more.	Želela je več.
I'm there with you.	Tam sem s tabo.
I just thought you were	Samo mislil sem, da si
No one knows where he went.	Nihče ne ve, kam je odšel.
I hope you had a good day	Upam, da ste imeli dober dan
The only problem is who.	Edini problem je kdo.
I just don't want to believe it	Samo nočem verjeti
I think he'll be fine	Mislim, da bo z njim vse v redu
I just didn't know why	Samo nisem vedel zakaj
Today actually.	Danes pravzaprav.
I do this every day	To počnem vsak dan
I didn't even want her here tonight	Nocoj je sploh nisem hotel tukaj
I should never do anything to you before	Nikoli še ne bi smel storiti ničesar s tabo
I'm not sure here.	Tukaj nisem prepričan.
I would do anything to get it.	Naredil bi vse, da bi ga dobil.
That must be a big job.	To mora biti veliko delo.
I liked it right away	Takoj mi je bil všeč
Tell me what you know.	Povej mi, kaj veš.
I see why she likes it	Vidim, zakaj ji je všeč
I could call them and ask	Lahko bi jih poklical in vprašal
I didn’t do much	Nisem naredil veliko
I just need to know who will be doing what.	Samo vedeti moram, kdo bo kaj delal.
I knew right away what to do	Takoj sem vedel, kaj storiti
As if he could see.	Kot da bi lahko videl.
No, he saw.	Ne, videl je.
I want to know what else you saw	Rad bi vedel, kaj si še videl
Here today, no more tomorrow.	Danes tukaj, jutri ni več.
I have to be ready	Moram biti pripravljen
I wouldn't stay there anymore	Ne bi več ostal tam
I had to move on.	Moral sem iti naprej.
I wouldn't wait any longer	Ne bi več čakal
I wish I could see him	Želim si, da bi ga videl
It never will be.	Nikoli ne bo.
I'll be back.	vrnil se bom.
i really need help	res potrebujem pomoč
She said she needed to talk to me.	Rekla je, da mora govoriti z mano.
I think you were right	Mislim, da si imel prav
No one had any more.	Nihče ni imel več.
You might like it for tonight.	Morda vam bo všeč za nocoj.
This is simply not happening.	To se preprosto ne dogaja.
I just let it happen	Samo pustil sem, da se dogaja
I didn’t even go to work today	Danes sploh nisem šel v službo
It's much better.	Je veliko bolje.
I didn't feel well	Nisem se počutil dobro
I could give some money one day	Enkrat bi lahko dal nekaj denarja
That didn't happen.	To se ni zgodilo.
I didn't see her come	Nisem je videl priti
It has never been easy.	Nikoli ni bilo lahko.
You used to do that.	Včasih si to naredil.
I mean, yes, for that.	Mislim, da, za to.
I think he's right.	Mislim, da ima prav.
But I expected so much	Sem pa pričakoval toliko
It was so fast.	Tako je bilo hitro.
I’m not even sure what it is.	Sploh nisem prepričan, kaj je.
I want to help with that	Pri tem želim pomagati
He just lost everything.	Pravkar je izgubil vse.
I may never see him again	Morda ga ne bom nikoli več videl
But I see it happening.	Vidim pa, da se dogaja.
I almost couldn't	Skoraj nisem mogel
Do or when will.	Naredi ali kdaj bo.
But I knew what we had to do	Vedel sem pa, kaj moramo narediti
He, too, was only a child.	Tudi on je bil samo otrok.
I knew what he was doing	Vedel sem, kaj počne
Here and here.	Tukaj in tukaj.
That will be enough now.	Zdaj bo dovolj.
We are still here.	Še vedno smo tukaj.
That could be good.	To bi lahko bilo dobro.
I was tired all the time	Utrujen sem bil ves čas
I am no longer alone	nisem več sam
You taught me that.	Tega si me naučil.
He has never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni storil.
I've been here for years, alone	Tukaj sem že leta, sam
It was just you.	Bil si samo ti.
But we have work to do.	Vendar imamo delo.
I wasn't tired either	Tudi jaz nisem bil utrujen
I am, I am.	Sem, sem.
I've been here for a while.	Že nekaj časa sem bil tukaj.
I'm not as busy as any of you	Nisem tako zaposlen kot kdo od vas
He might not have spoken at all.	Morda sploh ni govoril.
I'm just so tired of it	Samo tako sem utrujen od tega
I know what you did to me	Vem, kaj si mi naredil
I was happy about that	Bil sem vesel tega
I will definitely be back	zagotovo se bom vrnil
He said he would do it.	Rekel je, da bo to storil.
I really was pretty much gone.	Res me je precej ni bilo.
We don't even know yet what will happen.	Sploh še ne vemo, kaj se bo zgodilo.
I haven't heard anything in a while	Že kar nekaj časa nisem slišal ničesar
I never told anyone about it	Nikoli nisem nikomur nič rekel o tem
I promised her.	Obljubil sem ji.
To be, he is here.	Biti, on je tukaj.
I only did this once.	To sem naredil samo enkrat.
So you know.	Da veš.
We know it's good now.	Vemo, da je zdaj dobro.
You could say she needs it	Lahko bi rekel, da ga potrebuje
You should get home sooner, that's all	Domov bi moral priti prej, to je vse
I didn't know any of that	Nič od tega nisem vedel
I'm sure you are too.	Prepričan sem, da tudi ti.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
I already called her	Sem jo že poklical
Which could be.	Kar bi lahko bilo.
Apparently the time has come.	Očitno je prišel čas.
I liked it a lot more now	Zdaj mi je bilo veliko bolj všeč
Which has never been seen before.	Kar še nikoli ni bilo videti.
I had to do it yesterday	Včeraj sem moral to narediti
I wanted so badly to like it.	Tako zelo sem si želel, da bi mi bilo všeč.
I have to go to work	moram v službo
And it really was.	In res je bilo.
I didn't mean anything by that	S tem nisem mislil nič
I didn't even speak for very long.	Niti govoril nisem prav dolgo.
But something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​pa je bilo narobe.
He said there was nothing wrong with me.	Rekel je, da z mano ni nič narobe.
I meant it.	Resno sem mislil.
I've seen it all before	Vse to sem že videl
I want to see this car myself	Sam si želim videti ta avto
They never saw me.	Nikoli me niso videli.
it will help me.	mi bo pomagal.
I also knew enough not to ask	Vedel sem tudi dovolj, da nisem vprašal
That could be it.	To bi lahko bilo to.
I think it could be even better	Mislim, da bi lahko bilo še bolje
Someone loves you.	Nekdo te ima rad.
It felt very good to me.	Zdelo se mi je zelo dobro.
I will win again tonight	Nocoj bom spet zmagal
I doubt anyone would say that now	Dvomim, da bi zdaj kdo to rekel
I wanted to do more than that with him tonight	Nocoj sem hotel z njim narediti več kot to
I think he was right.	Mislim, da je imel prav.
And three days before that.	In tri dni pred tem.
This is the week.	To je teden.
I have to be alone for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa moram biti sam.
Sometimes it is.	Včasih je.
Now I see he needs someone like him.	Zdaj vidim, da potrebuje nekoga, kot je on.
That’s when I knew what he was up to.	Takrat sem vedel, kaj namerava narediti.
I love you very much	Te imam zelo rad
This does not appear to be the case.	Zdi se, da temu ni tako.
But he had to know for sure.	Moral pa je vedeti zagotovo.
However, this is not the only way.	Vendar to ni edini način.
I saw that he still wanted me	Videl sem, da me še vedno želi
It is the same.	Prav tako je.
But before that we had to work.	Pred tem pa smo morali delati.
She wanted to believe.	Želela je verjeti.
I only met him once.	Srečal sem ga samo enkrat.
I think I should talk about it	Mislim, da bi moral govoriti o tem
I want to know more than that	Želim vedeti več kot to
I wish it was.	Želim si, da bi bilo.
You were there last night.	Sinoči si bil tam.
You've been before.	Bili ste že prej.
Because you're not.	Ker nisi.
I don't think so.	ne mislim.
I will help you.	jaz ti bom pomagal.
I did that yesterday and today	To sem naredil včeraj in danes
I've never seen her	Nikoli je nisem videl
Or he will lose his house.	Ali pa bo izgubil hišo.
I would like to go back.	Želela bi iti nazaj.
But she said none of that.	Vendar ni rekla nič od tega.
I already said that	To sem že rekel
Now was the time, he said.	Zdaj je bil čas, je rekel.
I mean, you met her	Mislim, spoznal si jo
I am sure.	Prepričan sem.
I have to go.	Moram iti.
I see why you like it so much	Vidim, zakaj ti je tako všeč
I know you've made up your mind	Vem, da si se odločil
I had to help him	Moral sem mu pomagati
He doesn't know how.	Ne ve, kako.
I have children.	imam otroke.
I didn’t even wait for it to come to me	Nisem niti čakal, da pride do mene
You should know better	Moral bi vedeti bolje
You always love your children.	Vedno imaš rad svoje otroke.
You were angry.	Bil si jezen.
But it is.	Ali je to.
I just got home	Pravkar sem prišel domov
I would never do that to you	Tega ti ne bi nikoli naredil
We'll see what he has to say.	Bomo videli, kaj ima za povedati.
He is here to help me.	Tukaj je, da mi pomaga.
I forgot about him for years	Leta sem ga pozabil
I was so glad to see him.	Tako vesel sem ga videl.
I've never been so alone	Še nikoli nisem bil tako sam
It's on everything.	Na vsem je.
I would like that.	To bi mi bilo všeč.
Just make them.	Samo naredi jih.
A little, not a lot	Malo, a ne veliko
I hope your day was good	Upam, da je bil tvoj dan dobro
You always can.	Vedno lahko.
It really would be.	Res bi bilo.
He had never seen her before and had never seen her again.	Še nikoli je ni videl in nikoli več je ni videl.
Very well, I should go.	Zelo dobro, moral bi iti.
This is often difficult for me	To mi je pogosto težko
Be ready.	Biti pripravljen.
I just have to keep working	Samo še naprej moram delati
As if that were work.	Kot bi bilo to delo.
I didn't know what to believe.	Nisem vedel, kaj naj verjamem.
Well, it's not likely.	Pa ni verjetno.
But it was never easy.	A nikoli ni bilo lahko.
Everything was here.	Vse je bilo tukaj.
I thought, maybe.	Mislil sem, mogoče.
I couldn’t have done better	Ne bi mogel narediti bolje
I always thought it was just me.	Vedno sem mislil, da gre samo zame.
I don't think you can.	Mislim, da ne moreš.
It does that for me, too.	To počne tudi zame.
This is who and what you are.	To je kdo in kaj ste.
He is not the only one.	Ni pa edini.
Not just now.	Ne samo zdaj.
But he could do it	Lahko pa bi to naredil
He needed something.	Nekaj ​​je potreboval.
I'm not interested in that either.	Tudi mene to ne zanima.
Not so much now.	Zdaj pa ne toliko.
We need to talk.	Moramo govoriti.
That's how we did it.	Tako smo to storili.
I ate something	nekaj sem jedel
I'm not feeling well today	Danes se ne počutim dobro
I didn’t know what it was	Nisem vedel, kaj je to
I want to work with you	Želim delati s tabo
I saw nothing and heard nothing	Nič nisem videl in nič slišal
That's what I wanted.	To sem hotel.
It was hard work.	To je bilo težko delo.
I left him here	Pustil sem ga tukaj
I've been doing this for a long time	Dolgo sem to delal
I have to tell you something	nekaj ti moram povedati
I forgot how beautiful it was	Pozabil sem, kako lepo je bilo
He has no one.	On nima nikogar.
I wanted to be there early	Želel sem biti tam zgodaj
I could give her a lot more	Lahko bi ji dal veliko več
That is why it is difficult.	Zato je težko.
Can I see.	lahko vidim.
And the boy was helpful.	In fant je bil v pomoč.
But he will say so much.	Toliko pa bo povedal.
I had my thoughts	Imel sem svoje misli
It starts.	To počne.
I never needed them	Nikoli jih nisem potreboval
I just talked to him the day before	Pravkar sem govoril z njim prejšnji dan
He knew he would look good.	Vedel je, da bo videti dobro.
We didn’t know what else to do.	Nismo vedeli, kaj bi še naredili.
From then on, we were always together.	Od takrat naprej sva bila vedno skupaj.
Because of you.	Zaradi tebe.
I wouldn't be your friend if you didn't love me	Ne bi bil tvoj prijatelj, če me ne bi imel rad
That was good enough for me.	To je bilo zame dovolj dobro.
But I doubt anyone will come today	Dvomim pa, da bo kdo prišel danes
I thought you would come alone	Mislil sem, da boš prišel sam
I wouldn't want to do that	Tega ne bi hotel narediti
He wants to know who he is.	Želi vedeti, kdo je.
But you don't have to leave.	Vendar ti ni treba oditi.
I haven't seen him in front of this house yet	Pred to hišo ga še nisem videl
So it is better that no one will be surprised.	Zato je bolje, da nihče ne bo presenečen.
I actually liked it	Pravzaprav mi je bilo všeč
I didn't know you'd be here last night	Nisem vedel, da boš sinoči tukaj
Of which you can be sure.	V kar ste lahko prepričani.
no one is.	nihče ni.
But I wouldn’t wait long.	Vendar ne bi dolgo čakal.
I won’t even ask them where you were last night	Sploh jih ne bom vprašal, kje si bil sinoči
I need to know everything that's going on	Moram vedeti vse, kar se dogaja
I know you know more than you told me	Vem, da veš več, kot si mi povedal
I could see.	Lahko sem videl.
I'll be back for more	Vrnil se bom po več
I just helped him so he could stay with you.	Pomagal sem mu le, da je lahko ostal s tabo.
The man himself.	Človek sam.
How hard is that.	Kako težko je to.
I have to keep talking	Moram govoriti naprej
I loved everything about it	Všeč mi je bilo vse na tem
I don't care.	Sploh mi je.
I hadn't seen them before.	Do takrat jih še nisem videl.
I didn't want to be yours	Nisem hotel biti tvoj

And it really is pretty simple.	In res je precej preprosto.
I didn't expect you so early	Nisem te pričakoval tako zgodaj
I can't do this all day	Tega ne morem početi ves dan
If anyone is interested.	Če koga zanima.
There is a lot of talk about this in the city.	V mestu se o tem veliko govori.
No.	Ne.
I like it here.	Všeč mi je tukaj.
He's alone again	Spet je sam
I think the next day was even better.	Mislim, da je bilo naslednji dan še bolje.
He didn't see her.	Ni je videl.
You know what's going to happen.	Saj veš kaj se bo zgodilo.
You know, I shouldn't do that.	Veš, tega ne bi smel storiti.
It was very difficult.	Bilo je zelo težko.
I hope it will be good today	Upam, da bo danes dobro
Back to the house.	Nazaj v hišo.
I will be asking for help soon	Kmalu bom prosil za pomoč
We'll be fine.	Bomo v redu.
She knew before us.	Vedela je pred nami.
It was hard to believe anyone said.	Težko je bilo verjeti, da je kdo rekel.
There is so much to tell you and so little time.	Toliko vam je za povedati in tako malo časa.
You had to know when enough was enough.	Moral si vedeti, kdaj je dovolj.
He said nothing like this had happened to him before.	Rekel je, da se mu prej ni zgodilo nič takega.
I didn’t know much about it	Nisem vedel veliko o tem
I just wanted him to feel good	Hotel sem samo, da se počuti dobro
He didn't ask.	Ni vprašal.
I know you're going to die.	Vem, da boš umrl.
It was good, really good.	Bilo je dobro, res dobro.
Ready.	Pripravljen.
I knew it might be someday, but not soon	Vedel sem, da bo morda nekoč, a ne kmalu
Only a few things need to be done here.	Tukaj je treba narediti le nekaj stvari.
I really believe that	To res verjamem
I had to move on	Moral sem naprej
I have to believe it isn't	Moram verjeti, da ni

I just couldn’t help myself	Preprosto si nisem mogel pomagati
to that.	k temu.
He simply has.	Preprosto ima.
I want to talk about us	Želim govoriti o nas
You should probably go too.	Verjetno bi moral iti tudi ti.
I’ve done this more than once.	To sem storil več kot enkrat.
It's so hard.	To je tako težko.
I really like it together	Zelo mi je všeč skupaj
If the time comes.	Če pride čas.
I think he lost it right now	Mislim, da ga je trenutno izgubil
It's just for fun.	Gre samo za zabavo.
She had to go home the next day.	Naslednji dan je morala domov.
I hope this helps you.	Upam, da vam to pomaga.
I loved these things.	Všeč mi je bilo te stvari.
If he is, he might call us.	Če je, nas bo morda poklical.
He didn't say.	Ni rekel.
I think it worked	Mislim, da je to uspelo
I don't even want to be here	Sploh nočem biti tukaj
I really like the game.	Igra mi je zelo všeč.
And still.	In še vedno.
I know you still have it.	Vem, da ga še imaš.
I mean, after.	Mislim, po.
She was good.	Bila je dobra.
If not now, soon.	Če ne zdaj, kmalu.
Maybe it goes with that ?.	Mogoče gre s tem?.
We will do that.	To bomo storili.
I think he's happy about that	Mislim, da je vesel tega
It is all we are not.	Je vse, kar nismo.
He is here with me now.	Zdaj je tukaj z mano.
I like this guy very much	Ta fant mi je zelo všeč
I didn't know who they were.	Nisem vedel, kdo so.
I mean, you know where	Mislim, veš kje
He did it.	Naredil to.
What more does a man need?.	Kaj več človek potrebuje?.
He said he works for someone else.	Rekel je, da dela za nekoga drugega.
I also know how it feels	Tudi jaz vem, kako se počuti
He still feels good.	Še vedno se počuti dobro.
It's good now.	Zdaj je dobro.
I'll be back.	vrnil se bom.
You certainly don't know that.	Tega zagotovo ne veš.
I’ve never heard anyone talk about it before.	Nikoli prej nisem slišal, da bi kdo govoril o tem.
I could say almost immediately	Lahko bi rekel skoraj takoj
They saw nothing.	Nič niso videli.
In fact, I was very happy that they went together	Pravzaprav sem bil zelo vesel, da sta šla skupaj
He would come, but he probably wouldn’t stay.	Prišel bi, a verjetno ne bi ostal.
I can't believe he said that	Ne morem verjeti, da je to rekel
I was sure it was yours	Prepričan sem bil, da je tvoj
I couldn't help myself then	Takrat si nisem mogel pomagati
I wouldn't do that.	Ne bi tega naredil.
I couldn’t believe we were that lucky	Nisem mogel verjeti, da smo imeli to srečo
More years.	Več let.
I didn't see where he was going	Nisem videl, kam je šel
And it has hardly worked since.	In od takrat skoraj ne dela.
We have it every day.	Imamo ga vsak dan.
Not that.	Ne da bi.
The problem itself.	Sam problem.
I thought as if I wanted to know	Mislil sem, kot bi rad vedel
You didn't do anything.	Nič nisi storil.
She liked that.	To ji je bilo všeč.
You know that.	To veš.
No one knew why.	Nihče ni vedel zakaj.
It's pretty hard work.	To je precej težko delo.
I think it is possible.	Mislim, da se da.
I almost forgot	Skoraj sem pozabil
I never have been and probably never will be.	Nikoli nisem bil in verjetno nikoli ne bom.
She is very good at this.	V tem je zelo dobra.
It's not him.	To ni on.
Maybe I'll leave for a while	Morda bom za nekaj časa odšel
They just didn’t know where he was.	Samo niso vedeli, kje je.
I hope he knows that	Upam, da to ve
It was never right.	Nikoli ni bilo prav.
I would never do anything like that again	Nikoli več ne bi naredil kaj takega
He was out of work.	Bil je brez dela.
I didn't get it myself	Sam tega nisem dobil
Or maybe not anymore.	Ali pa morda ne več.
You know why you love him.	Veš zakaj ga imaš rad.
I couldn't just leave.	Nisem mogel kar oditi.
I just know something is going to happen	Samo vem, da se bo nekaj zgodilo
I wanted to tell you myself	Sam sem ti hotel povedati
I need him here with me.	Potrebujem ga tukaj z mano.
That's a lot for you.	To je veliko za vas.
He was good at it.	Bil je dober v tem.
I mean, it's obvious what it is.	Mislim, očitno je, kaj je.
No, it wasn't.	Ne, ni bilo.
He went to the hotel.	Šel je v hotel.
In fact, I just met her	Pravzaprav sem jo pravkar spoznal
there is something else I need to do	še nekaj moram početi
It's not enough.	Ni dovolj.
It wasn't much.	Ni bilo veliko.
It wasn't much.	Ni bilo veliko.
Which really wasn’t often.	Kar pa res ni bilo pogosto.
I knew this was it	Vedel sem, da je to to
Just like you are.	Tako kot si ti.
There's nothing you can do for me.	Nič ne moreš narediti zame.
She told me she couldn't stay long.	Rekla mi je, da ne more ostati dolgo.
You know.	Saj veš.
He never had and never will.	Nikoli ni imel in nikoli ne bo.
More than that needs to be done.	Narediti je treba več kot to.
I wish she were with us today.	Želim si, da bi bila danes z nami.
Can anyone please help.	Ali lahko kdo prosim pomaga.
I think everyone did everything they could.	Mislim, da so vsi naredili vse, kar so lahko storili.
I wonder why he didn’t give it.	Sprašujem se, zakaj ga ni dal.
But I knew it would be so	Vedel sem pa, da bo tako
But do nothing.	A storiti ničesar.
I've never had one before.	Nikoli prej nisem imel.
I'm afraid that's true	Bojim se, da je to res
He told me so much about it.	Toliko mi je povedal o tem.
I'm very, very sorry about that.	Zelo, zelo mi je žal za to.
I think it's a good thing.	Mislim, da je dobra stvar.
I don't know anything about that	Ne vem nič o tem
He's gone.	Ni ga več.
I'll be right away.	Takoj bom odšel.
He doesn't even know about it.	Sploh ne ve za to.
I'm very interested in what you think	Zelo me zanima kaj si mislite
I didn't expect to see him	Nisem pričakoval, da ga bom videl
I saw some of them	Nekaj ​​sem jih videl
I'm so glad you helped	Zelo sem vesel, da si pomagal
And it was probably true.	In verjetno je bilo res.
I can't get out of this now	Zdaj ne morem iz tega
I only came back to have you forever	Vrnil sem se samo zato, da bi te imel za vedno
I don't have a home without it	Brez tega nimam doma
I hope all is well	upam, da bo vse dobro
I had so much more to do	Še toliko sem moral narediti
I am this thing.	jaz sem te stvari.
I wish you never came here	Želim si, da nikoli nisi prišel sem
I'll be here if you need anything.	Tukaj bom, če boš kaj potreboval.
That's what his father taught him.	Tega ga je naučil oče.
That's hard enough.	To je dovolj težko.
I know we should never be.	Vem, da nikoli ne bi smeli biti.
I shouldn’t be so surprised	Ne bi smel biti tako presenečen
I was tired and wanted to stay home	Bil sem utrujen in hotel sem ostati doma
He won more than he lost.	Več je zmagal kot izgubil.
I couldn't help it	Nisem mogel pomagati
Unfortunately, this is not true.	To pa žal ni res.
So we'll see what happens.	Tako da bomo videli, kaj se bo zgodilo.
I never could.	nikoli nisem mogel.
I came to him	Prišel sem do njega
You should do this as soon as you arrive	To bi moral storiti takoj, ko si prišel
I have to go for a while	Moram iti za nekaj časa
I have nothing to do with this	Nimam nič s tem
I can't do without you.	Ne morem brez tebe.
I didn't mean to say that	Nisem hotel tega povedati
We will be here.	Tukaj bomo.
He really loves you, you know.	Res te ima rad, veš.
None of you.	Nihče od vas.
It was still early.	Bilo je še zgodaj.
I'm glad, man.	Vesel sem, človek.
He actually needs them.	Pravzaprav jih potrebuje.
You will love it.	Všeč ti bo.
I can't do anything at all	Sploh nič ne morem
I said yes, everything was fine with me	Rekel sem, da, z mano je bilo vse v redu
I've done this before	To sem storil že prej
Until tonight, I didn’t even know it existed	Do nocoj sploh nisem vedel, da obstaja
This is not a question.	To ni vprašanje.
Nice of you to come.	Lepo od tebe, da si prišel.
That's what I thought	To sem mislil
I asked her if she knew anyone she knew.	Vprašal sem jo, če pozna koga, ki ga pozna.
I wouldn’t know what it’s like to do that	Ne bi vedel, kako je to, da bi to naredil
It won't.	Ne bo.
I need to know it's okay	Moram vedeti, da je v redu
I do not want to.	nočem.

And man does not know how he got there.	In človek ne ve, kako je prišel tja.
I can't believe it's been so long	Ne morem verjeti, da je že tako dolgo
I hope he's not gone yet	Upam, da ni že odšel

Bo.	Bo.
I didn't get anything	Nič nisem dobil
This is not something that can be done this way.	To ni nekaj, kar se da narediti na ta način.
I can't do this.	Ne morem narediti tega.
I told him not to do that.	Rekel sem mu, naj tega ne počne.
We are here for you.	Tukaj smo za vas.
I can't help myself anymore	Ne morem si več pomagati
He spoke for some time.	Nekaj ​​časa je govoril.
I am ready for this job	Pripravljen sem na to delo
I think so.	Mislim, da.
He didn't have to.	Ni mu bilo treba.
He returned them.	Vrnil jih je.
I didn't want to be like him	Nisem hotel biti kot on
I’ve always done my own thing	Vedno sem delal svoje stvari
No one told her how to do it.	Nihče ji ni povedal, kako naj to naredi.
I felt really good.	Počutil sem se res zelo dobro.
She said she didn't do it.	Rekla je, da tega ni storila.

You were right.	Imel si prav.
I asked, but she didn't say	Vprašal sem, vendar ni rekla
They'll be home soon.	Kmalu bodo doma.
I was surprised	Bil sem presenečen

That would be completely wrong.	To bi bilo popolnoma narobe.
It's all or nothing here.	Tukaj je vse ali nič.
I wish I knew.	Želim si, da bi vedela.
I need some more time.	Potrebujem še nekaj časa.
I understand.	Razumem.
I knew it wasn't true.	Vedel sem, da ni res.
That was tomorrow.	To je bilo pa jutri.
I almost came home too	Tudi jaz sem skoraj prišel domov
It's just.	Samo je.
I mean eat at home	Mislim jesti doma
I heard him speak.	Slišal sem ga govoriti.
He hasn’t done it in so many years.	Toliko let ni naredil.
It is possible.	To je mogoče.
It was like that again sometimes, after several days.	Spet je bil tako včasih, po več dni.
I bought everything, I didn't even have to look.	Vse sem kupil, niti videti mi ni bilo treba.
And you.	In ti.
I know what it's like to be alone	Vem, kako je biti sam

I believe it exists	Verjamem, da obstaja
Now I really have to go	Zdaj moram res iti

I have not seen or heard him since	Od takrat ga nisem več videl in slišal
I will definitely succeed again	Zagotovo mi bo uspelo še enkrat
Or it ever would be.	Ali pa bi kdaj bilo.
Me too.	Tudi meni.
However, this is not a problem.	Vendar to ni problem.
I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for him.	Danes me ne bi bilo tukaj, če ne bi bilo njega.
He says this is not the first time he has done so.	Pravi, da to ni prvič, da to počne.
I've never felt this way before	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil
And got nothing back.	In dobil nič nazaj.
I think you know right away	Mislim, da takoj veš
The man did things himself	Človek je stvari delal sam

Today was not the day for that.	Danes ni bil dan za to.
And she was good to me.	In bila je dobra zame.
Which may be just as good.	Kar je morda prav tako dobro.
I didn’t have time to decide	Nisem imel časa, da bi se odločil
He was just sitting there.	Samo sedel je tam.
He wanted to.	Želel si je.
He helps us.	On nam pomaga.
First, you don't want it to be true.	Prvič, ne želite, da bi bilo res.
He said he would.	Rekel je, da bo.
That's enough.	To je dovolj.
Maybe it still is.	Morda je še vedno.
This is very, very, very wrong.	To je zelo, zelo, zelo narobe.
I could do it myself at home.	Sam bi to lahko počel doma.
And it will.	In bo.
I haven’t succeeded since.	Od takrat mi ni uspelo.
My life doesn’t have to be that way.	Moje življenje ne mora biti tako.
I'm so glad you came	Tako sem vesel, da si prišel

I couldn’t find anything to be happy about	Nisem našel ničesar, za kar bi bil vesel
This week will be better.	Ta teden bo bolje.
I didn't expect it	Nisem pričakoval
And we like it that way.	In tako nam je všeč.
Like this one.	Kot je ta.
There is nothing else.	Nič drugega ni.
Does he say he thought so.	Ali pravi, da je tako mislil.
I want to go there.	Rad bi šel tja.
Given all this, I felt very good	Glede na vse to sem se počutil zelo dobro
I really liked it	Zelo mi je bilo všeč

I couldn't know	Ne bi mogel vedeti
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I saw her, she told me	Videl sem jo, mi je rekla
Maybe too obvious.	Mogoče preveč očitno.
It was still with him, perhaps always would be.	Še vedno je bilo z njim, morda bo vedno.
I have to do right.	Moram narediti prav.
Nothing happened, which was good.	Nič se ni zgodilo, kar je bilo dobro.

I'm going back.	grem nazaj.
I liked her right away	Takoj mi je bila všeč
I was with that.	Bil sem s tem.
I've never seen him before	Še nikoli ga nisem videl
That's not right, he told himself.	To ni prav, si je rekel.
I still can’t believe what’s going on	Še vedno ne morem verjeti, kaj se dogaja
I had to get out of there right away	Takoj sem moral oditi od tam
No one knew it was going.	Nihče ni vedel, da gre.
And they did a lot.	In naredili so veliko.
He didn’t want to do that.	Ni hotel, da to počne.
Now I know how wrong that is	Zdaj vem, kako narobe je to
It's not us.	Nismo mi.
I shouldn't stay	Ne bi smel ostati
This one was this one.	Ta je bil ta.
But maybe we shouldn’t be.	Morda pa ne bi smeli biti.
I would like to see you.	rad bi te videl.
He was with me.	Bil z mano.
Maybe even after that.	Mogoče tudi po tem.
This is obvious.	To je očitno.
They are still together.	Še vedno sta skupaj.
I really want to hear from him	Res bi rad slišal od njega
I need time.	potrebujem čas.
He couldn't help himself.	Ni si mogel pomagati.
I started to believe.	Začel sem verjeti.
We always are.	Vedno smo.
He's gone.	Odšel je.
He knew what to do.	Vedel je, kaj storiti.
Maybe it will be sooner.	Mogoče bo pa prej.
I just want to see where he lives.	Samo videti bi rad, kje živi.
Just three days.	Samo tri dni.
Because that wasn't true.	Ker to ni bilo res.
It was the only way, you know.	To je bil edini način, veš.
There is a time when you don’t want anything.	Obstaja čas, ko ne želite ničesar.
He never came back.	Nikoli se ni vrnil.
Who knows, man.	Kdo ve, človek.
There were a lot of kids.	Bilo je veliko otrok.
We don't like it.	Ni nam všeč.
I would say it is	Rekel bi, da je
I thought it was going to be hard	Mislil sem, da bo težko
I mean, it's just normal life	Mislim, to je samo običajno življenje
More than you know.	Več kot veš.
I couldn't see them	Nisem jih mogel videti
I do not know you.	ne poznam te.
I should leave tonight	Nocoj bi moral oditi
I wasn’t there when it happened.	Nisem bil tam, ko se je to zgodilo.
I haven't been back in a long time	Že dolgo se nisem vrnil sem
I called her for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa sem jo poklical.
Okay, never.	Dobro, naj nikoli.
He thought he had succeeded.	Mislil je, da mu je uspelo.
That didn't happen today.	To se danes ni zgodilo.
I know him, he knows me.	Jaz ga poznam, on pozna mene.
Let's see how it is.	Da vidim kako je.
Nowhere to go.	Ni kam iti.
But I like it better	Meni pa je bolj všeč
I want to do my own thing.	Želim delati svoje stvari.
Unfortunately, he failed to do so.	Žal mu tega ni uspelo.
I couldn't tell who they were.	Nisem mogel povedati, kdo so.
Often more than that.	Pogosto več kot to.
I understand now !.	Zdaj razumem !.
We just don't know who they are.	Samo ne vemo, kdo so.
Just the way you wanted.	Tako kot si želel.
I had so much work to do	Imel sem toliko dela
He went and asked.	Šel je in vprašal.
So it will be.	Tako bo.
A friend told me he was in town	Prijatelj mi je povedal, da je v mestu
No one has ever seen anything like it.	Nihče še ni videl takega.
You probably should	Verjetno bi moral
I can't stay there anymore	Ne morem več ostati tam
They are together.	Skupaj sta on.
I would like to say something.	Nekaj ​​bi rad povedal.
i don't see it.	jaz tega ne vidim.
They had no children	Niso imeli otrok
We were lucky.	Imeli smo srečo.
I asked what he was doing.	Vprašal sem, kaj počne.
She wanted so much more.	Želela je toliko več.
My work was not either.	Tudi moje delo ni bilo.
I knew you would be the one	Vedel sem, da boš ti tisti
For a long time.	Za dolgo časa.
I shouldn't see them again	Ne bi jih smel več videti
This is not possible.	To ni mogoče.
I knew something was going on	Vedel sem, da se nekaj dogaja
Is that right?	Je to prav?.
And you will see everything that happens.	In videli boste vse, kar se dogaja.
That's what we knew until then.	Tako smo vedeli do takrat.
I don't even know how to call you.	Sploh ne vem, kako bi te poklical.
I seem to have forgotten how to do it	Zdi se, da sem pozabil, kako to storiti
Very much.	Tako zelo.
We have to be here.	Moramo biti tukaj.
I succeeded.	Meni je uspelo.
But he needs to be told.	Vendar mu je treba povedati.
I could say more next week	Več bi lahko povedal naslednji teden
It won't be like that.	Ne bo tako.
They were both in the room tonight.	Oba sta bila nocoj v sobi.
However, no.	Vendar pa ne.
He decided he had to.	Odločil se je, da mora.
I didn’t know how that could be	Nisem vedel, kako je to lahko
I heard about it yesterday	Včeraj sem slišal za to
I haven’t felt that way in years	Tako se nisem počutil že leta
I didn’t know they were still together	Nisem vedel, da sta še vedno skupaj
I didn't, he said.	Nisem, je rekel.
I haven't met you yet	Nisem te še srečal
I have nothing to eat	Nimam kaj jesti
I didn't want to tell you that	Tega ti nisem hotel povedati
This is true.	To je res.
I hope you are too.	Upam, da si tudi ti.
I knew he was right.	Vedel sem, da je prav.
I have to be busy.	Moram biti zaposlen.
Everything is fine and right.	Vse je lepo in prav.
Because no, you know I couldn't.	Ker ne, veš, da ne bi mogel.
Because he was right.	Ker je imel prav.
That was a good thing.	To je bila dobra stvar.
I want to go to work.	Želim iti na delo.
Maybe you won't be here again tomorrow.	Mogoče te jutri spet ne bo.
I've never seen her.	Nikoli je nisem videl.
I know you mean well	Vem, da misliš dobro
I thought tonight would be better for me	Mislil sem, da bo nocoj boljši zame
I'm really sorry it has to be this way	Res mi je žal, da mora biti tako
And he left.	In je odšel.
I just didn’t expect you to be home so early	Samo nisem pričakoval, da si doma tako zgodaj
He didn't expect anyone to feel that way.	Ni pričakoval, da se bo do koga še kdaj tako počutil.
I really wanted to see it all	Res sem želel videti vse
You have to, too.	Moraš tudi ti.
I need to know what's going on	Moram vedeti, kaj se dogaja
There are very few people here.	Tukaj je zelo malo ljudi.
I believe he did just that.	Verjamem, da je naredil prav to.
I forgot about school, everything	Pozabil sem na šolo, vse
She said this had happened before.	Rekla je, da se je to zgodilo že prej.
I just want you to be sure	Želim samo, da si prepričan
I do not believe.	Ne verjamem.
And that’s what happened here.	In to se je zgodilo tukaj.
Which is to say very little.	Kar se pravi zelo malo.
It seems every day.	Vsak dan se zdi.
He called.	Poklical je.
I lost you	Izgubil sem te
Apparently this was once true, not anymore.	Očitno je bilo to nekoč res, ne več.
I came to be alone	Sem prišel, da bi bil sam
Whether they will or not remains to be seen.	Ali bodo ali ne, bomo še videli.
And I don't understand.	In ne razumem.
I wish it was fast.	Rad bi, da je hitro.
He did wrong.	Naredil je narobe.
I never, ever wanted any of this to happen	Nikoli, nikoli si nisem želel, da bi se kaj od tega zgodilo
It's in us.	V nas je.
I told him it was	Povedal sem mu, da je
According to the	Glede na
If not, please.	Če ne, prosim.
I didn't want to believe him	Nisem mu hotel verjeti
He knew what he had to do.	Vedel je, kaj mora narediti.
There was no one to tell him how to live.	Ni bilo nikogar, ki bi mu povedal, kako naj živi.
There are many of us here.	Veliko nas je tukaj.
I can't be with you anymore	Ne morem biti več s tabo
I couldn’t believe how quickly this happened	Nisem mogel verjeti, kako hitro se je to zgodilo
That's not a problem.	To ni problem.
I said that to say no, but it’s not.	To sem rekel, da bi rekla ne, vendar ni.
I have to be a little alone	Moram biti malo sam
Maybe too much.	Morda preveč.
It feels very hard.	Počuti se zelo težko.
No, it's not that.	Ne, ni to.
I asked what happened	Vprašal sem, kaj se je zgodilo
It was once.	Bilo je nekoč.
I told myself that was enough	Rekel sem si, da je dovolj
He can't do that either.	Tudi tega ne more narediti.
I would never do that	Tega ne bi nikoli naredil
There are several things.	Obstaja več stvari.
I shouldn't tell you any of that	Ne bi vam smel povedati ničesar od tega
Just a little.	Le malo.
I didn’t know what it was.	Nisem vedel, kaj je to.
You will not die.	Ne boš umrl.
I mean, very few people	Mislim, zelo malo ljudi
I know how hard it is	Vem, kako težko je
I don’t like much from anyone right now	Trenutno ne maram veliko od nikogar
I will not forget	ne bom pozabil
And he learned absolutely nothing.	In se ni naučil popolnoma nič.
At the time I thought he couldn't talk.	Takrat sem mislil, da ne more govoriti.
But I understand what you mean.	Razumem pa, kaj misliš.
I want to be the one to do it	Želim biti tisti, ki to počne
I told him who they were, that's all	Povedal sem mu, kdo so, to je vse
I really need to go home	Res moram domov
You seem to know a lot.	Zdi se, da veš veliko.
I won't stay long.	ne bom ostal dolgo.
I had to do it myself	To sem moral narediti sam
Either you are or you aren't.	Ali si ali nisi.
She's gone now.	Zdaj je ni več.
I mean, I really like it	Mislim, res mi je všeč
I did that.	To sem naredil.
And the boy wanted to be good.	In fant je hotel biti dober.
He did that to me.	To mi je naredil.
There was no one.	Nikogar ni bilo.
But it is	Ali je to
I would sooner be without.	Prej bi bil brez.
I shouldn't have done that to her	Tega ji ne bi smel storiti
You can't help it.	Temu ne moreš pomagati.
I wanted to tell him about it	Hotel sem mu povedati o tem
I hope there will be more	Upam, da bo še kaj
The man is like a father to me.	Človek mi je kot oče.
I don't know who this person is.	Ne vem, kdo je ta oseba.
I didn't have that either	Niti tega nisem imel
There is nothing there.	Tam ni ničesar.
I don't think he can help us but help us	Mislim, da nam ne more nič drugega kot pomagati
He has it.	Ima ga.
For this better way.	Za ta boljši način.
I didn't think you were talking to him	Nisem mislil, da si govoril z njim
We should go, ”he said.	Morali bi iti,« je rekel.
I was glad to hear you liked me	Vesel sem bil, ko sem slišal, da sem ti všeč
Something should be done.	Nekaj ​​bi bilo treba narediti.
I learned so much.	Toliko sem se naučil.
I was expecting someone else myself	Tudi sam sem pričakoval nekoga drugega
I didn’t think it would be that hard	Nisem si mislil, da bo tako težko
This may help, it may not.	To lahko pomaga, morda ne.
I have quite a few.	Imam jih kar nekaj.
Someone who will tell you who you are.	Nekdo, ki vam bo povedal, kdo ste.
I'll get them back.	Dobil jih bom nazaj.
I could help him with that.	Lahko bi mu pomagal pri tem.
There was no one at home at the time.	Takrat ni bilo nikogar doma.
I need to know what will happen next.	Moram vedeti, kaj se bo zgodilo naprej.
He loved that thing.	To stvar je imel rad.
I mean, just everyone, everyone.	Mislim, prav vsi, vsi.
I had to be ready	Moral sem biti pripravljen
That was true.	To je bilo res.
I should see that it's you	Moral bi videti, da si ti
I never asked her how she felt about it	Nikoli je nisem vprašal, kako se počuti ob tem
You make me feel this way.	Tako se počutim zaradi tebe.
I want to help.	želim pomagati.
I wonder if they should be.	Sprašujem se, ali naj bi bili.
I didn't want to be good either.	Tudi jaz nisem hotel biti dober.
I walked around the city and all	Šel sem po mestu in vse
I could lose her	Lahko bi jo izgubil
I didn’t know who else to ask	Nisem vedel, koga bi še vprašal
It's very good.	Zelo dobro je.
He never asked for anything.	Nikoli ni ničesar prosil.
I won't tell him anything.	nič mu ne bom povedal.
I immediately said the obvious	Takoj sem povedal očitno
I understand it's hard for you	Razumem, da ti je težko
Father, tell me.	Oče, povej mi.
I could tell she wasn't interested	Lahko bi rekel, da je ne zanima
I didn’t ask him what he meant by that	Nisem ga vprašal, kaj je mislil s tem
When he comes to school.	Ko pride v šolo.
I want to go do everything with you	Rad bi šel narediti vse s tabo
I didn’t know what was right or wrong	Nisem vedel, kaj je prav ali narobe
I have to be here for you	Tukaj moram biti zate
She moved on.	Šla je naprej.
I just never did.	Samo nikoli nisem.
For my children.	Za moje otroke.
I didn't say that.	tega nisem rekel.
I couldn't be that man	Ne bi mogel biti ta človek
I don’t like to work fast today.	Danes ne maram delati na hitro.
There is no help for anyone.	Nikomur ni pomoči.
I had a chance to meet him	Imel sem priložnost, da sem ga spoznal
I already know enough	že vem dovolj
I hope you like it.	Upam, da vam je všeč.
And maybe that's a good thing.	In morda je to dobro.
I think you know what to do	Mislim, da veš kaj narediti
I haven't learned that yet	Tega se še nisem naučil
That was not true.	To ni bilo res.
I really thought they were better than that	Res sem mislil, da so boljši od tega
I know already.	Vem, že.
We have done it now.	Zdaj smo to naredili.
Do you like it?' 	Ti je všeč?'
I saw my opportunity	Videl sem svojo priložnost
It's not hard to believe.	Ni težko verjeti.
But not me.	Vendar ne jaz.
Soon, I would say.	Kmalu, bi rekel.
And he failed.	In ni mu uspelo.
It may not be obvious.	Morda ni očitno.
No, he didn't forget.	Ne, ni pozabil.
He called.	Poklical je.
I haven't met them before	Prej jih nisem srečal
I want to do it myself.	Želim to narediti sam.
Never before.	Nikoli prej.
I wanted to be that man	Hotel sem biti ta človek
I do this all the time.	To počnem ves čas.
He could see that now.	Zdaj je to lahko videl.
I think they are behind me	Mislim, da so za mano
And yet it is.	In vendar je.
But now he knows better.	Zdaj pa ve bolje.
I have to believe that.	To moram verjeti.
It's happening.	To se dogaja.
I know he's with you	Vem, da je s tabo
A little.	Malo.
I don’t think that was simply enough	Mislim, da preprosto ni bilo dovolj
I didn't even want to see that.	Tega sploh nisem hotel videti.
I started to like it	Začel mi je biti všeč
We know where they are.	Vemo, kje so.
I think this is difficult	Mislim, da je to težko
I wish it was that simple	Želel sem si, da bi bilo tako preprosto
Everything looked right, but something was very wrong.	Vse je bilo videti prav, a nekaj je bilo zelo narobe.
I think you had a good reason	Mislim, da si imel dober razlog
I loved that time.	Všeč mi je bil tisti čas.
I'll tell you why.	Povedal vam bom zakaj.
She said no again.	Spet je rekla ne.
Do better.	Naredi bolje.
What she wanted.	Kar je želela.
I wonder what it's about	Zanima me za kaj gre
It's perfectly fine.	Popolnoma v redu je.
But there was something else.	Vendar je bilo nekaj drugega.
I didn't expect it to be mine	Nisem pričakoval, da bo moja
His father taught him how to do it.	Oče ga je naučil, kako to storiti.
I didn't hear anything	Nič nisem slišal
Keep it fast.	Naj bo hitro.
Or he decided to know me.	Ali pa se je odločil, da me pozna.
Now he saw that she was no more.	Zdaj je videl, da je ni več.
I can’t, I just can’t.	Ne morem, preprosto ne morem.
If he wanted to know, he would tell me soon.	Če bi hotel vedeti, bi mi kmalu povedal.
Maybe not much.	Morda ne veliko.
That’s how he often felt.	Tako se je pogosto počutil.
Who knows if this is possible.	Kdo ve, če je to mogoče.
I will never forget him.	nikoli ga ne bom pozabil.
I can't be with you	Ne morem biti s tabo
I didn't expect to find anything.	Nisem pričakoval, da bom kaj našel.
She knew what she had to do.	Vedela je, kaj mora narediti.
They did nothing.	Nič niso storili.
I have never met anyone like him.	Še nikoli nisem srečal nikogar, kot je on.
Something like this happened last week.	Nekaj ​​takega se je zgodilo prejšnji teden.
I didn't know where he lived	Nisem vedel, kje živi
I can not do it anymore.	ne morem več.
And he really wants that.	In res si to želi.
However, how good it is.	Vendar, kako dobro je.
I almost didn’t go to work this morning	Danes zjutraj skoraj nisem šel v službo
I should never stay home.	Nikoli ne bi smel ostati doma.
This is not difficult to do.	To ni težko narediti.
I didn’t want to talk about what just happened	Nisem hotel govoriti o tem, kar se je pravkar zgodilo
I can not believe	Ne morem verjeti
I wish I was here now.	Želim si, da bi bila zdaj tukaj.
Instead ?.	Namesto ?.
Now I want to go home, please	Zdaj želim iti domov, prosim
She said it happened so fast.	Rekla je, da se je zgodilo tako hitro.
I really like this one	Ta mi je res všeč
He helped you get in the car.	Pomagal ti je priti v avto.
Tired but good.	Utrujen, a dober.
I still didn’t really like it	Še vedno mi ni bilo zelo všeč
That was more than enough.	To je bilo več kot dovolj.
What do you think.	Kaj misliš.
Now about the second one.	Zdaj pa glede drugega.
I knew that when I only met him once	To sem vedel, ko sem ga le enkrat srečal
I knew it was probably nothing	Vedel sem, da verjetno ni nič
I never want to be him again.	Nikoli več ne želim biti on.
It's really true.	Res je res.
If I was there, I would know.	Če bi bil tam, bi vedel.
I was glad to be there.	Vesel sem bil, da sem bil tam.
I have a lot of work	Imam veliko dela
It wasn't enough.	Ni bilo dovolj.
This is not a game.	To ni igra.
I wasn't happy at all.	Sploh nisem bil vesel.
This is not going to happen.	To se ne bo zgodilo.
I didn't want that for her	Tega ji nisem želel
But it has to be more than that.	Vendar mora biti več kot to.
I will be sorry to do that	Žal mi bo, da to storim
Why would anyone want her.	Zakaj bi si jo kdo želel.
I'll do it tomorrow.	Naredil bom jutri.
I know you have to do this	Vem, da moraš to storiti
I will do a lot of this	To bom naredil veliko
I mean from there	Mislim od tam
I told him we couldn't eat yet	Rekel sem mu, da še ne moremo jesti
Only I can.	Lahko samo jaz.
I wonder who did it	Sprašujem se, kdo je to storil
i don't need anything	ne potrebujem ničesar
He was very kind to me.	Bil je zelo dober do mene.
We both knew that.	To sva oba vedela.
I'm having a good time now, here	Zdaj se imam dobro, tukaj
.	.
I can't go on	Ne morem naprej
I will always be here for you.	Vedno bom tukaj zate.
I can’t believe this has never happened to me before.	Ne morem verjeti, da se mi to še nikoli ni zgodilo.
They were just there.	Pravkar so bili tam.
He said it was.	Rekel je, da je.
I have none of that.	Jaz nimam nič od tega.
It just wasn't there anymore.	Samo ni bilo več.
I need to know if this is true	Moram vedeti, če je to res
If you're not better by then.	Če ti do takrat ne bo bolje.
I never forgot them	Nikoli jih nisem pozabil
I don't have that.	tega nimam.
Very much.	Tako zelo.
I wanted to talk to you before that	Želel sem govoriti s tabo pred tem
I won't have anything to do with you.	Ne bom imel nič s tabo.
I just know what he means	Samo vem, kaj misli
We had work to do.	Imeli smo delo.
And yet, and yet.	In vendar, in vendar.
There was nothing else	Nič drugega ni bilo
He has been doing it ever since.	Od takrat to počne.
She seems to have done it before.	Zdi se, da je to storila že prej.
I have nothing like that	nimam nič takega
I don't want him to live alone anymore	Nočem več, da živi sam
You have to work with us.	Moraš delati z nami.
And it happened.	In to se je zgodilo.
I will have to do more.	Moral bom narediti več.
Probably not much.	Verjetno ne veliko.
And it's okay.	In je v redu.
I never knew that.	Tega nikoli nisem vedel.
We can't do this anymore.	Ne moremo več tako.
I forgot he was here	Pozabil sem na to, da je tukaj
He was in place with everything he said.	Bil je na mestu z vsem, kar je rekel.
He's a good guy.	On je dober fant.
I’m not sure this is the right way to do it.	Nisem prepričan, da je to pravi način za to.
I didn’t know what happened to her	Nisem vedel, kaj se ji je zgodilo
I know a lot of people who wouldn’t do that	Poznam veliko ljudi, ki tega ne bi storili
I can't work.	ne morem delati.
A man is not supposed to need much.	Človek naj ne bi potreboval veliko.
I also know what happened to you	Vem tudi kaj se ti je zgodilo
I never understand that again	Tega nikoli več ne razumem
I hope you are.	upam, da si.
You have a lot to do.	Veliko moraš narediti.
I have to see for myself.	Moram se prepričati sam.
The child does not.	Otrok ne.
She's not sorry.	Ni ji žal.
I didn't want to go	Nisem hotel iti
He didn't hear her.	Ni je slišal.
He knew that.	To je vedel.
I didn't feel that way anymore	Nisem se več tako počutil
I don't think that's true	Mislim, da to ni res
I knew it would be hard for him	Vedel sem, da mu bo težko
That's a good enough reason for me.	To je zame dovolj dober razlog.
I know she'll want to see you	Vem, da te bo želela videti
I didn't want to be alone anymore	Nisem hotel biti več sam
And you know what, now you know something.	In veš kaj, zdaj nekaj veš.
It is certainly happening now.	Zagotovo se to zdaj dogaja.
I'm glad you made it here	Vesel sem, da vam je uspelo tukaj
We have to go.	Moramo iti.
I never thought this would happen so quickly	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da se bo to zgodilo tako hitro
Now tell me more.	Zdaj mi povej več.
He met her there every day after that.	Tam jo je srečal vsak dan po tem.
Probably the way it's always been.	Verjetno tako, kot je bilo vedno.
That was completely wrong.	To je bilo popolnoma narobe.
And he's not here.	In ga ni tukaj.
He never knew who he was.	Nikoli ni vedel, kdo je.
I wanted them both there	Želel sem, da sta oba tam
I talked to him too	Tudi jaz sem govoril z njim
She's not there.	Ni je tam.
I didn't die.	nisem umrl.
We knew that.	To smo vedeli.
I told him to go out	Rekel sem mu, naj gre ven
I'm not going back to school	Ne grem nazaj v šolo
I know what my father did	Vem, kaj je oče počel
I may need him back tonight	Morda ga bom nocoj potreboval nazaj
But we'll be fine.	Vendar bo z nami vse v redu.
I will not say anything	ne bom rekel ničesar
That's not right	To ni v redu
I wish I could.	Želim si, da bi lahko.
And it will happen.	In to se bo zgodilo.
I didn’t think he would do that	Nisem si mislil, da bo to storil
It would never happen.	Nikoli se ne bi zgodilo.
Nothing more tonight.	Nocoj nič več.
Life for life, he says	Življenje za življenje, pravi
He still didn't know why he was the only one left.	Še vedno ni vedel, zakaj je ostal edini.
He will not return.	Ne bo se vrnil.
It's actually nothing.	Pravzaprav ni nič.
I know it's going to be hard	Vem, da bo težko
And so it is.	In tudi to je.
Nobody called.	Nihče ni poklical.
I didn't know anyone was here	Nisem vedel, da je kdo tukaj
If it were time.	Če bi bil čas.
I didn’t even know if that was possible	Sploh nisem vedel, če je to mogoče
Not so much today.	Danes ne toliko.
I hope this can help you.	Upam, da vam to lahko pomaga.
But you know how it is.	Veš pa, kako je.
And that's what he wanted to do.	In to je tisto, kar je hotel storiti.
We don't know who they are	Ne vemo, kdo so
It's not something everyone likes.	To ni nekaj, kar je vsem všeč.
Not forever, obviously.	Ne za vedno, očitno.
Maybe he was right.	Mogoče je imel prav.
I wonder what they did to him	Sprašujem se, kaj so mu naredili
I think we would already be here	Mislim, da bi že bili tukaj
So we will do it ourselves.	Zato bomo to naredili sami.
Now he has done it.	Zdaj je to storil.
I can't.	Ne morem pa.
I sure want to know.	Zagotovo želim vedeti.
I didn’t hear much of her say after that.	Po tem nisem veliko slišal, da je rekla.
There was nothing.	Nič ni bilo.
I couldn't tell what he was thinking.	Nisem mogel povedati, kaj si misli.
I want to know how to do it.	Želim vedeti, kako to narediti.
I didn't feel that way anymore	Nisem se več tako počutil
Each of you.	Vsak od vas.
He gave her what he could.	Dal ji je, kar je mogel.
This is not possible.	To ni mogoče.
Which is good.	Kar je dobro.
You are so good.	Tako si dober.
This is hard to do.	To je težko narediti.
I understand.	Razumem.
It could be someone.	Lahko bi bil nekdo.
Still no one came.	Še vedno nihče ni prišel.
I don't have anything.	Ničesar nimam.
I was ready for more.	Bil sem pripravljen na več.
That being said, it still is.	Glede na to je še vedno.
He stayed there for three years.	Tam je ostal tri leta.
Does not exist.	Ne obstaja.
Tom couldn't see anything.	Tom ni mogel videti ničesar.
I didn't want that at all	Sploh si tega nisem želel
Something had to be done.	Nekaj ​​je bilo treba narediti.
I already knew where he lived	Vedel sem že, kje živi
There was nothing like that	Ni bilo nič takega
He didn't see me.	Ni me videl.
I don’t see him much, maybe that’s why.	Ne vidim ga veliko, mogoče zato.
I wouldn't say no.	Ne bi rekel ne.
I knew what needed to be done	Vedel sem, kaj je treba narediti
I hope this was helpful !.	Upam, da je bilo to v pomoč!.
I mean, very hard to work with	Mislim, zelo težko delati

There was something more.	Bilo je nekaj več.
I started swimming instead.	Namesto tega sem začel plavati.

It seems there must be something here.	Zdi se, da nekaj mora biti tukaj.
I thought he was so lucky	Mislil sem, da je imel tako srečo

You're fine now.	Zdaj si v redu.
I had nothing else to do in the morning anyway	Zjutraj tako ali tako nisem imel ničesar drugega za početi
You know it is.	Saj veš, da je.
I could also tell him	Lahko bi mu tudi povedal
However, we cannot.	Vendar pa ne moremo.
I want to do what I can.	Rad bi naredil, kar lahko.
He said he didn't like it anymore.	Rekel je, da mu ni več všeč.
You will see a lot of this.	Videli boste veliko tega.
What happened was simple.	Kar se je zgodilo, je bilo preprosto.
Maybe something.	Mogoče nekaj.
I couldn't go home.	nisem mogel domov.
I just really want you	Samo res te želim
There she said.	Tam je rekla.
I never made it.	Nikoli mi ni uspelo.
She wanted it, she liked it there.	Želela je, tam ji je bilo všeč.
I promised you everything would be fine	Obljubil sem ti, da bo vse v redu
Maybe for good.	Mogoče za dobro.
I just let them go.	Preprosto sem jih pustil.
I understand why my father didn't want that for me	Razumem, zakaj oče tega ni hotel zame
I don't want anything more	Ne bi rad nič več
And you should know better.	In moral bi vedeti bolje.
I see a problem	Vidim problem
There may be more, but there must be so many.	Morda jih je še več, a toliko mora biti.
Good thing no one asked you.	Še dobro, da te nihče ni vprašal.
He couldn't be sure.	Ni mogel biti prepričan.
I haven't seen her here either	Tudi tukaj je nisem videl
He heard nothing.	Nič ni slišal.
And is.	In je.
He had time for this because he never worked.	Za to je imel čas, ker nikoli ni delal.
Everything is simple.	Vse preprosto je.
You're not.	Ti pa nisi.
I'll tell him.	Povedal mu bom.
There was too much work.	Dela je bilo preveč.
And so could he.	Pa tudi on bi lahko.
After what happened.	Po tem, kar se je zgodilo.
I see he likes it	Vidim, da mu je všeč
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
There was no one.	Ni bilo nikogar.
I'll leave if you want	Odšel bom, če želiš
I told her everything	Povedal sem ji vse
I will do what is right	Naredil bom, kar je prav
He had no one.	Nikogar ni imel.
I didn't work then.	Takrat nisem delal.
He asked how it was.	Vprašal je, kako je.
I want to see everything he has	Rad bi videl vse, kar ima
It's not true.	Ni res.
I'll be back there again.	Spet se bom vrnil tja.
Very few people do that.	Zelo malo ljudi to počne.
So often this is true.	Tako pogosto je to res.
I knew he was there for me	Vedela sem, da je tam zame
We know that.	To vemo.
So I want you to know about it.	Zato želim, da veš o tem.
And he liked to eat almost everything.	In rad je jedel skoraj vse.
I'm fine with that	S tem pa sem v redu
I didn't always know that	Tega nisem vedno vedel
Not that we would know if it is.	Saj ne, da bi vedeli, če je.
Which we were.	Kar smo bili.
No money.	Ni denarja.
So there seemed to be an opportunity there.	Tako se je zdelo, da je tam priložnost.
That's hard for me.	To mi je težko.
I think you're right	Mislim, da imaš prav
My friend was right.	Moj prijatelj je imel prav.
I need to talk to you now	Zdaj moram govoriti s tabo
A lot of time.	Veliko časa.
I just worked.	Pravkar sem delal.
Yes, from you too.	Da, tudi od tebe.
It really helps.	Res pomaga.
I thought you might come here	Mislil sem, da boš morda prišel sem
I think we should go there	Mislim, da bi morali iti tja
I didn’t know there were more kids	Nisem vedel, da je bilo več otrok
I don't have time now.	Zdaj nimam več časa.
He won't find anything.	Nič ne bo našel.
I just wanted to be alone	Samo želel sem biti sam
Not you either.	Tudi ti ne.
I didn't want to know, I really didn't.	Nisem hotel vedeti, res ne.
And yet! 	In vendar!
.	.
Apparently, what she said was difficult for her.	Očitno ji je bilo to, kar je rekla, težko.
Good and good.	Dobro in dobro.
I think it will help me	Mislim, da mi bo pomagal
I know you still have it.	Vem, da ga še imaš.
We know so much.	Toliko vemo.
I will work on that.	Bom delal na tem.
I have a lot of work	Imam veliko dela
I can’t believe everything that has happened since then	Ne morem verjeti vsega, kar se je zgodilo od takrat
You have to stay put.	Moraš ostati na mestu.
I won't be back yet.	Ne bom se še vrnil.
Hope to hear more from you.	Upam, da vas bom slišal več.
I had to do it.	Moral sem to narediti.
I can hardly speak	Skoraj ne morem govoriti
I've never seen her.	Nikoli je nisem videl.
Maybe he died.	Mogoče je umrl.
Certainly not now.	Zdaj zagotovo ne.
He liked you.	Všeč si mu bil.
I'm asking you, please.	Sprašujem vas, prosim.
I'm not alone.	Ne sam.
I think that would probably work	Mislim, da, to bi verjetno uspelo
Like a lot more.	Kot veliko več.
I think a lot is obvious	Mislim, da je veliko očitno
I didn't have to get in trouble anymore	Ni mi bilo treba več v težave
I've been waiting so long.	Tako dolgo sem čakal.
I just want her again	Samo spet jo želim
This is my life.	To je moje življenje.
If something goes wrong.	Če gre kaj narobe.
It was actually quite good.	Pravzaprav je bilo kar dobro.
Maybe it's just as good	Morda je prav tako dobro
I saw her.	Videl sem jo.
I know you won't do that	Vem, da tega ne boš naredil
I didn't want to do that	Nisem hotel tega storiti
There is nothing wrong with you.	Nič ni narobe s tabo.
No, obviously that wasn't good enough.	Ne, očitno to ni bilo dovolj dobro.
Everyone did it.	Vsi so to storili.
I knew what you did to him	Vedel sem, kaj si mu naredil
I told him my thoughts	Povedal sem mu svoje misli
I've never felt this way before	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil
I mean, we are all we have	Mislim, mi smo vse, kar imamo
Maybe very good.	Mogoče zelo dobro.
I did as you wished	Naredil sem, kot si hotel
It's just not normal.	Samo ni običajno.
And this man was a teacher.	In ta človek je bil učitelj.
But that's how it seemed to me at the time.	Ali tako se mi je takrat zdelo.
You will help me.	Pomagal mi boš.
He said he was happy.	Rekel je, da je vesel.
I can't believe he did that	Ne morem verjeti, da je to naredil
I have to work to eat	Za jesti moram delati
He went alone.	Sam je šel.
I decided to go home	Odločil sem se, da grem domov
And this one is.	In ta je.
I had to do something about him	Moral sem nekaj storiti glede njega
And he left it there.	In pustil ga je tam.
In fact, I still am	Pravzaprav sem še vedno
I wanted to stay there forever	Tam sem želel ostati za vedno
Oh, that's nice.	O, to je pa lepo.
I had to make sure you were okay	Moral sem se prepričati, da si v redu
You never did.	Nikoli nisi.
I'm not sure if that's true	Nisem prepričan, če je res
I wish I hadn't.	Želim si, da ne bi.
I thought that was it	Mislil sem, da je to to
And if so, that's fine.	In če je bilo tako, je v redu.
I did not have time	Nisem imel časa
I will definitely die	Zagotovo bom umrl
We were sure about you.	Bili smo prepričani o vas.
I will succeed again.	Uspelo mi bo še enkrat.
This is a very good thing.	To je zelo dobra stvar.
A little more.	Malo več.
I think he's really scared of you	Mislim, da se te res boji
That's probably right.	Verjetno je prav tako.
This is not likely.	To ni verjetno.
And there was none of that.	In nič od tega ni bilo.
You're lucky to be here tonight.	Imaš srečo, da si nocoj tukaj.
I would if I knew.	Saj bi, če bi vedela.
I think that will be all	Mislim, da bo to vse
Something seems to be here.	Nekaj ​​se zdi tukaj.
It made me feel good.	Zaradi tega sem se dobro počutil.
I don’t know if that can be done.	Ne vem, če je to mogoče storiti.
I need you here.	Jaz te potrebujem tukaj.
These are the things you want.	To so stvari, ki jih želite.
I knew it wasn't him	Vedel sem, da to ni on
I don't feel that way	Ne počutim se tako
I hope it will be the same with you.	Upam, da bo tako tudi pri vas.
You will see as they saw.	Videli boste, kot so videli.
I thought it was time	Mislil sem, čas je
I've done this at home before	To sem že delal doma
I feel better now, really	Zdaj se počutim bolje, res
I didn't need him anymore	Nisem ga več potreboval
We had a chance to do that.	Imeli smo priložnost za to.
He was angry enough.	Bil je že dovolj jezen.
I had a very good day today	Danes sem imel zelo dober dan
I am now and always will be your friend	Zdaj sem in vedno bom tvoj prijatelj
It was really hard for me.	Bilo mi je res težko.
I'm not him.	jaz nisem on.
It's not like we're together.	Ni tako, da bi bila skupaj.
It's not okay anymore.	Ni več v redu.
With your school.	S svojo šolo.
I needed something really fast.	Potreboval sem nekaj res hitro.
I may have to do something about it	Morda bom moral nekaj storiti glede tega
I called earlier this week	Poklical sem prej ta teden
Something in me tells him to talk.	Nekaj ​​v meni pravi, da naj govori.
I don't think anyone has money	Mislim, da nihče nima denarja
Maybe that's the question.	Mogoče je to vprašanje.
You did it yourself.	Sam si to naredil.
I told myself everything would be fine	Rekel sem si, da bo vse v redu
He says they were in place.	Pravi, da so bili na mestu.
There 's just you and me.	Obstaja samo ti in jaz.
What will be will be.	Kar bo pa bo.
You should be here.	Moral bi biti tukaj.
We need to be better at this.	Pri tem moramo biti boljši.
We wouldn’t do that, and neither did we.	Tega ne bi storili in tudi nismo.
I asked him why he was angry	Vprašal sem ga, zakaj je jezen
It wasn't fast.	Ni bilo hitro.
That's not how I do it	Tako ne počnem tega
Everyone has enough of everything.	Vsak ima vsega dovolj.
He never comes here.	Nikoli ne pride sem.
I've been here since yesterday	Tukaj sem od včeraj
You should see him now.	Zdaj bi ga morala videti.
I am very happy	Zelo sem vesel
The only question is where.	Vprašanje je le kje.
As it should be as it is.	Tako kot mora biti, kot je.
I hope nothing happened to you	Upam, da se ti ni nič zgodilo
That's what I wanted to do.	To sem hotel narediti.
I know this is going to be something she will love	Vem, da bo to nekaj, kar ji bo všeč
He is a very good teacher.	Je zelo dober učitelj.
I have a problem with that.	s tem imam problem.
I told you what we were going to do and why	Povedal sem vam, kaj bomo naredili in zakaj
You would never know it was here.	Nikoli ne bi vedel, da je tukaj.
I didn't know why you went, just that you went	Nisem vedel zakaj si šel, samo da si šel
Not on their own.	Ne na svoje.
I've been for years	Bil sem že leta
He didn't even have to be told	Niti mu ni bilo treba povedati
I love doing it for you	Rad ti to počnem
I have to leave today	Danes moram oditi
He wanted me.	Želel me je.
Just like now.	Tako kot je zdaj.
I already knew that	Za to sem že vedel
Still her.	Še vedno jo.
You are not human.	Ti nisi človek.
I will not return	ne bom se vrnil
No, not that one.	Ne, ne ta.
He knows that much.	Toliko ve.
I was ready to do anything	Pripravljen sem bil narediti za vse
He wasn't there long.	Tam ni bil dolgo.
So it would be better if there was nothing wrong.	Zato bi bilo bolje, da ni nič narobe.
It wouldn't be easy, said the boy.	Ne bi bilo lahko, je rekel fant.
We did it.	Uspelo nam je.
I knew who they were	Vedel sem, kdo so
And nothing else.	Pa nič drugega.
I still couldn’t believe this really happened	Še vedno nisem mogel verjeti, da se je to res zgodilo
I just wanted to know if you were okay	Hotel sem samo vedeti, če si v redu
I always thought it would be time	Vedno sem mislil, da bo čas
I'm sure you know, too	Prepričan sem, da tudi ti veš
I want him to help me	Želim, da mi pomaga
Time has not lost him.	Ni ga izgubil čas.
I could immediately tell he knew.	Takoj sem lahko rekel, da je vedel.
We have to get it right the first time.	Prvič moramo narediti prav.
It's very good.	Zelo dobro je.
I needed him.	Potreboval sem ga.
I didn't see him at all	Sploh ga nisem videl
He didn't say where.	Ni povedal kje.
I feel good now.	Zdaj se počutim dobro.
I didn't expect us to	Nisem pričakoval, da bomo
He didn't know that much.	Toliko tega ni vedel.
He got the job done.	Delo je opravil.
However, this did not happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
I know this is hard for you	Vem, da ti je to težko
You have to do it yourself.	To moraš narediti sam.

I had to do something fast	Nekaj ​​sem moral hitro narediti
I would like to do more	Rad bi naredil več

You knew that.	To si vedel.
That's what I've been thinking for years	To sem mislil leta
I just want to be here and now	Želim biti samo tukaj in zdaj
I want to be someone	želim biti nekdo
This is clearly not the case.	To očitno ni tako.
He says so.	On tako pravi.
I mean, really please me	Mislim, res me prosim
I can't believe he didn't tell you	Ne morem verjeti, da ti ni povedal
Was.	Je bilo.
I know it's a lot of money	Vem, da je to veliko denarja
I could tell he had never met anyone like me.	Lahko bi rekel, da še nikoli ni srečal nikogar, kot sem jaz.
I can't do anything else.	Ne morem drugega.
It’s actually pretty simple.	Pravzaprav je precej preprosto.
If you were there, you know what happened.	Če bi bil tam, veš, kaj se je zgodilo.

I really liked it.	Resno mi je bilo všeč.
Probably more.	Verjetno bolj.

Obviously, that could happen.	Očitno bi se to lahko zgodilo.
I didn't go to work today either	Tudi jaz danes nisem šel v službo
Which could have happened without.	Kar bi se lahko zgodilo brez.
It was a good life.	Bilo je dobro življenje.
I couldn't tell anyone	Nikomur nisem mogel povedati
I wish I never did.	Želim si, da nikoli ne bi.
There seems to be no one at home.	Zdi se, da ni nikogar doma.
She didn't know what to do.	Ni vedela, kaj naj naredi.
You're home again.	Spet si doma.
When he wanted to say something, he couldn't speak.	Ko je hotel nekaj povedati, ni mogel govoriti.
That is what I would say.	To je tisto, kar bi rekel.
It wasn't long.	Ni bilo dolgo.
I was glad to see him	Vesel sem bil, ko sem ga videl
I know you're right	Vem, da imaš prav
I will never come back here	Nikoli se ne bom vrnil sem
I would love to see them.	Rad bi jih videl.
And he would succeed again.	In spet bi mu uspelo.
Better not, he told himself, better not.	Bolje ne, si je rekel, bolje ne.
I understand why.	Razumem zakaj.
I thought I should know about it	Mislil sem, da bi moral vedeti za to
No one would hear.	Nihče ne bi slišal.
I thought it was good	Mislil sem, da je dobro
Obviously we can't.	Očitno ne moremo.
I would work.	jaz bi delal.
We didn't know.	Nismo vedeli.
Not good.	Ni dobra.
He got what he wanted again.	Spet je dobil, kar je hotel.
I didn't teach you that	Tega te nisem naučil
I wouldn't want her	Ne bi je želel
It was hard for everyone.	Vsem je bilo težko.
I was here when it happened	Bil sem tukaj, ko se je zgodilo
I probably have nothing to do with him	Verjetno nimam nič z njim
If they don’t, they won’t.	Če ne bodo, ne bodo.
I want to go there too, and soon	Tudi jaz si želim tja, in to kmalu
She had to.	Morala je.
I just don't think that's going to happen	Samo mislim, da se to ne bo zgodilo
I hope I decide then	Upam, da se bom takrat odločil
It's not that, he said.	Ni to, je rekel.
As if that was the only reason.	Kot da je bil to edini razlog.
I'll talk to him when he gets home.	Govoril bom z njim, ko pride domov.
Hard to come.	Težko priti.
They didn't have them now.	Zdaj jih niso imeli.
Kot.	Kot.
I have it all here	Tukaj imam vse
But he clearly was.	Vendar je očitno bil.
I've never said that before	Nikoli prej tega nisem rekel
For several days.	Že nekaj dni.
Not even when she should.	Niti takrat, ko bi morala.
He returned it.	Vrnil ga je.
More than that, he needed her.	Bolj kot to, potreboval jo je.
I don't like them.	Ne maram jih.
This is not for me.	To ni zame.
That's what makes you.	To je tisto, kar te dela.
I think three things need to be done	Mislim, da je treba narediti tri stvari
I didn’t know what he was going to do	Nisem vedel, kaj bo naredil
And she knew what she had to do.	In vedela je, kaj mora narediti.
I know that for sure.	To vem zagotovo.
That's how it's supposed to be.	Tako naj bi bilo.
And there it is today.	In tam je danes.
I wanted him back then	Že takrat sem si ga želela
Tonight if possible.	Nocoj, če je mogoče.
I did it as fast as I could.	Naredil sem to kar se da hitro.
But he knew that wasn't true either.	A vedel je, da tudi to ni res.
Sometimes she just didn't know how.	Včasih preprosto ni vedela, kako.
I actually love doing it	Pravzaprav rad to počnem
I hope you're better now	Upam, da si zdaj bolje
Nothing came of it.	Iz tega ni bilo nič.
He could come tonight, but not now	Lahko bi prišel nocoj, vendar ne zdaj
I can't work with you anymore	Ne morem več delati s tabo
Something had to be done	Nekaj ​​je bilo treba narediti
I think he thought he won	Mislim, da je mislil, da je zmagal
A lot of people do that	Veliko ljudi to počne
Apparently he succeeded.	Očitno mu je uspelo.
I know you have a long life	Vem, da imaš dolgo življenje
It wasn't there then.	Takrat še ni bilo.
It's much simpler.	To je veliko bolj preprosto.
I came to this.	Jaz sem prišel do tega.
I found it too.	Tudi jaz sem ga našel.
And maybe we were.	In morda smo bili.
I told you good luck	Povedal sem vam srečo
Nor were they ever what one expected them to be.	Tudi nikoli niso bili to, kar je človek pričakoval, da bodo.
I did everything.	Vse sem delal.
He was still so angry.	Še vedno je bil tako jezen.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I'm glad to meet you.	Vesel sem da sem te spoznal.
You're right now.	Zdaj si prav.
You were right about him.	Prav si imel glede njega.
, what.	, kaj.
This week was no better.	Ta teden ni bil nič boljši.
I hope this is okay for everyone	Upam, da je to za vse v redu
I was surprised and angry	Bil sem presenečen in jezen
I could do this all day.	To bi lahko počel ves dan.
I wasn’t trying to help	Nisem poskušal pomagati
I would never be okay again	Nikoli več ne bi bil v redu
She just kept going.	Samo naprej je šla.
It really helps.	Res pomaga.
I know what we can do	Vem, kaj smo lahko
I never expected him to say that	Nikoli nisem pričakoval, da bo to rekel
This is exactly what is happening now.	Prav to se zdaj dogaja.
I said my thing.	Povedal sem svoje.
He is none of those things.	On ni nič od tega.
You should see that	To bi moral videti
We need to say more.	Moramo povedati več.
I'm back.	Vrnil sem se.
It was the first time.	Bilo je prvič.
I was glad I had it	Vesel sem bil, da sem ga imel
I know he still has it	Vem, da ga še ima
We don't need it.	Ni nam treba.
I saw where he was going with this.	Videl sem, kam gre s tem.
It is simply wrong.	Je preprosto narobe.
I knew you would be alone	Vedel sem, da boš sam
I didn’t need too much	Nisem potreboval preveč
That's right.	Tako bi.
I have to tell him something else	Moram mu povedati nekaj drugega
He didn't know where they were.	Ni vedel, kje so.
What he did had to be done.	Kar je naredil, je bilo treba narediti.
I just wasn’t sure where	Samo nisem bil prepričan, kje
A few were gone	Nekaj ​​jih ni bilo več
And she was good to us.	In bila je dobra do nas.
A lot of things are happening to you.	Veliko stvari se vam dogaja.
I can't talk to him right now	Trenutno ne morem govoriti z njim
I also didn’t know who was behind us	Tudi jaz nisem vedel, kdo je za nami
I heard that.	To sem slišal.
The man is afraid of me	Človek se me boji
I knew what was happening to me	Vedel sem, kaj se mi dogaja
You're better than that.	Boljši si od tega.
I gave him a job.	Dal sem mu delo.
Nothing is here.	Nič ni tukaj.
I know who he is now	Vem, kdo je zdaj
I love you all and I will call you soon.	Vse vas imam rad in kmalu vas bom poklical.
Not so long ago I saw her	Ne tako dolgo nazaj sem jo videl
I need to do more.	Moram narediti več.
The problem was time.	Problem je bil čas.
He would have.	On bi imel.
I haven't met him in a long time	Že dolgo ga nisem srečal
He asked me what he could do for me.	Vprašal me je, kaj bi lahko naredil zame.
And many, many people do.	In veliko, veliko ljudi to počne.
As it was.	Kot je bilo.
They did their thing.	Svoje so naredili.
He's probably already gone.	Verjetno je že odšel.
I don't know for sure why.	Ne vem zagotovo zakaj.
Here, no.	Tukaj, ne.
I didn't talk to him	Nisem govoril z njim
I wonder how many people still live that way	Sprašujem se, koliko ljudi še živi tako
He was not happy.	Ni bil vesel.
I won't need help	Ne bom potreboval pomoči
He was also right.	Imel je tudi prav.
Something else was wrong as well.	Tudi nekaj drugega je bilo narobe.
Nobody wants to.	Nihče noče.
I'm not sure about that	o tem nisem prepričan
He had time.	Imel je čas.
I'm not ready for that	Nisem pripravljen na to
I didn't tell him everything.	Nisem mu povedal vsega.
I never knew that	Tega še nikoli nisem vedel
I told her everything you told me	Povedal sem ji vse, kar si mi povedal
I sat and waited.	Sedel sem in čakal.
He hasn’t seen any of that money yet, he says.	Nič od tega denarja še ni videl, pravi.
I didn’t know at the time what that could be.	Takrat nisem vedel, kaj bi to lahko bilo.
I haven't been alone for a long time	Dolgo nisem bil sam
She knew.	Vedela je.
And never.	In nikoli ne.
In fact, you probably should	Pravzaprav bi verjetno moral
I wanted to stay and help	Hotel sem ostati in pomagati
You should just leave	Moral bi samo oditi
I knew what was going to happen.	Vedel sem, kaj se bo zgodilo.
She wanted nothing.	Za nič si je želela.
He's never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni naredil.
That's it, he did.	To je to, naredil je.
On, on, on.	Na, na, naprej.
For the next day.	Za naslednji dan.
Maybe there is a reason for this.	Mogoče obstaja razlog za to.
I know why you're here	Vem zakaj si tukaj
Instead, I decided to believe in people	Namesto tega sem se odločil verjeti v ljudi
I've never done that before.	Še nikoli tega nisem storil.
Not much at all.	Sploh ne veliko.
I loved being here	Všeč mi je bilo, da je bila tukaj
I could go out.	Lahko bi šel ven.
He made them.	Naredil jih je.
I was not ready.	nisem bil pripravljen.
But I made up my mind	Vendar sem se odločil
I knew better than that	Vedel sem bolje kot to
He made it back.	Uspelo mu je nazaj.
Always has been, probably always will be.	Vedno je bilo, verjetno vedno bo.
I needed to know if it was really you	Moral sem vedeti, če si to res ti
I think she's been there before	Mislim, da je bila tam že prej
I hope he goes on	Upam, da bo šel naprej
No, just a few.	Ne, le nekaj.
I soon had to see them	Kmalu sem jih moral videti
Very good too.	Tudi zelo dobro.
It was just something.	Bilo je samo kaj.
It has to do this or it does nothing.	To mora storiti ali pa ne naredi nič.
I would never get it now.	Zdaj ga nikoli ne bi dobil.
He loves you.	Te ima rad.
I couldn't do it without you.	Brez tebe ne bi mogel.
We knew nothing.	Nič nismo vedeli.
I knew who he was.	Vedel sem, kdo je.
That's all I could do	Samo to bi mi lahko uspelo
I thought they were won by a friend	Mislil sem, da jih je zmagal prijatelj
I understand that would be wrong for you	Razumem, da bi bilo zate narobe
No matter who he is.	Ne glede na to, kdo je.
And that's that.	In to je to.
i will know sometime soon.	bom vedel kdaj kmalu.
That's what I expected	To sem pričakoval
He was the only person there.	Bil je edina oseba tam.
You were everything to me.	Bil si mi vse.
I haven't heard of it	Nisem slišal za to
The reason for this is as follows.	Razlog za to je naslednji.
I thought something was wrong	Mislil sem, da je nekaj narobe
You had her do it for you.	Dal si ji, da to naredi namesto tebe.
This is simply not true.	To preprosto ni res.
And life here is very good.	In življenje tukaj je zelo dobro.
I thought you would.	Mislil sem, da boš.
I didn't want to do that	Tega nisem hotel narediti
It’s hard to do good	Težko je narediti dobro
Even if he didn't ask.	Tudi če ni vprašal.
I just have it.	Samo imam ga.
I wanted that money.	Ta denar sem hotel.
I want to move on.	želim iti naprej.
I don't know after that.	po tem ne vem.
I can still see a lot of them	Še vedno jih lahko vidim veliko
I can't help but talk to him	Ne morem ne govoriti z njim
I shouldn't stay here	Ne bi smel ostati tukaj
I shouldn't be coming to work today.	Danes ne bi smel priti v službo.
She had to say.	Morala je povedati.
I should.	Moral bi.
I didn't know how it would be	Nisem vedel, kako bo
I think he was tired	Mislim, da je bil utrujen
But no more than that.	Vendar ne več kot to.
Which no longer exists.	Ki ne obstaja več.
I already know he does	Že vem, da to počne
I should probably do that.	Verjetno bi moral to storiti.
However, this is unlikely.	Vendar to ni verjetno.
I thought you wanted to see	Mislil sem, da želiš videti
He tried to help	Poskušal je pomagati
I've always liked you too	Tudi meni si bil vedno všeč
today.	danes.
Maybe you'll get a job, maybe not.	Mogoče boš dobil službo, mogoče ne.
I haven't known her in a long time	Ne poznam je že dolgo
You should be fine in the morning.	Zjutraj bi morali biti dobro.
I think we should come get you	Mislim, da bi morali priti po vas
And it goes on as if nothing had happened.	In gre naprej, kot da se ni nič zgodilo.
I didn't even want to talk about it.	Sploh nisem hotel govoriti o tem.
I'd say that's about it.	Rekel bi, da gre za to.
I don't feel alone anymore	Ne počutim se več sam
I'm here.	Tukaj sem.
I just got this for you	Pravkar sem ti dobil to
I’m too tired to go back and forth	Preveč sem utrujen, da bi šel naprej in nazaj
He said he can’t help himself, but he loves me.	Rekel je, da si ne more pomagati, vendar me ima rad.
I haven't seen much of anyone.	Nisem videl veliko nikogar.
That's for.	To je za.
I wanted her back too	Tudi jaz sem jo hotel nazaj
I was ready, and so was your father	Bil sem pripravljen, in tudi tvoj oče

I have it all and more	Imam vse to in še več
I didn't know it was you	Nisem vedel, da si ti
I just couldn’t believe it	Preprosto nisem mogel verjeti
He failed.	Ni mu uspelo.
Maybe this, maybe that.	Mogoče to, mogoče tisto.
I couldn't eat anything	Nič nisem mogel jesti
We should really move on.	Res bi morali iti naprej.
And much more.	In še veliko več.
A man who wouldn't leave	Človek, ki ne bi odšel
There are so few of them.	Tako malo jih je.
I wonder what.	Sprašujem se, kaj.
Everyone has time.	Vsak ima čas.
Nobody came and told you what to do.	Nihče ni prišel in ti rekel, kaj moraš narediti.
I wouldn't be too sure	Ne bi bil preveč prepričan
I may never see you again	Morda te nikoli več ne bom videl
I knew you loved him	Vedel sem, da ga imaš rad
And the person after that.	In oseba po tem.
There are so many things I have to do	Toliko stvari moram narediti
It was so good today.	Danes je bilo tako dobro.
It was something else.	Je bilo nekaj drugega.
Tell me what happened.	Povej mi, kaj se je zgodilo.
Maybe your money, not mine.	Mogoče tvoj denar, ne pa moj.
He said he would just have to see.	Rekel je, da bo moral samo videti.
And no one has since.	In od takrat še nihče.
I think he might get somewhere	Mislim, da bo morda kam prišel
There were really few of them.	Res jih je bilo malo.
I'm still me.	Še vedno sem jaz.
I didn’t know what was going on.	Nisem vedel, kaj se dogaja.
I think he was as surprised as we were	Mislim, da je bil tako presenečen kot mi

I thought you were gone forever	Mislil sem, da si šel za vedno
I knew where he was going	Vedel sem, kam gre
I couldn’t be more surprised	Ne bi mogel biti bolj presenečen
He was fine.	Bil je dobro.
I think that's a good thing	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar
I haven't heard from him in days	Že nekaj dni ga nisem slišal

I liked it right away	Takoj mi je bilo všeč

Why, no one knows.	Zakaj, nihče ne ve.
I thought it would work	Mislil sem, da bo uspelo
I've never heard of such a thing	Nikoli nisem slišal za kaj takega

There was so little time.	Tako malo je bilo časa.
He is afraid of us now.	Zdaj se nas boji.
I'll call you back.	Poklical te bom nazaj.
And that's not all.	In ni samo to.
I knew what he could do.	Vedel sem, kaj lahko naredi.
I would like to.	rad bi.
I won't be able to help	Ne bom mogel pomagati
That was a big help to me.	To mi je bilo v veliko pomoč.
I knew nothing else	Nič drugega nisem vedel
He learned more than he should have.	Naučil se je več, kot bi moral.
He loves what he does.	Rad ima to, kar dela.
As it is, I didn’t feel good	Tako kot je, se nisem počutil dobro
However, this is not the way to do it.	Vendar to ni način, kako to storiti.
I didn’t want to go to a party	Nisem hotel iti na zabavo
Me, I don't want to do this.	Jaz, tega nočem storiti.
I heard him tell you	Slišal sem, da ti je povedal
If there is anything else.	Če je še kaj.

I know you want her	Vem, da si jo želiš
I shouldn't be here.	Ne bi smel biti tukaj.
Back then, my only chance was to go out.	Takrat je bila moja edina priložnost, da grem ven.

It will be you.	To boš ti.
I think he knows everything.	Mislim, da ve vse.
I didn't know when you would be back	Nisem vedel, kdaj se boš vrnil
I see things like you couldn't see	Vidim stvari, ki jih kot ti ne bi mogel videti
That was all before the truth.	To je bilo vse prej kot res.
No one has ever seen it before.	Nihče ga še nikoli ni videl.
I never thought he could be right, really not	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da ima lahko prav, res ne
I just stayed there.	Samo ostal sem tam.
But there was no help for that.	A za to ni bilo pomoči.
It’s actually pretty simple.	Pravzaprav je precej preprosto.
Maybe you are.	Morda ste.
I find that very hard to believe.	To zelo težko verjamem.
I just need a little time	Potrebujem le malo časa
There would be nothing.	Nič ne bi bilo.
You have to make sure you have a chance.	Prepričati se moraš, da imaš priložnost.
There wasn't much time.	Ni bilo veliko časa.
I just wanted to make sure	Hotel sem se samo prepričati
I didn’t know there was a child	Nisem vedela, da obstaja otrok
My friend died	Umrl je moj prijatelj
I haven't heard that in a long time	Tega že dolgo nisem slišal
Nice to have someone interested.	Lepo, da se nekdo zanima.
I was glad I got something	Vesel sem bil, da sem nekaj dobil

I know you know that	Vem, da to veš
He had never seen her before.	Še nikoli je ni videl.
I've known them my whole life	Poznam jih vse življenje
The reason is as follows.	Razlog je naslednji.
He said enough.	Dovolj je rekel.
This can be difficult.	To je lahko težko.
It was serious.	Bilo je resno.
Apparently this was no longer true.	Očitno to ni bilo več res.
The thing is.	Stvar je.
If I only knew.	Če bi le vedel.
I just met her.	Pravkar sem jo spoznal.
I'm not sure about that.	Nisem prepričan glede tega.
Which is actually pretty obvious.	Kar je pravzaprav precej očitno.
I'm not interested in that.	To me ne zanima.
Not much.	Ni veliko.
It really exists.	Res obstaja.
I have something to say.	imam nekaj za povedati.
They are simple.	Preprosto so.
I've never had that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem imel.
I have a hard time understanding	Težko razumem
I had to do something about it.	Moral sem nekaj storiti glede tega.
I need to be a better person	Moram biti boljši človek

She was never there.	Nikoli je ni bilo tam.
I know all about it.	Vem vse o tem.
I love having it.	Všeč mi je, da ga imam.
I lost you then, but it will never happen again	Takrat sem te izgubil, a to se ne bo nikoli več zgodilo

I was just playing	Samo igral sem se
Hard to do it, but only once.	Težko to storiti, vendar samo enkrat.
I'm so sorry, man.	Tako mi je žal, človek.

He's not home.	Ni ga doma.
Or maybe too much.	Ali pa morda preveč.
Nobody really saw that.	Tega res nihče ni videl.
Or some of it is.	Ali nekaj od tega je.
I need to talk to you.	Moram govoriti s tabo.
I understand more now.	Zdaj razumem več.
The child is gone, gone.	Otrok je odšel, odšel.
And that's exactly what happened to me.	In prav to se mi je zgodilo.
I'll go if you can	Grem, če ti bo uspelo
There was nothing he could do about it anyway.	Glede tega tako ali tako ni mogel storiti ničesar.
I wish I was here.	Želim si, da bi bil tukaj.
I hope there is something to eat	Upam, da je kaj za jesti
He's just not ready.	Samo ni pripravljen.
It just seemed possible to me.	Samo zdelo se mi je mogoče.

It could be right.	Lahko bi bilo prav.
I liked that question	Všeč mi je bilo to vprašanje

Much remains to be done.	Veliko je še treba narediti.
He left everything in place.	Pustil vse na mestu.
That's right.	Tako je.
I told you there were more	Rekel sem ti, da jih je več
You know and you didn't go there.	Veš in nisi šel tja.
I worked like you all my life	Tako kot ti sem delal vse življenje
As if that were possible.	Kot da bi bilo to mogoče.
You tell.	Ti povej.
I didn’t know what she knew	Nisem vedel, kaj je vedela
I asked her who she was	Vprašal sem jo, kdo je
I just wished I would	Samo želel sem si, da bi
You know how it is here in the morning.	Saj veste, kako je tukaj zjutraj.
I will stay there again	Spet bom ostal tam
I was tired all the time	Ves čas sem bil utrujen
I didn’t get much else	Nisem dobil veliko drugega

I have a car.	Imam avto.
He did.	Naredil.
I thought you all wanted that	Mislil sem, da si to vsi želite
I really need to tell her we're fine	Res ji moram povedati, da smo v redu
Not much there.	Ni veliko tam.
I'm the one who has to stay here.	Jaz sem tisti, ki mora ostati tukaj.
It never was.	Nikoli ni bilo.
I waited for him for a while	Nekaj ​​časa sem ga čakal
I needed her from here	Potreboval sem jo od tukaj
I will go back to my room.	Vrnil se bom v svojo sobo.
But I wouldn’t feel right	Vendar se ne bi počutil prav
I should do that	To bi moral narediti
I couldn’t believe they were gone	Nisem mogel verjeti, da jih ni več
I need it by tomorrow morning	Potrebujem do jutri zjutraj
I mean, now anyone can do that	Mislim, zdaj lahko to stori vsak
I just hope he sees it.	Samo upam, da bo to videl.
That may be true today.	To je morda res danes.
I'm here for you	Tukaj sem zaradi tebe
You’re just someone who wants to know what’s going on there.	Ste samo nekdo, ki želi vedeti, kaj se tam dogaja.
Just a question.	Samo vprašanje.
He has to do it his way.	Narediti mora na svoj način.
I still don't see anyone	Še vedno ne vidim nikogar
I was just trying to make sure	Poskušal sem se samo prepričati
It's up to you to know.	Na vas je, da veste.
I almost went back to play with it.	Skoraj sem se vrnil, da bi se igral z njim.
And not just work.	In ne samo delo.
I told everyone no	Vsem sem rekel ne
Maybe it's us.	Mogoče smo to mi.
I didn’t like that I had nothing to do	Ni mi bilo všeč, da nimam kaj početi
He had nothing to say about it.	O tem ni imel kaj povedati.
That was very good.	To je bilo zelo dobro.
None of this I wanted to believe.	Nič od tega nisem hotel verjeti.
I know you're tired	Vem, da si utrujen
I'm doing it again.	Spet to počnem.
I need help, you know that	Potrebujem pomoč, to veš
I hope you are very happy.	Upam, da boš zelo vesel.
It won't.	Ne bo.
Really nice!.	Res lepo!.
He said you were.	Rekel je, da si.
Nor is it.	Pa tudi ni.
In fact, he saw it all.	Pravzaprav je vse videl.
That exists too.	Tudi to obstaja.
I would never say anything like that	Kaj takega ne bi nikoli rekel
It's happening right now.	Prav zdaj se dogaja.
You saw it better.	Bolje si to videl.
You should come with me.	Moral bi iti z mano.
I wanted to stay with you	Hotel sem ostati s tabo
Matter,.	Glede na to,.
Which doesn't help.	Kar ne pomaga.
I don't want to either.	Tudi ne želim.
Maybe he thought it would make me feel better.	Mogoče je mislil, da se bom počutil bolje.
I can understand that.	To lahko razumem.
Everything is simply good.	Vse je preprosto dobro.
The child who was often me.	Otrok, ki je bil pogosto jaz.
I’m not ready for anything that might come	Nisem pripravljen na vse, kar lahko pride
I'm ready, he said	Pripravljen sem, je rekel
When I didn't.	Ko nisem.
He spoke.	Govoril je.
I'm ready to believe	Pripravljen sem verjeti
Like he really does.	Kot da to res počne.
I just didn’t have the time.	Preprosto nisem imel časa.
They are not real.	Pravi niso.
If you want to buy.	Če želite kupiti.
But I wanted it.	Vendar sem si ga želel.
She's there with him.	Tam je z njim.
But I certainly didn’t know	Nisem pa zagotovo vedel
I didn't do anything wrong here	Tukaj nisem naredil nič narobe
I've already done that.	To sem že storil.
It was hard.	Bilo je težko.
Sometimes not all the time.	Včasih ne ves čas.
He didn't want to eat.	Ni hotel jesti.
However, it simply did not seem right to me.	Vendar se mi preprosto ni zdelo prav.
I want to be your friend.	Rad bi bil tvoj prijatelj.
I will try to make it simple	Poskušal bom narediti preprosto
No matter what I do.	Ne glede na to, kaj počnem.
I called her	Poklical sem jo
I never expected it to be	Nikoli nisem pričakoval, da bo
And so were we.	In tudi mi smo bili.
And I succeeded.	In mi je uspelo.
I was there.	Sem bil tam.
It would be nice.	Lepo bi bilo.
I just don't know.	Samo ne vem.
He didn't even know that for sure.	Niti tega ni vedel zagotovo.
I have to tell you something	nekaj ti moram povedati
It all happened.	Vse se je zgodilo.
I never wanted anyone again	Nikoli si nisem želel nikogar več
I wasn’t sure why he was so angry	Nisem bil prepričan, zakaj je bil tako jezen
So nice of you.	Tako lepo od tebe.
Now you know what to do.	Zdaj veste, kaj storiti.
That was the reason.	To je bil razlog.
I would love to see her do really well.	Rad bi videl, da ji gre res dobro.
You didn't have to come to me.	Ni ti bilo treba priti k meni.
I love people.	rad imam ljudi.
I realized he really meant it	Spoznal sem, da je to res mislil
I wasn't there anymore	Nisem bil več tam
No, they weren't real.	Ne, niso bili pravi.
I almost got them	Skoraj sem jih dobil
You are here now.	Zdaj ste tukaj.
I felt it again	Spet sem se počutil
It's not true.	Ni res.
I had a quick question	Imel sem hitro vprašanje
I want to know these things	Te stvari želim vedeti
And he has known all this for a long time.	In vse to že dolgo ve.
I hope today is a better day for you	Upam, da je danes boljši dan zate
He is glad to be alone.	Vesel je, da je sam.
I know he will do it	Vem, da bo to storil
I just didn’t want to be alone	Preprosto nisem hotel biti sam
I liked it for a while, but not anymore	Nekaj ​​časa mi je bilo všeč, a ne več
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
Everyone liked it.	Vsem je bilo všeč.
Not that.	Ne ta.
There are too many of us now.	Zdaj nas je preveč.
No, he wasn't.	Ne, ni bil.
I asked him what he was going to do.	Vprašal sem ga, kaj bo naredil.
This is usually possible, but not always.	Običajno je to mogoče, vendar ne vedno.
You don't know what it was like back then.	Ne veš, kako je bilo takrat.
I couldn't do it alone	Sam ne bi mogel
Everything seems right here.	Vse se zdi prav tukaj.
I left for the day.	Odšel sem za dan.
I don’t know what else could be wrong.	Ne vem, kaj bi lahko bilo še narobe.
She was everything to me.	Bila mi je vse.
He never said that.	Tega ni nikoli rekel.
I forgot about you	Pozabil sem na te
It often takes time.	Pogosto potrebuje čas.
I know you haven't seen him	Vem, da ga nisi videl
He did that.	To je naredil.
Nice to see you again.	Lepo te je spet videti.
We have a lot of time for that.	Za to imamo veliko časa.
I really want to meet her again	Res bi jo rad spet srečal
He felt good.	Počutil se je dobro.
He should have stayed when he asked me to	Moral bi ostati, ko me je prosil
I'll see how it goes	bom videl kako bo
I haven't heard from you in a while	Že nekaj časa se nisem slišal od vas
I didn't really have anything	Pravzaprav nisem imel ničesar
I will never be without it	Nikoli ne bom brez tega
There's more to that too.	Tudi tega je več.
I believe that to be true	Verjamem, da je to res
They never saw him again	Nikoli več ga niso videli
I can’t believe this is happening now	Ne morem verjeti, da se to zdaj dogaja
I didn't have any of that anymore	Nič od tega nisem imel več
I believe you can.	Verjamem, da lahko.
However, we cannot do without time.	Vendar pa ne moremo brez časa.
I don't think so	Mislim, da ni
I can't be angry at all.	Sploh ne morem biti jezen.
I thought they would definitely be alive by now	Mislil sem, da bodo do zdaj zagotovo živi
In fact, I feel so much better now	Pravzaprav se zdaj počutim veliko bolje
I hope they won't.	Upam, da ne bodo.
I will really lose	res bom izgubil
I didn’t think this was going to happen	Nisem si mislil, da se bo to zgodilo
I'm fine.	Dobro sem.
We have to do that.	To moramo storiti.
I won't do anything to you	nič ti ne bom naredil
Or enough of that.	Ali dovolj tega.
Mine too.	Tudi moj.
Not because of that.	Ne zaradi tega.
I never met them.	Nikoli jih nisem srečal.
I hope you won't be there.	Upam, da te ne bo tam.
He obviously failed to do that.	To mu očitno ni uspelo.
I wish I could just die	Želim si, da bi samo umrl
I think he is a good person.	Mislim, da je dobra oseba.
I knew he was fine	Vedel sem, da je z njim vse v redu
You are not all enough.	Vsi niste dovolj.
I didn't want to do that to him	Tega mu nisem hotel narediti
I have nothing to tell you	Nimam ti kaj povedati
I would love to see him again	Rad bi ga še enkrat videl
I will not say more than that	Več kot to pa ne bom rekel
That failed.	To ni uspelo.
He hasn't done that in years.	Tega ni storil že leta.
It was something else, more.	To je bilo nekaj drugega, več.
I hope this was helpful	Upam, da je bilo to v pomoč
A man could only die once	Človek je lahko umrl samo enkrat
They can be anything you want.	Lahko so vse, kar želite.
I was just thinking about that, you know	Pravkar sem mislil na tisto, veš
I am and still am.	Sem in še vedno.
I won't tell her anything about it	O tem ji ne bom nič rekel
I have a house here.	Tukaj imam hišo.
There were no children.	Ni bilo otrok.
We have to.	Moramo.
It is also true that he did.	Prav tako je, da je to storil.
I'm sure he's fine.	Prepričan sem, da je v redu.
I am .	Jaz sem .
It's never about me.	Nikoli ne gre zame.
And now or never.	In zdaj ali nikoli.
The question is how much.	Vprašanje je koliko.
I thought I should be together forever	Mislil sem, da bi morala biti za vedno skupaj
He said he couldn’t tell him a few things.	Rekel je, da mu nekaj stvari ne more povedati.
This was almost not the case.	Temu skoraj ni bilo tako.
You have children.	Imaš otroke.
I really have to go	Res moram iti
I was pretty angry about everything	Zaradi vsega sem bil precej jezen
That's just as good.	To je prav tako dobro.
Or even the next one.	Ali pa tudi naslednji.
I just left him there	Pravkar sem ga pustil tam
He seemed to be thinking seriously.	Zdelo se je, da misli resno.
That's what he said.	To je rekel.
I would call you	jaz bi te poklical
I like you too.	Tudi ti si meni všeč.
That was fine.	To je bilo v redu.
I never wanted to stay here	Nikoli nisem hotel ostati tukaj
Not all of me.	Ne ves jaz.
You did what you could.	Naredili ste, kar ste lahko.
I've had enough of this for the first time	Tega sem imel že prvič dovolj
I mean it, as a person	Mislim resno, kot oseba
I just didn't know how	Samo nisem vedel kako
I never heard her again	Nikoli več je nisem slišal
It's little.	Malo je.
Everything has a reason.	Vse ima razlog.
I’m not sure how he feels about me.	Nisem prepričan, kako se počuti do mene.
I knew she hadn't been here long	Vedel sem, da ni bila dolgo tukaj
He had seen her before.	Videl jo je že prej.
There seemed to be no helping it.	Zdelo se je, da temu ni pomoči.
It's really nice.	Res je lepo.
For help.	Za pomoč.
And you are right there.	In prav ste tam.
He will help her.	Pomagal ji bo.
So we were there in the morning.	Zato smo bili zjutraj tam.
I would never have thought that	Tega si ne bi nikoli mislil
I really liked it there	Tam mi je bilo zelo všeč
I'll go to the house myself	Sam bom šel v hišo
Or if anything happened to him.	Ali če bi se mu kaj zgodilo.
It is absolutely true.	Popolnoma res je.
You obviously want to be here.	Očitno želiš biti tukaj.
And not for money.	In ne za denar.
I will not be that person	Ne bom ta oseba
I hope this helps	Upam, da je to v pomoč
We are here now.	Zdaj smo tukaj.
It was day.	Bil je dan.
I'm just a man	sem samo človek
Or so he said.	Ali tako je rekel.
But there are many.	Vendar jih je veliko.
There is no time this morning.	Danes zjutraj ni časa.
It's alone.	To je sam.
He couldn't see anything.	Ničesar ni mogel videti.
He said he wanted it himself.	Rekel je, da si ga želi tudi sam.
She should do that.	To bi morala storiti.
we are not sure.	nismo prepričani.
I was gone the day before	Prejšnji dan me ni bilo
I said nothing more, not then, never	Rekel sem nič več, ne takrat, nikoli
And now he thought that day had definitely come.	In zdaj je mislil, da je ta dan zagotovo prišel.
I tried to do what was right	Poskušal sem narediti, kar je prav
Do you think you are.	Ali mislite, da ste.
I don't know where he got them.	Ne vem, kje jih je dobil.
I just didn't know that yet	Samo tega še nisem vedel
I already knew who he was	Sem že vedel, kdo je
It was as good as anything.	Bilo je tako dobro kot vse.
I called him and he came right away	Poklical sem ga in takoj je prišel
It’s hard to know for sure.	Težko je vedeti zagotovo.
I will do just that.	Naredil bom prav to.
I feel pretty good.	Počutim se kar dobro.
I left without telling you anything	Odšel sem, ne da bi ti sploh kaj rekel
Better to come back	Bolje, da bi se vrnil
I first met him three days earlier	Prvič sem ga srečal tri dni prej
That was really something.	To je bilo res nekaj.
I know you have to see her.	Vem, da jo moraš videti.
And you can never see all of me.	In nikoli me ne moreš videti vsega.
She said no.	Rekla je, da ni.
There is a problem now.	Zdaj je problem.
And that's exactly what he did.	In prav to je naredil.
Maybe she didn’t know then, but now she knows.	Morda takrat še ni vedela, zdaj pa ve.
You did that.	To si naredil.
Everything was hard.	Vse je bilo težko.
I can understand them all	Vse jih lahko razumem
We don't have to.	Ni nam treba.
I've been for a while	Bil sem že nekaj časa
I obviously don't want that.	Tega očitno ne želim.
That made me more than happy.	To sem bil več kot vesel.
She was good to me.	Bila je dobra do mene.
There was no need to do that at the moment.	Trenutno tega ni bilo treba storiti.
And he was tired.	In bil je utrujen.
I also thought it was very nice	Tudi jaz sem mislil, da je to zelo lepo
I like that you want to do this	Všeč mi je, da želiš to narediti
I will not tell anyone about this.	O tem ne bom rekel nikomur.
You don't know anything.	Nič ne veš.
And he's right.	In ima prav.
I thought he would be with me forever	Mislil sem, da bo z mano za vedno
Someone was here.	Nekdo je bil tukaj.
I mean, that's fine	Mislim, to je v redu
I don't think it would.	Mislim, da ne bi.
I couldn't do that.	Tega nisem mogel storiti.
He asked for it.	Prosil je za to.
He knows about you.	On ve zate.
I don't believe it is	Ne verjamem, da je
I just didn’t know where that might be	Samo nisem vedel kje bi to lahko bilo
You know you will.	Veš, da boš.
I haven't seen her much.	Nisem je veliko videl.
They both went their separate ways.	Oba sta šla po svoje.
I am also convinced of that	V to sem tudi prepričan
I didn't hear everything	Nisem slišal vsega
He would be fine.	On bi bil v redu.
That's when I saw the room	Takrat sem videl sobo
I felt so good.	Počutil sem se tako dobro.
This is a thing he did himself.	To je stvar, ki jo je naredil sam.
I knew something was wrong	Vedel sem, da je nekaj narobe
I have to go now.	Zdaj moram iti.
I used to go and sit there	Včasih sem šel in sedel tja
Everyone had it there.	Tam so imeli vsi.
You will have to do this.	To boš moral narediti.
He couldn't help her.	Ni ji mogel pomagati.
I had to do something about it	Moral sem nekaj storiti glede tega
I couldn’t be sure what it was.	Nisem mogel biti prepričan, kaj je bilo.
I wish you wanted to be with me	Želim si, da si želiš biti z mano
Never, never was.	Nikoli, nikoli ni bilo.
I can't tell you yet	Ne morem ti še povedati
I am and nothing happened.	Sem in nič se ni zgodilo.
I will stay here	ostal bom tukaj
I saw a lot of that today.	Danes sem videl veliko tega.
Talk to him.	Govoril z njim.
There is a way to do it.	Obstaja način za to.
You have to get ready every day.	Vsak dan moraš priti pripravljen.
I mean, you can.	Mislim, lahko.
That's all for us today.	To je vse za nas danes.
You don't have to do all of this.	Vsega tega vam ni treba narediti.
I could work with him now	Zdaj bi lahko delal z njim
He was an angry, angry child.	Bil je jezen, jezen otrok.
I think there were a lot of people	Mislim, da je bilo veliko ljudi
A man may know right, but he doesn’t.	Človek morda pozna prav, a tega ne stori.
I just wanted you to think that	Hotel sem samo, da to misliš
I might go there.	Morda bi šel tja.
He just wanted out.	Samo hotel je ven.
I waited, but no one went to the room	Čakal sem, a nihče ni odšel v sobo
Maybe it is, maybe it is not.	Mogoče je, mogoče ni.
He lives here.	Živi tukaj.
She was alone, that much he knew.	Bila je sama, toliko je vedel.
I'm not ready for that	Nisem pripravljen na to
And it's so hard.	In tako je težko.
I really liked it	Zelo mi je bil všeč
This was clearly not the case.	Temu očitno ni bilo tako.
And yet he was here.	Pa vendar je bil tukaj.
If we could, we'd all have it by now.	Če bi lahko, bi ga že vsi imeli.
You were right about that.	Glede tega si imel prav.
Don't think that.	Ne misli tega.
They made a room.	Naredili so sobo.
That's what you said.	Tako si rekel.
I think you did what you had to do	Mislim, da si naredil, kar si moral
It can be several things.	To je lahko več stvari.
I’ve never been so happy to see her	Še nikoli nisem bil tako vesel, da jo vidim
For both.	Za oba.
No one does that.	Nihče tega ne počne.
I don't need much.	ne potrebujem veliko.
He has never done that before.	Tega še nikoli ni storil.
I didn't mean that	Nisem mislil na to
If that were the case.	Če bi bilo temu tako.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ne vem, kaj je narobe z mano.
He was fine because he got lost.	V redu je bil, ker se je izgubil.
That's when I knew you didn't mean that	Takrat sem vedel, da nisi mislil tega
I saw it today.	Danes sem videl.
If for no one else, do it for me.	Če zaradi nikogar drugega, naredi to namesto mene.
I never found him.	Nikoli ga nisem našel.
I can't say what you think	Ne morem povedati, kaj mislite
I wonder if this has ever happened to her	Zanima me, ali se ji je to že kdaj zgodilo
We know what to do.	Vemo, kaj storiti.
It was to be seen.	Videti je bilo.
I found it very nice	Zdelo se mi je zelo lepo
I want to know what's going on	Želim vedeti, kaj se dogaja
I didn't even know who he was	Sploh nisem vedel, kdo je
He promised himself he would.	Obljubil si je, da bo.
I still can't see anything.	Še vedno nič ne vidim.
I couldn't tell him what to do	Nisem mu mogel povedati, kaj naj naredi
He will want to go home.	Želel bo domov.
I didn't want to believe it	Nisem hotel verjeti
He was tired too.	Tudi on je bil utrujen.
Now back to that.	Zdaj pa nazaj k temu.
I didn't know why.	Nisem vedel zakaj.
I tried to tell him what happened	Poskušal sem mu povedati, kaj se je zgodilo
You made a good friend.	Dobro si naredil prijatelj.
You've only seen a few of these.	Videli ste le nekaj od tega.
That's what she said.	To je rekla.
I have to see him every day	Vsak dan ga moram videti
I already have.	Imam že.
He knows where he's going.	Ve, kam gre.
I went a little and it was nice.	Šel sem malo in bilo je lepo.
But I really have to go	Moram pa res iti
He did not expect to stay long.	Ni pričakoval, da bo ostal dolgo.
So he just left.	Zato je kar odšel.
And not just once.	In ne samo enkrat.
Just because he does.	Samo zato, ker to počne.
What is right is right.	Kar je prav, je prav.
I hope he was just tired.	Upam, da je bil samo utrujen.
I had to do something all the time	Ves čas sem moral nekaj početi
I still haven't heard of you	Še vedno nisem slišal zate
i don't like them anymore	ne maram jih več
And there was something else.	In še nekaj je bilo.
I didn’t know he had so many	Nisem vedel, da jih ima toliko
It's about everything.	Gre za vse.
I decided to forget what just happened	Odločil sem se, da bom pozabil, kaj se je pravkar zgodilo
I want you to know that	Želim, da to veš
But I found something else	Sem pa našel nekaj drugega
She could go to work now.	Zdaj je lahko šla v službo.
Isn't that nice.	Ali ni to lepo.
I wouldn't be without it	Brez tega me ne bi bilo
That is a must know.	To je treba vedeti.
You didn't want to be him.	Nisi hotel biti on.
Let it be a lot.	Naj bo to veliko.
It's been that way for a long time.	Že dolgo je bilo tako.
I'm ready.	pripravljen sem.
I can't help you.	Ne morem ti pomagati.
Everyone knew that.	Vsi so to vedeli.
No, that is simply not possible.	Ne, to preprosto ni mogoče.
I really thought there would be something	Res sem mislil, da bo nekaj
When supposed to, for the whole time.	Ko naj bi, za ves čas.
He can play.	Lahko igra.
I still had so much to do.	Še vedno sem imel toliko dela.
I know what needs to be done	Vem, kaj je treba narediti
If I did, I wouldn't be here.	Če bi, ne bi bil tukaj.
I needed help, so here it is	Potreboval sem pomoč, zato je tukaj
I just wanted to.	Samo hotel sem.
I had a nice time there	Tam sem se imel lepo
I didn't want you in this, but now you are	Nisem te želel v tem, zdaj pa si
I very much doubt that this will happen now	Zelo dvomim, ali se bo to zgodilo zdaj
If only I wanted to.	Če bi le želela.
I can't tell you how happy	Ne morem vam povedati, kako vesel
It is from .	Je iz .
Nice to know.	Lepo je vedeti.
In front of you.	Pred tabo.
I didn’t have much to do	Nisem imel veliko dela
They will have it for a long time.	Imeli ga bodo še dolgo časa.
I'm glad you're fine	Vesel sem, da si dobro
I don't want to think that.	Ne bi rad tako mislil.
I'm not too sure about that.	V to nisem preveč prepričan.
It was always fine.	Vedno je bilo v redu.
I'm not.	nisem.
We don't know for sure.	Ne vemo zagotovo.
I wished this would happen to me	Želela sem si, da bi se mi to zgodilo
She seems to be doing well.	Zdi se, da ji gre dobro.
I can't go there.	Ne morem tja.
They did that.	To so storili.
We could only do so much.	Lahko bi naredili le toliko.
I came quickly.	Hitro sem prišel.
Not this way.	Ne na ta način.
You don't need to do anything more.	Ni vam treba storiti ničesar več.
No one would find you.	Nihče te ne bi našel.
I don't want to see you.	Nočem te videti.
In fact, I’m glad he’s gone	Pravzaprav sem vesel, da ga ni več
I have all these problems too	Tudi jaz imam vse te težave
But I knew better	Vedel sem pa bolje
But I won't tell her yet	Vendar ji še ne bom povedal
Should not.	Ne bi smel.
He couldn't go today.	Danes ni mogel iti.
I would do anything for it	Vse bi naredil za to
You are perfectly in place.	Popolnoma si na mestu.
I wish it was just that.	Želim si, da bi bilo samo to.
I just didn’t know how	Preprosto nisem vedel, kako
I could see she liked it	Videl sem, da ji je to všeč
I hope you stay here	Upam, da boš ostal tukaj
I made the right decision	Prav sem se odločil
I think you'll like it	Mislim, da ti bo všeč
He said that's why he's here.	Rekel je, da je zato tukaj.
But he wasn't sure how he did it.	Ni pa bil prepričan, kako mu je to uspelo.
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
I didn't say that.	Nisem povedal s tem.
Sometimes I can't believe you	Včasih ti ne morem verjeti
This is not likely to happen.	To se tako verjetno ne bo zgodilo.
I know he didn't mean it that way	Vem, da ni mislil tako
That's fast too.	Tudi to je hitro.
Nice to see you.	Lepo te je videti.
I didn't know why.	Nisem vedel zakaj.
But sometimes he can't.	Včasih pa ne more.
It's hard for us too.	Tudi nam je težko.
They could, and they both knew it.	Lahko bi, in oba sta to vedela.
I know what he meant.	Vem, kaj je mislil.

Life was good.	Življenje je bilo dobro.
I mean children	Mislim na otroke
Or is it.	Ali je.
I go fast every day.	Vsak dan grem hitro.
It can't be life.	To ne more biti življenje.
I never will	Nikoli več ne bom
I have to do something	Moram nekaj narediti
I didn't know you were there	Nisem vedel, da si tam
I can't see him.	Ne morem ga videti.
I'm not leaving that long	Ne bom odšel tako dolgo
That's not it.	To ni to.
I didn't see you come after me like that	Nisem te videl, da si tako prišel za mano
As a child, I often found them	Kot otrok sem jih pogosto našel
No one has done that yet.	Tega še nihče ni storil.
I just need a little time.	Potrebujem le malo časa.
.	.
Yes, he said.	Je, je rekel.
That remains to be seen.	To pa je treba še videti.
I didn't want it to go	Nisem hotel, da gre
I was lucky again	Spet sem imel srečo
I won't be alone for long	Ne bom dolgo sam
It won't be nice.	Ne bo lepo.
I wasn’t sure if that was possible anymore	Nisem bil prepričan, če je to več mogoče
I'll be here for you	Tukaj bom zate
I really don’t think so.	Res ga ne mislim tako.
It's actually not true.	Pravzaprav ni res.
I was right all along	Ves čas sem imel prav
At your home.	Pri vas doma.
It worked again.	Spet je uspelo.
Very little indeed.	Res zelo malo.
It wouldn't be long now.	Zdaj ne bi bilo dolgo.
However, this is not enough.	Vendar to ni dovolj.
I heard that yesterday	To sem slišal včeraj
I think he's right.	Mislim, da ima prav.
I really didn't want that.	Tega si res nisem želel.
Just nothing there.	Samo nič tam.
This has never happened before.	To se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
I had to work fast	Hitro sem moral delati
He had to tell her how much he loved her.	Moral ji je povedati, kako zelo jo ima rad.
I gave him something	Nekaj ​​sem mu dal
I saw it happening	Videl sem, da se to dogaja
But I understand what he says	Razumem pa, kaj pravi
I know what he means.	Vem, kaj misli.
It's only a matter of time.	Samo vprašanje časa je.
I forgot to tell you he works here now	Pozabil sem ti povedati, da zdaj dela tukaj
I hope to see you soon	upam da te kmalu vidim
It will happen to us.	Zgodilo se nam bo.
What he said was so true.	Kar je rekel, je bilo tako res.
I was so glad he did	Bil sem tako vesel, da je to storil
I knew you would never come back.	Vedel sem, da se ne boš nikoli vrnil.
We were.	Smo bili.
He was not and never has been.	Ni bil in zdaj nikoli ni bil.
My question is this.	Moje vprašanje je to.
Who he really was.	Kdo je bil pravzaprav.
None of this can be true.	Nič od tega ne more biti res.
He went home.	Odšel je domov.
I know he knows me	Vem, da me pozna
No no.	Ne, ne.
There was no one in front of him.	Pred njim ni bilo nikogar.
I saw how much more he had to do	Videl sem, koliko še mora narediti
This one is good.	Ta je dobra.
Never fast enough.	Nikoli dovolj hitro.
You knew they were here.	Vedel si, da so tukaj.
Nothing comes to me.	Nič mi ne pride.
It wasn't mine.	Ni bilo moje.
Everything is just the way it is.	Vse je samo tako, kot je.
I just thought it was hard sometimes	Mislil sem samo, da je včasih težko
But we saw a lot of them.	Videli pa smo jih veliko.
That seems to be the case here.	Zdi se, da je tukaj tako.
No, not really.	Ne, res ne.
I don’t think that might help	Mislim, da to morda ne bo v pomoč
You should make sure.	Moral bi se prepričati.
I never seem to be able to do anything right	Zdi se, da nikoli ne morem narediti ničesar prav
This may not be what you want.	To morda ni tisto, kar želite.
I can't help you	Ne bom ti mogel pomagati
I should do something more	Moral bi narediti nekaj več
You should know that there is more to it.	Moral bi vedeti, da je tega več.
I'm going.	grem.
Until then .	Do takrat .
He said okay.	Rekel je v redu.
Maybe she should say something now.	Mogoče bi morala zdaj kaj povedati.
He didn't know how little he knew.	Ni vedel, kako malo ve.
Apparently he wasn't there to see me.	Očitno ga ni bilo tam, da bi me videl.
I think you may have already known that	Mislim, da ste to morda že vedeli
We should and will not do anything other than that.	Morali bi in ne bomo naredili nič drugega kot to.
We can't be.	Ne moremo biti.
And there are many.	In veliko jih je.
He has to go.	Mora iti.
I was there, I did.	Bil sem tam, naredil.
I need to know that	To moram vedeti
And it was.	In bilo je.
You never know.	Nikoli ne veš.
I have to move on	Moram naprej
I could talk to him.	Lahko bi govoril z njim.
Much too much.	Veliko preveč.
I mean, not like that	Mislim, ne tako
I want to tell her about it, but I can’t	Želim ji povedati o tem, vendar ne morem
I probably feel that way too	Verjetno se tudi jaz tako počutim
This was simply not possible	To preprosto ni bilo mogoče
I couldn't do that anymore	Tega nisem mogel več
I know what we have to do	Vem, kaj moramo narediti
Now I want to go into my thoughts.	Zdaj želim oditi v svoje misli.
I thought that was nice.	Mislil sem, da je to lepo.
Everything will be fine now.	Zdaj bo vse v redu.
I wanted to know what he was thinking	Hotel sem vedeti, kaj si misli
I'm not going for that	Ne grem za to
You have to do it again.	To moraš storiti še enkrat.
I didn't want to leave home	Nisem hotel oditi od doma
Now we have a chance to leave.	Zdaj imamo možnost oditi.
As a teacher.	Kot učitelj.
He just wants to go to school	Samo v šolo želi
I don't think you are either	Mislim, da tudi ti nisi
I don't see anything wrong with that.	V tem ne vidim nič narobe.
I think that's true.	Mislim, da je to res.
It was always a problem.	Vedno je bil problem.
There was nothing that I could do.	Nič nisem mogel storiti.
I wish this would not happen	Želim si, da se to ne bo zgodilo
I'll be better.	bolje mi bo.
They saw what was happening.	Videli so, kaj se dogaja.
I couldn't do that.	Tega ne bi mogel storiti.
It almost seems that way.	Skoraj tako se zdi.
Too many years.	Preveč let.
I can't believe I would do that	Ne morem verjeti, da bi to storil
Nobody knew where you were.	Nihče ni vedel, kje si.
I still have this book.	Še vedno imam to knjigo.
I have a job, but I can't help it	Imam delo, a si ne morem pomagati
He wants to help.	Želi pomagati.
I can't believe you didn't hear that last night	Ne morem verjeti, da tega nisi slišal sinoči
I feel good.	Počutim se dobro.
That will be difficult.	To bo težko.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
Keep going.	Kar naprej.
I wouldn't want to at all	Sploh ne bi hotel
It was unlikely that anyone would ever get to know each other completely.	Malo verjetno je bilo, da bi se kdo kdaj popolnoma spoznal.
I'm ready for it.	Pripravljen sem na to.
He is a very good father.	On je zelo dober oče.
I mean, there was a time when it was	Mislim, bil je čas, ko je bil
I know someone like that	Poznam nekoga takega
I will not do that.	tega ne bom storil.
Here's the problem.	Tukaj je problem.
I didn't know he was with you	Nisem vedel, da je s tabo
It was obvious to me.	Zame je bilo očitno.
I wouldn't be here without you	Ne bi bil tukaj, če ne bi bilo tebe
You got us.	Dobil si nas.
I didn’t like what he became	Ni mi bilo všeč, kaj je postal
With a lot.	Z veliko.
For you.	Zate.
Before all this, I was fine	Pred vsem tem sem bil v redu
He didn't have children either.	Tudi otrok ni imel.
As a kid, I used to do that all the time	Kot otrok sem to počel ves čas
It's probably going to happen to me anyway.	Verjetno se mi bo tako ali tako zgodilo.
I wish I could.	Želim si, da bi lahko.
He couldn't tell if they had seen him.	Ni mogel povedati, ali so ga videli.
And he did just that.	In naredil je prav to.
I came back from that right away.	Takoj sem se vrnil iz tega.
I know what we have to do	Vem, kaj moramo storiti
Yes and no.	Da in ne.
Like maybe not anymore.	Kot morda ni več.
I can not.	ne morem.
I didn't want to be there.	Nisem hotel biti tam.
I think we'll be fine.	Mislim, da bomo v redu.
I want something that will work.	Želim si nekaj, kar bo uspelo.
I still couldn’t believe this was happening	Še vedno nisem mogel verjeti, da se to dogaja
I could not.	nisem mogel.
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
I hope it's not serious.	Upam, da ni resno.
Back your car.	Nazaj svoj avto.
I don't like him.	ne maram ga.
I hope everyone is fine	Upam, da so vsi dobro
Let it go right! 	Naj gre prav!
That's not it.	To pa ne.
I should do all this tomorrow.	Vse to bi moral narediti jutri.
I had to do that	To sem moral narediti
You have to come with us too.	Tudi ti moraš iti z nami.
I'm sure of that	O tem sem prepričan
It’s not just about knowing what happened there.	Ne gre samo za vedeti, kaj se je tam zgodilo.
I heard someone call again	Spet sem slišal, da je nekdo poklical
I never did because he wasn’t my father	Nikoli nisem, ker ni bil moj oče
A lot has happened.	Veliko se je zgodilo.
It just felt wrong.	Samo zdelo se je narobe.
It would be nice if someone could help.	Lepo bi bilo, če bi lahko kdo pomagal.
How did you do it?	Kako ti je uspelo?
He couldn't be.	Ni mogel biti.
It takes time.	Potrebuje čas.
That will be just as good.	To bo prav tako dobro.
I thought it was obvious	Mislil sem, da je očitno
You are fine and you will remain fine.	V redu si in ostal boš v redu.
I hope you feel better soon !.	Upam, da se boš kmalu počutil bolje!.
I decided to go ahead and do it	Odločil sem se, da grem naprej in to storim
We have tomorrow.	Imamo jutri.
I didn’t know how to get out	Nisem vedel, kako priti ven
But not for long.	Vendar ne za dolgo.
I'm sure you already know that	Prepričan sem, da to že veš
I understand them.	razumem jih.
Maybe that was the problem.	Morda je bil to problem.
I need help.	Potrebujem pomoč.
I have to do something.	Moram nekaj narediti.
Not anymore.	Ni več.
But I didn't say that	Nisem pa tako rekel
I wasn’t too surprised	Nisem bil preveč presenečen
Everything, everything was beautiful.	Vse, vse je bilo lepo.
This is mine.	To je moje.
I want to talk to you right now.	Želim govoriti s tabo takoj.
But probably not you or me.	Vendar verjetno ne ti ali jaz.
I will never return.	nikoli se ne bom vrnil.
He needs help just like us.	Potrebuje pomoč tako kot mi.
I want to know what happened to me	Želim vedeti, kaj se mi je zgodilo
That simply wasn’t enough.	To preprosto ni bilo dovolj.
Nothing is right with him.	Nič mu ni prav.
And not only did we have.	In ne samo, da smo imeli.
Because of this, he will return.	Zaradi tega se bo vrnil.
Maybe something from him.	Mogoče kaj od njega.
We've been at this for a long time.	Pri tem smo že dolgo časa.
I didn't see you there either	Tudi jaz te nisem videl tam
He did little else.	Malo drugega je storil.
I better go	Bolje, da grem
I was very surprised	Bil sem zelo presenečen
He didn't even want to.	Niti si ni želel.
She didn't say that.	Tega ni rekla.
I completely understand	popolnoma razumem
It's hard, you know.	Težko je, veš.
I thought you were good at it	Mislil sem, da si dober v tem
He was my everything.	Bil je moje vse.
That's right now.	Zdaj je tako.
You could do that too.	Tudi ti bi to lahko storil.
I have nothing else to do.	Nimam kaj drugega za početi.
We didn’t see them, just like that.	Nismo jih videli, preprosto tako.
I know you're a busy man	Vem, da si zaposlen človek
But I'd like to see you in the morning	Bi se pa rad videl zjutraj
I'm going to have to see what happens	Moral bom videti, kaj se bo zgodilo
It would be hard not to.	Težko bi ne.
This is a very good life	To je zelo dobro življenje
Simple, really.	Preprosto, res.
I need to talk to him	Moram govoriti z njim
And know what's right.	In vedeti, kaj je prav.
I still do all that	Vse to še vedno počnem
I was also surprised	Bil sem tudi presenečen
probably not.	verjetno ne.
He too will be childless.	Tudi on bo brez otrok.
And we shouldn't do that.	In tega ne bi smeli početi.
He expected that.	To je pričakoval.
I called her.	poklical sem jo.
I'm sure there's nothing to it.	Prepričan sem, da ni nič na tem.
That won't be the case for much longer.	Temu ne bo več dolgo tako.
I will never forget that	Tega ne bom nikoli pozabil
I need to see them.	Moram jih videti.
No matter what.	Ne glede na vse.
To do more.	Da bi naredili več.
Maybe I'll tell you more about it	Morda vas bom o tem še povedal
I thought he died.	Mislil sem, da je umrl.
And now that is what it is for us.	In zdaj je to, kar je za nas.
I mean, I probably would	Mislim, verjetno bi
It’s so simple it doesn’t need anything else.	To je tako preprosto, da ne potrebuje ničesar drugega.
He looks tired.	Videti je utrujen.
I forgot about everything	Na vse sem pozabil
To them? 	Njim?
he asked.	je vprašal.
I find it very difficult to believe this	Zelo težko verjamem v to
I wonder how much he's doing	Zanima me, koliko mu gre
Being human is not human.	Biti človek ni človek.
I would never go out	Nikoli ne bi šel ven
Sam goes.	Sam gre.
We knew you would come early.	Vedeli smo, da boš prišel zgodaj.
I also had a job	Imel sem tudi delo
Not that it makes me feel better.	Ne, da se zaradi tega počutim bolje.
In fact, this is not true.	Pravzaprav to ni res.
I still believe.	Še vedno verjamem.
Each of us has our own problems.	Vsak od nas ima svoje težave.
I mean the problem	Mislim na problem
I will work with you.	delal bom s tabo.
I just knew it was him	Samo vedela sem, da je on
The question is why this is not happening.	Vprašanje je, zakaj se to ne dogaja.
Even if it isn't.	Tudi če ni.
And if it will, it will be very difficult.	In če bo, bo zelo težko.
You know how it is.	Saj veš kako je.
If not, it probably won’t.	Če ne, verjetno ne bo.
I'm going because my friend asked me to.	Grem, ker me je prijatelj prosil.
Please, just talk.	Prosim, samo govori.
You still have to go.	Še vedno moraš iti.
I tried, like you said	Poskušal sem, kot si rekel
We know what is likely to happen.	Vemo, kaj se bo verjetno zgodilo.
She's not there anymore.	Ni je več tam.
This is you.	To si ti.
I would never start	Nikoli ne bi začel
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
I didn’t think there was anyone else	Nisem si mislil, da obstaja še kdo
I've heard it before.	Slišal sem že prej.
I wouldn't be happy	Ne bi bil vesel
I’ve always wanted them, but it never happened	Vedno sem si jih želel, a se to nikoli ni zgodilo
I don't know if it is.	Ne vem, če je.
I didn't really want to know.	Pravzaprav nisem hotel vedeti.
She wasn't the only one.	Ni bila edina.
He didn't have to do that.	Tega mu ni bilo treba storiti.
They should be helpful.	Morali bi biti v pomoč.
I could be there for a while	Lahko bi bil tam nekaj časa
He wasn't angry.	Ni bil jezen.
It won't always be this way.	Ne bo vedno tako.
I don't know why, really.	Ne vem zakaj, res.
I’m glad time is never an issue.	Vesel sem, da čas ni nikoli problem.
He says you won't be able to.	Pravi, da ne boš mogel.
They shouldn't be a problem.	Ne bi smeli biti problem.
I didn't know she told you these things	Nisem vedel, da ti je rekla te stvari
I'll be waiting for you	Čakal te bom
Enough, for now.	Dovolj, za zdaj.
Maybe I know what it is.	Mogoče vem kaj je to.
There is no time for that.	Ni časa za to.
I just thought he had to talk	Samo mislil sem, da mora govoriti
That would be enough.	To bi bilo dovolj.
My friend lives here now	Tukaj zdaj živi moj prijatelj
I was so glad to see him	Tako sem bil vesel, da sem ga videl
I promised myself	Obljubil sem si
I made the right decision.	Prav sem se odločil.
He didn't want to do that.	Tega ni hotel storiti.
Do that.	Naredi tisto.
There just isn't much out there.	Tam preprosto ni veliko.
I spoke to you yesterday	Včeraj sem govoril s tabo
I want to make my own	Rad bi naredil svoje
More than good.	Več kot dobro.
I wouldn't have thought you couldn't.	Sam si ne bi mislil, da ne moreš.
I doubt that is the case.	Dvomim, da je temu tako.
I'm ready for anything.	Pripravljen sem na vse.
I could have done better, I would have been better.	Lahko bi naredil bolje, bil bi boljši.
I want to be a teacher	Želim biti učitelj
I think it's better.	Mislim, da je boljši.
I can't tell you anymore	Ne morem ti povedati več
A lot of that has happened	Veliko takega se je zgodilo

I want to know what I would do	Rad bi vedel, kaj bi naredil

I understand you.	razumem te.
I know all about it, as you might think	Vem vse o tem, kot morda mislite
I knew it wouldn't be long now	Vedel sem, da zdaj ne bo dolgo
You don't know what will happen.	Ne veš, kaj se bo zgodilo.
I could stay there.	Lahko bi ostal tam.
I was there alone with no money	Tam sem bil sam brez denarja
More than I like	Več kot mi je všeč
I had to see them	Moral sem jih videti
I didn't see him.	Nisem ga videl.
At that time.	Takrat pa .
And no one can be like him.	In nihče ne more biti kot on.
I haven’t seen them very often	Nisem jih videl prav pogosto
That was not an option.	To ni bila možnost.
I would like to meet you	rad bi te spoznal
I'm not your father.	Nisem tvoj oče.
It was all just a matter of time.	Vse je bilo samo vprašanje časa.
He is just good and loves to help.	Je samo dober in rad pomaga.
Or to hear it.	Ali da bi ga slišal.
There was nowhere to go.	Ni bilo kam iti.
I didn't have that kind of money	Nisem imel takega denarja
Too much for me.	Preveč zame.
There are a lot of people right now	Trenutno je veliko ljudi
I really can't believe it	Res ne morem verjeti
Just got home.	Pravkar prišel domov.

I just hope it's okay	Upam samo, da je v redu

Or not.	Ali ne.
I got to know her a little	Malo sem jo spoznal
I hope you like it	Upam, da vam bo všeč
He can do it.	Lahko ga naredi.
I didn’t see or hear anything last night	Sinoči nisem ničesar videl ali slišal
That's what I'd like to tell her.	To bi ji rad povedal.
Sometimes I still do that	Včasih še vedno tako počnem
It was just.	Bilo je samo.
But there were a few.	Vendar jih je bilo nekaj.
It's pretty much.	Je precej.
I knew he was a good person	Vedel sem, da je dobra oseba
I really have nothing	res nimam nič

This is not difficult.	To ni težko.
That is, more work is ahead of us than behind us.	Se pravi, več dela je pred nami kot za nami.
I would love to see him someday	nekoč bi ga rad videl

More and more.	Več in več.
I first met him last week	Prvič sem ga srečal prejšnji teden
I'll tell you what could be better done.	Povedal ti bom, kaj bi bilo bolje narediti.

That was obvious.	To je bilo očitno.
I just know you'll like it	Samo vem, da ti bo všeč
Like really many children.	Kot res veliko otrok.
That's right.	Je tako.
I thought there was no one left	Mislil sem, da ni več nikogar
As you wish.	Tako kot želite.
It's obvious now.	Zdaj je očitno.
It's true.	Res je.
She's not sorry.	Ni ji žal.
You know how they are.	Saj veste, kako so.
And you said no.	In rekel si ne.
It's not like your father could help you.	Ni tako, kot da bi ti oče lahko pomagal.

No one likes him and doesn’t want to work with him.	Nihče ga ne mara in ne želi delati z njim.
I didn't feel well	Nisem se dobro počutil

He's gone now, nothing to see.	Zdaj ga ni več, nič za videti.
Pretty good day.	Precej dober dan.
Unfortunately, no one has done that yet.	Žal tega še nihče ni storil.
There were things that needed to be done.	Bilo je stvari, ki jih je bilo treba narediti.
I thought I wanted to know	Mislil sem, da bi rad vedel
And he does everything for money.	In za denar naredi vse.
I mean, you obviously like it	Mislim, očitno ti je všeč
I would have it.	Imel bi jo.
They never were.	Nikoli niso bili.
I was nobody.	Bil sem nihče.
I won't have enough time	Ne bom imel dovolj časa
I thought he was already gone	Mislil sem, da je že odšel
I need to know how you did it	Moram vedeti, kako si to naredil

I'll be leaving soon	Kmalu bom odšel

I need to know how fast you want it	Moram vedeti, kako hitro si ga želiš

Just that, nothing more.	Samo to, nič več.
However, this cannot be done.	Vendar tega ni mogoče storiti.
This is likely to happen soon.	Verjetno se bo to zgodilo kmalu.
And he knows it.	In on to ve.
It was a friend, he decided.	To je bil prijatelj, se je odločil.
I've never told anyone about this before	Nikoli prej nisem nikomur povedal o tem
He had it now.	Zdaj jo je imel.
I think I can go home now	Mislim, da lahko zdaj domov

He forgot me.	Pozabil me je.
The reason for a lot of this.	Razlog za veliko tega.
You better be there too.	Bolje, da si tudi ti tam.
Yes, he ate in town.	Da, jedel je v mestu.
Apparently he has.	Očitno ima.
Now the time has come.	Zdaj je prišel čas.
You don't know what's going on here.	Ne veš kaj se dogaja tukaj.
But he still has so much to do.	A še toliko mora narediti.
I think it would be so good for you	Mislim, da bi bil tako dober zate

I was lucky.	Imel sem srečo.
Everything can be done.	Vse se da narediti.
I hope everything gets better soon.	Upam, da bo kmalu vse bolje.
I didn’t expect any of this to happen	Nisem pričakoval, da se bo kaj od tega zgodilo
In fact, I could bring that back	Pravzaprav bi to lahko vrnil
I almost forgot	Skoraj sem pozabil
Maybe that's why he helped.	Morda je zato pomagal.
How it happened.	Kako se je zgodilo.
To be able to do something like that.	Da bi lahko naredil kaj takega.
I very much doubt it	Zelo dvomim glede tega
I don't see him giving it to you	Ne vidim, da bi ti ga dal
He didn't want to believe it.	Ni hotel verjeti.
I hope it helps.	Upam, da pomaga.
You know that could be good for me.	Veš, da bi to lahko bilo dobro zame.
I think he may be right	Mislim, da ima morda prav
I want a simple life	Želim si preprosto življenje
It was never me.	To nikoli nisem bil jaz.
For then and for now.	Za takrat in za zdaj.
I really wish you wouldn't tell me that	Res bi si želel, da mi tega ne bi povedal
He has already realized this himself.	To je že sam spoznal.
Don't talk anymore.	Ne govori več.
I will stay here.	ostal bom tukaj.
I didn't know if you knew	Nisem vedel, če veš
In fact, that would be good.	Pravzaprav bi bilo to dobro.
I love seeing him like that.	Rad ga vidim takega.
This is something simple.	To nekaj preprosto je.
He says it just seems obvious to him.	Pravi, da se mu zdi samo očitno.
He looked angry.	Videti je bil jezen.
You were good that way.	Na ta način si bil dober.
I haven't been here before	Prej nisem bil tukaj
There was a lot to it.	Veliko je bilo za to.
I don't see anything anymore.	Nič več ne vidim.
I thought it must be my father.	Mislil sem, da mora biti moj oče.
It comes and goes with me.	Pri meni pride in gre.
No one speaks.	Nihče ne govori.
He said it was nice.	Rekel je, da je lepo.
I wonder when that happened	Sprašujem se, kdaj se je to zgodilo
She didn't do anything for a while.	Nič časa ni storila.
I'd rather not talk about it	Raje ne bi govoril o tem
I didn’t even expect that to happen	Sploh nisem pričakoval, da se bo to zgodilo
Too many people know us now. 	Preveč ljudi nas zdaj ve. 
I'll see him tonight	ga bom videl nocoj
I will never return.	nikoli se ne bom vrnil.
It was so right.	Bilo je tako prav.
You should be there	Moral bi biti tam
It's just life.	To je samo življenje.
I'm glad you did it.	Vesel sem, da ti je uspelo.
I always have been	Vedno sem bil
I know they will.	Vem, da bodo.
I believe not.	Verjamem, da ne.
I should be the one to die	Jaz bi moral biti tisti, ki bi umrl
I had to get out now	Zdaj sem moral ven
I always knew they were alive	Vedno sem vedel, da so živi
Now we just have to go and do it.	Zdaj moramo samo iti in to narediti.
I would never ask you for any of this.	Nikoli te ne bi prosil za kaj od tega.
One must eat.	Človek mora jesti.
We need to see more of him, don't we.	Moramo ga videti več, ne.
But he couldn't help himself.	A si ni mogel pomagati.
This is something that anyone can do.	To je nekaj, kar lahko naredi vsak.
This one wasn't.	Ta ni bil.
I'm not sure anyone knows.	Nisem prepričan, da kdo ve.
And just like that, we're there.	In tako veste, tam smo.
I'm not a boy anymore.	Nisem več fant.
I saw him this afternoon.	Danes popoldne sem ga videl.
I left it as it was	Pustil sem tako kot je bilo
I want everyone here right now	Želim, da so vsi tukaj takoj
I thought so too.	Tudi jaz sem tako mislil.
I failed a little	Malo mi ni uspelo
We don't know where he is.	Ne vemo, kje je.
I will not do anything like that again.	Ne bom več naredil ničesar takega.
They will never know.	Nikoli ne bodo vedeli.
I think this time is good	Mislim, da je ta čas dober
I could meet you there too.	Tudi tam bi se lahko srečal s tabo.

And it needs to be said today.	In to je treba povedati danes.
I certainly am.	zagotovo sem.
He is not.	On ni.
I went, but only for a while.	Šel sem, a le za malo.
I have so many thoughts on this	Imam toliko misli o tem
You really should talk to him.	Res bi moral govoriti z njim.
I liked her then	Takrat mi je bila všeč
i don't need that.	ne potrebujem tega.
And that's hard.	In to je težko.
But that is not enough for her.	Vendar ji to ni dovolj.
I wish we had more time together	Želim si, da bi imeli več časa skupaj
I didn't even want to do that	Tega sploh nisem hotel narediti
I wasn't expecting you	Nisem te pričakoval
I can't get out if it is.	Ne morem ven, če je.
He went to the house.	Odšel je v hišo.
Time was money.	Čas je bil denar.
Apparently he doesn't have to go to work today.	Očitno mu danes ni treba v službo.
I saw what was going on here	Videl sem, kaj se tukaj dogaja
I need a lot of time alone	Potrebujem veliko časa sam
I also really liked that	To mi je bilo tudi zelo všeč
I can only wish it were true.	Lahko si samo želim, da bi bilo res.
There was, in fact, something to it.	Pravzaprav je bilo nekaj v tem.

I can't see him.	Ne morem ga videti.
We will do our own too.	Tudi mi bomo naredili svoje.
I am very sorry that this happened.	Zelo mi je žal, da se je to zgodilo.
I can not do it anymore	ne morem več
I hope they know more.	Upam, da bodo vedeli več.
I'm almost sorry	Skoraj mi je žal
That's more than enough.	To je več kot dovolj.
Probably too much.	Verjetno preveč.
He did what he could.	Naredil je, kar je mogel.
I wanted my life	Hotel sem svoje življenje
To get money.	Da bi dobil denar.
I didn’t teach him that, but he learned it	Tega ga nisem naučil, on pa se je tega naučil
I understand a little	Malo razumem
I didn't expect anything from you tonight	Nocoj nisem pričakoval od tebe
I forgot he was still there	Pozabil sem, da je še vedno tam
They didn't do that.	Tega niso storili.
It would take time.	Za to bi potreboval čas.
I’m sure it must be so beautiful	Prepričan sem, da mora biti tako lepo

I knew it was good.	Vedel sem, da je dobro.
No one said it was so	Nihče ni rekel, da je tako
I think he was just lucky	Mislim, da je imel samo srečo
He was still eating.	Še vedno je jedel.
Here we are.	Tukaj smo.
I didn't say anything.	Nič nisem rekel.
I really liked that	V tem mi je bila zelo všeč
Maybe I was more of someone.	Morda sem bil bolj nekdo.
Sometimes he heard well.	Včasih je dobro slišal.
What was once fine is no more.	Kar je bilo prej v redu, ni več.
No, that seemed wrong to me.	Ne, to se mi je zdelo narobe.
I never was.	Nikoli nisem bil.
He was a child.	On je bil otrok.
We should do much better.	Morali bi narediti veliko bolje.
But I think he was right	Mislim pa, da je imel prav
Let him speak.	Naj govori.
I don't believe it is.	Ne verjamem, da je.
She said.	Rekla je.
I wasn’t too sure why	Nisem bil preveč prepričan, zakaj
However, he could not do that.	Vendar tega ni mogel storiti.
If he left.	Če je odšel.
To have someone find him.	Da bi ga nekdo našel.
And you came here.	In prišel si sem.
It's hard for her.	Težko ji je.
I know what he has to do	Vem, kaj mora narediti
Sometimes he was the one who did it.	Včasih je bil on tisti, ki je to počel.
Okay, we have.	V redu, imamo.
I can't go on without him	Brez njega ne morem naprej
No, not that either.	Ne, tudi tega ne.
Some more time.	Še nekaj časa.
What was right had to be done.	Kar je bilo prav, je bilo treba storiti.
I know she's wanted this for so long	Vem, da si je to želela tako dolgo
So glad you're here !.	Tako vesel, da si tukaj!.
I had three at the time	Takrat sem imel tri
which is good.	kar je dobro.
I think you're right.	Mislim, da imaš prav.
And that was it.	In je bilo to.
I didn't even start.	Sploh nisem začel.
I thought that for years.	To sem mislil leta.
I could leave him there.	Lahko bi ga pustil tam.
For someone else, maybe not.	Za nekoga drugega morda ne.
I didn't really like that	To mi ni bilo zelo všeč
From there, I knew we were going to have trouble	Od tam sem vedel, da bomo imeli težave
No, he said.	Ne, je rekel.
You didn't have to be there.	Ni ti bilo treba biti tam.
I would like to do that	rad bi to naredil
But a lot happened before and after.	A veliko se je zgodilo pred in po tem.
I asked who all lives here	Vprašal sem, kdo vse živi tukaj
This is your first time.	To je tvoj prvič.
And that he didn't want to.	In da ni hotel.
I needed to know more	Moral sem vedeti več
I wanted to stay with him	Hotel sem ostati z njim
I told her.	Povedal sem ji.
I like the work.	Delo mi je všeč.
I know you want her	Vem, da si jo želiš
.	.
I didn’t expect him to have it	Nisem pričakoval, da ga je imel
He wouldn't hear us.	Ne bi nas slišal.
I know how he felt	Vem, kako se je počutil
It's true.	Res je.
Never, never will.	Nikoli, nikoli ne bom.
It's good, he said.	Dobro je, je rekel.
I didn’t know he wouldn’t be there the next day	Nisem vedela, da ga naslednji dan ne bo več
He thought it was good.	Zdelo se mu je dobro.
I need more than that	Potrebujem več kot to
But it's not that hard.	Vendar ni tako težko.
Everything is now.	Vse je zdaj.
Maybe he wanted to.	Mogoče je hotel.
I was thinking of you today.	Danes sem mislil na vas.
I just started doing what I thought was good.	Pravkar sem začel delati tisto, kar se mi je zdelo dobro.
I really like it here.	Tukaj mi je zelo všeč.
I find it hard to believe	Težko sem verjeti
It’s probably hard for both of us.	Verjetno je težko za oba.
I work here and there.	Delo sem in tja.
What happened to you.	Kaj se ti je zgodilo.
I can't believe how many there are	Ne morem verjeti, koliko jih je
I had to tell her something	Moral sem ji nekaj povedati
I wonder what they are	Zanima me kaj so
You were just trying to help me.	Pravkar si mi poskušal pomagati.
I could tell he was angry	Lahko bi rekel, da je bil jezen
They are gone now.	Zdaj jih ni več.
Just three more days.	Samo še tri dni.
It makes me feel so much better	Zaradi tega se počutim veliko bolje
I just told you what happened because you asked	Pravkar sem ti povedal, kaj se je zgodilo, ker si vprašal
I know what your father could do	Vem, kaj bi lahko naredil tvoj oče
I can't be human again	Ne morem biti spet človek
I thought he knew better	Mislil sem, da ve bolje
He never knew how he felt.	Nikoli ni vedel, kako se počuti.
Something to believe in.	Nekaj, v kar je treba verjeti.
I wasn’t sure why we were here	Nisem bil prepričan, zakaj smo tukaj
Where she was last night.	Kje je bila sinoči.
I won't tell him what you said	Ne bom mu povedal, kaj si rekel
I will never forget what she told me	Nikoli ne bom pozabil, kaj mi je rekla
I could do that well.	To bi lahko naredil dobro.
She's been gone for a long time.	Dolgo je ni več.
She likes it.	Všeč ji je.
It was just like every week.	Bilo je tako kot vsak teden.
And maybe you will succeed.	In morda vam bo uspelo.
Not now.	Zdaj pa ne.
I know you heard	Vem, da si slišal
This is a very, very serious question.	To je zelo, zelo resno vprašanje.
I also know he needs you	Vem tudi, da te potrebuje
He was there, he was there.	Bil je tam, bil je tam.
It was all so long ago.	Vse to je bilo tako dolgo nazaj.
It's very difficult to play like that.	Tako igrati je zelo težko.
In fact, he had to.	Pravzaprav je moral storiti.
And he didn't stay.	A ni ostal.
I'm so scared.	Tako se bojim.
He said he was sorry again, and he didn't mean anything by that.	Rekel je, da mu je spet žal, in s tem ni mislil ničesar.
He seemed glad to see me.	Zdelo se je vesel, da me je videl.
That was then.	To je bilo takrat.
Maybe you too.	Mogoče tudi ti.
Not after that.	Po tem ni.
This is not the case.	Pri tem ni tako.
As soon as you can.	Takoj ko lahko.
It just might be.	Samo morda je.
I've had it for quite some time	Imam že kar nekaj časa
I need to talk to you now	Zdaj moram govoriti s tabo
Because someone has to.	Ker nekdo mora.
She needed to know.	Morala je vedeti.
Something was wrong, very wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe, zelo narobe.
I’ve been there before and didn’t find anything	Tam sem bil že prej in nisem našel ničesar

I believe in that	Verjamem v to
I would give her time until tonight to come to me	Dal bi ji čas do nocoj, da pride k meni

I think she probably knew why	Mislim, da je verjetno vedela zakaj
I think that's a good thing	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar
I wonder what it’s like to actually be there	Sprašujem se, kako je pravzaprav biti tam
I don't want them.	nočem jih.

You are the problem.	Ti si problem.
But he's right.	Vendar ima prav.
I wasn’t sure when that happened	Nisem bil prepričan, kdaj se je to zgodilo
I know more than he thinks	Vem več kot on misli
I think she followed him	Mislim, da je šla za njim
It will be difficult for some time.	Nekaj ​​časa bo težko.
I wanted to see what you liked about it	Želel sem videti, kaj ti je pri tem všeč
I just didn’t have it.	Preprosto ga nisem imel.
Something to do.	Nekaj ​​za početi.
Fortunately, they are.	Na srečo so.

You're not too busy.	Nisi preveč zaposlen.
I certainly am	Zagotovo sem
I know, too simple again	Vem, spet preveč preprosto

I hope it will be soon.	Upam, da bo kmalu.
I'm sorry this happened to you	Žal mi je, da se ti je to zgodilo

I was thinking about last night	Mislil sem na sinoči
It was early afternoon.	Bilo je zgodaj popoldne.
He knew he could.	Vedel je, da lahko.
I think we did it	Mislim, da nam je to uspelo
He plays there.	Igra tam.
Maybe there's something to it.	Morda je nekaj na tem.
I feel very good right now	Trenutno se počutim zelo dobro
We would be here.	Bili bi tukaj.
He will want to know.	Želel bo vedeti.
They've been together for years.	Skupaj sta že leta.
I shouldn't be surprised	Ne bi smel biti presenečen
Your father is still a boy.	Tvoj oče je še fant.
I liked it right away	Takoj mi je bil všeč

I needed her to be better	Potreboval sem jo, da bi bilo bolje
And there is a possibility that there are more.	In obstaja možnost, da jih je še več.
There was no one in the room.	V sobi ni bilo nikogar.
I have to go.	Moram pa iti.
But I didn’t like it.	Vendar mi ni bilo všeč.
We're fine, we're fine.	V redu smo, v redu smo.
I want you and no one else	Želim si tebe in nikogar drugega
I will buy everything.	vse bom kupil.
I mean, everything.	Mislim, vse.
Everything is simple.	Vse je preprosto.
That's right.	Tako je.

Or this week.	Ali ta teden.
It had to be hard work.	Težko je bilo treba delati.
I know him really well	Poznam ga res dobro
I've had it for a few years.	Imam ga že nekaj let.
I don’t like it when he does that	Ni mi všeč, ko to počne
I didn't even know that at the time	Tega takrat sploh nisem vedel
I couldn't take it anymore.	Nisem mogel več.
You're a good boy.	Ti si dober fant.
I wonder how she's doing	Zanima me, kako ji gre
I couldn't be there	Nisem mogel biti tam
That's us.	To smo mi.
Now I knew it was mine	Zdaj sem vedel, da je to moje
I know it's not what you like	Vem, da ni tisto, kar ti je všeč
We knew this quite early on.	To smo vedeli precej zgodaj.
He's just a kid.	On je samo otrok.
I am nobody.	jaz nisem nihče.
He is doing well at the moment.	Trenutno mu gre dobro.
I didn’t find it very serious.	Ni se mi zdelo, da je zelo resno.
I think it was obvious	Mislim, da je bilo očitno
I shouldn't have done that	Tega ne bi smel storiti
But I would if I had to.	Vendar bi, če bi bilo treba.
You didn't do that.	Tega nisi storil.
That's how he feels.	Tako se počuti.
Tonight, if I can.	Nocoj, če lahko.
Also a good thing.	Tudi dobra stvar.
I hope this helps.	Upam, da to pomaga.
And so can you.	In tudi ti lahko.
Like him.	Kot on.
Nothing else is happening.	Nič drugega se ne dogaja.
I know you were with him	Vem, da si bil z njim
He will probably die.	Verjetno bo umrl.
I couldn't come out alone	Sam ne bi mogel priti ven
It made her want more.	Zaradi tega si je želela več.
Which she clearly wasn't now.	Kar zdaj očitno ni bila.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Mogoče je to tako.
I didn't expect that	Tega nisem pričakoval
It's time to go.	Čas je, da grem.
I did something wrong	Nekaj ​​sem delal narobe
I used to be a teacher, you know.	Včasih sem bil učitelj, veš.
And it's there again.	In spet je tam.
But he did not eat.	A sam ni jedel.
We have to do that.	To moramo storiti.
I wouldn't want to do that.	Tega ne bi želel storiti.
When he is right, he is right.	Ko je prav, je prav.
I didn’t always feel that way	Nisem se vedno počutil tako
And it was just.	In bilo je samo.
But I was sure it wouldn’t	Vendar sem bil prepričan, da ne bo
That's so much.	To je tako veliko.
I wish we were.	Želim si, da bi bili.
I told him something	Nekaj ​​sem mu povedal
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I almost called you once	Enkrat sem te skoraj poklical
And that.	In to.
I told you that before	To sem ti povedal prej
That's something.	To je nekaj.
I just know this is not the time	Samo vem, da ni pravi čas
I didn’t expect this to happen	Nisem pričakoval, da se bo to zgodilo
It's true.	Res je.
So it wasn't long here.	Zato tukaj ni bilo dolgo.
I am completely surprised	Popolnoma sem presenečen
I will come.	Jaz bom prišel.
He's right about that.	Glede tega ima prav.
This is not an opportunity.	To ni priložnost.
But I knew who he was	Vedel pa sem, kdo je
Maybe not even good.	Morda niti ni dobro.
No one knew where they were.	Nihče ni vedel, kje so.
I think that exists.	Mislim, da to obstaja.
I wish we were doing this for the first time.	Želim si, da bi to storili prvič.
It should continue to be better.	Še naprej bi moral biti boljši.
I gave her this book.	Dal sem ji to knjigo.
I couldn't be that person anymore	Ne bi mogel biti več ta oseba
Everything was as it should be.	Vse je bilo kot mora biti.
But we don't have to.	Vendar nam ni treba.
That was all.	Samo to je bilo.
Lots of things going on.	Veliko stvari se dogaja.
It's not just me anymore	Nisem več samo jaz
He said nothing.	Nič ni rekel.
I hope anyone knows what to do	Upam, da kdo ve kaj narediti
I like it a little more.	Malo bolj mi je všeč.
I know where he lives	Vem, kje živi
I couldn't take it anymore	Nisem mogel več
It's like that for everyone.	Tako je vsem.
I didn't go back.	nisem šel nazaj.
I mean, he was talking to me	Mislim, govoril je z mano
I am not going.	ne grem.
I was so glad you called this morning	Tako sem bil vesel, da si zjutraj poklical
It's just not right.	Samo ni prav.
I almost forgot to tell you	Skoraj sem ti pozabil povedati
Let him talk to him if he wants to.	Naj govori z njim, če želi.
I saw what he wanted.	Videl sem, kaj je hotel.
I was alone and at home	Bila sem sama in doma
You will have me.	Imel me boš.
Tell me what is true and what is not.	Povej mi, kaj je res, kaj ne.
And they are not.	In niso.
I believe her.	jaz ji verjamem.
said my father.	je rekel moj oče.
You haven't seen him, you can't.	Nisi ga videl, ne moreš.
I didn't want them there	Nisem jih želel tam
Or something like that.	Ali kaj takega.
Sometimes it’s still like that.	Včasih je še vedno tako.
I could still decide	Še vedno bi se lahko odločil
I think that would be it.	Mislim, da bi bilo to to.
I didn't go with him	Nisem šel z njim
That would be good enough.	To bi bilo dovolj dobro.
I don't know these people	Poznam te ljudi ne
I shouldn't say that much	Ne bi smel povedati toliko
We made you.	Te smo naredili.
Let it be so.	Naj bo tako.
We all knew that.	To smo vsi vedeli.
This is not going to happen.	To se ne bo zgodilo.
And there will be more.	In še več jih bo.
We have enough of that.	Tega imamo dovolj.
I told you before, no	Sem ti že prej rekel, da ni
I wonder why we didn’t see them	Sprašujem se, zakaj jih nismo videli
I can't see him, not yet	Ne morem ga videti, še ne
It's almost gone.	Skoraj ni več.
I hope you succeed.	Upam, da vam bo uspelo.
I still have to stay home	Še vedno moram ostati doma
I love that you want me so badly	Všeč mi je, da si me tako zelo želiš
I do not dare	ne upam si
She never said anything.	Nikoli ni rekla ničesar.
Now back to me.	Zdaj pa nazaj k meni.
I haven't been there long enough.	Nisem bil dovolj dolgo tam.
Maybe someone was there.	Mogoče je bil kdo tam.
For.	Za.
I understand why you did that	Razumem, zakaj si to naredil
Or maybe you think so.	Ali pa si morda mislite.
I couldn't do that to him	Tega mu nisem mogel storiti
Not even that.	Niti ni tako.
I just wanted to see her	Hotel sem jo samo videti
And it worked.	In je uspelo.
I loved what I could be together	Všeč mi je bilo, kar bi lahko bila skupaj
I was also lucky	Imel sem tudi srečo
I mean, they are now because they are no longer alive	Mislim, zdaj so, ker niso več živi
would hear.	bi slišal.
It was really nice.	Bilo je res lepo.
It wasn't too good.	Ni bilo preveč dobro.
I won't be here at all	Sploh me ne bo tukaj
I have to go to work	Moram na delo
I don't even know how to do it.	Sploh ne vem, kako bi to naredil.
That's just the way it should be.	Samo tako naj bi bilo.
Doing instead of talking about it.	Delati, namesto govoriti o tem.
What we knew we saw we did not see.	Kar smo vedeli, da smo videli, nismo videli.
I didn’t know for sure	Nisem vedel zagotovo
But I didn't get anything out of it	Od tega pa nisem dobil nič
They did it here.	To so storili tukaj.
I think there was something else about it	Mislim, da je bilo na tem nekaj drugega
I wasn't even here.	Sploh nisem bil tukaj.
I'm not sure if he'll make it.	Nisem prepričan, če mu bo uspelo.
And he didn't know what to do anymore.	In ni vedel več, kaj naj naredi.
I will definitely tell him that	To mu bom zagotovo povedal
That's the problem.	To je problem.
No one said too much.	Nihče ni rekel preveč.
I think you must be very sorry	Mislim, da ti mora biti zelo žal
I liked it.	Všeč mi je bil.
He called me right away.	Takoj me je poklical.
I liked it, but not like that	Všeč mi je bil, a ne tako
However, very little.	Vendar pa zelo malo.
There is nothing for it now.	Zdaj ni nič za to.
I wasn't sure about that	O tem nisem bil prepričan
But I wanted to do more.	Želel pa sem narediti več.
And it came from feeling good.	In prišel iz tega, da se počuti dobro.
I saw it myself.	Sam sem videl.
I had to, because of you	Moral sem, zaradi tebe
I'm so glad you found yourself here	Zelo sem vesel, da si se našel tukaj
This is how it should be.	To je tako, kot mora biti.
That's not really you.	To nisi res ti.
I wanted to know all about it	Hotel sem vedeti vse o tem
He said he would try to come.	Rekel je, da bo poskušal priti.
Because it is so.	Ker je tako.
I didn’t even know it was happening	Sploh nisem vedel, da se to dogaja
I'll go out.	šel bom ven.
And my father worked a lot.	In moj oče je veliko delal.
So much so that they didn’t know what to do with it.	Toliko, da niso vedeli, kaj bi s tem.
It seems he has.	Zdi se, da ima.
Maybe I told you.	Morda sem ti povedal.
Can anyone help me.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga.
I'm here for you now	Zdaj sem tukaj zate
I wanted to see	Hotel sem videti
I wouldn’t know much about it	Ne bi vedel veliko o tem
I don't want to be anything.	Nočem biti nič.
It was fine.	Bilo je v redu.
I've never heard of such a thing	Še nikoli nisem slišal za kaj takega
I put that in the book.	To sem dal v knjigo.
And maybe again.	In morda spet.
He's not that at all.	On sploh ni to.
This man was not the one to sit.	Ta človek ni bil tisti, ki bi sedel.
I will always be here	Vedno bom tukaj
You should be there for that	Moral bi biti tam zaradi tega
I had no money.	Nisem imel denarja.
I came here to find a job	Sem prišel sem, da bi našel delo
There was still a chance, but you left.	Še je bila možnost, a si odšel.
I should never have come here	Nikoli ne bi smel priti sem
I actually felt better on my own	Pravzaprav sem se počutil bolje sam
I really wanted to see what you got	Res sem hotel videti, kaj imaš
I wouldn't expect anything else.	Nič drugega ne bi pričakoval.
I will not go with you	ne bom šel s tabo
You have it.	Imaš ga.
I don't see anything about that here	Tukaj ne vidim ničesar o tem
She knew what was going on.	Vedela je, kaj se dogaja.
You should help him.	Moral bi mu pomagati.
We only know that there were more of us before.	Vemo le, da nas je bilo prej več.
I already know what's going on	že vem kaj se dogaja
He didn't say that.	Tako ni rekel.
He's not here either.	Tudi njega ni tukaj.
I wanted him more and more	Vedno bolj sem si ga želel
You can't do without it.	Brez tega tudi ne moreš.
I didn't want to do that	Tega nisem hotel narediti
But that’s probably not what you want.	Vendar verjetno to ni tisto, kar si želite.
I probably had them there	Verjetno sem jih imel tam
I just wanted to get out of there forever	Hotel sem samo oditi od tam za vedno
And it can be done right away.	In to je mogoče storiti takoj.
That was only once, right.	To je bilo samo enkrat, kajne.
He will get it.	Dobil ga bo.
We should be leaving soon.	Kmalu bi morali oditi.
Now I know who you mean	Zdaj vem, koga misliš
I still want to do all these things	Še vedno želim početi vse te stvari
I'd tell you if something like that happened	Povedal bi ti, če bi se kaj takega zgodilo
Tell him.	Povej mu.
And nothing more.	In nič več.
I wasn't there at all yesterday	Včeraj me sploh ni bilo
I hope so	Upam, da ti bo tako
It was really hard for me	Res mi je bilo težko
I had to be alone	Moral sem biti sam
I would forget you.	Pozabil bi te.
He is coming.	On pride.
I wouldn't see him again	Ne bi ga več videl
I've had enough of that	Tega imam dovolj
I knew you would come here.	Vedel sem, da boš prišel sem.
I wish we were.	Želim si, da bi bili.
I already know they won't	Že vem, da ne bodo
I never liked it.	Nikoli mi ni bilo všeč.
And it would be better.	In bolje bi bilo.
This helps me move forward.	To mi pomaga, da grem naprej.
I should have talked to you about this sooner	Moral bi govoriti s tabo o tem prej
I knew what was going on	Vedel sem, kaj se dogaja
I couldn't talk anymore	Nisem mogel več govoriti
He knew it was true.	Vedel je, da je res.
He said he probably was.	Rekel je, da verjetno je.
I couldn't just stay in town	Nisem mogel kar ostati v mestu
She was good to us.	Bila je dobra do nas.
Maybe it's all true.	Morda je vse res.
I didn't find anything	Nič nisem našel
He doesn't like me either.	Tudi mene ne mara.
You didn't forget.	Nisi pozabil.
I know what's going on.	Vem kaj se dogaja.
I haven't had a week	Nisem imel teden dni
I felt like a child again	Spet sem se počutil kot otrok
I didn’t want to talk about it	Nisem hotel govoriti o tem
This is my only chance.	To je moja edina priložnost.
I thought there might be something wrong with you.	Mislil sem, da je s tabo morda nekaj narobe.
I do not know how.	Ne vem kako.
That was not the only reason.	To ni bil edini razlog.
I won't tell you anything like that	Ne bom ti rekel nič takega
We will have a day for people.	Imeli bomo dan za ljudi.
You will like it very much.	Zelo vam bo všeč.
I should work	Jaz bi moral delati
That he can't do it.	Da ne more storiti.
I would go home.	Šla bi domov.
Now I have a reason to live	Zdaj imam razlog za življenje
I know he was surprised	Vem, da je bil presenečen
Like a game.	Kot igra.
I still think that's true.	Še vedno mislim, da je to res.
I didn't do that.	jaz tega nisem storil.
I can't tell you everything	Ne morem ti povedati vsega
I need to know if you did that	Moram vedeti, če si to naredil
I would never have thought that was possible	Nikoli si ne bi mislil, da je to mogoče
I did it.	Uspelo mi je.
It's time to go.	Čas je, da grem.
I was glad to see him	Vesel sem bil, da sem ga videl
And as he did before.	In kot je to storil prej.
I know it's very good	Vem, da je zelo dobro
I had to do something else	Moral sem narediti nekaj drugega
I couldn't just leave either	Tudi jaz nisem mogel kar oditi
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
I didn’t really know why he came	Pravzaprav nisem vedel, zakaj je prišel
However, this did not happen to anyone.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo prav nikomur.
I'll be ready.	Pripravljen bom.
But I have to go home	Moram pa domov
I lost you for a while.	Za nekaj časa sem te izgubil.
I did it with you today	Danes sem to storil s tabo
I loved doing it.	Rad sem to delal.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Nočem več govoriti o tem.
I know better than not	Vem bolje kot ne
I loved this kid.	Všeč mi je bil ta otrok.
I have decided	Odločil sem se
He may be gone now.	Zdaj ga morda že ni več.
I would do anything she said	Naredil bi vse, kar je rekla
He seems to really know everything.	Zdi se, da res pozna vse.
What did you think?	Kaj si mislil?
I know you think so	Vem, da tako misliš
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
That would be quite something.	To bi bilo res nekaj.
This has already happened to me	To se mi je že zgodilo
You really got me.	Res si me dobil.
I knew we wouldn't be here long	Vedel sem, da ne bomo dolgo tukaj
He does this every day.	To počne vsak dan.
It is what you want it to be.	Je, kar želite, da je.
I want to go home forever	Želim iti domov za vedno
He is.	On je.
I needed help	Potreboval sem pomoč
It just feels that way.	Tako se preprosto počuti.
But there was nothing, there was nothing left to see.	Vendar ni bilo ničesar, videti ni bilo več ničesar.
Obviously, there is still a lot of work to do.	Očitno je dela še veliko.
How very.	Kako zelo.
It's okay, we still have time.	Ni kaj, še imamo čas.
I won't talk about it again, my friend	Ne bom več govoril o tem, prijatelj
I'm ready to go now.	Zdaj sem pripravljen iti.
He wanted to come.	Želel je priti.
And, and, and.	In, in, in.
But a lot of things happened to me	Veliko stvari pa se mi je zgodilo
I really don't understand	res ne razumem
I need to see you soon	Kmalu te moram videti
It was nice of him.	Bilo je lepo od njega.
I want to stay here.	Želim ostati tukaj.
But much more needs to be said than that.	Vendar je treba povedati še veliko več kot to.
I think I would come home soon	Mislim, da bi kmalu prišel domov
That afternoon.	Tisto popoldne.
I had to move on	Moral sem iti naprej
This is simply not possible.	To preprosto ni mogoče.
I will lose him forever	Za vedno ga bom izgubil
He doesn't want to do that.	On tega noče storiti.
I probably won't be home tonight	Nocoj me verjetno ne bo doma
And is.	In je.
that is.	to je.
Now let me see.	Zdaj pa naj vidim.
Like everyone, really.	Kot vsi, res.
Very very difficult.	Zelo zelo težko.
You can't tell if you don't know.	Ne moreš povedati, če ne veš.
More than fine.	Več kot v redu.
I have to get there right now	Takoj moram tja
I wasn’t sure what that would be	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj bi to bilo
This is not a question.	To ni vprašanje.
Almost no one did that.	Tega skoraj nihče ni storil.
I could ask him about it	Lahko bi ga vprašal o tem
I will keep waiting	Čakal bom še naprej
I want to see if he's home	Želim videti, če je doma
I already told myself.	Sem si že rekel.
Not so here.	Tukaj ni tako.
It's all true.	Vse je res.
I thought you had that too	Tudi jaz sem mislil, da imaš to
And that was a good thing.	In to je bila dobra stvar.
We're at.	Smo pri.
I think that's a good thing	Zdi se mi, da je to dobra stvar
He gave everything.	Dal je vse.
We don't have too many of them here.	Pri nas jih ni preveč.
No one helped her.	Nihče ji ni pomagal.
We haven't been there yet.	Nismo še bili tam.
Maybe you're over it.	Mogoče si nad tem.
I like you very much	zelo si mi všeč
I like it much more	meni je veliko bolj všeč
Not yet.	Še ni.
I knew it would look really good here.	Vedel sem, da bo tukaj videti res dobro.
maybe I am.	morda sem.
I feel much better when I move on	Veliko bolje se počutim, ko grem naprej
But I can't help it	Ne morem pa pomagati
I haven't been there in a few years	Že nekaj let nisem bil tam
I heard him speak	Slišal sem ga govoriti
I went ahead and felt right at home	Šel sem naprej in se počutil kot doma
What comes of that comes of that.	Kar pride iz tega, pride iz tega.
And sometimes you will.	In včasih boste.
It was actually nice.	Pravzaprav je bilo lepo.
This is very difficult.	To je zelo težko.
I'd like to see that.	To bi rad videl.
That's how he knew.	Tako je vedel.
You had it now.	Zdaj ste ga imeli.
I don't know if you've ever been.	Ne vem, če si bil kdaj.
And she was.	In bila je.
They really are.	Res so.
Almost all, but not all.	Skoraj vsi, a ne vsi.
I hope we have all this	Upam, da imamo vse to
He got the book.	Dobil je knjigo.
That was difficult.	To je bilo težko.
I actually feel good.	Pravzaprav se počutim dobro.
You never knew where you were going to come out.	Nikoli nisi vedel, kje boš prišel ven.
I just wanted you to know what happened	Hotel sem samo, da veš, kaj se je zgodilo
I should help with that	Pri tem bi moral pomagati
I will tell you how to do it	Povedal vam bom, kako to storiti
I felt at home	Počutil sem se kot doma
I'm sure things will be fine	Prepričan sem, da bodo stvari v redu
I need someone to be there	Potrebujem nekoga, da je tam
I told him everything	Povedal sem mu vse
I don't think that's even right.	Mislim, da to niti ni prav.
Everyone has it.	Vsak ga ima.
I don’t know if that was the only reason.	Ne vem, če je bil to edini razlog.
I don’t think it’s ever possible for everyone to like something.	Mislim, da nikoli ni mogoče, da bi bilo vsem nekaj všeč.
He knows very well who he is.	Zelo dobro ve, kdo je.
However, this is not obvious.	Vendar to ni očitno.
Maybe I need more time.	Mogoče potrebujem več časa.
He was my friend.	Bil je moj prijatelj.
She knew that.	To je vedela.
I think there would be more	Mislim, da bi bilo kaj več
Much more needs to be bought.	Treba je kupiti veliko več.
He works there.	Tam dela.
Or he was.	Ali pa je bil.
I had a great time with that	Zelo sem se imel ob tem
It's just not there.	Preprosto ga ni.
We won't do it for you.	Tega ne bomo storili namesto vas.
It was a lot of work with very little time.	Bilo je veliko dela z zelo malo časa.
I was sure.	bil sem prepričan.
It's happening a lot.	Dogaja se na veliko.
He didn't like him.	Ni mu bil všeč.
I hope he doesn't come home at all	Upam, da sploh ne pride domov
I'm fine now.	zdaj sem v redu.
I told him he needed more people	Rekel sem mu, da potrebuje več ljudi
Without it, it is nothing.	Brez tega ni nič.
But I will tell you	Vam pa bom povedal
Long time ago.	Dolgo nazaj.
And what's wrong with that.	In kaj je s tem narobe.
But not for long.	Vendar ne za dolgo.
Everything, everything, everything.	Vse, vse, vse.
A hotel would not be an option	Hotel ne bi bil možnost
He doesn't like me.	Ne mara me.
I would need it.	Potreboval bi ga.
I told myself they were still alive	Rekel sem si, da so še živi
I want you to have it now	Želim, da ga imaš zdaj
I'm busy.	Zaposlen sem.
If you feel like it.	Če se ti zdi tako.
I doubt it a little.	Malo dvomim.
He likes it.	Všeč mu je.
I can’t believe I would do that	Ne morem verjeti, da bi to naredil
I told him to come there	Rekel sem mu, naj pride tja
He lost everything, just like me.	Izgubil je vse, tako kot jaz.
We need to stay together and help each other.	Moramo ostati skupaj in si pomagati.
Who thinks.	Kdo misli.
And he absolutely knows it's true.	In popolnoma ve, da je res.
Maybe he told him to come home.	Mogoče mu je rekel, naj pride domov.
There was nothing left.	Ni bilo nič več.
You know how it goes.	Saj veš kako to gre.
Doing nothing is not an option.	Ne delati nič ni možnost.
He went the way he wanted to go	Šel je tako, kot je hotel iti
It probably won't be much.	Verjetno ne bo veliko.
I've known him for quite some time.	Poznam ga že kar nekaj časa.
I just want to see him	Samo videti ga želim
Something must be wrong.	Nekaj ​​mora biti narobe.
He came and sat down.	Prišel je in sedel.
This has never happened before.	Tako se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
Which it wasn't.	Kar pa ni bilo.
I think he had it for me	Mislim, da je imel to zame
I wish it weren't so	Želim si, da ne bi bilo tako
I kept waiting and waiting	Kar naprej sem čakal in čakal
I did something myself too.	Nekaj ​​sem delal tudi sam.
I can see that for myself	To lahko vidim sam
I didn't mean to come here.	Nisem mislil priti sem.
Because he succeeded.	Ker mu je uspelo.
In fact, you did it.	Pravzaprav ti je uspelo.
You also won't have much time.	Prav tako ne boste imeli veliko časa.
I didn’t know how to help him	Nisem vedel, kako mu pomagati
I didn’t know what happened	Nisem vedel, kaj se je zgodilo
It's about what's right and what's wrong.	Gre za to, kaj je prav in kaj ne.
They were all there.	Vsi so bili pri tem.
It is very .	Je zelo .
I believe he will do a good job.	Verjamem, da bo opravil dobro delo.
He wants me to see.	Želi, da vidim.
I didn't have a good time	Nisem se imel prav dobro
And maybe that's a good thing.	In morda je to dobro.
This is someone who is like a child.	To je nekdo, ki je kot otrok.
It's easy to talk.	Lahko je govoriti.
I've never heard of her before	Še nikoli je nisem slišal
Apparently he's gone.	Očitno ga ni več.
I'm not at home.	Nisem doma.
I am so lucky to have him	Imam tako srečo, da ga imam
However, he did not do so.	Vendar tega ni storil.
He never goes out.	Nikoli ne gre ven.
He is good at what he does.	Dober je v tem, kar počne.
I want to be there to help with that	Želim biti tam, da bi pomagal pri tem
I wasn't then	Takrat nisem bil
I wouldn't let her.	Ne bi ji dovolil.
Couldn't help it.	Ni bilo mogoče pomagati.
He is a good man.	On je dober človek.
I know this is hard for you	Vem, da ti je to težko
I just heard.	pravkar sem slišal.
I asked him why he came to me	Vprašal sem ga, zakaj je prišel k meni
I told you.	Sem ti rekel.
Are you the one?	Ali si ti tisti.
Something was really wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo res narobe.
I'm not here to do that.	Nisem tukaj, da bi to naredil.
It's never happened before.	Še nikoli se ni zgodilo.
Nothing could be done.	Nič ni bilo mogoče storiti.
There was so much we could do.	Toliko bi lahko naredili.
Tell him that.	Povej mu to.
I want that with you	To želim s tabo
I'll be fine.	V redu bom.
I couldn’t be sure he was going to do his job	Nisem mogel biti prepričan, da bo opravil svoje delo
This is work.	To je delo.
I have to go get it	Moram iti po to
Sometimes hard work.	Včasih težko delo.
I knew it wouldn't	Vedel sem, da ne bo
There is more to say.	Še več je za povedati.
I was only human.	Bil sem samo človek.
But he didn't have one.	Vendar ga ni imel.
She said she couldn't tell you.	Rekla je, da ti ne more povedati.
You can't buy me.	Ne moreš me kupiti.
I couldn’t help but like her	Nisem mogel pomagati, da mi je bila všeč
That is the question.	To je vprašanje.
I'll give it a few days	Temu bom dal nekaj dni
I still think that's true	Še vedno mislim, da je to res
He wanted me here.	Hotel me je tukaj.
I learned that as a child	Tega sem se naučil kot otrok
Ni.	Ni.
I told you before.	Prej sem ti rekel.
We know what it is.	Vemo, kaj je.
I really needed the money	Res sem potreboval denar
It never was and never will be.	Nikoli ni bilo in nikoli ne bo.
Don't do anything else.	Ne naredi ničesar več.
I didn't even expect you to be there	Sploh nisem pričakoval, da boš tam
I could tell he was waiting for me	Lahko bi rekel, da me je čakal
Which is fine.	Kar je v redu.
I didn't expect it from him	Nisem pričakoval od njega
I called everyone and told him he was gone.	Vse sem poklical in povedal, da je odšel.
He told me that himself.	To mi je sam rekel.
Only something needed to be done.	Samo nekaj je bilo treba narediti.
I told her she didn't have to	Rekel sem ji, da ji ni treba
I haven't seen him in days	Že nekaj dni ga nisem videl
Don't think he has.	Ne mislite, da ima.
Almost everyone has a car.	Skoraj vsak ima avto.
Not so tonight.	Nocoj pa ni tako.
Maybe he already had one.	Mogoče ga je že imel.
Surely this is obvious.	Zagotovo je to očitno.
He had it.	Imel ga je.
I talked about it almost every week	O tem sem govoril skoraj vsak teden
I thought you might know	Mislil sem, da morda veš
It's not that long ago.	To ni tako dolgo nazaj.
I can't even.	Sploh ne morem.
This is done this way.	To se naredi na ta način.
She didn't even want to.	Sploh si ni želela.
I don’t think so, but it can be.	Mislim, da ne, lahko pa je.
Nothing happened that anyone could see.	Nič se ni zgodilo, kar bi kdo lahko videl.
I didn't expect to find you here.	Nisem pričakoval, da te bom našel tukaj.
I think there is something to be said about this.	Mislim, da je o tem nekaj za povedati.
I wanted to see for myself what was going on	Sam sem hotel videti, kaj se dogaja
I know you well enough	Poznam te dovolj dobro
Just the things he says.	Samo stvari, ki jih pravi.
I see what's going on here	Vidim, kaj se tukaj dogaja
We love it here.	Tukaj nam je všeč.
I can’t believe this just happened	Ne morem verjeti, da se je to pravkar zgodilo
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
Now you obviously don't like it.	Zdaj očitno ti to ni všeč.
But I didn't expect you to be with me	Nisem pa pričakoval, da boš z mano
There is none of that now.	Zdaj ni nič od tega.
I hope it helped you	Upam, da vam je bilo v pomoč
I'm glad you're here !.	Vesel sem, da ste tukaj!.
They weren't.	Niso bili.
I'm not interested in anything else	Nič drugega me ne zanima
You are here, not there.	Tukaj si, ne tam.
I need to see where you're going	Moram te videti, kam gre
Please if anyone can help me.	Prosim, če mi kdo pomaga.
I would definitely die here	Tukaj bi zagotovo umrl
Now is not the time.	Zdaj ni pravi čas.
I couldn't see that at all	Sploh tega nisem mogel videti
You were a boy here.	Tukaj si bil fant.
It's very nice.	Zelo je lepo.
We should do more with this	S tem bi morali narediti več
That's all I said	Samo to sem rekel
I'd be really good at that.	V tem bi bil res dober.
I was lucky.	Imel sem srečo.
This has never happened before.	To se še nikoli ni zgodilo.
Now I know how to do it.	Zdaj vem, kako to storiti.
Sometimes I don’t know what my problem is.	Včasih ne vem, kaj je moj problem.
I really wanted to know	Res sem želel vedeti
We knew what to do.	Vedeli smo, kaj storiti.
I doubt he could see me	Dvomim, da bi me lahko videl
I don't have that much time	Nimam toliko časa
I have nothing else to say	Nimam kaj drugega za povedati
I understand immediately, completely.	Takoj razumem, popolnoma.
I really liked it.	res mi je bilo všeč.
I will never forget him	Nikoli ga ne bom pozabil
I was pretty sure of that.	V to sem bil precej prepričan.
We love it.	Všeč nam je.
I couldn't do that to her	Tega ji nisem mogel storiti
She knew she would.	Vedela je, da bo.
Maybe he's here.	Mogoče je tukaj.
I doubt he'll talk about it	Sumim, da bo govoril o tem
I meant what you said	Mislil sem na to, kar si rekel
I don't know what's wrong.	Ne vem, kaj je narobe.
This is probably not the case.	To verjetno ni tako.
I only saw three of them	Videl sem jih samo tri
I wouldn't say that.	tega ne bi rekel.
I would never make it	Nikoli mi ne bi uspelo
In fact, he was surprised.	Pravzaprav je bil presenečen.
Maybe it was true that there was nothing to do.	Mogoče je bilo res, da ni bilo kaj storiti.
I wanted to be me again	Spet sem hotel biti jaz
He's not so sure.	Ni tako prepričan.
I’ve never been very good at it.	Nikoli nisem bil zelo dober v tem.
I still want to see you	Še vedno te želim videti
I waited long enough	Čakal sem dovolj dolgo
And he did more than that.	In naredil je več kot to.
He didn't leave.	Ni odšel.
I know she'll say no	Vem, da bo rekla ne
I will ask her.	jo bom vprašal.
I was right all along	Ves čas sem imel prav
I was lucky to get this	Imel sem srečo, da sem dobil tega
He's nothing like that.	On ni nič takega.
The reason for this is as follows.	Razlog za to je naslednji.
Not for long.	Ne za dolgo.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
I didn't go there	Nisem šel tja
I know it's not always easy.	Vem, da to ni vedno lahko.
I have to be home.	moram biti doma.
I'm going to the hotel.	Grem v hotel.
That's what.	To je kaj.
There is a lot to do.	Veliko se da narediti.
He knows how we are.	On ve, kako smo.
I did everything right	Vse sem naredil prav
A lot needs to be done now.	Zdaj je treba veliko narediti.
He was absolutely right.	Imel je popolnoma prav.
I think that definitely happened	Mislim, da se je to zagotovo zgodilo
I really didn’t help her much	Res ji nisem veliko pomagal
I've always liked this one	Ta mi je bil vedno všeč
It was very nice.	Bilo je zelo lepo.
It still exists today.	Obstaja še danes.
It will be soon.	To bo kmalu.
I really wanted to talk	Res sem hotel govoriti
You said it right.	Dobro si povedal.
We don't know what to do.	Ne vemo, kaj storiti.
I had a hard time with my job	Težko sem imel svojo službo
I will not forget you here	Tukaj te ne bom pozabil
It really isn't.	Res ni.
That was what he learned.	To je bilo tisto, kar se je naučil.
I’ve done enough of this and now I’m tired.	Tega sem naredil dovolj in zdaj sem utrujen.
I believe I would not do that	Verjamem, da tega ne bi storil
I may never go.	Morda ne bom nikoli šel.
I think we'll see	Mislim, da bomo videli
I told you about it.	Povedal sem ti o tem.
In doing so, he left.	Pri tem je pustil.
I didn't go back	nisem šel nazaj
Often not.	Pogosto ni.
As you would expect.	Kot bi pričakoval.
Not even a little.	Niti malo.
I knew it wouldn't be long.	Vedel sem, da ne bo dolgo prišel.
I would love to see more.	Rad bi videl več.
Not me, man.	Ne jaz, človek.
I think you already knew that at the time	Mislim, da si to že takrat vedel
And you can't go home either.	In tudi domov ne moreš.
I wasn't here to die.	Nisem bil tukaj, da bi umrl.
I haven't heard anything back yet.	Nič še nisem slišal nazaj.
I hope it works for you	Upam, da bo zate delo
I couldn’t be with him the whole time	Nisem mogel biti ves čas z njim
Not to go out.	Da ne grem ven.
I can't always stay long	Ne morem vedno ostati dolgo
I, too, could see this happening	Tudi jaz sem lahko videl, da se to dogaja
It was often enough.	Pogosto je bilo dovolj.
I was never anything but talking.	Nikoli nisem bil nič drugega kot govoril.
And certainly not.	In to zagotovo ne.
I am.	Jaz sem.
It's good to talk.	Dobro je govoriti.
I didn't see anything either	Tudi jaz nisem nič videl
I know I can.	Vem, da lahko.
I was perfectly prepared for that	Bil sem popolnoma pripravljen na to
It was nice to play	Lepo je bilo igrati
I might know what it is.	Morda vem, kaj je to.
I knew what he was up to.	Vedel sem, kaj namerava.
I had to stay that way	Moral sem ostati tako
But tell him nothing.	Nič pa mu povedati.
Actually a very good job	Pravzaprav zelo dobro delo
I wouldn't know.	Ne bi vedel.
I asked her for help	Prosil sem jo za pomoč
Or actually for the first time.	Ali pravzaprav prvič.
Maybe she did it because someone told her to.	Mogoče je to storila zato, ker ji je nekdo rekel.
He was good, so good.	Bil je dober, tako dober.
Or there will be very few.	Ali pa jih bo zelo malo.
Sat back.	Sedel nazaj.
He really did his thing.	Res je opravil svoje.
My question is.	Moje vprašanje je.
I wanted him to be with me	Želela sem si, da bi bil z mano
And good job on that.	In dobro delo na tem.
I didn't know where to go	Nisem vedel, kam naj grem
You have enough of them.	Dovolj jih imaš.
It's obvious why you're here.	Očitno je, zakaj ste tukaj.
Something is happening and soon.	Nekaj ​​se dogaja in kmalu.
When, he can't tell.	Kdaj, ne more povedati.
I've never had them before	Še nikoli jih nisem imel
I wish you could see me	Želim si, da bi me videl
Something seems wrong.	Nekaj ​​se zdi narobe.
To leave was to leave.	Oditi je bilo oditi.
I can't play anymore	Ne morem se več igrati
I'm sure you'll like this one	Prepričan sem, da vam bo ta všeč
You have to believe.	Moraš verjeti.
Therefore.	Zato .
You are not well.	Nisi dobro.
I hope it helps.	Upam, da pomaga.
Just do it.	Samo naredi to.
I tried to get out, but I failed	Poskušal sem priti ven, a mi ni uspelo
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
I haven't forgotten what you did for me	Nisem pozabil, kaj si naredil zame
You don't like being here alone.	Ni ti všeč biti sam tukaj.
I wasn't expecting anyone	Nikogar nisem pričakoval
That can't be.	To ne more biti.
He just died.	Pravkar je umrl.
He could have died just to get there	Lahko bi umrl samo, da bi prišel tja
But it was there.	Vendar je bilo tam.
As if someone died.	Kot da bi nekdo umrl.
I really will.	res bom.
I didn't do the work myself	Sam nisem opravil dela
I believe in these things.	Verjamem v te stvari.
You should do it yourself.	Moral bi to narediti sam.
He was before.	Bil že prej.
You have to see what I am.	Moraš videti, kaj je jaz.
I just found you again.	Pravkar sem te spet našel.
I never thought anything like this would happen	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da se bo kaj takega zgodilo
I have no doubt about that.	V to ne dvomim.
Just like your father.	Tako kot tvoj oče.
I still couldn’t believe he told me that	Še vedno nisem mogel verjeti, da mi je to rekel
He has something to say.	Ima nekaj za povedati.
This can only be done once a week.	To je mogoče storiti le enkrat na teden.
Just forward.	Samo naprej.
He was mine.	Bil je moj.
I will not do anything like that again	Ne bom več naredil ničesar takega
How very much he was not a man.	Kako zelo ni bil človek.
I know her a few years ago	Poznam jo že nekaj let nazaj
There may be more.	Morda jih je več.
I loved that.	Všeč mi je bilo to.
It should be.	Moral bi biti.
I think there are too many of them.	Meni, da jih je preveč.
I didn't expect it	Nisem ga pričakoval
I can’t see this happening.	Ne morem videti, da se to dogaja.
I see that it is still.	Vidim, da je še.
He is the hour.	On je čas.
A little time, that's all he needs	Malo časa, to je vse, kar potrebuje
I was only gone for a few days	Ni me bilo le nekaj dni
I want her back so badly	Tako zelo jo želim nazaj
I know you're in trouble	Vem, da imaš težave
I wonder if he knows	Zanima me, če ve
Something happened when he died.	Nekaj ​​se je zgodilo, ko je umrl.
These are who they are.	To so, kdo so.
It seemed to him.	Zdelo se mu je.
He hadn't seen anyone for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa ni videl nikogar.
I haven't had that in a long time	Tega že dolgo nisem imel
I didn’t even know he was there	Sploh nisem vedel, da je tam
I just want a chance to talk to him	Želim samo priložnost govoriti z njim
I hope the baby is okay	Upam, da bo otrok v redu
It won't.	Ne bo.
I may never see him again	Morda ga nikoli več ne bom videl
So little time.	Tako malo časa.
Something is going on.	Nekaj ​​se dogaja.
I think we should go there	Mislim, da bi morali iti tja
Something just doesn’t seem right to me.	Nekaj ​​se mi preprosto ne zdi prav.
I think you would be fine	Mislim, da bi ti bilo dobro
At the time, he seemed likely to die	Takrat se je zdelo, da bo verjetno umrl
Home now.	Zdaj doma.
I want you to be sure	Želim, da si prepričan
Not that you won't succeed.	Saj ne, da ti ne bo uspelo.
You have to be alone.	Moraš biti sam.
It was really simple.	Bilo je res preprosto.
I don't know if that's true.	Ne vem, če je to res.
I had to know where she was.	Moral sem vedeti, kje je bila.
I just wanted to help	Hotel sem samo pomagati
Better than the first time.	Bolje kot prvič.
But he still has so much to do	A še toliko mora narediti
You're not from here.	Nisi od tukaj.
He liked it very much.	Zelo mu je bilo všeč.
I thought maybe he was with you	Mislil sem, da je morda s tabo
I have no doubt about that	V to ne dvomim
She's not here today.	Danes je ni tukaj.
A few more things.	Še nekaj stvari.
If anything.	Če je kaj.
I had to see this for myself to be sure.	To sem moral videti sam, da bi bil prepričan.
's	' s
Maybe I have a few more days	Mogoče imam še nekaj dni
A child.	Otrok.
And if you can, for how long.	In če lahko, kako dolgo.
I haven't seen him much	Nisem ga veliko videl
And always will be.	In vedno bo.
They probably were.	Verjetno so bili.
There was nothing I could do about it.	Nič nisem mogel storiti glede tega.
A man would be good	Človek bi bil dober
Mine is too.	Tudi moj je.
He knew what you were thinking.	Vedel je, kaj misliš.
She knew she would.	Vedela je, da bo.
I know he won't be back	Vem, da ga ne bo nazaj
I want them alive	Želim, da so živi
I want us to be together	Želim, da sva skupaj
I just wouldn't.	Preprosto ne bi.
I can't help you get to him	Ne morem ti pomagati priti do njega
I didn't know it was your father	Nisem vedel, da je to tvoj oče
I haven't seen you in days	Nisem te videl nekaj dni
It seemed very good to do so.	To se je zdelo zelo dobro, da to storim.
I was out of work what.	Bil sem brez dela kaj.
Very.	Zelo.
, but it will not.	, vendar ne bo.
He says for sure.	Pravi, da zagotovo.
And so on and so forth.	In tako naprej in naprej.
You know what you're going to get from him.	Veš, kaj boš dobil od njega.
I doubt it is.	Dvomim, da je.
I really wanted to see her again	Zelo sem si jo želel spet videti
I would get money.	Dobil bi denar.
She said she wanted to go home.	Rekla je, da želi domov.
It did for me.	Zame se je.
I already know who you are	že vem kdo si
And it never will be.	In nikoli ne bo.
I would lose too much	Izgubil bi preveč
Just a possibility.	Samo možnost.
Not at all.	Niti malo.
I know them.	poznam jih.
That's what I wanted him to do	To sem mu želel
I'm glad she succeeded.	Vesel sem, da ji je uspelo.
It's there as if it weren't there.	Tam je, kot da ga ne bi bilo.
She must have known already.	Zagotovo je že vedela.
My Life.	Moje življenje.
He was right and we both knew.	Imel je prav in oba sva vedela.
It probably is.	Verjetno je.
I'll give you that.	To ti bom dal.
I did these things	Te stvari sem naredil
Sometimes this is hard to do.	Včasih je to težko narediti.
I wouldn't need her after today	Po danes je ne bi potreboval
He was not sorry.	Ni mu bilo žal.
I would work with almost anything.	Delal bi s skoraj vsem.
I had to be alone for that	Za to sem moral biti sam
I could work back from that.	Od tega bi lahko delal nazaj.
I know a lot of people	Poznam veliko ljudi
He doesn't want anymore.	Noče več.
I know what you will find	Vem, kaj boš našel
I never forgot him	Nikoli ga nisem pozabil
Now you know almost everything.	Zdaj veš skoraj vse.
Here's the thing.	Tukaj je stvar.
I saw it all	vse sem videl
03:30.	03:30.
Because if you were, you wouldn't be here right now.	Ker če bi bil, te zdaj ne bi bilo tukaj.
He comes home here.	Tukaj pride domov.
Maybe not everyone.	Morda ne vsi.
I believe in us.	verjamem v nas.
I heard you say that	Slišal sem, ko si to rekel
The question is how.	Vprašanje je, kako.
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisem naredil nič narobe
I just want to be	rad bi samo bil
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
I didn't have a home	Nisem imel doma
Or in me.	Ali v meni.
I didn't want to be alone	Nisem hotel biti sam
He didn't come.	Ni prišel.
I'm nothing like that.	jaz nisem nič takega.
There was something more	Bilo je nekaj več

I didn't see any of that	Nič od tega nisem videl
I'm probably really tired	Verjetno sem res utrujen
I see things that are not	Vidim stvari, ki jih ni
However, this is not the case.	Vendar ni tako.
I did so little.	Tako malo sem naredil.
I didn't expect to see him here	Nisem pričakoval, da ga bom videl tukaj
I shouldn't go to work	Ne bi smel iti v službo
Why? 	Zakaj?
I thought it still was	Mislil sem, da je še vedno
he asked himself.	se je vprašal.
I can't do better than that here.	Tukaj mi ne gre bolje od tega.
But if not, that was fine too.	Če pa ne, je bilo tudi v redu.
I just don’t see that happening.	Samo ne vidim, da bi se to zgodilo.
I mean, you're right	Mislim, prav imaš
I think that’s all he does all day	Mislim, da je to vse, kar počne ves dan
That's your friend. '	To je tvoj prijatelj'.
He said so much.	Toliko je rekel.
Someone needs you.	Nekdo te potrebuje.
Not really.	Pravzaprav ni.
I didn't know anything like that was going to happen to you	Nisem vedel, da se ti bo zgodilo kaj takega
And that time is now.	In ta čas je zdaj.
You probably haven't heard	Verjetno nisi slišal
I'm sure of that	O tem sem prepričan
It's not about money for me.	Zame ne gre za denar.
What were you doing?	Kaj si počel.
I wasn't tired at all	Sploh nisem bil utrujen
And we were the only ones there.	In tam smo bili edini.
The boy is ever.	Fant je kdaj.
I don't know how, not yet	Ne vem kako, še ne
I met them all.	Vse sem jih srečal.
I asked him what he was doing	Vprašal sem ga, kaj počne
He was playing.	Igral se je.
There is nothing to see here again.	Spet tukaj ni kaj videti.
You don't have to now.	Zdaj jih ni treba.
I would give her a few days	Dal bi ji nekaj dni
I worked the next day	Naslednji dan sem delal
I think that's right.	Mislim, da je to prav.
I hope to leave when that happens	Upam, da bom odšel, ko se bo to zgodilo
I can't go out.	Ne morem ven.
And so soon.	In tako kmalu.
I didn’t say he was good	Nisem rekel, da je dober
I think we need to get there	Mislim, da moramo priti tja

Good, that's all	Dober, a samo to

What is it.	Kaj je to.
Not much else.	Ne veliko drugega.
I know him better than you	Poznam ga bolje kot ti
I'm afraid of what would happen	Bojim se, kaj bi se zgodilo
You were the one.	Ti si bil tisti.
Simple as that.	Tako preprosto.
I asked her about it earlier	Prej sem jo vprašal o tem
They certainly knew.	Zagotovo so vedeli.
We shouldn't either.	Prav tako ne bi smeli.
You were lucky.	Imel si srečo.
We had a car that was.	Imeli smo avto, ki je bil.
This is really a must see.	To je res treba videti.
I was him.	jaz sem bil on.
In fact, it was really good.	Pravzaprav je bilo res dobro.

Maybe I could help	Morda bi lahko pomagal
I want to be here and now	Želim biti tukaj in zdaj
I wish we had more time on our own	Želim si, da bi imeli več časa sami
I’ve never seen this happen before.	Še nikoli nisem videl, da bi se to zgodilo.

It looked so simple.	Videti je bilo tako preprosto.
I see what happened	Vidim, kaj se je zgodilo

I was very angry at the time about what happened	Takrat sem bil zelo jezen zaradi tega, kar se je zgodilo
Nobody found it.	Nihče ga ni našel.
I went home.	Šel sem domov.
I wanted to know where he was going.	Hotel sem vedeti, kam gre.
That was simply wrong.	To je bilo preprosto narobe.
I have to go now.	Zdaj moram iti.
A week if we're lucky	Teden dni, če bomo imeli srečo
Because then.	Ker takrat.
I was in front of him	Bil sem pred njim
Ste v.	Ste v.

He thinks so.	Misli, da.
I came back tonight.	Nocoj sem se vrnil.
Nobody goes home here.	Nihče tukaj ne gre domov.
Or your father.	Ali pa tvoj oče.
I know this because the boy was me	To vem, ker sem bil fant jaz

I can do anything for her	Vse ji lahko storim
That's the only thing.	To je edina stvar.
I don't feel right.	Ne počutim se prav.
This is what is wrong.	To je tisto, kar je narobe.
I don't like that.	Ni mi všeč, da je.

I'm so tired.	Tako zelo sem utrujen.
A man like you could be of great help to me	Človek, kot si ti, bi mi lahko bil v veliko pomoč
I will be back and hopefully soon	Vrnil se bom in upam, da kmalu
That's not true either.	Tudi to ni res.
Just like now.	Tako kot zdaj.
And that's not good.	In to ni dobro.
I left my stuff there.	Tam sem pustil svoje stvari.
He did that.	To je storil.
No, he didn't mean that.	Ne, ni mislil tega.
In three years.	Za tri leta.
I just really wanted you there	Samo res sem te želel tam

His father taught him another.	Oče ga je naučil drugega.
But it was there.	Je pa bilo tam.
He was not ready.	Ni bil pripravljen.
I talked to him for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa sem govoril z njim.
And he never could be, never was.	In nikoli ni mogel biti, nikoli ni bil.
And there is nothing to be done about it.	In glede tega ni treba narediti ničesar.
And then you knew.	In takrat si vedel.
That was not the case.	Tako ni bilo.
A child you will not soon	Otrok, ki ga ne boš kmalu

We have some time.	Imamo nekaj časa.

They didn’t do much better.	Niso naredili veliko bolje.
That probably won't happen.	To se verjetno ne bo zgodilo.

I'm going, she said.	Grem, je rekla.
I think he loves you	Mislim, da te ima rad
I didn't know that.	Tega nisem vedel.

For a long time.	Za dolgo časa.
This is not a game.	To ni igra.
He went back.	Odšel je nazaj.
I lost you before.	Prej sem te izgubil.
I didn't even think about it	Sploh nisem mislil
I think he thought you said	Mislim, da je mislil, da si rekel
Maybe sometimes more than that.	Morda včasih več kot to.
I have a problem before	Prej imam problem
He didn't know what to do about it.	Ni vedel, kaj naj stori glede tega.
I just didn't expect that	Samo tega nisem pričakoval
I didn't know where my father was	Nisem vedel, kje je moj oče
You are my only friend.	Ti si moj edini prijatelj.
However, this is not the case	Vendar temu ni tako
I can't talk.	Ne morem govoriti.
And so he waited.	In tako je čakal.
I mean, no.	Mislim, ne.
I learned so much.	Toliko sem se naučil.
That's enough.	To je dovolj.
You're not like us.	Nisi kot mi.
I could come back.	Lahko bi se vrnil.
And obviously no one can do that for so long.	In očitno tega nihče ne more početi tako dolgo.
I didn’t think he wanted to talk about it	Nisem mislil, da želi govoriti o tem
Something must be done.	Nekaj ​​je treba narediti.
He just doesn't live.	Samo ne živi.
It is and it is not.	Je in ni.
I tried to speak, but I couldn’t	Poskušal sem govoriti, a nisem mogel
I wondered why this was so	Vprašal sem se, zakaj je temu tako
I tried to get here.	Poskušal sem priti sem.
I can't do anything.	nič ne morem.
I'll tell you this again.	To vam bom še enkrat povedal.
I know you want to go there right now	Vem, da želiš iti tja takoj
I don't think that's a problem	Mislim, da to ni problem
We really shouldn't.	Res ne bi smeli.
He never called again.	Nikoli več ni poklical.
Everyone did it.	Vsi so to storili.
She had to go.	Morala je iti.
I just wanted you to know that	Samo hotel sem, da to veš
But he had to.	Moral pa je.
It's nothing but work, work, work.	To ni nič drugega kot delo, delo, delo.
I know he doesn't have that kind of money	Vem, da nima takega denarja
I think they did it so well.	Mislim, da so to naredili tako dobro.
I don't see how it happened.	Ne vidim, kako se je zgodilo.
However, this is even more.	Vendar pa je to še več.
I think you have some time left	Mislim, da imaš še nekaj časa
I know it was wrong.	Vem, da je bilo narobe.
I will never do that again.	Nikoli več tega ne bom storil.
Now he can't.	Zdaj pa ne more.
Living with you is not enough	Življenje s tabo ni dovolj
There's a lot more here.	Tukaj je veliko več.
I've never heard of it	Še nikoli nisem slišal za to
I went to see them	Šel sem jih videti
Or for the whole time.	Ali pa za ves čas.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ni to.
Again, this remains to be seen.	Spet, to je treba še videti.
That's none of my business.	To ni moja stvar.
And they never seem to care.	In zdi se, da jih to nikoli ne zanima.
I helped him and he knows it	Pomagal sem mu in on to ve
I'm like you.	jaz sem kot ti.
My father would play with us.	Moj oče bi se igral z nami.
I didn’t know what was going to happen	Nisem vedel, kaj se bo zgodilo
Neither is he.	Tudi on ni.
It hasn't happened yet.	Ni se še zgodilo.
Is there such a thing ?.	Ali obstaja kaj takega?.
She wanted something like that, but even more so.	Želela si je nekaj takega, a še bolj.
It was hard, it really was.	Bilo je težko, res je bilo.
I didn't see him at all	Sploh ga nisem videl
It's true.	Res je.
I love that you're here	Všeč mi je, da si tukaj
I hope that doesn’t happen	Upam, da se to ne bo zgodilo
I wouldn't do that to you	Tega ti ne bi naredil
You are not my friend.	Nisi moj prijatelj.
I didn't lose everything	Nisem izgubil vsega
It doesn't help me.	Ne pomaga mi.
That's all of us.	To smo vsi.
I had a job.	Imel sem službo.
That's what I want you to do	To bi ti želel
I can't do that.	Tega ne morem.
I didn’t want to know any of that	Nič od tega nisem hotel vedeti
I had it myself.	Sam sem ga imel.
In fact, I haven’t asked anyone yet	Pravzaprav še nisem nikogar vprašal
I told him there wasn't enough time	Rekel sem mu, da ni dovolj časa
Even if it’s not, actually.	Tudi če ni, pravzaprav.
I want to hear from you all day	Rad bi se slišal od tebe ves dan
No one found him.	Nihče ga ni našel.
It really isn't.	Res ni.
Who hasn't been there in years.	Ki ga že leta ni bilo tam.
I don’t think that’s likely to happen.	Mislim, da se to verjetno ne bo zgodilo.
He didn't do that.	Tega ni storil.
I tried to do more.	Poskušal sem narediti več.
neither am I.	tudi jaz to nisem
That's how it's happening.	Tako se dogaja.
He never said he was sorry.	Nikoli ni rekel, da mu je žal.
I already knew all this	Vse to sem že vedel
He will not forget.	Ne bo pozabil.
I had to believe I could	Moral sem verjeti, da lahko
And this thing is good !.	In ta stvar je dobra!.
He tells us, no.	On nam pravi, ne.
He's a good boy.	On je dober fant.
I didn't want to believe it.	Nisem hotel verjeti.
He saw this thing for himself.	To stvar je videl sam.
I knew how it felt	Vedel sem, kako se to počuti
I heard you won	Slišal sem, da si zmagal
I know some of them	Nekaj ​​jih poznam
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
I really wish him well	Res mu želim dobro
Apparently not.	Očitno ni.
But he did.	Vendar je to storil.
So be it, he thought.	Naj bo, si je mislil.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
I am him.	jaz sem on.
There is a lot on this.	Veliko je na tem.
He said you'd be alone when he died.	Rekel je, da boš sam, ko bo umrl.
I couldn't see myself completely	Nisem se mogel popolnoma videti
It goes on and on and on.	Še naprej in naprej in naprej gre.
You never know here.	Nikoli ne veš tukaj.
A very long time actually.	Pravzaprav zelo dolgo.
He doesn't have them himself.	Sam jih nima.
I wouldn't let her eat that day	Tisti dan ji ne bi pustil več jesti
You may have done it yourself.	Morda ste to storili tudi sami.
This is an opportunity for you.	To je priložnost za vas.
I see now.	zdaj vidim.
That's really all.	To je pravzaprav vse.
I will make them quickly	Hitro jih bom naredil
I am very sorry about that	Zelo mi je žal za to
I was definitely angry now	Zdaj sem bil zagotovo jezen
I wanted to tell you yesterday	Včeraj sem ti hotel povedati
We didn't like him.	Ni nam bil všeč.
I'm a man just like you.	Človek sem tako kot ti.
I liked it right away	Takoj mi je bilo všeč
That was the question.	To je bilo vprašanje.
I would be fine all the time	Ves čas bi bil dobro
He just bought it here.	Pravkar ga je kupil tukaj.
I think he knew too	Mislim, da je tudi on vedel
I asked him if there was, but he didn’t know	Vprašal sem ga, če obstaja, pa ni vedel
That's not the question now.	To zdaj ni vprašanje.
I called him this afternoon	Poklical sem ga danes popoldne
He thought he was going to get something.	Mislil je, da bo nekaj dobil.
Tell me everything.	Povej mi vse.
I was here for that.	Za to sem bil tukaj.
I wish she hadn't done that	Želim si, da tega ni storila
That's when he started.	Takrat je začel.
I would do anything for you	vse bi naredil zate
Or almost three.	Ali skoraj tri.
There was nothing that I could do about it	Nič pa nisem mogel storiti glede tega
Maybe he's right.	Mogoče ima prav.
I'll call her.	jo bom poklical.
We've seen that before.	To smo že videli.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Nisem prepričan, da je tako.
I never knew who.	Nikoli nisem vedel kdo.
I can’t help but wonder what he’s thinking	Ne morem si pomagati, da se ne bi vprašal, kaj si misli
I knew he was there	Vedel sem, da je tam
This is not the time.	To ni pravi čas.
You're not even human.	Sploh nisi človek.
Everyone has money.	Vsak ima denar.
I want to be on this	Želim biti na tem
You wanted to or you wouldn’t call.	Želel si ali pa ne bi poklical.
I hope it becomes	Upam, da bo to postal
But it didn’t look like it would.	Vendar ni bilo videti, kot da bi.
They didn't even.	Niti niso.
Someone should know.	Nekdo bi moral vedeti.
I've never felt this way before	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil
That was not good for me.	To mi ni bilo dobro.
I used to love school.	Včasih sem imel rad šolo.
But I would never, ever say that	Tega pa ne bi nikoli, nikoli rekel
Glad he's gone.	Vesel, da ga ni več.
Not so.	Ni tako.
I didn't do that	Tega nisem počel
Gone forever.	Odšel za vedno.
i would be good at that	jaz bi bil dober v tem
I would be leaving soon	Kmalu bi odšel
That's how it's supposed to be.	Tako naj bi bilo.
I fear this more than anything	Bojim se tega bolj kot vsega
And now she's gone.	In zdaj je ni več.
We could do more.	Lahko bi naredili z več.
Difficult.	Težko.
You seriously.	Ti resno.
Now that he knew he would see me again.	Zdaj, ko je vedel, da me bo spet videl.
There's nothing I can do about it	Ne morem nič storiti glede tega
I actually got a lot more.	Pravzaprav sem dobil veliko več.
We don't know yet.	Ne vemo še.
I was a good man.	Bil sem dober človek.
He came.	Prišel je.
And we shouldn't.	In ne bi smeli.
Looks like you are doing very well.	Videti je, da vam gre zelo dobro.
I don't think that's possible.	Mislim, da to ni mogoče.
There are many more.	Veliko jih je več.
They knew nothing about it.	O tem niso vedeli ničesar.
I didn't want to see him	Nisem ga hotel videti
I didn't see anything, I just heard	Ničesar nisem videl, samo slišal
This is serious for us.	To je za nas resno.
I can't do without it.	Ne morem brez tega.
I will not be working this week	Ta teden ne bom delal
I always thought that was too much	Vedno sem mislil, da je to preveč
Everything from me.	Vse od mene.
I can't get away from this	Ne morem oditi od tega
After the party.	Po zabavi.
I can't go out either	Tudi jaz ne morem ven
That thing is good.	Ta stvar je dobra.
That was something we needed to know.	To je bilo nekaj, kar smo morali vedeti.
I shouldn't have stayed that long	Ne bi smel ostati tako dolgo
They never saw her again.	Nikoli več je niso videli.
And the next.	In naslednji.
He was fine.	Bilo mu je dobro.
It's still there.	Še vedno je tam.
I wonder how she knew that	Sprašujem se, kako je to vedela
No, it's actually that simple.	Ne, pravzaprav je tako preprosto.
I know both of them.	Poznam oba.
Like me.	Tako kot jaz.
This can never be so.	To nikoli ne more biti tako.
I'm not sure I would today.	Nisem prepričan, da bi danes.
I have a good thing.	Imam dobro stvar.
we will not.	ne bomo.
You have to come now.	Zdaj moraš priti.
And you would be.	In ti bi bil.
I felt like me.	Počutil sem se kot jaz.
I find that hard to believe.	To težko verjamem.
I really have to go	Res moram iti
But we can't help her.	Vendar ji ne moremo pomagati.
I just wanted to be ready	Hotel sem biti samo pripravljen
I've never seen that before	Tega še nikoli nisem videl
It was there right away	Takoj je bilo tam
Everything would be fine again.	Vse bi bilo še enkrat prav.
I can only hope so much	Lahko samo toliko upam
I really wanted to get out of there	Zelo sem si želel oditi od tam
He didn't even have to do that.	Tega mu sploh ni bilo treba narediti.
We will succeed.	Uspelo nam bo.
Even for a while.	Tudi za nekaj časa.
I had to tell him something	Nekaj ​​sem mu moral povedati
I didn't think there was anything wrong with that	Nisem si mislil, da je s tem kaj narobe
I also want to tell you a few things	Tudi jaz vam želim povedati nekaj stvari
Nothing, he said.	Nič, je rekel.
I haven't seen him before	Prej ga nisem videl
If there was money, we would be there.	Če bi bil denar, bi bili tam.
And that was not enough.	In to ni bilo dovolj.
I knew he needed me	Vedel sem, da me potrebuje
I didn’t know for sure	Nisem vedel zagotovo
Something happened in the room.	Nekaj ​​se je zgodilo v sobi.
I also knew this was going to happen	Vedel sem tudi, da se bo to zgodilo
There was very little of that.	Tega je bilo zelo malo.
It can't be that good.	Ne more biti tako dobro.
Which you didn't.	Kar pa nisi.
He wanted her.	Želel jo je.
I haven't seen her since.	Od takrat je nisem videl.
And it really doesn't do anything.	In res nič ne naredi.
I had a nice time.	Imel sem se lepo.
That's it.	Toliko je.
You're with me now.	Zdaj si z mano.
He didn't expect this now.	Zdaj tega ni pričakoval.
Everything was as he had left it.	Vse je bilo tako, kot je pustil.
I didn't find anything about it here.	Tukaj nisem našel ničesar o tem.
He's not here now.	Zdaj ga ni tukaj.
It's nothing.	Nič ni.
Now I really have to go.	Zdaj moram res iti.
This is clearly not the case.	Temu očitno ni tako.
I did more than that	Naredil sem več kot to
It's really not my thing.	To res ni moja stvar.
Just what he knows or doesn’t know yet.	Samo tisto, kar ve ali še ne ve.
I want you to know that	Želim, da to veš
I will never tell anyone what is going on	Nikoli ne bom nikomur povedal, kaj se dogaja
I don’t know what can and what can’t	Ne vem, kaj lahko in kaj ne
I still thought we would succeed	Še vedno sem mislil, da nam bo uspelo
I was glad she was here tonight	Vesel sem bil, da je bila nocoj tukaj
Think, think, think.	Misli, misli, misli.
I'd rather see something else	Raje bi videl kaj drugega
I didn't want to see her.	Nisem je hotel videti.
The problem is me.	Problem sem jaz.
I didn’t want anyone to know about it	Nisem hotel, da bi kdo vedel za to
Nobody does that today.	Danes tega ne počne nihče.
This is true for me.	To je res zame.
No matter where you are.	Ne glede na to, kje ste.
That's true, you know.	To je res, veš.
There were many of them.	Bilo jih je veliko.
He is very good.	Zelo dober je.
I would be back home soon.	Kmalu bi se vrnil domov.
But not everyone looks good.	Vendar niso vsi videti dobro.
Yes.	Je.
I very much doubt it	zelo dvomim
He completely forgot about it.	Popolnoma je pozabil na to.
I did everything he told me	Naredil sem vse, kar mi je rekel
That makes me love him all the more	Zaradi tega ga imam še toliko bolj rad
Nothing for me.	Nič zame.
I can't speak right now	Trenutno ne morem govoriti
You never will.	Nikoli ne boš.
We are not alone in this place.	Na tem mestu nismo sami.
I haven't seen you in a while	Že nekaj časa te nisem videl
Not so here.	Tukaj ni tako.
I didn't want to for so long	Nisem hotel tako dolgo
I said your father works for me.	Rekel sem, da tvoj oče dela zame.
I am tired.	utrujen sem.
Maybe I can do something for you	Morda bom lahko kaj naredil zate
We all had a great time.	Vsi smo se imeli lepo.
I think so	Mislim, da bo tako
You should know that	To bi moral vedeti
You seem to be.	Zdi se, da si.
I would never wish that on anyone	Tega ne bi nikoli nikomur želel
I actually thought so	Pravzaprav sem to mislil
This has not happened just once.	To se ni zgodilo samo enkrat.
I hope he gets it.	Upam, da ga bo dobil.
And because of that.	In zaradi tega.
I don't have it anymore.	Nimam ga več.
It's a game.	To je igra.
I knew how much you wanted something like that	Vedel sem, kako zelo si želiš nekaj takega
You came to me.	Prišel si do mene.
I've had enough of that myself.	Tudi sam sem imel tega dovolj.
Also if it is.	Prav tako tudi, če je.
He is a man.	On je človek.
He has to work with that.	S tem mora delati.
I didn't even know what	Sploh nisem vedela kaj
I want to tell you everything	Vse ti želim povedati
That he wouldn't need it.	Da mu ne bi bilo treba.
I'm pretty sure of that	V to sem skoraj prepričan
They had no children.	Niso imeli otrok.
I met him last night	Sinoči sem ga srečal
I thought he wanted to know	Mislil sem, da želi vedeti
I should go for it now	Zdaj bi moral iti na to
I am no longer a child, he said.	Nisem več otrok, je rekel.
I love doing it.	Rad to počnem.
And he knows exactly what to do.	In prav ve, kaj mora storiti.
So simple.	Tako preprosto.
But I think he's gone	Mislim pa, da je odšel
There is no such thing	Nič takega ni
Not for years.	Že več let ne.
I don't have much time.	Nimam veliko časa.
He wants to know what's going on.	Želi vedeti, kaj se dogaja.
I didn't have to talk to him	Ni mi bilo treba govoriti z njim
We did that last night.	To smo storili sinoči.
He has few.	Malo jih ima.
I didn't want to be alone again	Nisem hotel biti spet sam
It happened to me once	Enkrat se mi je to zgodilo
I mean, nothing but me	Mislim, nič drugega kot jaz
You seem to have a lot more.	Zdi se, da imaš še veliko.
I didn't ask for any of that	Nič od tega nisem prosil
I didn’t actually do anything.	Pravzaprav nisem naredil ničesar.
Now there seems to be something else here.	Zdaj se zdi, da je tukaj nekaj drugega.
But he heard and saw nothing.	Vendar ni slišal in videl ničesar.
All because of me.	Vse zaradi mene.
You may or may not.	Lahko ali pa tudi ne.
I would have.	Jaz bi imel.
I wonder where he met her	Sprašujem se, kje jo je spoznal
I believe in these things	Verjamem v te stvari
Someone already lives there.	Nekdo že živi tam.
She said nothing more.	Nič več ni rekla.
I already had it, but I didn’t say anything	Imel sem ga že, pa nisem rekel nič
I saw something.	Nekaj ​​sem videl.
I mean, how.	Mislim, kako.
I have something for you.	Imam nekaj zate.
We didn't do anything.	Nič nismo naredili.
Now that's not the case.	Zdaj temu ni tako.
I could not.	nisem mogel.
I was lucky.	Imel sem srečo.
You should see what he did yesterday.	Moral bi videti, kaj je naredil včeraj.
No one knows who he is.	Nihče ne ve, kdo je.
Maybe he wasn't there.	Morda ga ni bilo.
I tried to make sure I thought I would	Poskušal sem se prepričati, da bi mislil, da bo
You can't help it.	Ne moreš pomagati.
I'm not going there.	Ne grem tja.
I wish that would happen	Želim si, da bi se to zgodilo
That’s when I really met her	Takrat sem jo res spoznal
So can we, you and me.	Lahko tudi mi, ti in jaz.
But we did it.	Vendar smo to storili.
I did all these things	Vse te stvari sem naredil
If he was, he would have to do it.	Če bi bil, bi moral to narediti.
It's time.	Čas je.
Something seems wrong	Nekaj ​​se zdi narobe
You man.	Ti človek.
She wasn't there yesterday or today.	Ni je bilo ne včeraj ne danes.
I know what would happen	Vem, kaj bi se zgodilo
I know you can't help yourself	Vem, da si ne moreš pomagati
It has never been so difficult.	Še nikoli ni bilo tako težko.
I’d like to say it is, but it’s not.	Rad bi rekel, da je, vendar ni.
I heard I talked to you about it	Slišal sem, da sem govoril s tabo o tem
He had nothing to say once.	Enkrat ni imel kaj povedati.
I see you wanted to say something	Vidim, da si hotel nekaj povedati
I said, but it wasn’t from me	Rekel sem, a ni bilo od mene
I'll see her in the afternoon	Popoldne jo bom videl
I think we'll just have to see	Mislim, da bomo morali samo videti
He looked fine yesterday morning too.	Tudi včeraj zjutraj je bil videti v redu.
It shouldn't be.	Ne bi smel biti.
Sometimes it's too much for you.	Včasih je preveč za vas.
He said he knows and will.	Rekel je, da ve in bo.
He wants it.	On to želi.
That was early.	To je bilo zgodaj.
I understand this better now, just a little bit	Zdaj to bolje razumem, le malo
I understand each other a little better	Malo bolje se razumem
There must be something.	Nekaj ​​mora biti.
I was there to do it.	Bil sem tam, da je to storil.
We all were.	Vsi smo bili.
I have already decided	Odločil sem se že
I want to keep going	Želim si še naprej
I could never do something like that	Nikoli ne bi mogel narediti kaj takega
I'll be ready.	Pripravljen bom.
But she succeeded in the afternoon.	Vendar ji je uspelo popoldne.
I had nothing but time	Nisem imel nič drugega kot čas
I've seen her before.	Videl sem jo že prej.
I hope you do better.	Upam, da ti gre bolje.
I don't want to know who it is.	Nočem vedeti, kdo je.
I spoke to him today	Danes sem govoril z njim
I feel like.	Počutim se kot.
I want to see him again	Želim ga spet videti
They weren't here tonight.	Nocoj jih ni bilo tukaj.
I always expected they would.	Vedno sem pričakoval, da bodo.
She never liked it.	Nikoli ji ni bilo všeč.
I have to do everything myself	Vse moram narediti sam
Maybe that's why.	Mogoče zato.
I've heard a lot about you	Veliko sem slišal o vas
I'm busy enough.	dovolj sem zaposlen.
I could go back.	Lahko bi se vrnil.
He still couldn't speak.	Še vedno ni mogel govoriti.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe.
Nothing will happen.	Nič se ne bo zgodilo.
I knew what it was like	Vedel sem, kako je to
I wouldn't be here to see them	Ne bi bil tukaj, da bi jih videl
I have no doubt about that	O tem ne dvomim
Or tell me something.	Ali pa mi kaj povej.
We're together tonight.	Nocoj sva skupaj.
And that's not all.	Pa tudi to še ni vse.
I expected them myself	Sam sem jih pričakoval
It's not right.	Ni prav.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisem mogel verjeti.
It happened here.	To se je zgodilo tukaj.
I didn't want to go home	Nisem hotel domov
I thought you were just human	Mislil sem, da si samo človek
How to play.	Kako igrati.
He, too, is not what he seems.	Tudi on ni to, kar se zdi.
I know it was hard for you	Vem, da ti je bilo težko
I can't go there anymore	Ne morem več tja
She said she couldn't.	Rekla je, da ne more.
And you can.	In lahko.
I'm interested in you	Zanima me zate
Now they had to go to work.	Zdaj so morali v službo.
In fact, this is not the case.	Pravzaprav temu ni tako.
Just more.	Samo še bolj.
He didn't know what to think.	Ni vedel, kaj naj si misli.
Maybe he would have called me if that hadn’t happened.	Mogoče bi me poklical, če se to ne bi zgodilo.
Just keep going and going.	Samo naprej in naprej.
She was here.	Bila je tukaj.
He needed money.	Potreboval je denar.
It was early in the morning when he usually went to work.	Bilo je zgodaj zjutraj, ko je običajno šel v službo.
There is a lot of work.	Dela je veliko.
I feel almost nothing	Počutim se skoraj nič
He sat down and started eating.	Sedel je in začel jesti.
His father always told him that he was good for nothing.	Oče mu je vedno govoril, da ni za nič.
I was still your father.	Še vedno sem bil tvoj oče.
She knew that was true.	Vedela je, da je to res.
I can't help myself	Ne morem si pomagati
I want to stay here with you	Želim ostati tukaj s tabo
I was very lucky.	Imel sem veliko srečo.
I'm not interested in seeing anymore.	Ne zanima me več videti.
My father was also home early.	Tudi oče je bil zgodaj doma.
This is very common.	To je zelo pogosto.
I was convinced of that	V to sem bil prepričan
I'm okay.	Jaz sem v redu.
I didn't want to see her again	Nisem je hotel več videti
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I need you to be here for me	Potrebujem, da si tukaj zame
I can't believe it was him	Ne morem verjeti, da je bil on
Everything is fine.	Vse je v redu.
I just need to know what you said.	Samo vedeti moram, kaj si rekel.
I wasn't sure why.	Nisem bil prepričan zakaj.
I have no doubt about that.	Glede tega ne dvomim.
It doesn't help.	Ne pomaga.
You know what's right.	Veš kaj je prav.
But he didn't stay long.	Vendar ni ostal dolgo.
Maybe she won't say anything.	Mogoče ne bo rekla ničesar.
He had to be alone.	Moral je biti sam.
I'm sure you'll like them.	Prepričan sem, da vam bodo všeč.

I didn't mean, you know, like that	Nisem mislil, veš, tako
I couldn't help it.	Nisem si mogel pomagati.
I always have had and always will have	Vedno sem imel in vedno bom
I also learned a lot from him	Tudi od njega sem se veliko naučil
I will not say anything more.	ne bom rekel nič več.
That was the reason.	To je bil razlog.

It's good to be alone	Dobro mi je biti sam
I wonder if that was enough	Sprašujem se, če je bilo dovolj

I went back to school today	Danes sem šel nazaj v šolo

I thought maybe you were	Mislil sem, da si morda

Here is my problem.	Tukaj je moj problem.
It was normal, it still is.	Bilo je običajno, še vedno je.

I'm in it now.	Zdaj sem v tem.
I never saw him leave.	Nikoli ga nisem videl oditi.
I heard it all.	vse sem slišal.
I learned to be alone	Naučil sem se biti sam
I don't think he's really gone anymore	Mislim, da ga res ni več
And that's fine with me.	In meni je to v redu.
And the next day.	In naslednji dan.
Only it never happened.	Le da se nikoli ni zgodilo.
That's all we can do.	Toliko nam gre.
I really don’t know what’s going to happen.	Res ne vem, kaj se bo zgodilo.
He's probably interested in it himself	Verjetno ga sam zanima

Who we are is fine.	Kdo smo, je v redu.
I'm so sorry for both of you	Tako mi je žal za oba
Or maybe not.	Ali lahko ne .
I just couldn't	Preprosto nisem mogel

And that's us.	In to smo mi.
He couldn’t make them fast enough.	Ni jih mogel narediti dovolj hitro.
I've seen it all before	Vse to sem že videl

This seemed like a good option.	To se je zdelo kot dobra možnost.
I just wanted to go home and be alone	Hotel sem samo domov in biti sam
It's a question.	Je vprašanje.
I just wanted you to know	Hotel sem samo, da veš

I still think I would have it.	Še vedno mislim, da bi ga imel.
There was something to do.	Bilo je nekaj za početi.
I would never want that.	Tega si nikoli ne bi želela.
It seemed not.	Zdelo se je, da ni.
A little of that, a little of that	Malo tega, malo tega

I wish you would come with us.	Želim si, da bi šel z nami.
And that may be the real reason.	In to je lahko pravi razlog.
We don't know how.	Ne vemo kako.
I wanted it to be true	Hotel sem, da bi bilo res

He says no.	Pravi, da ne.
Not so much today.	Danes ne toliko.
They always are and we always are.	Vedno so in vedno smo.
I only care who you are	Zanima me samo kdo si
I realized that could be good	Spoznal sem, da bi bilo to lahko dobro

Make your own.	Naredi svoje.
I see again.	Spet vidim.
I know so little about it	Tako malo vem o tem
Which none of us have.	Ki jih nihče od nas nima.

I want to know what it is	Želim vedeti, kaj je to

It's only in me.	Samo v meni je.
It's true.	Res je.
I can't tell you where.	Ne morem ti povedati kje.
It wasn't good to go there.	Ni bilo dobro iti tja.
I need to know who did this	Moram vedeti, kdo je to naredil
She just wasn't.	Preprosto ni bila.
And he wants his money back.	In želi svoj denar nazaj.
Apparently not here.	Očitno ne tukaj.
But I could meet her	Lahko pa bi jo srečal
I'm not sure that's the case.	Nisem prepričan, da je tako.
I knew she wouldn't do it herself	Vedel sem, da tudi sama tega ne bo storila
I had him now and he knew it	Zdaj sem ga imel in on je to vedel
We are here alone.	Tukaj smo sami.
Lots to say.	Veliko za povedati.
I just know what some of them are doing	Vem le, kaj jih nekaj počne
There I was.	Tam sem bil jaz.
I will not do anything or anyone	Ne bom naredil ničesar ali nikogar
I hope he finds someone	Upam, da bo koga našel
Absolutely no one.	Popolnoma nihče.
I could tell he didn’t want me to go	Lahko bi rekel, da ni hotel, da grem
Just like the next one and the one behind it.	Tako kot je bil naslednji in tisti za tem.
He wanted to know.	Želel je vedeti.
I can't tell you how much.	Ne morem vam povedati, koliko.
I can't stay in this place either	Tudi jaz ne morem ostati na tem mestu
I knew it was going to happen	Vedel sem, da se bo zgodilo
I just needed a little more	Potreboval sem le malo več
I'm sure you liked it	Prepričan sem, da ti je bil všeč
But I couldn't do that	Tega pa nisem mogel storiti
Sometimes that's a good thing.	Včasih je to dobra stvar.
He never wanted anything else.	Nikoli si ni želel ničesar drugega.
I should tell you all this	Vse to bi ti moral povedati
That would be something if I had the time.	To bi bilo nekaj, če bi imel čas.
Something had to be done.	Nekaj ​​je bilo treba narediti.
We didn't know what happened to us.	Nismo vedeli, kaj se nam je zgodilo.
I heard what happened to you	Slišal sem, kaj se ti je zgodilo
I'd rather be with you	raje bi bil s tabo
I'm here for you if you want me	Tukaj sem zate, če me želiš
Which he did.	Kar je storil.
I made it, if you will.	Uspelo mi je, če želite.
I just couldn’t believe he was doing this	Preprosto nisem mogel verjeti, da to počne
You've worked hard enough.	Dovolj si delal.
I was everything and everyone.	Bila sem vse in vsi.
I don't love you more than you love me.	Ne maram te več kot ti mene.
I really couldn't help myself.	Res si nisem mogel pomagati.
But it's hard.	Je pa težko.
All life is hard.	Vse življenje je težko.
I'm not alone anymore.	Nisem več sam.
I've always been, too	Tudi jaz sem bil vedno
Actually pretty good.	Pravzaprav precej dobro.
I believe in everything here	Verjamem v vse tukaj
We should know better.	Morali bi vedeti bolje.
I didn’t know how long he was there	Nisem vedel, kako dolgo je bil tam
When it's good it's good.	Ko je dobro je dobro.
Apparently my father too.	Očitno tudi moj oče.
But he didn't succeed.	A mu to ni uspelo.
I had so many once.	Enkrat sem jih imel toliko.
I didn't want to talk to him anymore	Nisem hotel več govoriti z njim
Even when I'd rather not.	Tudi ko bi raje ne.
I waited there	Tam sem čakal
I mean, if they had us	Mislim, če bi nas imeli
I don't know how long.	ne vem kako dolgo.
I realized it was now or never	Spoznal sem, da je zdaj ali nikoli
I'm glad you told me	Vesel sem, da si mi povedal
It's time for some work.	Čas je za nekaj dela.
This seems more than what you want.	To se zdi bolj kot tisto, kar želite.
I have to do it myself	To moram narediti sam
Do things your own way.	Narediti stvari po svoje.
I was really tired last night	Sinoči sem bil res utrujen
It was for me.	Zame je bilo.
I learned a little more, but not much	Naučil sem se malo več, a ne veliko
I don't know for sure	ne vem zagotovo
I was right.	Prav sem bil.
I wasn’t sure it was him	Nisem bil prepričan, da je bil on
That's how you wanted you.	Tako si te želel.
What he had, he did not want.	Kar je imel, ni hotel.
I could do that well	To bi lahko naredil dobro
As a father, I was not good	Kot oče nisem bil dober
I want to know everything that is happening in this city today.	Želim vedeti vse, kar se danes dogaja v tem mestu.
I could tell her to go home.	Lahko bi ji rekel, naj gre domov.
He had a hard life.	Imel je težko življenje.
It probably didn't just happen.	Verjetno se ni zgodilo kar tako.
That was not possible.	To ni bilo mogoče.
I just wanted to be alone then	Želela sem samo, da sva takrat sama
In and out.	V in ven.
I forgot he was there	Pozabil sem, da je tam
You will be back.	Vrnil se boš.
I didn't think it would be like that	Nisem si mislil, da bo tako
Because that wouldn't happen.	Ker se to ne bi zgodilo.
I really have a good life	Res imam dobro življenje
It wasn’t that hard to do.	To ni bilo tako težko narediti.
But I didn't do anything	Nič pa nisem naredil
He could have been, but he wasn’t.	Lahko bi bil, a ni bil.
I didn't see anything else.	Nič drugega nisem videl.
I didn't know who was left	Nisem vedel, da je kdo ostal
This is sometimes, but not always, obvious.	To je včasih, vendar ne vedno, očitno.
It was simply difficult.	Preprosto je bilo težko.
I wish the same to all of you	To želim tudi vsem vam
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
I didn't know what it was about	Nisem vedel, za kaj gre
You will be angry.	Jezen se boš.
The more the better.	Več kot je bolje.
I was no longer that person	Nisem bil več ta oseba
We knew it was there.	Vedeli smo, da je tam.
I was like okay what.	Bil sem v redu, kaj.
I have a job.	imam službo.
He works in the city.	Dela v mestu.
I never thought that day would come	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da bo prišel ta dan
That's why.	Zato je.
So they did it.	Zato so to storili.
You got me.	Dobil si me.
I didn’t even know it existed	Sploh nisem vedel, da obstaja
Dad can't.	Oče ne more.
I went there too	sem šel tudi tja
You have to do that.	To moraš storiti.
You can't believe anything he says.	Ne moreš verjeti nič, kar pravi.
It never seemed like enough.	Nikoli se ni zdelo, da je dovolj.
And he is not a child.	In ni otrok.
But not.	Pa vendar ne.
I know you did it for me	Vem, da si to naredil zame
He didn't meet anyone.	Nikogar ni srečal.
I think they all are.	Mislim, da so vsi.
Are you interested in more?.	Vas zanima več?.
It's not just.	Ni samo.
Tell me what's wrong.	Povej mi, kaj je narobe.
I just left them there	Pravkar sem jih pustil tam
I forgot about that.	Pozabil sem na to.
Sometimes they wouldn't even do that.	Včasih niti tega ne bi storili.
But it won't be long.	Vendar ga ne bo dolgo.
I’m not sure if it’s serious or not.	Nisem prepričan, ali je resno ali ne.
I will not die like that	ne bom tako umrl
I will be really angry.	Res bom jezen.
However, this did not happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
I really liked it.	Zelo mi je bil všeč.
I knew there was more.	Vedel sem, da je bilo več.
He didn't say.	Ni rekel.
I never told her.	Nikoli ji nisem povedal.
It actually looks a lot better.	Pravzaprav je videti veliko bolje.
Something happened to her.	Nekaj ​​se ji je zgodilo.
Just do it!.	Samo naredi!.
I said okay, this must be this one	Rekel sem v redu, to mora biti ta
I asked him why.	Vprašal sem ga zakaj.
It was better.	Bilo je bolje.
Or maybe it would.	Ali pa bi morda.
Not you and me.	Ne ti in jaz.
Just me.	Jaz samo.
I hope there is a better way.	Upam, da obstaja boljši način.
I also can’t believe he bought it	Tudi jaz ne morem verjeti, da ga je kupil
Here's some money.	Tukaj je nekaj denarja.
There is still nothing there.	Tam še vedno ni nič.
He really wanted to go there.	Zelo si je želel iti tja.
He started.	Počel.
I didn't see where you did it	Nisem videl, kje si to naredil
He never has and now he has a reason.	Nikoli ni in zdaj ima razlog.
I think you need to see things	Mislim, da moraš videti stvari
No one asked him what happened.	Nihče ga ni vprašal, kaj se je zgodilo.
I like you as a person	Všeč si mi kot oseba
I know you're really good with him	Vem, da si z njim res dobro
And now he did it again.	In zdaj je to spet storil.
They didn't.	Pa niso.
I used to feel that way	Nekoč sem se počutil tako
It almost is.	Skoraj je.
Who knows what will come of this.	Kdo ve, kaj bo iz tega.
We can't be.	Ne moremo biti.
In fact, they were just here.	Pravzaprav so bili samo tukaj.
He is supposed to win.	Zmagal naj bi.
They all had them.	Vsi so jih imeli.
It doesn't seem possible.	Ne zdi se mogoče.
We'll be alone again.	Spet bomo sami.
Something was wrong here.	Tukaj je bilo nekaj narobe.
I’m glad he didn’t go for nothing.	Vesel sem, da ni šel v nič.
So he promised he never would.	Zato je obljubil, da nikoli ne bo.
This will be my first time.	To bo zame prvič.
You should leave.	Moral bi oditi.
I would never make that.	Tega mi nikoli ne bi uspelo.
I've said enough.	Povedal sem dovolj.
He has to do it.	To mora narediti.
I just saw it happen	Videl sem samo, da se je zgodilo
It's too serious.	Preveč resno je.
I'm glad I have it.	Vesel sem, da ga imam.
Well, not that it was good.	Pa ne, da je bilo dobro.
My father bought this house.	Moj oče je kupil to hišo.
Just for this week.	Samo za ta teden.
He hasn't had it in years.	Že leta ga ni imel.
I certainly wouldn't.	Zagotovo ne bi.

One knows them immediately.	Človek jih takoj pozna.
Money is money.	Denar je denar.
Today is.	Danes je.
I can't be here with you	Ne morem biti tukaj s tabo
I'm afraid to move on	Bojim se iti naprej
I didn't know who it was	Nisem vedel, kdo je to
I've never seen him before	Še nikoli ga nisem videl
Sometimes it seems that way.	Včasih se zdi tako.
And that's wrong, wrong, wrong.	In to je narobe, narobe, narobe.
I really don't think so.	res ne mislim.
Now I wasn’t so sure about that	Zdaj nisem bil tako prepričan o tem
I didn't have much time	Nisem imel veliko časa
It was out of place for me.	Tako mi ni bilo na mestu.
I'm glad you're here	Vesel sem, da ste tukaj
I will find.	bom našel.
And there is a good reason for that.	In za to obstaja dober razlog.

I need him to do it again	Potrebujem, da to stori še enkrat

I think it can help you see	Mislim, da ti lahko pomaga videti

I want to be surprised	Želim biti presenečen
I think we will succeed	Mislim, da nam bo uspelo

But I wasn't so sure	Nisem pa bil tako prepričan
I'll feel better soon.	Kmalu se bom bolje počutil.

It is to be believed.	Treba je verjeti.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar.
I already knew what he was thinking	Vedel sem že, kaj si misli
he told himself	si je rekel
I didn’t know how he felt	Nisem vedel, kako se počuti
I believe it will not	Verjamem, da ne bo
That's a lot.	To je res veliko.
I don't believe it's wrong	Ne verjamem, da je narobe
Just because it feels that way.	Samo zato, ker se tako počuti.
But it is still there.	Vendar je še vedno tam.
Something tells me she would say that even if it weren’t.	Nekaj ​​mi pravi, da bi to rekla, tudi če ne bi bilo tako.
I can’t tell you how good I felt because of that	Ne morem vam povedati, kako dobro sem se zaradi tega počutil
He didn't wait to say anything.	Ni čakal, da bo kaj rekel.
I feel much better.	Počutim se veliko bolje.
I haven't been in quite some time.	Že kar nekaj časa nisem bil.
He is gone forever.	Odšel je za vedno.
I don’t think he can say much about it	Mislim, da o tem ne more veliko povedati
He was ready.	Bil je pripravljen.
I know him better than he knows me then	Poznam ga bolj kot on mene takrat
I wonder how he did it.	Zanima me, kako mu je uspelo.
It's the same for me sometimes	Tudi meni je včasih tako
I wanted to be alone with you for a while	Želel sem biti nekaj časa sam s tabo
I started with that	Začel sem k temu
I won't now, "he said.	Zdaj ne bom,« je rekel.
I really like you	Res si mi všeč
With that, everything seemed to be fine.	S tem se je zdelo, da je vse v redu.
what am i doing	kaj počnem.
And they were home.	In bili so doma.
I thought it would be nice one day	Mislil sem, da bo enkrat lepo
It wasn't just him either.	Tudi ni bil samo on.
And so we will do it.	In tako bomo to naredili.
You look surprised.	Videti si presenečen.
I can't do what he says	Ne morem narediti, kar pravi
I haven't seen him this morning	Danes zjutraj ga še nisem bil videti
I feel much better now	Zdaj se počutim veliko bolje
I can't or I can't yet.	Ne morem ali pa še ne.
You wouldn't want that.	Tega si ne bi želela.
I may not see you again.	Morda te ne bom več videl.
I kept going and going	Kar naprej sem šel in šel
Maybe I could help	Mogoče bi lahko pomagal
I still have a chance	Še vedno imam možnost
I like it there.	Tam mi je všeč.
He never needed it.	Nikoli mu ni bilo treba.
I wish you could see more	Želim si, da bi videli več
I know you're tired.	Vem, da si utrujen.
Unfortunately, this did not happen.	Žal se to ni zgodilo.
I was with you last night	Sinoči sem bil s tabo
I saw it myself.	Sam sem to videl.
Now I see it was	Zdaj vidim, da je bilo
I really have to go	res moram oditi
Each in his own way.	Vsak na svoj način.
You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to.	Tega vam ni treba storiti, če ne želite.
I was alone again	Spet sem bil sam
I didn’t want to stay back again	Nisem hotel spet ostati nazaj
I'm glad they are.	Vesel sem, da so.
I didn't hear anything.	Ničesar nisem slišal.
He could die.	Lahko bi umrl.
I immediately said yes	Takoj sem rekel da
It just makes me want to do a lot more.	Samo zaradi tega si želim delati veliko več.
I just want to help him	Samo pomagati mu želim
Father who father	Oče, ki oče
I knew it could never be	Vedel sem, da tega nikoli ne more biti
All day today, no.	Danes ves dan, ne.
I was really very lucky, he said	Res sem imel veliko srečo, je rekel
I knew it was this one	Vedel sem, da je to ta
Maybe I'm gone for a while	Morda me za nekaj časa ni več
We can't go back.	Ne moremo nazaj.
Obviously, a lot needs to be done.	Očitno je, da je treba veliko narediti.
And that seems highly unlikely.	In to se zdi zelo malo verjetno.
I didn't do anything	Nič nisem naredil
He said no.	Rekel je, da ni.
That's what it's all about.	Gre prav do tega.
I don't like that at all.	To mi sploh ni všeč.
Now they were together again.	Zdaj sta bila spet skupaj.
You know, like, work.	Veste, kot, delo.
We all were.	Vsi smo bili.
Tell her where she will be.	Povej ji, kje bo.
If not.	Če ne.
He expected that.	To je pričakoval.
Even then, that doesn’t seem to be fast enough.	Tudi takrat se zdi, da to ni dovolj hitro.
I doubt it will ever be	Dvomim, da bo kdaj
I couldn't see anymore	Nisem mogel več videti
All this work.	Vse to delo.
No.	Ne.
I shouldn't have been here last night	Sinoči ne bi smel biti tukaj
I like.	Všeč mi je.
He actually said that.	Pravzaprav je to rekel.
I asked him what was wrong	Vprašal sem ga, kaj je narobe
Actually as a child.	Pravzaprav kot otrok.
I can't do this without him	Tega ne morem brez njega
I hope you are interested	Upam, da vas zanima
Still him.	Še vedno ga.
You just have to	Samo moral bi
How could you.	Kako bi sploh lahko.
There must be nothing.	Mora biti nič.
He didn't even know he said that.	Sploh ni vedel, da je to rekel.
Back to serious.	Nazaj na resno.
He didn't call her.	Ni je poklical.
You can't help everyone.	Ne moreš pomagati vsem.
It was here again.	Tukaj je bilo spet.
I hope to see some of you there	Upam, da vas nekaj vidim tam
He will be happy and help you.	Vesel bo in ti bo pomagal.
I was so glad to see you	Tako sem bil vesel, da sem te videl
We had to do it.	Morali smo to narediti.
Because he knows.	Ker ve.
That's what I wanted to tell you	To sem ti hotel povedati
It actually looked.	Pravzaprav je bilo videti.
You know, it works.	Veš, dela.
He's right.	Ima prav.
I know that, and so do you	Jaz to vem in ti tudi
I'm going to get a book.	Grem po knjigo.
There would be no help there.	Tam ne bi bilo pomoči.
You should know that you will not feel well	Moral bi vedeti, da se ne boš počutil dobro
I know he really wants to see you again	Vem, da te res želi spet videti
It seems impossible.	Zdi se, da ni mogoče.
I can't tell you that	Tega ti ne morem povedati
I had a quick question.	Imel sem hitro vprašanje.
I wish not everyone knew	Želim si, da ne bi vsi vedeli
We would see her.	Videli bi jo.
I asked her how to get there.	Vprašal sem jo, kako do tja.
I just went ahead and did it.	Samo šel sem naprej in naredil.
You know, it's not because you can't do it.	Veste, ni zato, ker se tega ne da narediti.
And it really wasn't true.	In res ni bilo res.
I think they would know.	Mislim, da bi vedeli.
But he never said anything about it.	Vendar ni nikoli nič rekel o tem.
Neither do I.	Niti jaz ne.
However, I could not do that	Vendar tega nisem mogel storiti
I wasn't here to die.	Nisem bil tukaj, da bi umrl.
And you shouldn't either.	In tudi ti ne bi smel.
Or once upon a time.	Ali nekoč.
Sometimes not even then.	Včasih niti takrat ne.
Maybe he won.	Morda je zmagal.
I'm going to have to do something soon	Kmalu bom moral nekaj narediti
You could do it.	Lahko bi naredili.
I almost lost my job	Skoraj sem izgubil službo
It was better there.	Tam je bilo bolje.
I will never forget him	nikoli ga ne bom pozabil
Now, that's not it.	Zdaj, tega ni več.
I started with that.	Začel sem s tem.
I was sure he knew	Prepričan sem bil, da ve
I wonder if he knows about it.	Zanima me, če ve za to.
He was ready to go.	Bil je pripravljen iti.
Maybe this will never happen	Mogoče se to nikoli ne bo zgodilo
Neither do you.	Niti ti ne.
I can't play it.	Ne morem ga igrati.
That's why you love it.	Zaradi tega imaš rad.
This was much better than last week.	To je bilo veliko bolje kot prejšnji teden.
Here, not so much.	Tukaj, ne toliko.
We'll know soon enough.	Kmalu bomo vedeli.
I didn't come alone	Nisem prišel sam
I am much better than that	Jaz sem veliko boljši od tega
She wasn't that, not anymore.	Ni bila to, ne več.
We never had that.	Tega nismo imeli nikoli.
You had a chance.	Imel si priložnost.
I want to help you.	Želim ti pomagati.
However, this is probably not the case.	Vendar verjetno ni tako.
I knew she could tell, she had to	Vedel sem, da zna povedati, morala je
That's my game.	To je moja igra.
Not like my father.	Ne kot moj oče.
It was a game.	Bil je igra.
He just isn’t there anymore, not for me.	Preprosto ga ni več, ne zame.
After him.	Za njim.
And he's not here.	In ni ga tukaj.
And she wanted to be there.	In želela je biti tam.
Without help, I couldn’t have done anything.	Brez pomoči ne bi mogel storiti ničesar.
There was nowhere to go	Ni bilo kam iti
I've had a few.	Imel sem jih nekaj.
I expected too much.	Pričakoval sem preveč.
I had to make sure he was gone	Moral sem se prepričati, da ga ni več
I'll do it tonight.	Naredil bom nocoj.
We know who should say things.	Vemo, kdo bi moral povedati stvari.
And now he's doing it to us.	In zdaj nam to počne.
Better than you, a lot.	Bolje kot ti, veliko.
I've been over you for a few years	Bil sem nekaj let nad tabo
I think there is work here	Mislim, da je tukaj delo
I haven't seen her before.	Prej je nisem videl.
I couldn't eat at all either	Tudi jesti nisem mogel sploh
I really need you now	Zdaj te res potrebujem
I was sure he was gone	Prepričan sem bil, da ga ni več
I doubt anyone will be there	Dvomim, da bo kdo tam
This is going to happen.	To se bo zgodilo.
You should see that.	To bi moral videti.
I think he needs you	Mislim, da te potrebuje
I will not see you again	ne bom te več videl
Obviously this was not the case.	Očitno temu ni bilo tako.
I think this is a problem now	Mislim, da je to zdaj problem
We would.	Mi bi.
I waited for him to come to me	Čakal sem, da pride do mene
To talk about what he loved.	Da bi govoril o tem, kar je imel rad.
This is hard.	To je težko.
I didn't really find much.	Pravzaprav nisem našel veliko.
I'm sorry I learned that	Žal mi je, da sem se tega naučil
I don't see who's doing this	Ne vidim, kdo to počne
I can't talk tonight	Nocoj ne morem več govoriti
It was for me.	Bilo je zame.
I had to do something about it, and fast	Moral sem nekaj storiti glede tega, in to hitro
You are here.	Tukaj ste.
I should.	Moral bi.
I always do that too	Tudi jaz to vedno počnem
Just the way she was.	Tako kot je bila.
If you have to move on.	Če moraš naprej.
I mean, who knows what could have happened	Mislim, kdo ve, kaj se je lahko zgodilo
I'm not going to die the way you expected	Ne bom umrl tako, kot si pričakoval
If you think so.	Če misliš.
That's really it.	To je res to.

I heard from him this morning.	Zjutraj sem se slišal z njim.
I will never do that	Tega ne bom nikoli naredil
I want to be okay with that	Želim biti v redu s tem
I didn’t know he was coming back	Nisem vedel, da se bo vrnil
I was no more.	Nisem bil več.
I'm the one doing it	Sam sem, ki to počne
I need a lot more.	Potrebujem še veliko več.
It made her like him more than before.	Zaradi tega ji je bil bolj všeč kot prej.
I'll tell you what	ti bom povedal kaj
And here's the problem.	In tukaj je problem.
He knew all this but could not tell anyone.	Vse to je vedel, a nikomur ni mogel povedati.
It may also not exist at all.	Lahko tudi, da sploh ne obstaja.
I could find someone.	Lahko bi našel nekoga.
I'm sorry, but it is.	Žal mi je, vendar je.
I want to be yours forever	Želim biti tvoj za vedno
I hope we can do it again	Upam, da nam bo to uspelo še enkrat
I asked him how he knew that	Vprašal sem ga, kako to ve
I said he wasn't my friend	Rekel sem, da mi ni prijatelj
About what you said.	O tem, kar si govoril.
I'm a little surprised	Malo sem presenečen
My time is mine alone.	Moj čas je samo moj.
I believe you will not regret it	Verjamem, da vam ne bo žal
I could come that way.	Lahko bi prišel tako.
I don't think you're going to make it.	Mislim, da ti ne bo uspelo.
Not this man.	Ne ta človek.
I could stay there all day	Tam bi lahko ostal ves dan
He asked her that because.	To jo je vprašal, ker.
I know what you mean	Vem, kaj si mislil
I didn't feel well	Nisem se dobro počutil
I wish he was better than me	Želim si, da bi bil boljši od mene
I don’t know if he was or not.	Ne vem, ali je bil ali ne.
I never met him.	Nikoli ga nisem srečal.
Once upon a time.	Nekoč.
We know this will never happen.	Vemo, da se to nikoli ne bo zgodilo.
I didn't do anything.	Nič nisem naredil.
I knew nothing about it	O tem nisem vedel nič
I'm not a boy anymore.	Nisem več fant.
But it was.	Vendar je bilo.
I believe tomorrow can be even better than today.	Verjamem, da je lahko jutri še boljši kot danes.
Money is not a problem.	Denar ni problem.
He was on me.	Bil je na meni.
I know I wouldn't.	Vem, da ne bi.
I didn't hear that.	Tega nisem slišal.
I can't help you anymore.	Ne morem ti več pomagati.
This is normal.	To je običajno.
But I know she didn't have to	Vem pa, da ji ni bilo treba
I have a question for everyone	Imam vprašanje za vse
I should be the one over there	Jaz bi moral biti tisti tam
Why is this happening because usually.	Zakaj se to dogaja, ker običajno.

He didn't do that.	Tega ni storil.
I didn't say it myself	Nisem sam je rekel
I thought you would	Mislil sem, da boš

For me, it was nothing more than that.	Zame ni bilo nič več kot to.
I told you what to do	Povedal sem ti, kaj storiti
I thought it had to be just you	Mislil sem, da moraš biti samo ti
I hope you will like it.	Upam, da ti bo všeč.
It was so simple.	Bilo je tako preprosto.
I haven't in a while.	Že nekaj časa nisem.
I knew this was what he needed from me	Vedel sem, da je to tisto, kar potrebuje od mene
I haven't spoken to you in years	Že leta nisem govoril s tabo
You are actually helpful.	Pravzaprav si v pomoč.
Soon you will be who you are again.	Kmalu boš spet to, kar si.
He wasn't serious.	Ni mislil resno.
But it was so hard.	Vendar je bilo tako težko.
And maybe not.	In morda ni.
There was no need to work at all	Sploh ni bilo treba delati
Maybe there’s too much.	Morda je tam preveč.

I was a little tired too	Tudi jaz sem bil malo utrujen
I called her yesterday afternoon	Poklical sem jo včeraj popoldne
I wish you were here with us	Želim si, da bi bil tukaj z nami

I have nothing more to say today	Danes nimam več kaj povedati
And he says for sure.	In pravi, da zagotovo.
I wish it wasn’t	Želel sem si, da ne bi bilo

I know a lot is true	Vem, da je veliko res
It's me.	Zame si ti.
I hope you are doing well	Upam, da vam gre vse dobro
Not wrong.	Ni narobe.
As if it were only a matter of time.	Kot da bi bilo samo vprašanje časa.
I wouldn't want to leave.	Ne bi hotel oditi.
I didn't expect it to be	Nisem pričakoval, da bo
This is happening right now.	Trenutno se to dogaja.
He had little to do.	Malo mu je bilo za narediti.
If you can, good for you.	Če lahko, dobro zate.
I couldn't see anything	Nič nisem mogel videti

I learned a lot today	Danes sem se veliko naučil
That she knew.	Da je vedela.
I really believe in that	Res verjamem v to
I was probably lucky to get this.	Verjetno sem imel srečo, da sem to dobil.

I would do that.	To bi naredil.
It couldn't be more wrong.	Bolj narobe ne more biti.
But she didn't go.	Vendar ni šla.
It was and with me.	Bilo je in z mano.
Now I won't be anymore.	Zdaj ne bom več.
I can't believe he did that	Ne morem verjeti, da je to storil

There is so much I could say	Toliko bi lahko povedal
I just wanted to stay.	Hotel sem samo ostati.
The man spoke little.	Človek je malo govoril.
Never leave here.	Nikoli ne oditi od tukaj.

All because of me.	Vse to zaradi mene.
I believe he is afraid of her	Verjamem, da se je boji
You will love this.	To vam bo všeč.
We are what we are.	Mi smo, kar smo.
I believe he is right	Verjamem, da ima prav
Maybe that's enough.	Mogoče je to dovolj.
He will go out.	On bo šel ven.
He said that every day.	To je rekel vsak dan.
That's not it, she said.	Ni to, je rekla.
I really didn’t need him for that	Za to ga res nisem potreboval
He managed to do that.	To mu je uspelo.
I've been here a lot.	Veliko sem bil tukaj.
And she had to do that.	In morala tega je bila.
Nobody told me about it	Nihče mi ni povedal o tem
I want to go back there	Rad bi se vrnil tja
I'm glad to be home again.	Vesel sem, da sem spet doma.
This is my father.	To je moj oče.
I think this is also a difficult question	Mislim, da je to tudi težko vprašanje
I may be lucky tonight	Nocoj bom morda imel srečo
I saw it happen.	Videl sem, da se je zgodilo.
I mean, no, really not	Mislim, ne, res ne
No one is like him.	Nihče ni kot on.
I’m not sure if that’s a lot or a little.	Nisem prepričan, ali je to veliko ali malo.
We are now.	Zdaj smo.
I'll help you get home	Pomagal ti bom priti domov
We have to help her.	Moramo ji pomagati.
I would leave tomorrow	jutri bi odšel
And how he seems to want it to be.	In kako se zdi, da si želi, da bi bilo.
I just wanted to leave.	Samo hotel sem oditi.
The question was what to do about it all.	Vprašanje je bilo, kaj narediti glede vsega tega.
I didn't want him for anything	Nisem ga želela za nič
And there is certainly nothing wrong with that.	In s tem zagotovo ni nič narobe.
However, it is not.	Vendar pa ni.
I never said you can't work	Nikoli nisem rekel, da ne moreš delati
We know about the problems.	Vemo za težave.
We are on this.	Mi smo na tem.
I have no money.	Jaz nimam denarja.
I don't care at all.	Sploh me ne zanima.
I came from there	Prišel sem od tam
I never know what he thinks	Nikoli ne vem, kaj si misli
She said no.	Rekla je ne.
I'll tell him.	mu bom povedal.
I still didn’t like it	Še vedno mi ni bilo všeč
I know, too simple again.	Vem, spet preveč preprosto.
It's nothing.	Nič ni.
And on.	In naprej.
I know you know that too.	Vem, da tudi ti to veš.
or you	ali ti
A lot of things.	Veliko stvari.
I did not see.	Nisem videl.
I know you won't have that	Vem, da tega ne boš imel
I know where we are.	Vem kje smo.
I know it's more than that	Vem, da je več kot to
I wonder what he did there	Zanima me, kaj je naredil tam
I never worked there	Tam nisem nikoli delal
I liked them a lot more then	Takrat so mi bili veliko bolj všeč
That's how it was with him	Tako mi je bilo z njim
I have to hurry.	Moram hitro.
I didn't tell him too much	Nisem mu povedal preveč
You can't talk to me anymore.	Ne moreš več govoriti z mano.
I was just doing this.	Samo delal sem to.
I don't need that.	Ne potrebujem tega.
She had to say that.	Morala je to povedati.
And some of that would be true.	In nekaj od tega bi bilo res.
I knew he would like it	Vedel sem, da mu bo všeč
You've been gone for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa te ni bilo.
illberightback	takoj bom nazaj
He didn't know who she was.	Ni vedel, kdo je.
I didn't see her.	Nisem je videl.
I didn't see when he left	Nisem videl, kdaj je odšel
it's really good.	res je dobro.
Because there is nothing here.	Ker tukaj ni nič.
I love you	rad sem s tabo
Not even a little.	Niti malo.
And here we were.	In tukaj smo bili.
That's right.	Tako je prav.
You were right about everything.	O vsem si imel prav.
He must have seen me.	Verjetno me je videl.
I haven't been with you in a while	Že nekaj časa nisem bil s tabo
It can be really good.	Lahko je res dobro.
They were both very.	Oba sta bila zelo.
I didn't like talking	Ni mi bilo všeč govoriti
He wanted something from me.	Nekaj ​​je hotel od mene.
I told you what it was	Povedal sem ti, kaj je to
I wanted to play right away	Želel sem igrati takoj
Now I was convinced of that	Zdaj sem bil prepričan v to
I see them.	Vidim jih.
I could do that.	To bi lahko storil.
I found much more	Našel sem še veliko več
There is this.	Obstaja to.
That was the day.	To je bil dan.
If there is such a thing.	Če kaj takega obstaja.
I wish I had never come.	Želim si, da ne bi nikoli prišel.
I asked her if she knew that	Vprašal sem jo, če to ve
Yes.	Je.
I was also glad to see her	Tudi jaz sem bil vesel, da sem jo videl
It just wasn't right.	Samo ni bilo prav.
Here and now.	Tukaj in zdaj.
It's not that simple.	Ni tako preprosto.
Me, not so good.	Jaz, ne tako dobro.
I just know.	Samo vem.
I didn't have to do anything, you did everything	Nič mi ni bilo treba storiti, ti si naredil vse
Hope to see him there!	Upam, da ga bom videl tam!
Just a simple question.	Samo preprosto vprašanje.
And we knew it was wrong.	In vedeli smo, da je narobe.
More than before.	Več kot prej.
And he didn't like that.	In to mu ni bilo všeč.
I saw it, but I just couldn’t believe it	Videl sem, a preprosto nisem mogel verjeti
He saw what happened.	Videl je, kaj se je zgodilo.
I didn't hear him speak like before	Nisem ga slišal govoriti kot prej
No one has done that yet.	Tega še nihče ni storil.
Everyone likes it.	Vsem je všeč.
He said she felt better.	Rekel je, da se ji zdi bolje.
She wanted to know everything that had happened.	Želela je vedeti vse, kar se je zgodilo.
No one is better than that.	Nihče ni boljši od tega.
It's a bit long.	Malo je dolgo.
You said that yourself now.	To si sam rekel zdaj.
I can’t believe he’s doing this to me	Ne morem verjeti, da mi to počne
This has happened more than once.	To se je zgodilo več kot enkrat.
I don’t know how that comes about.	Ne vem, kako to pride.
I'm next.	jaz sem naslednji.
You'll be fine.	V redu boš.
I've done this before	To sem storil že prej
Because it is.	Ker je.
So it will be there for some time.	Tako bo tam še nekaj časa.
I'm here.	Tukaj sem.
It was too obvious.	Bilo je preveč očitno.
Also in this city.	Tudi v tem mestu.
I just want to play	Samo igrati se želim
And we did.	In smo to storili.
More than that is not much.	Več kot to ni veliko.
I do not have time.	Nimam časa.
I already lost her	Izgubil sem jo že
I think it happened here	Mislim, da se je to zgodilo tukaj
You never let me do anything.	Nikoli mi nisi dovolil ničesar.
That's wrong.	To je narobe.
I think what you did to me is wrong	Mislim, da je to, kar si mi naredil, narobe
I learned a lot from you	Od tebe sem se veliko naučil
I do not have any children	Nimam otrok
I will not say more	ne bom več rekel
There is nothing wrong with that.	V tem ni nič narobe.
Not so fast.	Ne tako hitro.
I hope you succeed	Upam, da ti bo uspelo
It's about money.	Gre za denar.
I needed something to do	Potreboval sem nekaj za narediti
Apparently you didn't help me.	Očitno mi nisi pomagal.
We wouldn't have children	Ne bi imeli otrok
He probably wants to anyway.	Verjetno si tako ali tako želi.
He's gone now.	Zdaj je odšel.
I've seen it before and I'll probably see it again.	Videl sem ga že in verjetno ga bom še kdaj videl.
I’m still not sure how that was possible	Še vedno nisem prepričan, kako je bilo to mogoče
I would always be there.	Vedno bi bil tam.

I will still be here for you as a friend	Še vedno bom tukaj zate kot prijatelj
He has a lot to do.	Veliko mora narediti.

I made it for you.	Naredil sem ga zate.
I know where you've been	Vem, kje si bil
I understand why you followed me	Razumem, zakaj si šel za mano

I didn’t know what to do about it	Nisem vedel, kaj naj storim glede tega

Everything seemed fine.	Vse se je zdelo v redu.
We will make it.	Uspelo nam bo.
It seemed like you never told anyone.	Zdelo se je, kot da nikoli nisi nikomur povedal.
I just wanted to see if you were interested	Hotel sem samo videti, če te zanima
I can’t help but like the guy	Ne morem si pomagati, da mi je fant všeč

Very often this is not the case.	Zelo pogosto pa temu ni tako.
I will come and find you.	Prišel bom in te našel.
You can too.	Lahko tudi ti.
I just know it's true	Samo vem, da je res
You should do that.	To bi moral storiti.
I couldn't stay anymore	Ne bi mogel več ostati
No one was there.	Nihče ni bil tam.
He has nothing to do with me, he is not mine.	On nima nič z mano, ni moj.
It really was that good.	Res je bilo tako dobro.
And now you can.	In zdaj lahko.
Now he couldn't anyway.	Zdaj pa tako ali tako ni mogel.
A long time ago	Že dolgo nazaj
Which was probably a good thing.	Kar je bilo verjetno dobro.
He started well.	Dobro je začel.
We'll see how it goes this week.	Bomo videli kako bo ta teden.
I've never done this before.	Nikoli prej tega nisem naredil.

We were much better.	Bili smo veliko boljši.
There was something wrong with it.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe s tem.

I have it at home.	jaz ga imam doma.

I think so.	Mislim.
You know quite a bit.	Kar malo veš.

I need to know these things	Te stvari moram vedeti

I've been here before.	Tukaj sem že bil.
The next day he still said he was at it.	Naslednji dan je še vedno rekel, da je pri tem.
I actually like it here	Tukaj mi je pravzaprav všeč
I'll leave that as a question.	To bom pustil kot vprašanje.
I have to do this.	To moram narediti.
I had to do that job	Moral sem narediti to delo
How much more was there.	Koliko več je bilo.
I told him it was true	Povedal sem mu, da je to res
I would not forget	ne bi pozabil
I never want to see you again	Nikoli več te ne želim videti
It seemed simple enough.	Zdelo se je dovolj preprosto.
I think it would be good together	Mislim, da bi bilo dobro skupaj
I wanted to do it here	Hotel sem to narediti tukaj
I knew that now.	To sem vedel zdaj.
I bought them.	Kupil sem jih.
And also.	Pa tudi.
I wonder how long that has been	Sprašujem se, kako dolgo je to bilo
It's not in me.	Ni v meni.
He knows what it's like to be you and me.	Ve, kako je biti ti in jaz.
That needs to be said.	To je treba povedati.
I didn’t forget that, really	Nisem pozabil na to, res ne
us.	nas.
How much he needed it.	Koliko ga je potreboval.
I mean, it just seems obvious to me.	Mislim, zdi se mi samo očitno.
There is no other than you.	Ni drugega, kot si ti.
I believe that is how it happened	Verjamem, da se je tako zgodilo
He did this to me last week.	Prejšnji teden mi je to storil.
Can someone please help.	Ali lahko kdo prosim pomaga.
All in all, it seemed so wrong.	Vse skupaj se je zdelo tako narobe.
It's not really there.	Ni res tam.
And for.	In za.
It was just nice.	Samo lepo je bilo.
You should know more.	Moral bi vedeti več.
I better go home	Bolje, da grem domov
He comes and goes.	Pride in gre.
I know he's right.	Vem, da ima prav.
I know you know it's true.	Vem, da veš, da je res.
Real.	Pravi.
I really needed that.	To sem res potreboval.
He never wanted that.	Nikoli si tega ni želel.
I will do anything to be with you	Naredil bom vse, da bom s tabo
He got her.	Dobil jo je.
Seriously, that's not a problem.	Resno, to ni problem.
I can't believe what just happened	Ne morem verjeti, kaj se je pravkar zgodilo
But I knew.	Vendar sem vedel.
Say what you think.	Povej, kar misliš.
Not much has happened	Veliko se ni zgodilo
I really liked it	Zelo mi je bil všeč
He said he didn't know how he got there.	Rekel je, da ne ve, kako je prišel tja.
I didn't see it that way.	Jaz tega nisem videl tako.
You will surely succeed.	Zagotovo ti bo uspelo.
I didn't want to leave	Nisem hotel oditi
You should know that he will know all about it	Moral bi vedeti, da bo vedel vse o tem
I never thought she would tell me that	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da mi bo to rekla
I never did that.	Nikoli tega nisem storil.
I want you to know everything he says	Želim, da veš vse, kar pravi
I had a lot of work to do tomorrow	Jutri sem imel veliko dela
You are alone.	Sama si.
Just do it.	Samo to naredi.
I know it's mine.	Vem, da je moj.
I am very happy that he is still alive	Zelo sem vesel, da še vedno živi
I haven't seen you in so long	Tako dolgo te nisem videl
And not just here.	In ne samo tukaj.
Do you think it is.	Ali mislite, da je.
I always have been and always will be	Vedno sem bil in vedno bom
Dad wasn't feeling well.	Oče se ni počutil dobro.
It all happened very quickly.	Vse se je zgodilo zelo hitro.
I don't know where anyone else lives	Ne vem, kje še kdo živi
But you had.	Vendar ste imeli.
I shouldn't tell anyone	Nikomur ne bi smel povedati
I asked her about it.	Vprašal sem jo o tem.
I actually came home	Pravzaprav sem prišel domov
It definitely has to be more than that.	Zagotovo mora biti več kot to.
That must be enough for him.	To mu mora biti dovolj.
Please, for me.	Prosim, zame.
I asked if anyone had seen her	Vprašal sem, če jo je kdo videl
I will have more for you.	Imel bom več za vas.
That's the 'how' of it.	To je 'kako' tega.
And the things she said.	In stvari, ki jih je rekla.
I didn't want to be here anymore	Nisem hotel več biti tukaj
I haven't seen him in three years	Nisem ga videl že tri leta
You will die.	Umrl boš.
I didn’t think we should be there.	Nisem mislil, da bi morali biti tam.
I never said.	nikoli nisem rekel.
But I can't help myself	Ne morem pa si pomagati
I doubt he ever had it	Dvomim, da ga je kdaj imel
I would make it there	Tam bi mi uspelo
It was hard for him.	Težko mu je bilo.
Nobody wants to talk to me.	Nihče noče govoriti z mano.
That must be it.	To mora biti to.
It happened so fast.	Zgodilo se je tako hitro.
And you can.	In lahko.
I didn’t mean it like I didn’t	Nisem to mislil kot ne
I wanted to be him.	Hotel sem biti on.
I got us.	Dobil sem nas.
I didn't start well.	Nisem dobro začel.
I started this.	To sem začel.
I don't want to know anymore	Nočem več vedeti
You never did.	Nikoli nisi.
I hope someone here can help.	Upam, da lahko kdo tukaj pomaga.
I didn't need anything else	Nič drugega nisem potreboval
But he didn't see it.	Vendar tega ni videl.
I would definitely be back	zagotovo bi se vrnil
This is the village.	To je vas.
Now we have somewhere to go.	Zdaj imamo kam iti.
Not much, just a little.	Ne veliko, samo malo.
That's a lot for me.	To je zame veliko.
Maybe he had more money than anyone knew.	Mogoče je imel več denarja, kot je kdo vedel.
You are very good.	Zelo si dober.
It wasn't easy.	Ni bilo lahko.
Nothing after that.	Po tem nič.
This did not seem likely.	To se ni zdelo verjetno.
I thought you already were	Mislil sem, da si že
However, nothing like that happened.	Vendar se ni zgodilo nič takega.
You can never be bought.	Nikoli te ni mogoče kupiti.
I'll get them.	Dobil jih bom.
Not so much these days.	Te dni ne toliko.
He almost never does that.	Tega skoraj nikoli ne naredi.
i really want to help	res želim pomagati
But I shouldn't leave at all	Vendar sploh ne bi smel oditi
None of this is true.	Nič od tega ni res.
He doesn't want to, he doesn't need that.	Noče, to mu ni treba.
That's why we were there this morning.	Zato smo bili danes zjutraj tam.
I can never do right.	Nikoli ne morem narediti prav.
I didn't expect him to be there	Nisem pričakoval, da bo tam
For me, they were that.	Zame so bili to.
To life.	Na življenje.
Do your thing.	Naredi svojo stvar.
I really like that	To mi je zelo všeč
I don’t seem to be able to do that	Zdi se, da tega ne morem storiti
He's seen it all.	Vse je videl.
I seem to be back here again	Zdi se, da sem se spet vrnil sem
I just wanted you to know it's okay	Hotel sem samo, da veš, da je v redu
We are really lucky.	Res imamo srečo.
I knew they would be there	Vedel sem, da bodo tam
I’ve never done anything about it, and now she’s gone	Nikoli nisem storil ničesar glede tega, zdaj pa je ni več
I just heard it before	Pravkar sem slišal prej
There is not much to say about this.	O tem ni veliko za povedati.
I didn't play tonight	Nocoj nisem igral
It's very nice.	Zelo lepo je.
I just want you to know	Samo želim, da veš
I want you to know what happened, how it happened	Želim, da veš, kaj se je zgodilo, kako se je zgodilo
I'm all about it	Jaz sem vse o tem
I didn't know he was your friend	Nisem vedel, da je tvoj prijatelj
He was a really good friend.	Bil je res dober prijatelj.
I don’t think being the only child doesn’t help	Mislim, da to, da sem edini otrok, ne pomaga
He didn't want to do that.	Tega ni hotel narediti.
That's not it.	To ni to.
I didn't say anything right away	Takoj nisem rekel ničesar
It could be me.	Lahko bi bil jaz.
I could help her	Lahko bi ji pomagal
I will never be okay again.	Nikoli več ne bom v redu.
A child without a home	Otrok brez doma
I had nothing to say	Nisem imel kaj povedati
As anyone who knows you knows.	Kot ve vsak, ki te pozna.
I really like it	Zelo mi je všeč
I also decided to go there	Tudi jaz sem se odločil, da grem tja
You should know right away	Moral bi vedeti takoj
I think he's right again	Mislim, da ima spet prav
That would be better.	Tako bi bilo bolje.
I haven't for a while	Že nekaj časa pa nisem
Like, really fast.	Kot, res hitro.
I understand why you wanted dinner here before.	Razumem, zakaj si že prej želel večerjo tukaj.
We should all do it.	Vsi bi morali to storiti.
He's not here.	Tukaj ga ni.
I do not know how.	Ne vem, kako.
That day was not good enough.	Ta dan ni bil dovolj dober.
He would definitely help me.	Zagotovo bi mi pomagal.
I haven't been here long	Nisem več dolgo tukaj
I wouldn't tell her anything.	Nič ji ne bi rekel.
I was the only one.	Bila sem edina.
After that, no one knows what happened.	Po tem nihče ne ve, kaj se je zgodilo.
I asked her why she thought he would do it.	Vprašal sem jo, zakaj misli, da bo to storil.
No one will ask why.	Nihče se ne bo vprašal, zakaj.
And next after that.	In naslednji po tem.
That makes me want to stay angry.	Zaradi tega želim ostati jezen.
You are all here.	Vsi ste tukaj.
And it really was.	In res je bilo.
That's the one.	To je tisti.
And it probably will.	In verjetno tudi bo.
It was all true.	Vse je bilo res.
I mean, very good.	Mislim, zelo dobro.
Something actually.	Nekaj, kar pravzaprav.
Nothing was there.	Nič ni bilo tam.
I didn’t want to talk about it anymore	Nisem hotel več govoriti o tem
I love being with you.	Rad sem s tabo.
I just knew he needed me	Vedela sem le, da me potrebuje
It's all before.	Je vse prej kot.
I may have a problem with that	Morda imam težave s tem
I used to be	Nekoč sem
He looks like a child.	Videti je kot otrok.
No matter what you have to do.	Ne glede na to, kaj moraš narediti.
There is nothing more to say.	Nič ni več za povedati.
I forgot that.	To sem pozabil.
I never saw anyone die.	Nikoli nisem videl, da bi kdo umrl.
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
I have these days too	Tudi jaz imam te dni
Actually more than a question.	Pravzaprav bolj kot vprašanje.
It's usually the same with me.	Tudi pri meni je običajno tako.
And not for the first time either.	In tudi ne prvič.
I knew there were a lot of them these days.	Vedel sem, da jih je te dni veliko.
I stayed in my room.	ostal sem v svoji sobi.
I mean, it happens to us all the time	Mislim, to se nam dogaja ves čas
And even that wasn’t what she wanted.	In tudi to ni bilo tisto, kar si je želela.
She wanted to believe him.	Želela mu je verjeti.
I couldn't see that at the time	Takrat tega nisem mogel videti
No, that doesn't help.	Ne, to nič ne pomaga.
I hope it works out for you.	Upam, da vam bo uspelo.
I didn't think he would find me	Nisem si mislil, da me bo našel
You could see.	Lahko bi videli.
I see this happening more and more	Vidim, da se to dogaja vedno bolj
He knew he might never see her again.	Vedel je, da je morda ne bo nikoli več videl.
I completely forgot about it	Popolnoma sem pozabil na to
Now he knows that.	Zdaj to ve.
It's wrong.	Narobe je.
I still can't believe it myself	Sam še vedno ne morem verjeti
No, never that.	Ne, nikoli to.
There is something wrong with me.	Nekaj ​​je narobe z mano.
I knew no one was coming for us	Vedel sem, da nihče ne pride po nas
You didn’t have to do that.	Tega vam ni bilo treba storiti.
It's nothing.	Nič ni.
They are enough.	Dovolj so.
She just wanted to know.	Želela je samo vedeti.
You know you are.	Veš, da si.
I mean, nobody knows that	Mislim, tega nihče ne ve
I knew that for sure	To sem zagotovo vedel
I felt like I was in my own room	Počutil sem se kot v svoji sobi
Maybe that's what happened.	Mogoče se je tako zgodilo.
Which is not.	Kar pa ni.
I know there is a possibility for that	Vem, da obstaja možnost za to
I've never seen them before.	Še nikoli jih nisem videl.
I wanted to make sure this was what you wanted	Želel sem se prepričati, da je to tisto, kar si želiš
I felt a little better	Počutil sem se malo bolje
I saw this almost immediately	To sem videl skoraj takoj
I will not leave again	ne bom več odšel
I would be very sorry	Zelo bi mi bilo žal
He always was.	Vedno je bil.
I had it once, as a kid.	Imel sem ga enkrat, kot otrok.
I've been there before.	Tam sem bil že prej.
And they are not.	In niso.
But we are much more than that.	Vendar smo veliko več kot to.
I won't stay at all if he doesn't want to.	Sploh ne bom ostal, če on tega noče.
It is not what it seems.	Ni to, kar se zdi.
He couldn't speak.	Ni mogel govoriti.
I wish you would come with us	Želim si, da bi šel z nami
Good money	Dober denar
I hope none of this is true	Upam, da nič od tega ni res
.	.
It's a hotel.	To je hotel.
He's not here now.	Zdaj ga ni tukaj.
Which goes on and on.	Kar gre naprej in naprej.
I’m not sure if that’s true.	Nisem prepričan, če je to res.
Maybe there will be time.	Morda bo še čas.
The boy has never been this way with me	Fant še nikoli ni bil tako z mano
Now they had a chance.	Zdaj so imeli priložnost.
I wonder why they are here	Sprašujem se, zakaj so tukaj
I'm surprised you never met her	Presenečen sem, da je nisi nikoli srečal
He never was.	Nikoli ni bil.
He will be so happy.	Tako vesel bo.
It has to be more than that.	Mora biti več kot to.
I thought it was nice	Zdelo se mi je lepo
He works so much.	Toliko dela.
I will not do that	jaz tega ne bom naredil
I really needed this job	Res sem potreboval to službo
It's good enough.	Dovolj je dobro.
Something like that.	Nekaj ​​takega.
He spoke with difficulty.	Težko je govoril.
I had to make sure it was him	Moral sem se prepričati, da je to on
I tried to make sure of that	Poskušal sem se prepričati v to
I really have to go	Res moram iti
I am nobody's home.	Nikomur nisem doma.
I mean, it is for me too, you know.	Mislim, tudi zame je, veš.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisem mogel verjeti.
We didn't see her.	Nismo je videli.
I'm not so sure now.	Zdaj nisem tako prepričan.
As you will soon see, this is simply not true.	Kot boste kmalu videli, to preprosto ni res.
And you know, I'm fine with that.	In veš, meni je to v redu.
And we'll see how it goes.	In bomo videli, kako bo.
I should have said something earlier	Nekaj ​​bi moral povedati že prej
It's happening here too.	Tudi tukaj se dogaja.
You needed me.	Potreboval si me.
I think I could have	Mislim, da bi lahko imel
I didn't see or hear anyone.	Nikogar nisem videl ali slišal.
Maybe there's something to it.	Mogoče je nekaj na tem.
Everything is something.	Vse je nekaj.
I felt better when I knew that	Počutil sem se bolje, ko sem to vedel
I want to know where you heard that	Rad bi vedel, kje si to slišal
It seemed simple to me.	Zdelo se mi je preprosto.
He lives there today.	Tam živi danes.
I did my job and he did his	Jaz sem opravil svoje delo, on pa svoje
I knew what was right	Vedel sem, kaj dela prav
Because he did it.	Ker je to storil.
I realized it was true	Spoznal sem, da je res
As usual.	Kot običajno gre.
I suspect that's not true	Sumim, da to ni res
You may not want to do it yourself, but someone has to.	Morda tega ne želite storiti sami, a nekdo mora.
I could not.	Nisem mogel.
It’s working together.	To je delo skupaj.
We have seen this quite often.	To smo že precej pogosto videli.
It will be hard.	Težko bo.
I absolutely, absolutely liked it there.	Tam mi je bilo popolnoma, popolnoma všeč.
you said.	si rekel.
He could make it.	Lahko bi mu uspelo.
It was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.	To je bilo narobe, narobe, narobe, narobe.
I couldn't tell anyone	Nikomur nisem mogel povedati
That was the day.	To je bil ta dan.
I thought she did it	Mislil sem, da je to storila
I think there is something in us.	Mislim, da je nekaj v nas.

I know what he means	Vem kaj misli
I know you still have it	Vem, da ga še imaš
I thought you were too	Tudi jaz sem mislil, da si
Just what you want to do.	Samo tisto, kar želite početi.
I need to see things	Moram videti stvari
They had to do something else.	Morali so narediti nekaj drugega.
What was that.	Kaj je bilo to.
He wants to come.	Želi priti.
I'll tell you what happens	Povedal vam bom, kaj se bo zgodilo
I still have a lot of work to do	Imam še veliko dela
There's nothing I can do about it now	Zdaj ne morem nič storiti glede tega
I think it can be	Mislim, da je lahko
So many people.	Toliko ljudi.
Something is going on here.	Tukaj se nekaj dogaja.
I'll give you time	dal ti bom čas
I never even knew he was there	Nikoli nisem niti vedel, da je tam
I'm sure you'll be able to go without it.	Prepričan sem, da boš lahko šel tudi brez tega.
I thought you were my friend.	Mislil sem, da si moj prijatelj.
I don't know anything other than that.	Ne vem nič drugega kot to.
I wasn’t sure if he worked there or not	Nisem bil prepričan, ali je tam delal ali ne
I haven't heard it back yet	Nisem še slišal nazaj
If she failed, she would die.	Če ji ne bi uspelo, bi umrl.
I've asked that before.	To sem vprašal že prej.
That's what happened.	To se je zgodilo.
I love you all so much	Vse vas imam tako zelo rad

Now I see what you mean	Zdaj vidim, kaj misliš
Maybe it was a little hard.	Mogoče je bilo malo težko.
But I can't be sure	Ne morem pa biti prepričan
Three years was nothing.	Tri leta ni bila nič.
And all the time after that.	In ves čas po tem.
I've had a lot of that.	Tega sem imel veliko.
They didn't know enough.	Niso vedeli dovolj.
I gave you what you wanted	Dal sem ti, kar si želel
She was not sorry.	Ni ji bilo žal.
It didn't look very good tonight.	Nocoj ni bilo videti prav dobro.
He knows me so little.	Tako zelo malo me pozna.
No, not really.	Ne, pravzaprav ne.
Not all, not always, but often enough.	Ne vsi, ne vedno, a dovolj pogosto.
I wanted to see this house	Želel sem videti to hišo
I didn't have it before	Prej ga nisem imel
But it was just us.	Vendar smo bili samo mi.
I really needed that	To sem res potreboval

From you.	Iz tebe.
He really loved me	Res me je imel zelo rad
It doesn't help.	Ne pomaga.
I know a lot of people this way	Poznam veliko ljudi na ta način

I just wish I was better, that’s all	Želim si samo, da bi bil boljši, to je vse
I have never been a problem for anyone.	Nikoli nisem bil nikomur problem.
I will not do that.	Tega ne bom storil.
I didn't say anything else	Nič drugega nisem rekel
She wished she could look better.	Želela si je, da bi bila videti bolje.
Not that it was much.	Ne da je bilo veliko.
He said that was right.	Rekel je, da je to prav.
I don't know what to think	Ne vem, kaj naj si mislim
I wish you nothing was wrong.	Želim vam, da ni narobe.
He would tell her too.	Tudi on bi ji povedal.
She knew who we were.	Vedela je, kdo smo.
Each of you who wants to stay has a job.	Vsak od vas, ki želi ostati, ima službo.
I will definitely not stay there anymore	Tam zagotovo ne bom več ostal

I used to work here.	Včasih sem delal tukaj.
It was all very difficult for me too	Tudi meni je bilo vse zelo težko

He wouldn't like it.	Ne bi mu bilo všeč.
There really is a lot to eat.	Res je veliko za jesti.
It's just a matter of time.	To je samo vprašanje časa.
You should be there.	Moral bi biti tam.
It can always be better	Vedno je lahko bolje
I don't think I could have known that	Mislim, da tega ne bi mogel vedeti
This child.	Ta otrok.
The one who knows nothing.	Tisti, ki nič ne ve.
Now that can only be good !.	Zdaj je to lahko samo dobro!.
This was anything but true.	To je bilo vse prej kot res.
I liked what he said.     	Všeč mi je bilo, kar je rekel.     
It will be better.	Bolje bo.
You didn't know.	Nisi vedel.
That will do for now.	To bo za zdaj dovolj.
But I don't see what else we can do	Ne vidim pa, kaj bi še lahko naredili
I was surprised he was still there, considering all the things	Presenečen sem bil, da je še vedno tam, glede na vse stvari
That seems to be true.	Zdi se, da je to res.
And they did.	In so se.
No, it wasn't enough.	Ne, ni bilo dovolj.
I will say it again.	Še enkrat bom povedal.
Time.	Čas .
Speak, speak, speak.	Govori, govori, govori.
Next, he said.	Naprej, je rekel.
I knew you wouldn't go	Vedel sem, da ne boš šel
I have	imam
I will go with you	šel bom s tabo
I think he could die.	Mislim, da bi lahko umrl.
Now they had to go.	Zdaj so morali iti.
Who knows how long it will be after that.	Kdo ve, koliko časa bo po tem.
That's why he will succeed.	Zato mu bo uspelo.
I need you here with me now	Zdaj te potrebujem tukaj z mano
You have to be prepared for that.	Na to moraš biti pripravljen.
And it's not right.	In ni prav.
He wouldn't say that.	On tega ne bi rekel.
I feel for you, friend.	Počutim se zate, prijatelj.
Instead, he sat back.	Namesto tega je sedel nazaj.
I think that's obvious.	Mislim, da je to očitno.
She knew the time had come.	Vedela je, da je prišel čas.
I didn’t want to do anything wrong.	Nisem hotel narediti nič narobe.
I think he knows that.	Mislim, da on to ve.
They are together in this.	V tem sta skupaj.
It just had to be said.	Samo povedati je bilo treba.
I came back here right away	Takoj sem se vrnil sem
I wanted to talk to you	Hotel sem govoriti s tabo
Maybe he was better.	Mogoče mu je bilo bolje.
He’ll probably get more again.	Verjetno bo spet dobil več.
I couldn't be here that long	Ne bi mogel biti tukaj tako dolgo
I don't think it exists.	Mislim, da ne obstaja.
They never are.	Nikoli niso.
I really don't know	res ne vem
He knows he never will.	Ve, da nikoli ne bo.
He got as good as he gave.	Dobil je tako dober, kot je dal.
He keeps telling himself that.	Kar naprej si to govori.
Maybe she was.	Mogoče je bila.
Maybe things are like that.	Morda so stvari tako.
I will not let that happen.	Tega ne bom pustil.
The reason for this is as follows.	Razlog za to je naslednji.
You would be.	Ti bi bil.
Not enough and she will not succeed.	Ne dovolj in ji ne bo uspelo.
I lost everything.	Izgubil sem vse.
If ever.	Če bo kdaj.
I can’t believe it happened.	Ne morem verjeti, da se je zgodilo.

I'll call you tomorrow	poklical te bom jutri
I had to do what was right	Moral sem narediti, kar je prav
I will continue to work with him.	Še naprej bom delal z njim.
Except maybe that's not true either.	Le da morda tudi to ni res.
Now I know who they are.	Zdaj vem, kdo so.
Now, as always, he lives.	Zdaj, kot vedno, živi.
This made it difficult to leave.	Zaradi tega je bilo težko oditi.

I decided it was definitely something else	Odločil sem se, da je zagotovo nekaj drugega

What to do, we did not know.	Kaj storiti, nismo vedeli.
We will see that today.	To bomo videli danes.
I said right	rekel sem prav
This is you.	To si ti.
I really wasn’t that good back then.	Takrat res nisem bil tako dober.
I just came to talk to you	Prišel sem samo govoriti s tabo
I didn't see much of her after that	Po tem je nisem veliko videl
That's how I was from here	Tako sem bil od tukaj
I was there myself	Sam sem bil tam
I'm here almost every day	Tukaj sem skoraj vsak dan
I didn't know who he was	Nisem vedel, kdo je
Because there was nothing to do.	Ker ni bilo kaj narediti.
I had to see her myself	Sam sem jo moral videti
I would never want to do that.	Tega ne bi nikoli želel narediti.
He came here.	Prišel je sem.
It was that.	Je bilo to.
I won't talk about it anymore	Ne bom več govoril o tem
He wasn't sure who to ask.	Ni bil prepričan, koga bi lahko vprašal.
I sat down.	sedel sem.
That was very hard for me to believe	To mi je bilo zelo težko verjeti
Not until then.	Do takrat pa ne.
I didn’t have to say much	Ni mi bilo treba veliko povedati
I wasn't there.	Ni me bilo.
I know you thought you were	Vem, da si mislil, da si
I haven't been there in years	Tam nisem bil že leta
I'm fine with that.	v redu sem s tem.
I mean, I didn't come that early	Mislim, nisem prišel tako zgodaj
I want him to know.	Želim, da ve.
I want to play too.	Tudi jaz želim igrati.
They never will.	Nikoli ne bodo.
I think that's it	Mislim, da je to to
If anyone is interested.	Če koga zanima.
I didn't mean anything by that	Nič nisem mislil s tem
It's simply more.	To je preprosto več.
This is not life.	To ni življenje.
I just told her how to do it	Pravkar sem ji povedal, kako naj to naredi
I would never say anything like that.	Kaj takega ne bi nikoli rekel.
I hope none of this	Upam, da ni nič od tega
I don't think so anyway.	Mislim, da tako ali tako ne.
He always was.	Vedno je bil.
Which is too common now.	Kar je zdaj preveč pogosto.
He was lucky he didn't.	Imel je srečo, da ni.
I knew it wouldn't be easy	Vedel sem, da ne bo lahko
I want you because you are and only because	Želim si, ker si ti in samo zato
Nothing can be said about this.	Glede tega se ne da nič.
Which maybe not.	Kar morda ne.
I knew right away who did it	Takoj sem vedel, kdo je to storil
It doesn't feel good.	Ne počuti se dobro.
I shouldn't have to do this for you	Ne bi mi bilo treba tega storiti namesto tebe
I would be that person.	Jaz bi bil ta oseba.
I'm not the only one who thinks so	Nisem edini, ki tako mislim
That's everyone.	To so vsi.
I don't like them.	Ne maram jih.
I have decided	Odločil sem se
Everyone knew that.	To so vsi vedeli.
I can not believe	ne morem verjeti
I just couldn’t stay home, you know	Preprosto nisem mogel ostati doma, veš
Not so, she told herself.	Ni tako, si je rekla.
I know where we've been.	Vem, kje smo bili.
I'll be better at home.	Bolje mi bo doma.
Maybe they were right.	Morda so imeli prav.
I knew it might never happen again	Vedel sem, da se morda nikoli več ne bo zgodilo
I really didn't want to be here	Res nisem hotel biti tukaj
I wanted to be ready	Hotel sem biti pripravljen
No one could leave.	Nihče ni mogel oditi.
Everything seemed possible to him now.	Zdaj se mu je zdelo vse mogoče.
I find it hard to understand that you are really here.	Težko razumem, da si res tukaj.
He admitted that he couldn't do anything on his own.	Priznal je, da sam ne more storiti ničesar.
And he means it.	In resno misli.
I didn't know that	Tega nisem vedel
I put them both in school	Oba sem dal v šolo
I'm so sorry for all of this.	Zelo mi je žal za vse to.
I actually expected it	Pravzaprav sem pričakoval
She failed.	Ni ji uspelo.
And that's just it	In to je samo to
I saw it as soon as you saw her	Videl sem takoj, ko si jo videl
Or the day before.	Ali dan prej.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
I know exactly where he is	Prav vem, kje je
There was still plenty of time.	Časa je bilo še veliko.
There was no one in the room, but everyone was there.	V sobi ni bilo nikogar, a vsi so bili.
I already knew where to go	Sem že vedel, kam naj grem
I couldn't say what he meant	Nisem mogel povedati, kaj je mislil
I was just waiting for that.	Samo to sem čakal.
I don't have any more people.	Nimam več ljudi.
I need to see him again	Moram ga spet videti
I'll be there soon	Kmalu bom tam
Like, you just have to.	Kot, preprosto moraš.
I also know this will be good for me	Vem tudi, da bo to dobro zame
There aren't many people.	Ni veliko ljudi.
I didn’t expect him to say that	Nisem pričakoval, da bo to rekel
I will learn.	naučil se bom.
I've never seen her there before	Še nikoli je nisem videl tam
I want to keep working	Želim delati naprej
They are very interested.	Zelo jih zanima.
You didn't even have me.	Sploh me nisi imel.
I had a nice time with you today	Danes sem se imel s tabo lepo
It's too simple.	To je preveč preprosto.
But I have a problem.	Imam pa problem.
And how you were.	In kako si bil.
I haven't been to this place yet	Na tem mestu še nisem bil
It's better now.	Zdaj je bolje.
Just talk about everything.	Samo govori o vsem.
I'll do it myself.	To bom naredil sam.
This week here, that week there.	Ta teden tukaj, tisti teden tam.
That is what we should do.	To je tisto, kar bi morali storiti.
Now I can't tell you why	Zdaj vam ne morem povedati zakaj
He was not a father.	Ni bil oče.
I think so much.	Toliko mislim.
This is hard.	To je težko.
I think he knew something was going on	Mislim, da je vedel, da se nekaj dogaja
I'd really like to know.	Res bi rad vedel.
I already feel better	Počutim se že bolje
I wasn’t much better	Nisem bil veliko boljši
Sometimes I am very tired.	Včasih sem zelo utrujen.
I didn’t know it existed	Nisem vedel, da to obstaja
I want you to have this by tomorrow	Želim, da imaš to do jutri
That's what he wanted to do.	To je hotel storiti.
I hope that's okay.	Upam, da je to v redu.
He just played with us.	Pravkar se je igral z nami.
I mean really, really	Mislim res, res
Someone had to be there.	Nekdo je moral biti tam.
They are not.	Te niso.
He wanted to talk now.	Želel je govoriti zdaj.
I could never do that to her.	Tega ji nikoli ne bi mogel storiti.
If you want to be.	Če želite biti.
You can only know what is true for you.	Veš lahko samo tisto, kar je res zate.
Not then, not right away.	Ne takrat, ne takoj.
I would never eat it	Nikoli ga ne bi jedel
We'll do it tomorrow.	Naredili bomo jutri.
I'm surprised you're here.	Presenečen sem, da si tukaj.
I didn't say any of that	Nič od tega pa nisem rekel
That can't be said, he said.	Tega ni mogoče povedati, je rekel.
That's probably not true.	To verjetno ni res.
I've never heard them talk like that before.	Še nikoli jih nisem slišal tako govoriti.
I didn't want to be here	Nisem hotel biti tukaj
Like many many.	Kot veliko veliko.
No one even knew where he was.	Nihče niti ni vedel, kje je.
I didn't know what it was	Nisem vedel, kaj je
If they only knew.	Ko bi le vedeli.
And so it was here.	In tako je bilo tudi tukaj.
I think there’s something there you should see	Mislim, da je tam nekaj, kar bi morali videti
Maybe he's gone.	Morda je odšel.
If you don't like it, you don't like it.	Če ti ni všeč, ti ni všeč.
I've already done that	To sem že naredil
I am what you will become	Jaz sem to, kar boš postal
You like it.	Všeč ti je.
I wanted to see where.	Hotel sem videti, kje.
He was right, the man realized.	Imel je prav, je spoznal človek.
A man comes prepared.	Človek pride pripravljen.
That's simple too.	Tudi to je preprosto.
I don’t know where he wanted to go with this.	Ne vem, kam je hotel iti s tem.
She just knew.	Samo vedela je.
I probably won't see you for a while	Verjetno te nekaj časa ne bom videl
I was trying to do things	Poskušal sem narediti stvari
What he was and what he did.	Kaj je bil in kaj je naredil.
Do what you want	Naredi kar želiš
I haven't done that in a long time	Tega že dolgo nisem storil
He didn’t have to do that, but he did.	Tega mu ni bilo treba storiti, je pa naredil.
I don't have much time.	Nimam veliko časa.
Now we have a place to go.	Zdaj imamo kam iti.
I have to see for myself	Sam se moram prepričati
I felt like she was mine	Počutil sem se, kot da je moja
I think you will come with us	Mislim, da boš šel z nami
I never went out of them	Nikoli jih nisem šel ven
That is probably true.	To je verjetno res.
I didn't think so	Nisem mislil tako
He doesn't do that for you.	Tega ne počne zate.
That's probably all you know.	To je verjetno vse, kar veš.
Would that be a problem?	Bi bil to problem?
I was only human.	Bil sem samo človek.
But it was not.	Vendar ni bilo.
Just because it was easy.	Samo zato, ker je bilo lahko.
For work.	Za službo.
It was good to help.	Bilo je dobro pomagati.
I didn’t want to believe that could be true	Nisem hotel verjeti, da je to lahko res
Or maybe they aren’t.	Ali pa morda niso.
I think you knew that too.	Mislim, da si tudi to vedel.
And it's not always obvious.	In ni vedno očitno.
No, that's not a problem.	Ne, to ni problem.
I think we'll have to see what happens	Mislim, da bomo morali videti, kaj se bo zgodilo
She said she didn't.	Rekla je, da ni.
I will never do anything	Nikoli ne bom naredil ničesar
You never talked about it again.	Nikoli več nisi govoril o tem.
I see no one has.	Vidim, da nihče nima.
I couldn't talk anymore.	Nisem mogel več govoriti.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Morda malo, morda veliko.
I should never have left	Nikoli ne bi smel oditi
However, no.	Vendar pa ne.
I could tell.	Lahko bi povedal.
I'm afraid of them too.	Tudi jaz se jih bojim.
I learned that there	To sem se naučil tam
I forgot you were there	Pozabil sem, da si tam
Nothing since then.	Od takrat pa nič.
Can you please help me.	Mi lahko prosim kdo pomaga.
I was no longer convinced of anything	Nisem bil več prepričan v nič
Okay for the kids.	V redu za otroke.
He didn't want it, he knew so much.	Ni ga želel, toliko je vedel.
They had plenty of time, she said.	Imeli so dovolj časa, je rekla.
That's all that happened.	Samo to se je zgodilo.
I never did, really not.	Nikoli nisem, res ne.
I don't think we're the only ones	Mislim, da nismo edini
I have never worked since.	Od takrat nisem nikoli delal.
He knew how to do it.	Vedel je, kako to narediti.
I'll give it to him	dal mu jo bom
I could also tell you something else	Lahko bi ti tudi povedal kaj drugega
And maybe again.	In morda še enkrat.
I should.	Moral bi.
Always do what's right.	Vedno naredi, kar je prav.
There has never been anything like it.	Nikoli ni bilo nič takega.
I really didn't like it	Res mi ni bilo všeč
I didn't tell him that	Tega mu nisem povedal
Does anyone know if this is true.	Ali kdo ve, če je to res.
No, it's not.	Ne ni.
I wouldn't wish that on anyone	Tega ne bi želel nikomur
I can not do it anymore	Ne morem več
I had nothing to say.	Nisem imel kaj povedati.
Believe it.	Verjeti v to.
I didn’t know what was wrong with me	Nisem vedel, kaj je narobe z mano
I didn't see any of that	Nič od tega nisem videl
No, we didn't.	Ne, nismo.
He couldn't leave.	Ni mogel oditi.
But he didn't leave.	Vendar ni odšel.
I mean, not at all	Mislim, sploh ne
I know what happened to you	Vem kaj se ti je zgodilo
It seems good to me.	Meni se zdi dobro.
No one did anything.	Nihče ni nič naredil.
He had to be okay, he had to be.	Moral je biti v redu, moral je biti.
we are not together.	nismo skupaj.
I actually feel really good	Pravzaprav se počutim zelo dobro
To be so good.	Biti tako dober.
I didn't decide	Nisem se odločil
I think she's right.	Mislim, da ji je prav.
I would say more.	Povedal bi več.
He knew nothing more.	Nič več ni vedel.
Would be a problem if.	Ali bi bil problem, če.
I didn't hear anything.	Nič nisem slišal.
Time is also a problem.	Tudi čas je problem.
I would never allow that	Nikoli si tega ne bi dovolil
I'm not interested.	Ne zanima me.
I am and always am here	Sem in vedno sem tukaj
I want to stay.	Želim ostati.
This will seem very difficult to me.	To se mi bo zdelo zelo težko.
Even then, I was still working	Tudi takrat sem še delal
I wonder why he came back	Sprašujem se, zakaj se je vrnil
That's what it's about.	Za to gre.
I shouldn't leave like that	Ne bi smel tako oditi
I have to do that.	to moram narediti.
I was amazed at what he did	Bil sem presenečen nad tem, kaj je naredil
I wouldn't be without it	Brez tega me ne bi bilo
He is such a good man.	On je tako dober človek.
And he liked it.	In všeč mu je bilo.
It's about people again.	Spet gre za ljudi.
He was good to me.	Bil je dober do mene.
I loved my life in the city	Všeč mi je bilo svoje življenje v mestu
I have early in the morning	Imam zgodaj zjutraj
You are always there for me.	Vedno si tam zame.
Maybe you were right.	Mogoče si imel prav.
But she was good at it.	Vendar je bila v tem dobra.
There was nothing I could do about it.	Nič nisem mogel storiti glede tega.
I will not allow him to do that.	Tega mu ne bom dovolil.
He learned nothing.	Ničesar se ni naučil.
I could learn that.	Tega bi se lahko naučil.
Nobody knows at home.	Doma nihče ne ve.
I should help you	Moral bi ti pomagati
I think it must be something else	Mislim, da mora biti nekaj drugega
I just have to see him	Samo videti ga moram
I hope no one saw me	Upam, da me nihče ni videl
I also bought you a car	Kupil sem ti tudi avto
This is simply not true.	To preprosto ni res.
I had nothing to do with it	Nisem imel nič s tem
That better be good.	Bolje, da je to dobro.
Sometimes I wonder why	Včasih se sprašujem zakaj
They are certainly not the only ones.	Zagotovo to niso edini.
But we have little time.	Imamo pa malo časa.
I didn't say anything like that.	Nisem rekel nič takega.
That's all I thought, you know	Samo to sem mislil, veš
You know it is.	Saj veš, da je.
That's a good boy.	To je dober fant.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ne bo.
She said it was, but it wasn’t true.	Rekla je, da je, vendar ni bilo res.
Maybe there will be more.	Morda bo še.
He had money.	Imel je denar.
I don't believe in any of this.	V nič od tega ne verjamem.
He did it wrong and he knew it.	Naredil je narobe in je to vedel.
I've never seen her.	Nikoli je nisem videl.
It probably was then.	Takrat je verjetno bilo.
It happened again.	Zgodilo se je spet.
We know what this is about.	Vemo, za kaj gre.
I'm really glad to be here now	Res sem vesel, da sem zdaj tukaj
I had to believe he would find me	Moral sem verjeti, da me bo našel
However, there never seems to be enough time.	Vendar se zdi, da nikoli ni dovolj časa.
I didn’t expect a lot of people	Nisem pričakoval veliko ljudi
That's good for us.	To je dobro za nas.
Pretty simple job.	Precej preprosto delo.
I wanted to know who this man was	Hotel sem vedeti, kdo je ta človek
But I felt a little better.	Počutil sem se pa malo bolje.
I will definitely win.	Zagotovo bom zmagal.
It just seems right.	Samo zdi se prav.
I didn't do it for the money	Tega nisem naredil zaradi denarja
He left it at that.	Pri tem je pustil.
I think we've done enough for tonight	Mislim, da smo naredili dovolj za nocoj
And that's that.	In to je to.
I never seem to have time	Zdi se, da nikoli nimam časa
I don't know what any of this is about.	Ne vem, za kaj od tega gre.
I didn't expect that either	Tudi jaz tega nisem pričakoval
I didn't like them at all	Sploh mi niso bili všeč
He couldn't know anything.	Ničesar ni mogel vedeti.
That's so true.	Toliko je res.
I want all my life	Želim si vse življenje
I want to know everything	Želim vedeti vse
I don't see anyone with you	S tabo ne vidim nikogar
I feel like it is.	Počutim se, kot da bi bilo tako.
I can't help you much with that	S tem ti ne morem veliko pomagati
That nothing happened.	Da se ni nič zgodilo.
I shouldn't have told you that	Tega ti ne bi smel povedati
I thought you'd like it.	Mislil sem, da ti bodo všeč.
I knew it wasn't	Vedel sem, da ni
You could do that too, you know.	Tudi ti bi to lahko storil, veš.
I never asked for help	Nikoli nisem prosil za pomoč
I thought she really liked me	Mislil sem, da sem ji res všeč
I was ready.	Bil sem pripravljen.
It seems that from.	Zdi se, da od.
Everything seemed good.	Vse se je zdelo dobro.
Or where is that.	Ali kje je to.
I could tell he really didn’t know	Lahko bi rekel, da res ni vedel
I'm glad to have him here.	Vesel sem, da ga imam tukaj.
I would be right.	Prav bi imel.
I haven't seen it yet	še nisem videl
I'm afraid of you.	bojim se te.
I didn't expect to come back here	Nisem pričakoval, da se bom vrnil sem
I knew you would never come alone	Vedel sem, da nikoli ne boš prišel sam
He doesn't know any better.	Ne ve bolje.
It's happening.	To se dogaja.
I'm not going to be well here	Tukaj mi ne bo dobro
I just know it will	Samo vem, da bo
I always know what you mean	Vedno vem, kaj misliš
There is more.	Obstaja več.
I could help him.	Lahko bi mu pomagal.
I really liked them	Res so mi bili všeč
Not so tired.	Ni tako utrujen.
I hope it feels that way	Upam, da se tako počuti
I wish I could stay	Želim si, da bi ostal
She had to go to work.	Morala je na delo.
I wasn't surprised at all.	Sploh nisem bil presenečen.
You can't be.	Ne moreš biti.
I'm going out tonight	Nocoj grem ven
You said it was going to be hard, and it was.	Rekel si, da bo težko, in bilo je.
I wasn’t so surprised.	Nisem bil tako presenečen.
I was the one who was wrong	Jaz sem bil tisti, ki je bil narobe
I wouldn't do it for him now.	Zdaj tega ne bi storila namesto njega.
I certainly wouldn't.	zagotovo ne bi.
It needs to be done !.	To je treba storiti!.
He didn't even call.	Niti ni poklical.
But he has never succeeded in that.	A tega mu še nikoli ni uspelo.
I don't need anything else from you.	Ne potrebujem ničesar drugega od tebe.
I thought my day was going well	Mislil sem, da mi gre dan dobro
But he still hasn't come home.	A domov še vedno ni prišel.
I can't tell her that yet	Tega ji še ne morem povedati
But he didn’t tell anyone.	Vendar ni povedal nikomur.
She knew why.	Vedela je zakaj.
I helped you.	Pomagal sem ti.
I never wanted her more	Nikoli si je nisem želel bolj
She really liked this one.	Ta ji je bil zelo všeč.
I don't know why he does this.	Ne vem, zakaj to počne.
But he hasn't completely, completely made up his mind yet.	Vendar se še ni popolnoma, popolnoma odločil.
It never will.	Nikoli ne bo.
I will never forget that.	Tega ne bom nikoli pozabil.
I've seen that before	To sem že videl
I found my true self again	Spet sem našel svoj pravi jaz
I was tired again	Spet sem bil utrujen
I am, and now she is gone	Sem, in zdaj je ni več
He knows nothing.	Ničesar ne ve.
I haven't seen that.	Tega nisem videl.
I'm certainly not alone.	Zagotovo nisem sam.
But there was a lot wrong.	Vendar je bilo veliko narobe.
I wonder why he was here last night	Sprašujem se, zakaj je bil sinoči tukaj
He liked this man.	Ta človek mu je bil všeč.
I'll talk to you	govoril bom s tabo
That will be fine.	To bo v redu.
Now you know what happened.	Zdaj veste, kaj se je zgodilo.
I need to know about you.	Moram vedeti zate.
I had to do it for you	Moral sem to narediti zate
I know it is.	Vem, da je.
I love being there	Rad imam tam
I want to know what's going on	Želim vedeti, kaj se dogaja
And because.	In ker.
He said.	Rekel je.
He wanted to do it for money.	Hotel je to narediti za denar.
I could play.	Lahko bi igral.
Tell you what we have to do, he said.	Povedati ti, kaj moramo narediti, je rekel.
It's time to work.	Čas je za delo.
what is it about.	za kaj gre.
We could definitely do it here.	Tukaj bi zagotovo lahko naredili.
I wanted nothing more than to leave there	Ničesar nisem hotel, kot da bi odšel od tam
You should know that about me.	To bi moral vedeti o meni.
Tell her why.	Povej ji zakaj.
He said everything seemed fine.	Rekel je, da se zdi vse v redu.
He never knew.	Nikoli ni vedel.
It can never be otherwise.	Nikoli ne more biti drugega.
He thought he could do better.	Mislil je, da bi lahko bolje.
I didn't tell her anything	Nič ji nisem rekel
I hope you have a nice time	Upam, da se ima lepo
None of us could.	Nihče od nas ne bi mogel.
I left that at home	To sem pustil doma
I still sometimes believe he doesn’t know how	Še vedno včasih verjamem, da ne ve, kako
And that's that!.	In to je to!.
Back earlier.	Nazaj prej.
I said it would be fine	Rekel sem, da bo to v redu
I thought you were better than that	Mislil sem, da si boljši od tega
I don’t think they knew what was going on	Mislim, da niso vedeli, kaj se dogaja
I meant you.	Mislil sem tebe .
I’m not sure what’s right.	Nisem prepričan, kaj je prav.
I don't know what's wrong.	Ne vem, kaj je narobe.
I didn’t know what to think	Nisem vedel, kaj naj si mislim
And I could help you with that.	In s tem bi vam lahko pomagal.
I needed to know more, so much more	Moral sem vedeti več, toliko več
Not for a long time.	Že dolgo ne.
However, this did not happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
I know I couldn't do that	Vem, da tega ne bi mogel storiti
But so it seemed.	Ali tako se je zdelo.
He needed more.	Potreboval je več.
I knew you didn't know where he lived	Vedel sem, da ne veš, kje živi
I just don't know.	Samo ne vem.
I never played again after that.	Po tem nisem nikoli več igral.
I had to come and see for myself	Moral sem priti in se sam prepričati
I know what you were doing	Vem kaj si počel
I'm not interested in that.	To me ne zanima.
I stayed long enough	ostal sem dovolj dolgo
It was only a matter of time before the obvious happened.	Bilo je le vprašanje časa, kdaj se bo zgodilo očitno.
Not much now.	Zdaj ne veliko.
How they did it.	Kako so to naredili.
He knew.	Vedel je.
I know it's hard for you	Vem, da ti je težko
I liked everything there, except it wasn't me	Tam mi je bilo vse všeč, le da nisem bil jaz
I don't need help for that.	Za to ne potrebujem pomoči.
I wasn't sure.	nisem bil prepričan.
And we had it.	In imeli smo ga.
He went to work as usual.	Kot običajno je šel v službo.
No, that was nice.	Ne, to je bilo lepo.
I didn’t even know how it happened	Sploh nisem vedel, kako se je zgodilo
you are a friend.	ti si prijatelj.
How can I do that.	Kako lahko to storim.
It doesn't exist now.	Zdaj ne obstaja.
I have many children	Imam veliko otrok
Now she was gone.	Zdaj je ni bilo več.
He's good at it.	Je dober v tem.
I haven’t decided yet how to call her	Nisem se še odločil, kako bi jo poklical
How hard it is to be.	Kako težko je biti.
You'll be fine.	V redu boš.
He can still do it.	Še vedno lahko to stori.
I don’t know why I feel better.	Ne vem zakaj se počutim bolje.
It's good for you, too.	Dobro je tudi zate.
there.	tam.
I completely understand	popolnoma razumem
And that's what he said.	In to je rekel.
Which it should be.	Kar bi morala biti.
I didn't want it to work, you know.	Nisem hotel, da dela, veš.
Maybe he had.	Mogoče je imel.
I just had to get out of there.	Moral sem samo oditi od tam.
I didn’t have any of that	Nisem imel nič od tega
I liked both of them right away	Oba sta mi bila takoj všeč
I won't play it anymore.	Ne bom ga več igral.
We could do that.	To bi lahko naredili.
I had to know how he was doing.	Moral sem vedeti, kako mu gre.
I just can't.	Ne morem samo.
You know, it was really hard.	Veste, bilo je res težko.
I didn't talk to you about that either	Tudi s tabo nisem govoril o tem
I really don't care.	To me res ne zanima.
Now you have to go.	Zdaj moraš iti.
I didn’t know there were more	Nisem vedel, da jih je več
She certainly wouldn't make it.	Zagotovo ji tega v tem ne bi uspelo.
I taught you not to	Naučil sem te, da ne boš
That's what I said then	Takrat sem to rekel
And is.	In je.
So something is working with you.	Zato nekaj dela s tabo.
I wonder a lot about that	Zelo se sprašujem o tem
I forgot what it’s like to do these things	Pozabil sem, kako je delati te stvari
I almost feel sorry for him	Skoraj mi ga je žal
I didn’t want to believe this was happening	Nisem hotel verjeti, da se to dogaja
I wasn’t good at it	Nisem bil dober v tem
Everyone is here.	Vsi so tukaj.
I said it was fine and that everything was fine.	Rekel sem, da je v redu in da je vse v redu.
I myself do not know what to think about this.	Sam ne vem, kaj naj si mislim o tem.
I'll be fine	Popolnoma v redu bom
I have so much to say	Toliko imam za povedati
I think you know what that is.	Mislim, da dobro veš, kaj je to.
Don't think about anything.	Ne misli na nič.
This is my life now.	To je zdaj moje življenje.
I started in the morning	Začel sem zjutraj
It never was.	Nikoli ni bilo.
I definitely thought it was going to be hard	Zagotovo sem mislil, da bo težko
I just had to get out	Samo ven sem moral
I feel at home here.	Tukaj se počutim kot doma.
I asked someone what was going on	Nekoga sem vprašal, kaj se dogaja
He really liked that.	To mu je bilo zelo všeč.
You don't have to do that, you know.	Ni ti treba storiti tega, veš.
Sometimes you will make them.	Včasih jih boste naredili.
I will pass.	Bom opravil.
Your father too.	Tudi tvoj oče.
Apparently I was ready	Očitno sem bil pripravljen
None of this I told you	Nič od tega sem ti rekel
How.	Kako.
This was the first time he had come to the house.	To je bilo prvič, da je prišel v hišo.
To do.	Narediti.
I just like this one	Samo ta mi je všeč
I'm not too interested in that.	To me ne zanima preveč.
He is not.	On ni.
It starts.	To počne.
He's everything you've ever wanted.	On je vse, kar si si kdaj želela.
I have to do right	Moram narediti prav
I will not have them forever	Ne bom jih imel za vedno
You too had to be a child once.	Tudi ti si moral biti enkrat otrok.
That's not it.	Ta ne.
Maybe it still is.	Mogoče je še vedno.
He has a lot more time now.	Zdaj ima veliko več časa.
Tonight it's just you and me.	Nocoj sva samo ti in jaz.
You did your job.	Opravil si svoje delo.
He felt more tired than he had reason to.	Počutil se je bolj utrujen, kot je imel razlog za to.
But she was here again.	Vendar je bila spet tukaj.
And back to work again.	In spet nazaj na delo.
We've seen that before.	To smo že videli.
I know someone is for me	Vem, da je nekdo zame
Or a problem.	Ali problem.
But he was human.	Vendar je bil človek.
No one would tell me where.	Nihče mi ne bi povedal, kje.
I can't talk about it	Ne morem govoriti o tem
I didn't mean that.	Nisem to mislil.
I didn’t expect it to be difficult	Nisem pričakoval, da bo težko
I thought you were gone forever.	Mislil sem, da si šel za vedno.
It was a hard life.	Bilo je težko življenje.
I don't know them myself	Sam jih ne poznam
I can’t believe it all happened	Ne morem verjeti, da se je vse zgodilo
Obviously this is no longer the case.	Očitno ni več tako.
I worked and that was it	Delal sem in to je bilo to
That's how we had it.	Tako smo ga imeli.
Do it too.	Tudi to stori.
And he sings.	In poje.
That was the way to do it.	To je bil način za to.
I just wanted to leave.	Hotel sem samo oditi.
I don't know where to go from here.	Ne vem, kam naj grem od tukaj.
Everything goes well with a little help.	Z malo pomoči gre vse dobro.
So nice.	Tako lepo.
I want the option.	Želim možnost.
I think they all are	Mislim, da so vsi
I think you know.	Mislim, da veš.
I wasn’t sure what to think about it	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj naj si mislim o tem
I don't think it's that simple.	Mislim, da ni tako preprosto.
I know it’s just for a little bit, but it’s enough.	Vem, da je samo za malo, vendar je dovolj.
I knew he had a job.	Vedel sem, da ima delo.
I have too much work to do at the moment	Trenutno imam preveč dela
I never heard him leave	Nikoli ga nisem slišal oditi
That was not it.	To ni bilo to.
Can also.	Lahko tudi.
It was certainly possible.	Zagotovo je bilo to mogoče.
We had a great time.	Imeli smo se lepo.
I just wanted to be me	Hotel sem biti samo jaz
I think Dad had had enough	Mislim, da je imel oče dovolj
It's all for you and you're for me.	Vse je zate in ti si zame.
I didn't want that.	tega nisem hotel.
First, it is for sure	Prvič, to je zagotovo
You should know that.	To bi morala vedeti.
It's been there for a long time.	Tam je že dolgo časa.
We need to do better.	Moramo narediti bolje.
Nothing more is happening.	Nič več se ne dogaja.
Sometimes it happened.	Včasih se je zgodilo.
Not in this city.	Ne v tem mestu.
That's what he meant.	To je mislil.
I know this is really wrong.	Vem, da je to res narobe.
And it's true.	In res je.
I didn't see it that way	Nisem tako videl
I did it myself.	Sam sem to naredil.
Until then, I won't talk to you about it anymore.	Do takrat s tabo ne bom več govoril o tem.
I had to know what was going on and why.	Moral sem vedeti, kaj se dogaja in zakaj.
I'm glad it helped you	Vesel sem, da vam je bilo v pomoč
I hope it will be good.	Upam, da bo dobro.
That's your problem.	To je tvoj problem.
Like it would be nice tomorrow.	Kot da bi bilo jutri lepo.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
I liked it, but I didn’t like it	Všeč mi je bilo, vendar mi ni bilo všeč
I do this very often.	To počnem zelo pogosto.
I wouldn't have to stay long	Ne bi mi bilo treba dolgo ostati
But I'm glad we did.	Vendar sem vesel, da smo.
I wasn’t good at it	Nisem bil dober v tem
It wouldn't seem right.	Ne bi se zdelo prav.
I will also get some of that	Nekaj ​​od tega bom tudi dobil
He used to be a very good friend of mine.	Nekoč je bil moj zelo dober prijatelj.
Life goes on.	Življenje gre naprej.
It was so nice to see them.	Tako lepo jih je bilo videti.
It's just hard.	Samo težko je.
I found them in town	Našel sem jih v mestu
That's neither here nor there.	To ni ne tukaj ne tam.
The thing is, it could be.	Stvar je v tem, da bi lahko bilo.
There aren't any.	Ni jih.
He got lost.	Izgubil se je.
Not again man.	Ne spet človek.
If I could do that, I could do anything.	Če bi to lahko storil, bi lahko storil vse.
Next for you.	Naslednji za tabo.
And you’ll probably never know.	In verjetno ne boste nikoli vedeli.
But he doesn’t have to do that.	Vendar mu tega ni treba storiti.
Someone was talking too much.	Nekdo je preveč govoril.
It was hard not to be.	Težko je bilo ne biti.
I don't see who he is.	Ne vidim, kdo je.
It's so good.	Tako je dobro.
You've seen them before.	Videli ste jih že prej.
So she had to do something fast.	Zato je morala hitro nekaj narediti.
I didn't think you'd come alone	Nisem si mislil, da boš prišel sam
They did it wrong.	To so naredili narobe.
I wasn’t ready for that to be me	Nisem bil pripravljen, da bi to bil jaz
I should have told you right away.	Takoj bi ti moral povedati.
I didn't expect that at all	Tega sploh nisem pričakoval
I would do it myself.	To bi naredil sam.
That may not be nice.	To morda ni lepo.
I heard about it	Slišal sem o tem
If you can.	Če lahko.
I know what my father will say	Vem, kaj bo moj oče rekel
But you shouldn't be surprised.	A ne bi smel biti presenečen.
He gave me money.	Dal mi je denar.
I think it was hard for him	Mislim, da mu je bilo težko
We have to go back.	Moramo nazaj.
We're fine tonight.	Nocoj smo v redu.
I waited for him to come after me	Čakal sem, da pride za mano
I didn't do enough	Nisem naredil dovolj
A friend will never leave	Prijatelj nikoli ne bo odšel
You know that for sure.	To zagotovo veste.
I actually like that more.	To mi je pravzaprav bolj všeč.
I really believe.	res verjamem.
You lost everything.	Izgubil si vse.
I have money.	imam denar.
It gets better every day.	Vsak dan je bolje.
Make my little one.	Naredi moje malo.
This is nothing like that.	To ni nič takega.
I would give my life for you	Zate bi dal svoje življenje
We should move on.	Morali bi iti naprej.
I couldn't do that yet	Tega še nisem mogel
I already know what he's thinking	Že vem, kaj si misli
And it seems that it can.	In zdi se, da lahko.
I always believe that tomorrow will be better.	Vedno verjamem, da bo jutri bolje.
Nothing to go on.	Nič za naprej.
I feel better this morning.	Danes zjutraj se počutim bolje.
I was right to do that	Prav sem imel, da sem to naredil
I'm sorry about that.	Žal mi je za to.
He still won't do anything.	Še vedno ne bo naredil ničesar.
Just every day.	Prav vsak dan.
I don't know who he was	Ne vem, kdo je bil
I still have it today	Imam ga še danes
No, that's not enough.	Ne, to ni dovolj.
But you can too.	Lahko pa tudi ti.
Maybe you had them.	Morda ste jih imeli.
I would do that tomorrow	To bi naredil jutri
I wouldn't call that	Tega ne bi poklical
I wanted to go out tonight	Nocoj sem hotel iti ven
I was tired then, really tired	Takrat sem bil utrujen, res utrujen
I know I can.	Vem, da lahko.
He knew he wouldn't.	Vedel je, da ne bo.
Which were not.	Ki jih ni bilo.
I was actually really tired	Pravzaprav sem bil res utrujen
Tell me a little about it.	Povej mi malo o tem.
I want to be with you	rad bi bil s tabo
It's really fast.	Res je hitro.
I was in my room at the time	Takrat sem bil v svoji sobi
I told him about it today	Danes sem mu povedal o tem
I'm not afraid of you	Ne bojim se te
But she failed.	Vendar ji ni uspelo.
I didn't want to eat it	Nisem ga hotel jesti
Sam was trying to say something.	Sam je poskušal nekaj povedati.
It looked like you wanted it to.	Videti je bilo, kot bi si želela.
I can't help myself	Ne morem si pomagati
I don't understand either.	Tudi jaz ne razumem.
He gave it back to me.	Vrnil mi ga je.
Because it shouldn't be.	Ker ne bi smel biti.
I'll have a good time with that.	S tem se bom imel lepo.
I do this to be better.	To počnem, da bi bil boljši.
Now I know who they are	Zdaj vem, kdo so
Boy, that's really something.	Fant, to je res nekaj.
It doesn't help.	Ne pomaga.
I just have to do it	Samo to moram narediti
I really didn’t have to do that	Tega mi res ni bilo treba storiti
Let it be you.	Naj boš ti.
But it seems that we are there.	A zdi se, da smo pri tem.
He's back.	Vrnil se je.
This is life.	To je življenje.
I will not go to you	Ne bom šel v vas
That's why it's not.	Zato tega ni.
And the day after that and the next day.	In dan za tem in naslednji dan.
I'm so glad to see you	Tako sem vesel, da te vidim
That someone was me.	Ta nekdo sem bil jaz.
He knows this and he won't.	To ve in ne bo.
But maybe they will now.	Morda pa bodo zdaj.
It's just not good.	Samo ni dobro.
I couldn't just leave	Nisem mogel kar oditi
He was very helpful.	Bil je v veliko pomoč.
I didn't have that	Tega nisem imel
You need to talk to him.	Moraš govoriti z njim.
You could get your stuff	Lahko bi dobil svoje stvari
I was much more than that	Bil sem veliko več kot to
Or I'm afraid of you.	Ali pa se te bojim.
I didn’t know why at the time, but I thought it was right.	Takrat nisem vedel, zakaj, vendar se mi je zdelo prav.
They were with you.	Bili so pri vas.
There was nobody there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar.
I understand him.	razumem ga.
You really are alone	Res si sam
I couldn’t say for sure.	Nisem mogel zagotovo povedati.
Nothing was wrong.	Nič ni bilo narobe.
I believe I could	Verjamem, da bi lahko
I know it's not just me.	Vem, da nisem samo jaz.
I'm not going to make it now	Zdaj mi ne bo uspelo
But even if it were true.	A tudi če bi bilo res.
That's not right.	To ni prav.
I won't see them	Ne bom jih videl
It is often probable.	Pogosto je verjetno.
I would like to know.	rad bi vedel.
I'll be back.	Vrnil se bom.
I wanted him to come.	Hotel sem, da pride.
He doesn't need it.	Ni mu treba.
But just a few days before him.	A le nekaj dni pred njim.
None of us know.	Nihče od nas ne ve.
I think this is quite common	Mislim, da je to precej pogosto
I think that's how it goes	Mislim, da tako gre
We still have a chance.	Še vedno imamo priložnost.
I will love that.	To mi bo všeč.
I don't think you can.	Mislim, da ne moreš.
He had no money for it.	Za to ni imel denarja.
I shouldn't have known that	Tega ne bi smel vedeti
The boy knew more.	Fant je vedel več.
He has to go his own way.	Mora iti po svoje.
She has to do it herself.	To mora storiti sama.
Not from me.	Ne od mene.
Live for it.	Živi za to.
I was no longer alone	Nisem bil več sam
It's just that.	To je samo to.
Not really.	Pravzaprav ni tako.
I wasn’t sure it would be	Nisem bil prepričan, da bo
I saw the problem	Videl sem problem

There was something wrong here.	Tukaj je bilo nekaj narobe.
As if that could ever happen.	Kot bi se to lahko kdaj zgodilo.

There are a few.	Nekaj ​​jih je.
I didn't see what it was	Nisem videl, kaj je bilo
I wish you didn't have to go	Želim si, da ti ne bi bilo treba iti
I was the one who did it	Jaz sem bil tisti, ki je to naredil

However, it seemed to be going to be difficult for me.	Vendar se je zdelo, da mi bo težko.
I feel good.	Dobro se počutim.
They had enough.	Imeli so dovolj.
He didn't come back because he didn't want to.	Ni se vrnil, ker tega ni hotel.
I think your father was right	Mislim, da je imel tvoj oče prav

And no children.	In brez otrok.
I think she'll like you	Mislim, da ji bodo te všeč
I think he was a good man.	Mislim, da je bil dober človek.

You should see that.	To bi moral videti.
I will do it.	to bom naredil.

I thought he was there	Mislil sem, da je tam
Is there anything better than that ?.	Je kaj bolje od tega?.

I had to do these things myself	Te stvari sem moral narediti sam
In fact, many years.	Pravzaprav veliko let.
We have to see what I think is right.	Moramo videti, kaj se mi zdi prav.
And they didn't have it.	In ga niso imeli.

I wish someone would tell me that here	Želim si, da bi mi kdo to povedal tukaj
I wanted to talk more	Želel sem govoriti več

Maybe I'll lose her again	Morda jo bom spet izgubil
There is a possibility that this is true.	Obstaja možnost, da je to res.
It's just nothing.	Preprosto ni nič.

You could get your stuff.	Lahko bi dobil svoje stvari.
What is it?.	Kaj je to?.

He won't come to you here.	Tukaj ne bo prišel do tebe.

I'm still doing that.	To še zdaj počnem.

I would love it.	Meni bi bilo všeč.
I wasn’t the only one who felt that way.	Nisem bil edini, ki se je tako počutil.
I don't mean anything like that.	Ne mislim nič takega.
Much more than you know.	Veliko več kot veš.
I didn't need him.	Nisem ga potreboval.
I didn’t expect him to come out right away and ask	Nisem pričakoval, da bo takoj prišel ven in vprašal
But she didn't do that.	Vendar tega ni storila.
Which probably no one will buy.	Ki ga verjetno nihče ne bo kupil.
I thought you wanted that.	Mislil sem, da si to želiš.
He looked very tired.	Videti je bil zelo utrujen.
It was early in the morning.	Bilo je zgodaj zjutraj.
He wasn't right.	Ni bil pravi.
I have decided	Odločil sem se
And that helps.	In to pomaga.
You should go there and make sure	Moral bi iti tja in se prepričati
He said he would not return.	Rekel je, da se ne bo vrnil.
But they did.	Vendar so to storili.
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
I can't do without you.	Ne morem brez tebe.
Very good question.	Zelo dobro vprašanje.
I've known you forever.	Poznam te od vedno.
I wasn’t ready for that	Nisem bil pripravljen na to
That's it for us.	To je to za nas.
We're on it.	Smo na tem.
Maybe it was true.	Mogoče je bilo res.
And a good reason.	In dober razlog.
I knew it was wrong	Vedel sem, da je to narobe
Now was the time.	Zdaj je bil čas.
You have to do everything.	Vse moraš narediti.
I want to be like you	Želim biti kot ti
I know you will love it	Vem, da ti bo zelo všeč
He sings a little.	Malo poje.
And they were right	In imeli so prav
I really liked it	Res mi je bil zelo všeč
I knew what he was going to say	Vedel sem, kaj bo rekel
I think I should talk about it.	Mislim, da bi moral govoriti o tem.
He's not sure he could.	Ni prepričan, da bi lahko.
Said no one, ever.	Rekel nihče, nikoli.
He couldn't believe it, he didn't want to believe it.	Ni mogel verjeti, ni hotel verjeti.
Simple, but good.	Preprosto, a dobro.
I didn’t think this was going to happen	Nisem si mislil, da se bo to zgodilo
I shouldn't be surprised.	Ne bi smel biti presenečen.
I haven't heard from them since	Od takrat jih nisem več slišal
I asked you what you wanted	Vprašal sem te, kaj želiš
That's for sure.	To je zagotovo.
I like them.	Všeč so mi.
I decided not to let that happen	Odločil sem se, da tega ne bom pustil
And good thing it's not.	In dobro, da ni.
I didn't expect to see you	Nisem pričakoval, da te bom videl
I think they will see the reason	Mislim, da bodo videli razlog
He thinks it will happen.	Misli, da se bo to zgodilo.
I don't understand why he was alone	Ne razumem, zakaj je bil sam
And not here.	In ne tukaj.
You may succeed.	Morda vam bo uspelo.
I had to know.	Moral sem vedeti.
I could totally go for it.	Popolnoma bi se lahko odločil za to.
I didn't mean.	nisem mislil.
That was good enough.	To je bilo dovolj dobro.
So I hope he comes.	Tako upam, da bo prišel.
He went out.	Odšel je ven.
I didn’t get much myself	Sam nisem dobil veliko
I am very angry with him	Zelo sem jezen z njim
He didn't need to be told.	Ni mu bilo treba povedati.
He was not seen.	Ni ga bilo videti.
Very nice of you.	Zelo lepo od vas.
I wish she was still with me now	Želim si, da bi bila zdaj še vedno z mano
I forgot they were there	Pozabil sem, da so tam
Right there.	Prav tam.
I need to go back a little	Moram malo nazaj
He just seemed to know what to do.	Zdelo se je, da le ve, kaj storiti.
Or it used to be.	Ali pa je bilo včasih.
Just like that.	Tako kot to.
I thought it would.	Mislil sem, da bo.
Together with.	Skupaj z.
It wasn't like that for me.	Pri meni ni bilo tako.
It doesn't work.	Ne gre.
I couldn't leave now	Zdaj nisem mogel oditi
Again, it's only a matter of time.	Spet je samo vprašanje časa.
She's doing well.	Dobro ji gre.
There is nothing else he can do.	Tega ne more storiti nič drugega.
Obviously this is not true.	Očitno to ni res.
I am so glad to be home.	Tako sem vesel, da sem doma.
I became glad to be your friend	Postal sem vesel, da sem tvoj prijatelj
He has to stay with us.	Ostati mora pri nas.
Or what he does.	Ali kaj počne.
No one has seen him yet.	Nihče ga še ni videl.
Almost ready.	Še skoraj pripravljen.
There is more.	Obstaja več.
You're right, we did it.	Prav imaš, uspelo nam je.
I think that's it	Mislim, da je to to
But he heard none of it.	Vendar ni slišal ničesar od tega.
You're lucky you met me.	Imaš srečo, da si se srečal z mano.
Why did he stay? 	Zakaj je ostal?
he asked himself.	se je vprašal.
You know it's true.	Saj veš, da je res.
I wanted to believe her	Hotel sem ji verjeti
And yet.	In vendar se.
Maybe a lot.	Mogoče zelo.
He said it couldn't be true.	Rekel je, da ne more biti res.
I didn't hear anything from him	Nič nisem slišal od njega
And he feels good with us too.	In tudi on se dobro počuti ob nas.
The opportunity is there.	Priložnost je tam.
you think.	misliš.
I knew right away it was wrong	Takoj sem vedel, da je narobe
I was home alone	Doma sem bil sam in sam
Sometimes I do better.	Včasih mi gre bolje.
I really don't know why.	res ne vem zakaj.
Who knows if anything will happen.	Kdo ve, če se bo kaj zgodilo.
I don't think he's sure either	Mislim, da tudi on ni prepričan
That's how it's done.	Tako se to dela.
I came back.	sem se vrnil.
And we succeeded.	In uspelo nam je.
I would like to say	rad bi rekel
I can't believe I would do that	Ne morem verjeti, da bi to storil
And that was it.	In to je bilo to.
Do what you promised.	Naredi, kar si obljubil.
But I've never played that.	Tega pa nisem nikoli igral.
I've never been right before.	Nikoli prej nisem imel prav.
I think we could do more and better.	Mislim, da bi lahko naredili več in bolje.
Someone had to.	Nekdo je moral.
I don't think there was time	Mislim, da ni bilo časa
I never knew enough.	Nikoli nisem vedel dovolj.
And that's a problem for me.	In to je zame problem.
I have to help her	Moram ji pomagati
I just couldn't tell you before	Prej ti preprosto nisem mogel povedati
I know it's not easy being here	Vem, da ni lahko biti tukaj
That would not happen now.	Zdaj se to ne bi zgodilo.
No, that's right.	Ne, tako je.
I didn’t like where this was going	Ni mi bilo všeč, kam gre to
I heard you, you know.	Slišal sem te, veš.
I'm not going to help here	Tukaj ne bom pomagal
I was there, you know	Bil sem tam, veš
I think they will.	Mislim, da bodo.
He didn't call at all.	Sploh ni poklical.
That's how it will happen.	Tako se bo zgodilo.
I never made it	Nikoli mi tega ni uspelo
I can't speak at the moment.	Trenutno ne morem govoriti.
I stayed home a lot.	Veliko sem ostal doma.
I will tell her everything.	Vse ji bom povedal.
I don’t think anyone knew what was going to happen.	Mislim, da nihče ni vedel, kaj se bo zgodilo.
I was glad she made it	Vesel sem bil, da ji je to uspelo
He felt like he had lost everything.	Počutil se je, kot da je izgubil vse.
They still haven't.	Še vedno niso.
I think he will leave	Mislim, da bo odšel
i will buy them.	kupil jih bom.
You are it.	Ti si to.
It was completely me.	To sem bil popolnoma jaz.
I see him all the time	Ves čas ga vidim
It could be mine.	Lahko bi bil moj.
No one will ask you why.	Nihče te ne bo vprašal zakaj.
I started to like it very much	Začel mi je biti zelo všeč
There must be something wrong with me.	Nekaj ​​mora biti narobe z mano.
Also pretty good	Tudi precej dobra
Maybe it's all that.	Morda je vse to.
Much more.	Veliko več.
And I'll see you again.	In spet se bomo videli.
I am not a man for this job	Nisem človek za to službo
I started the next day	Začel sem že naslednji dan
Not now, not tonight.	Ne zdaj, ne nocoj.
She wanted to be with him.	Želela je biti z njim.
Not now, but then it was.	Zdaj ni, takrat pa je bilo.
I wouldn’t be angry if I did	Ne bi bil jezen, če bi
I was just wondering.	Samo vprašal sem se.
She went to work.	Šla je v službo.
I never knew there were so many	Nikoli nisem vedel, da jih je toliko
I liked them all	Vsi so mi bili všeč
And I would try to do a lot of it myself.	In veliko tega bi poskušal narediti sam.
Not wrong.	Ni narobe.
I didn't mean any of that	Nič od tega nisem mislil
I understand why that is	Razumem, zakaj je tako
I want you to know that something is wrong here	Želim, da veš, da tukaj nekaj ni v redu
And you are me.	In ti si jaz.
I understand.	Razumem.
I didn't say anything	Nič nisem rekel
It seems like a really easy job to me.	Zdi se mi kot res lahko delo.
That's how it was with us.	Tako je bilo pri nas.
I wish you were there	Želim si, da si tam
I could hear him now	Zdaj sem ga lahko slišal
My child needs more than sorry.	Moj otrok potrebuje več kot žal.
He seemed to be doing nothing	Videti je bilo, da nič ne stori
Maybe it's not just money.	Mogoče ni samo denar.
But it's really nice.	Je pa res lepo.
I just didn't see how	Samo nisem videl kako
Or a week.	Ali teden dni.
No one came.	Nihče ni prišel.
We'll see.	Bomo videli.
I didn’t know it happened	Nisem vedel, da se je to zgodilo
I don't know now.	zdaj ne vem.
I won't see him again	Ne bom ga več videl
Except she wasn't alone.	Le da ni bila sama.
I'm glad to see you there	Vesel sem, da vas vidim tam
I certainly didn't expect that	Tega zagotovo nisem pričakoval
He was still sorry.	Še vedno mu je bilo žal.
We are lucky.	Imamo srečo.
And here we are.	In tukaj smo.
That hasn’t happened and a lot of people have had enough.	To se ni zgodilo in veliko ljudi ima dovolj.
That reason and that.	Ta razlog in to.
I really didn’t know either	Tudi jaz res nisem vedel
I decided not to say anything	Odločil sem se, da ne bom ničesar rekel
I still couldn't tell.	Še vedno nisem mogel povedati.
First time ever.	Prvič sploh.
No one got it.	Nihče ga ni dobil.
He will stay there.	Tam bo ostal.
I didn’t expect anything to happen	Nisem pričakoval, da se bo kaj zgodilo
I really don't know what.	res ne vem kaj.
I got even more in my room.	Še več sem dobil v svoji sobi.
But that's a good thing.	Vendar je to dobra stvar.
Everything we have.	Vse kar imamo.
I just wanted to know	Hotel sem samo vedeti
He told her as much.	Toliko ji je povedal.
I wonder if it is	Zanima me, če je
He did his job.	Opravil je svoje delo.
I'm surprised at you	Presenečen sem nad tabo
I didn’t know how to feel about it	Nisem vedela, kako naj se ob tem počutim
That's how it was.	Tako je, kot je bilo.
I thought he did it himself	Mislil sem, da je to naredil sam
I think he is a good person	Mislim, da je dobra oseba
Something is going wrong.	Nekaj ​​gre narobe.
I know you'll like it.	Vem, da ti bo všeč.
He says he's not sure.	Pravi, da ni prepričan.
I have something for you.	Nekaj ​​imam zate.
Now, what are we going to do about it?	Zdaj, kaj bomo storili glede tega?
I'm the one who should be.	Jaz sem tisti, ki bi moral.
I was surprised I didn't see you there	Bil sem presenečen, da te nisem videl tam
I told you everything can be bought	Povedal sem ti, da se da vse kupiti
I didn't think so.	Nisem mislil tako.
It's a simple job.	To je preprosto delo.
I knew this was going to happen sometimes	Vedel sem, da se bo to včasih zgodilo
And they did that thing.	In to stvar so naredili.
All in all, it was a game.	Vse skupaj je bila igra.
You would die.	Ti bi umrl.
I think you will feel better	Mislim, da se boš počutil bolje
I hope to go there again	Upam, da bom šel še enkrat tja
I was happy to see him feel better	Vesel sem bil, ko sem videl, da se počuti bolje
Only it wasn't true.	Le da ni bilo res.
I was there almost alone	Tam sem bil skoraj sam
I know you have to see her	Vem, da jo moraš videti
She was really good.	Bila je res dobra.
It was still hard.	Še vedno je bilo težko.
I love where he's going	Všeč mi je, kam gre
I actually wanted to go	Pravzaprav sem hotel iti
We'll see if he can do it.	Bomo videli, če mu bo to uspelo.
Or even that.	Ali pa tudi to.
I have to work on it	Moram delati na tem
I wish that were true	Želim si, da bi bilo to res
I need to see you right now	Moram te videti takoj
My dad absolutely loved her.	Moj oče jo je imel popolnoma rad.
I knew you would help me	Vedel sem, da mi boš pomagal
I think she's probably not the only one.	Mislim, da verjetno ni edina.
I've been expecting you before	Pričakoval sem te že prej
It was good for work.	Za delo je bilo dobro.
I didn’t want anything other than that at all	Sploh nisem hotel nič drugega kot to
More than a hotel, really.	Bolj kot hotel, res.
This is not really a problem.	To pravzaprav ni problem.
They seemed to be right.	Zdi se, da so imeli prav.
I'm going to do it.	Grem to narediti.
I can’t believe this happened	Ne morem verjeti, da se je to zgodilo
I went back to the room and said something	Vrnil sem se v sobo in nekaj rekel
Not so.	Ni tako.
I bought these for you	Te sem kupil za vas
That's how I'll have it.	Tako bom imel.
I only know this because my father told me	To vem samo zato, ker mi je rekel oče
I feel better now	Zdaj se počutim bolje
He really likes that.	To mu je res všeč.
I didn't know that at the time	Takrat tega nisem vedel
You will always love me.	Vedno me boš imel rad.
I don't know if he saw it.	Ne vem, če je videl.
Like you said.	Kot si rekel.
So he decided to do it.	Tako se je odločil za to.
No, that wasn't right.	Ne, to ni bilo prav.
Just a child.	Samo otrok.
I didn't make it here either	Tudi tukaj mi ni uspelo
This is not really the case.	To pravzaprav ni tako.
More than you will ever know.	Več kot boste kdaj vedeli.
And again, and again.	In spet, in spet.
Being good is not good enough.	Biti dober ni dovolj dober.
I didn't want to believe her	Nisem ji hotel verjeti
I already forgot that day	Na tisti dan sem že pozabil
I'd rather be me than any of you	Raje bi bil jaz kot kdo od vas
I want to move on.	želim naprej.

I lost her.	izgubil sem jo.
He couldn't say he knew.	Ni mogel povedati, da je vedel.
You know you would.	Saj veš, da bi.
I think he was just playing	Mislim, da se je samo igral
I wonder how they will know.	Sprašujem se, kako bodo vedeli.
I'd like to pay you back now.	Rad bi ti vrnil zdaj.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.	Žal ni tako.
I hope they are really good	Upam, da so res dobro
Not like us.	Ne kot mi.
We're pretty sure you will.	Popolnoma smo prepričani, da boste.
I think there will be more	Mislim, da bo še več
He is not.	On ni.
When, why and how to do it.	Kdaj, zakaj in kako to storiti.
He was good at that too.	Tudi v tem je bil dober.
It was good right away.	Takoj je bilo dobro.
I could do anything I wanted.	Lahko bi naredil vse, kar bi hotel.
I just wanted to leave	Hotel sem samo oditi
I would wait for her.	jaz bi jo čakal.
He didn't expect to see me here.	Ni pričakoval, da me bo videl tukaj.
There were a few.	Nekaj ​​jih je bilo.
I was ready for that.	Na to sem bil pripravljen.
He is happy now.	Zdaj je vesel.
It's not him.	To ni on.
I'm so scared.	tako se bojim.
I just didn’t know who to ask.	Samo nisem vedel, koga bi vprašal.
I'm sure he'll want to talk to you	Prepričan sem, da bo želel govoriti s tabo
Better every day.	Vsak dan boljši.
I have nothing to say	nimam ničesar za povedati
We know they are there.	Vemo, da so tam.
There is nothing a man can do wrong right now.	Človek trenutno ne more narediti nič narobe.
I know that for sure	To zagotovo vem
So much for being alone.	Toliko o tem, da si sam.
I hope any of us can	Upam, da lahko kdo od nas
I'm really interested now.	Zdaj me res zanima.
Which we have now.	Kar imamo zdaj.

Nobody did anything.	Nihče ni nič naredil.
I find that hard to believe	To težko verjamem
I wanted something more	Želel sem nekaj več

He's not here now.	Zdaj ga ni.
I still have to do my part	Svoje moram še narediti
It's just for a while.	To je samo za nekaj časa.
I haven't met him yet	Nisem ga še srečal
I wanted more.	Hotel sem več.
If you meant it.	Če si to mislil.
You never liked it here.	Tukaj ti nikoli ni bilo všeč.

Why are we .	Zakaj smo .
And so it is.	In tako je.
He needs me to do it.	Potrebuje me, da to storim.
How could it be.	Kako bi lahko bilo.
Either way was good enough.	Vsak način je bil dovolj dober.
It really helps.	To res pomaga.
I want him to come home.	Želim, da pride domov.
It was much more than that.	Bilo je veliko več kot to.
I was even more tired now	Zdaj sem bil še bolj utrujen
I saw her this morning	Videl sem jo zjutraj
But I'm interested in what's going on	Me pa zanima kaj se dogaja
He didn't tell her anything.	Ničesar ji ni povedal.
In fact, she probably didn't know who he was.	Pravzaprav verjetno ni vedela, kdo je.
I've met them before	Spoznal sem jih že prej
And it didn't work.	In ni uspelo.
Now I really need to know everything	Zdaj moram res vse vedeti
I'm really sorry about that	Res mi je žal za to
Never seen before.	Še nikoli videl.
I could leave it.	Lahko bi ga pustil.
But I know someone who has	Poznam pa nekoga, ki ima
I have a question for you.	Imam vprašanje zate.
Obviously that wasn't right for you.	Očitno vam to ni bilo prav.
I would never have enough of her.	Nikoli je ne bi imel dovolj.
But he hasn't even found it yet.	A niti našel ga še ni.
I don't think that's likely.	Mislim, da ni verjetno.
I have a reason for that	Imam razlog za to
It's nothing.	Nič ni.
I believe this will be for a long time to come	Verjamem, da bo to še dolgo
But she knew.	Vedela pa je.
For a long time no one could speak.	Dolgo časa nihče ni mogel govoriti.
I think he was expecting you	Mislim, da te je pričakoval
I would give anything to feel that way.	Vse bi dal, da bi se tako počutil.
Just like now.	Tako kot zdaj.
I will never forget you	nikoli te ne bom pozabil
I think like this never happened	Mislim, kot da se to nikoli ni zgodilo
But I didn't do anything	Nič pa nisem storil
We would see, for sure.	Videli bi, zagotovo.
You do your thing.	Ti naredi svoje.
But surely it will.	Zagotovo pa bo.
That's what I wanted to tell you	To sem ti hotel povedati
I will do anything for you.	Vse bom naredil zate.
I know how much you always wanted to go there	Vem, kako zelo si si vedno želel iti tja
I didn't expect that at all	Tega sploh nisem pričakoval
I thought she was doing so well	Mislil sem, da ji gre tako dobro
This is no longer the case.	To ni več tako.
I will not do that	Tega ne bom storil
I wish you were here with me now	Želim si, da bi bila zdaj tukaj z mano
This is really good.	To je res dobro.
That didn't work either.	Tudi to ni uspelo.
It will never be enough.	To nikoli ne bo dovolj.
I want to do it right	To želim narediti prav
He needed this car.	Potreboval je ta avto.
He has a house.	Ima hišo.
I wish they were	Raje bi imel, da so
It really wasn’t work.	Res ni bilo delo.
I think maybe I could do with it	Mislim, da bi morda lahko naredil s tem
I shouldn't believe him	Ne bi mu smel verjeti
And boy did he know what it was.	In fant je vedel, kaj je to.
I worked well on that	Dobro sem se delal na tem
Maybe, maybe not.	Mogoče, morda ne.
It was hard work.	Bilo je težko delo.
I made people my own	Ljudi sem naredil za svoje
I want to talk to you.	Rad bi govoril s tabo.
You won.	Zmagal si.
I was right, you know	Imel sem prav, veš
I have to go to work	Moram na delo
If you want me.	Če me želiš.
I'm so glad to be here	Tako sem vesel, da sem tukaj
And this in the morning.	In to zjutraj.
He said no.	Rekel je, da ni.
I wanted to come here	Hotel sem priti sem
I wonder how he did it	Sprašujem se, kako mu je uspelo
I didn't even know you were here	Sploh nisem vedel, da si tukaj
You're like me.	Ti si kot jaz.
He died so quickly.	Tako hitro je umrl.
There's something about it.	Nekaj ​​je na tem.
Or not at all, he wasn’t.	Ali pa pravzaprav ne, ni bil.
I didn't want him either	Tudi jaz ga nisem želela
I would go home.	jaz bi šel domov.
I know it's not right	Vem, da ni prav
He is everything.	On je vse.
I have to do something	nekaj moram narediti
It's just wrong.	Samo narobe je.
You know that yourself.	To veš tudi sam.
I pretty much already know what's going on	Precej že vem, kaj se dogaja
I really know that	To res vem
I hope this works out	Upam, da bo to uspelo
It's all it could be.	To je vse, kar bi lahko bilo.
The next day he left for.	Naslednji dan je odšel za.
Or is it all.	Ali pa je vse.
I have a job and so do you	Jaz imam delo in tudi ti
A lot of money.	Veliko denarja.
It really doesn't make me feel any better.	Zaradi tega se res ne počutim bolje.
I think that's it now.	Mislim, da je to zdaj to.
And he's there.	In on je tam.
As really, now.	Kot res, zdaj.
I have to be in place	Moram biti na mestu
I just thought I would ask	Samo mislil sem, da bi vprašal
I found.	Našel sem.
That would be too much.	To bi bilo preveč.
I was just so angry	Tako preprosto sem bil jezen
That's my business.	To je moja stvar.
I don't mean anything by that.	Nič ne mislim s tem.
I feel better right away	Takoj se počutim bolje
Oh my, a lot of things are going on here.	O moj, veliko stvari se dogaja tukaj.
I was alone then	Takrat sem bil sam
I think that's all you have to do	Mislim, da je to vse, kar moraš storiti
I may not have time to do that tomorrow	Jutri morda ne bom imel časa, da bi to naredil
I have to do that soon	To moram kmalu narediti
Maybe he went out somewhere and came back.	Mogoče je šel kam ven in se vrnil.
There was nothing I could do about it.	Nič ne bi mogel storiti glede tega.
This was not life.	To ni bilo življenje.
I wouldn't have made it without you	Brez tebe mi ne bi uspelo
I told you it would.	Rekel sem ti, da bo.
We should do something more.	Morali bi narediti nekaj več.
I never put anything there	Nikoli nisem ničesar dal tja
I have someone right away.	Takoj imam nekoga.
It was really hard	Bilo je res težko
This is quite difficult.	To je precej težko.
he asked.	je vprašal.
Not so here.	Tukaj ni tako.
I'm a little better.	malo bolje sem.
I have to do something	Moram nekaj narediti
Everyone had a good time.	Vsi so se imeli lepo.
I'm not there right now.	Trenutno me ni tam.
I just couldn’t tell her	Preprosto ji nisem mogel povedati
Maybe he was really sorry for what he did.	Morda mu je bilo res žal za to, kar je storil.
I didn't know it was him	Nisem vedel, da je on
I don't know what else to say	Ne vem kaj drugega za povedati
He felt good now.	Zdaj se je počutil dobro.
You should see him.	Moral bi ga videti.
I think so.	Mislim, da je tako.
He's here with me now.	Zdaj je tukaj z mano.
There was no need to stay.	Ni bilo treba ostati.
I think I would have.	Mislim, da bi ga imel.
I want to make sure they're okay	Želim se prepričati, da so v redu
I would see what can be done.	Videl bi, kaj se da narediti.
You are nothing to me.	Ti zame nisi nič.
Until then, all is well.	Do takrat je vse dobro.
I heard you for the first time	Prvič sem te slišal
I told you about that	O tem sem ti povedal
No one knows who this is.	Nihče ne ve, kdo je to.
He can't do without me.	Ne more brez mene.
That's much better.	To je veliko bolje.
That's how it seemed to me.	Tako se mi je zdelo.
I knew right away.	Takoj sem vedel.
I'm sure it's about the money.	Prepričan sem, da gre za denar.
I almost didn't see him	Skoraj ga nisem videl
You've never been before.	Nikoli prej nisi bil.
But for me.	Ali zame.
It was hard, very hard.	To je bilo težko, zelo težko.
I'm sure you're right about this job.	Prepričan sem, da imaš prav glede tega dela.
And they didn't do that.	In tega niso storili.
But he was fine.	Vendar je bil v redu.
It's not that simple.	Ni tako preprosto.
I think he would let me do that if he had it.	Mislim, da bi mi to dovolil, če bi ga imel.
However, nothing had to be done.	Vendar ni bilo treba storiti ničesar.
And there are more and more of us.	In vedno več nas je.
You're the right man for the job.	Ti si pravi človek za to delo.
But he never worked more than he had to.	A nikoli ni delal več, kot je moral.
We didn't do any of that.	Nič od tega nismo storili.
I want to help you with that.	Želim ti pomagati pri tem.
You never saw anything.	Nikoli nisi videl ničesar.
I'm here.	tukaj sem.
It was quick work.	Bilo je hitro delo.
I should tell you everything	Moral bi ti vse povedati
I can't do that.	Ne morem storiti tega.
I said no and he went out again	Rekel sem, da nisi in je spet šel ven
We already knew that.	To smo že vedeli.
Someone must have left it here.	Nekdo ga je verjetno pustil tukaj.
I don't know what he needs.	Ne vem, kaj potrebuje.
I told you about that once	O tem sem ti že enkrat povedal
He was not prepared for that.	Na to ni bil pripravljen.
I would give anything to make it so	Vse bi dal, da bi bilo tako
It might not be a car.	Morda ni avto.
I did it for you	To sem naredil zate
He also won.	Zmagal je tudi.
I should say a lot of things	Moral bi povedati veliko stvari
There's nothing I can do about it.	Glede tega ne morem nič.
They are both no longer with us.	Oba nista več z nami.
I knew you would do it	Vedel sem, da boš to naredil
I was too busy or too tired	Bil sem preveč zaposlen ali preveč utrujen
I will not say anything.	ne bom rekel ničesar.
You saw me do that.	Videli ste me, da to počnem.
I knew you'd say that	Vedel sem, da boš to rekel
I didn't know how to leave	Nisem vedel, kako oditi
Next to him.	Do njega.
Better there than here.	Bolje tam kot tukaj.
I wasn’t sure what to do with it	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj naj s tem
I don't know what.	ne vem kaj.
I didn't even want to go	Niti nisem hotel iti
And she herself was not well.	A sama ni bila dobro.
You should do more	Moral bi narediti več
He doesn't.	On ne.
I want to see that again	To želim še enkrat videti
They were alone.	Bila sta sama.
There weren't many people.	Ni bilo veliko ljudi.
I couldn't do anything.	Nič nisem mogel storiti.
I do it myself.	To počnem sam.
He had nothing to do with it.	S tem ni imel nič.
It was more him than you.	Bil je bolj on kot ti.
He just died.	Pravkar je umrl.
I never have to see him again	Nikoli več ga ne moram videti
But it didn’t seem to be.	A zdelo se je, da ni.
You should be there	Moral bi biti tam
I think it was wrong.	Mislim, da je bilo narobe.
We didn’t know much about what happened.	Nismo vedeli veliko o tem, kaj se je zgodilo.
I believe this happened to you	Verjamem, da se ti je to zgodilo
I can't do it alone.	Sama ne morem.
It wasn't good.	Ni bilo dobro.
We will do that.	To bomo storili.
Neither of us said anything.	Nihče od nas ni rekel ničesar.
I was right he didn't come	Prav sem imel, da ni prišel
And she loved it.	In všeč ji je bilo.
I will not say anything	nič ne bom povedal
That is, .	To je, .
It wasn't that hard for someone like him.	Za nekoga, kot je on, ni bilo tako težko.
It simply isn't.	Preprosto ni.
I knew all along	Ves čas sem vedel
That's right.	Tako je.
I want to and I like it.	Želim si in mi je všeč.
Neither does he.	Tudi on ne.
What he had.	Kar je imel.
But he did better than that.	Vendar mu je uspelo bolje kot to.
Maybe someday you will.	Mogoče boš nekoč.
I don't know anything about that.	Ne vem nič o tem.
Where did you find them?!.	Kje si jih našel?!.
I let him do it.	Dovolil sem mu, da to naredi.
You should both know that.	To bi morala oba vedeti.
There was certainly nothing wrong with that.	Zagotovo s tem ni bilo nič narobe.
Maybe it's me.	Morda sem jaz.
I know he's getting better	Vem, da mu gre na bolje
I also have a few things	Imam tudi nekaj stvari
That's more than enough.	To je več kot dovolj.
No one said it would be easy.	Nihče ni rekel, da bo lahko.
I have no doubt about that.	O tem ne dvomim.
I meant well.	Dobro sem mislil.
I saw and I did not see	Videl sem in nisem videl
There was no one there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar.
I mean, what we did last night	Mislim na to, kar smo storili sinoči
You really should.	Res bi moral.
And that was fine with me.	In to mi je bilo v redu.
I wish I could see them.	Želim si, da bi jih videl.
It exists and it is difficult.	Obstaja in je težko.
I almost forgot about it	Na to sem skoraj pozabil
I asked him why he was there	Vprašal sem ga, zakaj je tam
You can’t see things simply.	Ne moreš videti stvari preprosto.
I just got a job there	Pravkar sem dobil službo tam
Or something will go wrong.	Ali pa bo nekaj narobe.
I think you have to leave	Mislim, da moraš oditi
They were together again.	Spet sta bila skupaj.
I knew this was my chance.	Vedel sem, da je to moja priložnost.
I have met several of them myself.	Sam sem jih srečal več.
You will not see us.	Ne boste nas videli.
This is not my father.	To ni moj oče.
I was sorry to see it go	Žal mi je bilo videti, da gre
Your problem.	Tvoj problem.
I knew it was going to happen	Vedel sem, da se bo to zgodilo
I had to do it and it just happened	Moral sem to narediti in pravkar se je zgodilo
I could see that too	Tudi to sem lahko videl
I need something more than that	Potrebujem nekaj več kot to
For me, he was my child, my child.	Zame je bil moj otrok, moj otrok.
You know you would.	Veš, da bi.
I just haven't met that yet	Samo tega še nisem srečal
Just tell us where it is.	Samo povej nam, kje je.
I really needed a car	Zelo sem potreboval avto
I didn't want to tell you that now.	Nisem ti hotel tega povedati zdaj.
Yes, we do.	Da, imamo.
He had her.	Imel jo je.
I thought you might be the problem	Mislil sem, da si morda problem
I don't know what.	Ne vem kaj.
He just has to.	Samo mora.

I believe that everything is as it should be	Verjamem, da je vse tako, kot mora biti
I understand more than you think	Razumem več, kot si mislite
I'm not going to do that here	Tukaj tega ne bom storil
When it worked.	Ko je uspelo.
It was nice.	Bilo je lepo.
I taught him to speak	Naučil sem ga govoriti
I'll be there soon.	Kmalu bom tam.
That seems right.	To se zdi prav.
I thought you already knew that	Mislil sem, da to že veš
Just not so little.	Samo ne tako malo.
It really is that simple.	Res je tako preprosto.
No more problems.	Ni več problem.
I didn’t like it, but I should have	Ni mi bilo všeč, vendar bi bilo treba
It was hard to see.	Težko je bilo videti.
Maybe that was good.	Mogoče je bilo to dobro.
But he probably doesn't have to say anything.	Verjetno pa mu ni treba ničesar povedati.
It's really nice.	Res je lepo.
He didn't really have one.	Pravzaprav ni imel.
He asked.	Je vprašal.
I know you know better than that.	Vem, da veš bolje od tega.
Always so good.	Vedno tako dobro.
He wasn't here.	Ni ga bilo tukaj.

I hope it worked out	Upam, da je uspelo

I knew something was going on	Vedel sem, da se nekaj dogaja
I just heard what he was thinking	Pravkar sem slišal, kaj si misli

I know it’s more than that for me	Vem, da je zame več kot to

I almost thought it was him	Skoraj sem mislil, da si on
I could get help now	Zdaj bi lahko dobil pomoč

I was so tired.	Tako sem bil utrujen.
As he says.	Kot pravi.
I wanted to see him myself	Sam sem ga hotel videti

I wanted to believe.	Hotel sem verjeti.
That could be it.	To bi lahko bilo to.
And we succeeded.	In uspelo nam je.

He never knew anything else.	Nikoli ni vedel ničesar drugega.
I couldn't help myself anymore	Nisem si mogel več pomagati
I'm afraid you did something wrong.	Bojim se, da si naredil kaj narobe.
I think it will be fine	Mislim, da bo v redu
Now that seems to be true.	Zdaj se zdi, da je to res.

A good man and a good father	Dober človek in dober oče
There's a lot going on.	Dogaja se kar veliko.
I didn't want to see you back.	Nisem te hotel videti nazaj.
You will have them all.	Imeli jih boste vse.
This usually goes very, very wrong.	To gre običajno zelo, zelo narobe.
I will not eat them	Ne bom jih jedel
It wasn't me anymore.	Nisem bil več jaz.
Because it wasn't hard enough before.	Ker prej ni bilo dovolj težko.
And you're back.	In vrnil si se.
I knew what he was going to say	Vedel sem, kaj bo rekel
You tried to help.	Poskušal si pomagati.
Now I see everything	Zdaj vidim vse

All you have to do is want it.	Vse kar moraš storiti je, da si to želiš.
He doesn't care about money.	Ne zanima ga denar.
And there's a good reason.	In obstaja dober razlog.

There would be nothing.	Nič ne bi bilo.
They are enough.	Dovolj so.

And they did.	In so to storili.
She wanted to know why.	Želela je vedeti zakaj.
And he worked with me to make it even better.	In delal je z mano, da bi bilo še bolje.
I could call her.	Lahko bi jo poklical.
And he couldn't help it.	In ni mogel pomagati.
And that's a good thing.	In to je dobra stvar.
Fast forward almost three years.	Hitro naprej skoraj tri leta.
I thought you would know.	Mislil sem, da boš vedel.
I knew he would be gone soon	Vedel sem, da bo kmalu odšel
I’m so tired of doing this	Tako sem utrujen od tega, da bi to uspelo

The problem is something else.	Problem je nekaj drugega.
Yes, much more.	Je, veliko več.
And that's life.	In to je življenje.
Maybe I'm not ready	Mogoče nisem pripravljen
No one can ever know.	Nihče nikoli ne more vedeti.
She says she didn't do it.	Pravi, da tega ni storila.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.

I hope everyone is well at home	Upam, da so vsi doma dobro

He said it was wrong.	Rekel je, da ni prav.
That was a lot of work	To je bilo veliko dela

But now I couldn’t do that	Zdaj pa tega nisem mogel storiti
This was not easy either.	Tudi to ni bilo lahko.
I think I really know someone	Mislim, da res poznam nekoga
And sometimes it seemed to be true.	In včasih se je zdelo, da je res.
I didn’t see much after that	Po tem nisem veliko videl
Good friend.	Dober prijatelj.
I hadn’t seen anyone do that yet, so I did.	Nisem še videl, da bi kdo to naredil, zato sem to storil.
I didn't call him back.	Nisem ga poklical nazaj.
That's why we're here.	Zato smo tukaj.
That's a boy.	To je fant.
I thought it was you	Mislil sem, da si ti
And there was something else.	In še nekaj je bilo.
He has nothing to do with it.	On nima nič s tem.
I couldn't do that to you	Tega ti ne bi mogel storiti
Is that even possible.	Ali je to sploh mogoče.
I probably could.	Verjetno bi lahko.
I would stay here again	Spet bi ostal tukaj
It felt like home.	Zdelo se je kot doma.
I let you have three	Dovolil sem ti, da imaš tri
Not that it was so early.	Saj ne, da je bilo tako zgodaj.

I didn't decide	Nisem se odločil
Can anyone help me.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga.
This is being done.	To se dela.
He saw.	On je videl.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
It will.	Bo.
This is very serious.	To je zelo resno.
What was there for.	Kaj je bilo tam za.
It was obvious what was happening now.	Bilo je očitno, kaj se zdaj dogaja.
I actually wanted to tell him that	Pravzaprav sem mu želel to povedati
He couldn't help me.	Ni mi mogel pomagati.
There could be more.	Lahko bi bilo več.
it's true.	res je.
He was not the only one.	Ni bil edini.
I can't tell her what he did	Ne morem ji povedati, kaj je naredil
I had to tell you that	To sem ti moral povedati
We did nothing.	Nič nismo storili.
I wouldn't do that, I couldn't.	Tega ne bi, ne bi mogel.
It's not possible.	Ni mogoče.
I had no money	Nisem imel denarja
Now I don’t see anything more we could do	Zdaj ne vidim ničesar več, kar bi lahko naredili

I hope we see some people	Upam, da bomo videli nekaj ljudi
I was so glad to see you	Tako sem bil vesel, da sem te videl

I knew my father would come	Vedel sem, da bo prišel oče
I believe in that myself.	Sam verjamem v to.
I shouldn't have known that	Tega naj ne bi vedel
I asked if something was wrong	Vprašal sem, če je kaj narobe
I don't know anything.	nič ne vem.
I no longer know if this is true or not	Ne vem več ali je to res ali ne
Because you were there.	Ker si bil tam.
And that's exactly what's happening.	In prav to se dogaja.
I still saw little	Še vedno sem malo videl
In fact, it is.	Pravzaprav je.
I knew it was going to happen	Vedel sem, da se bo to zgodilo
I was trying to help you	Poskušal sem ti pomagati
I would go on.	jaz bi šel naprej.
There is nothing better you can do.	Ne moreš narediti nič bolje.
She didn't know when that would be.	Kdaj bo to, ni vedela.
Nobody knows him.	Nihče ga ne pozna.
It's also good.	Prav tako je dobro.
Those who don't.	Tisti, ki ne.
It was the reason we were together.	Bil je razlog, da sva bila skupaj.
They've all had enough.	Vsi so imeli dovolj.
Maybe something else.	Mogoče kaj drugega.
And here it is, man.	In tukaj je, človek.
But I helped her	Vendar sem ji pomagal
I mean, he didn't even ask anyone for help	Mislim, niti nikogar ni prosil za pomoč
They knew where we were going and what to do about it.	Vedeli so, kje bomo in kaj storiti glede tega.
I didn't tell him anything.	Nič mu rekel.
I haven't seen him in years	Nisem ga videl že leta
I hope you succeed	Upam, da ti bo uspelo

She didn't know.	Ni vedela.
You will have to move on.	Morali boste iti naprej.
I will do this for you if you want	To bom naredil za vas, če želite

I feel good.	Dobro se počutim.
You should see that	To bi moral videti
I had to tell her more	Moral sem ji povedati več
I did the right thing	Naredil sem prav
He never asked again.	Nikoli več ni vprašal.
How much work would that be.	Koliko dela bi bilo to.
I wanted to be your father	Hotel sem ti biti oče
If I could be here with you, you know I would.	Če bi lahko bil tukaj s tabo, veš, da bi bil.
I can't do that, you know.	Tega ne morem, veš.
Why didn't you go to dinner? 	Zakaj nisi šel na večerjo?
he asked me.	me je vprašal.
This is not the case here.	Tukaj ni tako.
I could ask for you	Lahko bi vprašal zate
And it was much better	A je bilo veliko bolje
And this is very very serious.	In to je zelo zelo resno.
I told her she didn't need it.	Rekel sem ji, da tega ne potrebuje.
And that's okay.	In to je v redu.
I think she'll like it	Mislim, da ji bo to všeč
I came.	Prišel sem.
You will have a really good time.	Imeli se boste res dobro.

I always wanted to do that	Vedno sem si želel, da bi to storili
I want to know how this happened	Želim vedeti, kako se je to zgodilo

I think that's why	Mislim, da je bil zato
I have something to say	imam nekaj za povedati

I used to be you	Nekoč sem bil ti
I wouldn't work with you anymore, not for nothing	Ne bi več delal s tabo, ne za nič
I want to win that	To bi rad zmagal
He would like that.	To bi mu bilo všeč.
Anything was possible.	Vse je bilo mogoče.
But it is going well.	Vendar gre dobro.
I didn’t know how to tell her what was wrong	Nisem vedel, kako ji povedati, kaj je narobe
It wasn't enough now.	Zdaj ni bilo dovolj.
Boy, he was right.	Fant, je imel prav.
I haven't gotten this before	Tega prej nisem dobil
I think we would succeed	Mislim, da bi nam uspelo
He doesn't want to.	Ne želi.
I had never left home before	Nikoli prej nisem odšel od doma
Not everyone.	Niso vsi.
In the city.	V mestu.
I think you should go with me.	Mislim, da bi moral iti z mano.
I knew that was true.	Vedel sem, da je to res.
I know that in.	To vem v.
It wouldn't be enough for him now.	Zdaj mu ne bi bilo dovolj.
You should do it.	Moral bi narediti.
I was surprised to see that.	Bil sem presenečen, ko sem to videl.
And he's probably right.	In verjetno ima prav.

More kids, more people.	Več otrok, več ljudi.
I wasn’t ready for that	Nisem bil pripravljen na to
She knew he would never return.	Vedela je, da se ne bo nikoli vrnil.

I think you may be right	Mislim, da imaš morda prav

Fine.	V redu.
I know what seems wrong with that	Vem, kaj se zdi narobe s tem
I don't think they're right for me.	Mislim, da niso pravi zame.
I've always loved them myself.	Sam sem jih imel vedno rad.
That was more than enough for now.	Za zdaj je bilo to več kot dovolj.
I feel like a child again	Spet se počutim kot otrok
No, no one at all.	Ne, prav nihče.
I thought I would like to do it myself.	Mislil sem, da bi to želel narediti sam.
He didn't want to see anything more.	Nič več ni hotel videti.
Tell me how you are.	Povej mi kako si.
I think there could be more here as well	Mislim, da bi lahko bilo tudi tukaj več
It happened so fast.	Tako hitro se je zgodilo.
Everyone could see that	To je lahko videl vsak

He was very surprised.	Bil je zelo presenečen.
I forgot who bought them.	Pozabil sem, kdo jih je kupil.
I've been trying it for years.	Poskušal sem ga leta.
I believe I would help you if I met him	Verjamem, da bi ti pomagal, če bi ga srečal
It's just us.	Samo mi smo.
This one is much better.	Ta je veliko boljši.

You were there.	Bil si tam.
I wonder how he's doing	Zanima me, kako mu gre

It's hard these days.	Težko je te dni.
Not even a little.	Niti malo.

Or he tried.	Ali pa je poskušal.
That's what I wanted to tell you	To sem ti želel povedati
I want to see her.	Želim jo videti.

I know how to get out	Vem, kako priti ven
I just want to know what happened	Želim samo vedeti, kaj se je zgodilo

He didn't think it was right.	Ni se mu zdelo prav.
I didn't come here because of you	Nisem prišel sem zaradi tebe
I could hardly hear them myself.	Sam sem jih težko slišal.

I know this is hard to believe	Vem, da je to težko verjeti
I have enough time.	Imam dovolj časa.
I didn’t have anyone to help me either	Tudi jaz nisem imel nikogar, ki bi mi pomagal
I will tell you that it is difficult	Povedal vam bom, da je težko
We're always fine no matter what.	Vedno smo v redu, ne glede na vse.
I never saw him either	Tudi jaz ga nisem nikoli videl
I probably should have earlier, because I know who he is	Verjetno bi moral že prej, saj vem, kdo je
Quick, please.	Hitro, prosim.
And that doesn't help either.	In tudi to ni v pomoč.
It really is necessary.	Res je treba.
I liked her very much	Bila mi je zelo všeč

This is often not the case.	Pogosto ni tako.
I wouldn't want to know.	Ne bi hotel vedeti.
Not now, never.	Ne zdaj, nikoli.
And whoever wants it more will get it.	In tisti, ki si to bolj želi, jo bo dobil.
I didn't want to see him	Nisem ga hotel videti
please	prosim
I suspect you never did	Sumim, da nikoli nisi

Now it's true.	Zdaj je res.
I've never heard of it.	Še nikoli nisem slišal za to.

I wasn’t the only one who didn’t like her	Nisem bil edini, ki ji ni bila všeč

I'm sure he doesn't mean anything by that	Prepričan sem, da s tem ne misli nič
And soon there is.	In kmalu obstaja.
I saw it too.	Tudi jaz sem videl.
It was him.	To je bil on.
It has to be more than that.	Mora biti več kot to.
And sometimes it can be.	In včasih je lahko.
I still don't know.	še vedno ne vem.
They may never be.	Morda nikoli ne bodo.
You don't know what to do next.	Ne veste, kaj storiti naprej.

I'm afraid he won't be the only one	Bojim se, da ne bo edini

He knows where you are.	Ve, kje si.
I went to a little party.	Šel sem malo na zabavo.
Maybe not.	Morda ne.
I learned what you were doing	Naučil sem se, kaj si počel

I just wanted to know where he was	Hotel sem samo vedeti, kje je
I thought you'd like it	Mislil sem, da ti bo všeč

I have to get to him	Moram priti do njega
It doesn't help her much, even when she's here.	Ni ji v veliko pomoč, tudi ko je tukaj.
I could give her everything	Lahko bi ji dal vse

Is there anything that can be done about it.	Ali je mogoče kaj storiti glede tega.
I think she's sorry for me	Mislim, da ji je žal zame
I just wish I could leave	Samo želim si, da bi odšel
I can't stay here anymore.	Ne morem več ostati tukaj.
He didn't tell me.	Ni mi povedal.
I wasn't even sure why	Sploh nisem bil prepričan zakaj
I did things my way	Stvari sem naredil na svoj način

I had too many.	Imel sem jih preveč.
I believe there is always something to be done	Verjamem, da je vedno treba nekaj delati

I hope we see more of this from him.	Upam, da bomo od njega videli več takega.
I should know better than that now	Zdaj bi moral vedeti bolje od tega
He didn't tell me anything.	Nič mi ni rekel.
I couldn't help it.	S tem si nisem mogel pomagati.
I had someone who did all these things	Imel sem nekoga, ki je delal vse te stvari
But I didn't speak	Nisem pa govoril
Everyone should.	Vsi bi morali.
That's when I wanted to tell you	Takrat sem ti hotel povedati
That was last week.	To je bilo prejšnji teden.
I almost wish he wasn't there	Skoraj bi si želel, da ga ni
You should have done it sooner	Moral bi že prej
There was very little time.	Časa je bilo zelo malo.
He just has stuff.	Samo ima stvari.
I just needed a little more time	Potreboval sem le malo več časa
I won't try to see you	Ne bom te poskušal videti
Maybe I'm just going home	Mogoče grem samo domov
You know what it's like.	Saj veš kako je to.
She didn't do that either.	Tudi tega ni storila.
That should be it.	To naj bo to.
Never.	Nikoli ne.
It would be nice	Bilo bi lepo
I actually realized that myself	To sem pravzaprav spoznal sam

I've never heard of it	Nikoli nisem slišal za to
I will work.	Bom delal.
I couldn't see anything at all	Sploh nisem mogel ničesar videti
Except it's not.	Le da ni.
He didn't tell me anything.	Nič mi ni rekel.
Unfortunately, this was not the case.	Žal temu ni bilo tako.
He won't be there now.	Zdaj ga ne bo.
I didn't think she knew him at all	Nisem si mislil, da ga sploh pozna
I wanted what he wanted	Hotel sem, kar je hotel on
He was lucky.	Imel je srečo.
Nothing really happened there.	Tam se res nič ni zgodilo.
I could tell she knew it wasn't going to happen.	Lahko bi rekel, da je vedela, da se to ne bo zgodilo.
Which would be.	Kar bi bilo.
I think he's right.	Mislim, da ima prav.
I just wanted to leave	Hotel sem samo oditi
I didn’t expect everyone to already know about it	Nisem pričakoval, da bodo vsi že vedeli za to
He was always fine.	Vedno je bil v redu.
I can't be.	Ne morem biti.
I wouldn’t even know what it’s like	Sploh ne bi vedel, kako je to
She wasn't there at all.	Sploh je ni bilo.
You should stay	Moral bi ostati
I can't even be your friend now.	Zdaj ne morem biti niti tvoj prijatelj.
I'll tell her that tonight, too	To ji bom povedal tudi nocoj
He saw something.	Nekaj ​​je videl.
I knew that then	To sem takrat vedel
I am completely with you	Popolnoma sem s tabo
And that was it.	In to je bilo to.
I know how it is.	Vem kako je.
He did what he had to.	Naredil je, kar je moral.
They were there last night.	Sinoči so bili tam.
I will go for you	šel bom namesto tebe
It can't be that way.	Ne more biti tako.
I haven't seen or heard him in years	Že leta ga nisem videl ali slišal
I wanted to do things right	Hotel sem narediti stvari prav
It really happened.	Res se je zgodilo.
I can't believe it's you	Ne morem verjeti, da si to ti
Did nothing, really.	Naredil nič, res.
I knew right away what it was	Takoj sem vedel, kaj je
It certainly wasn't always this way.	Zagotovo ni bilo vedno tako.
You will move on.	Boš šel naprej.
Without being able to ask.	Ne da bi lahko vprašal.
That way he could win.	Tako bi lahko zmagal.
I couldn't be more angry	Nisem mogel biti več jezen
It may seem fine.	Morda se zdi v redu.
I would have heard of it if I had	Slišal bi za to, če bi
He was lucky.	Imel je srečo.
I can't believe you did that	Ne morem verjeti, da si to naredil
I think you're human	Mislim, da si človek
I never knew about it	Nikoli nisem vedel za to
I didn't need help for that	Za to nisem potreboval pomoči
It's not right, it's not right.	To ni prav, to ni prav.
He doesn't like them.	Ne mara jih.
I would tell you so	Tako bi ti rekel
Very good day.	Zelo dober dan.
That was happy.	To je bil vesel.
And also a good thing.	In tudi dobra stvar.
And there is so much to talk about.	In toliko je za govoriti.
As it was.	Kot je bilo.
I could do without it.	Lahko bi naredil brez tega.
He was alone now.	Zdaj je bil sam.
I said, no, not anymore.	Rekel sem, ne, ne več.
I thought you saw that	Mislil sem, da si to videl
I understand why he says that.	Razumem, zakaj to pravi.
I haven't met anyone here yet	Tukaj še nisem srečal nikogar
I didn't expect it.	Nisem pričakoval.
We still have it.	Še vedno ga imamo.
Actually a lot like you	Pravzaprav veliko kot ti
He said so too.	Tudi on je tako rekel.
He certainly meant it.	Zagotovo je to mislil.
I'm ready to move on	Pripravljen sem iti naprej
It is that, but it is also more.	Je to, a je tudi več.
I said too much in front of him	Preveč sem rekel pred njim
I got there early.	Tja sem prišel zgodaj.
So he was able to find it.	Zato ga je lahko našel.
That's what I was trying to tell you	To sem ti poskušal povedati
I still didn’t like them any more	Še vedno mi niso bili nič bolj všeč
You're going to have to help me here.	Tukaj mi boš moral pomagati.
We were always together.	Vedno sva bila skupaj.
I could see that.	To sem lahko videl.
I never wanted to see him again	Nikoli več ga nisem hotel videti
I don't think there is anything more to say	Mislim, da ni treba ničesar več povedati
I didn't start working with you for the money	Nisem začel delati s tabo zaradi denarja
I never wanted anything more.	Nikoli si nisem želel ničesar več.
They are alive.	Živi so.
I think we should stay here if we can	Mislim, da bi morali ostati tukaj, če lahko
How to speak.	Kako govoriti.
I want to see what he can do	Želim videti, kaj lahko naredi
I always thought it was just me	Vedno sem mislil, da sem samo jaz
How good it is to be human.	Kako dobro je biti človek.
He had no regrets.	Nič mu ni bilo žal.
I don't know if he knew that.	Ne vem, če je to vedel.
I had to be the only one	Moral sem biti edini
But I need something more than that.	Potrebujem pa še nekaj več od tega.
I want to tell what happened.	Želim povedati, kaj se je zgodilo.
I know this is hard for you	Vem, da ti je to težko
I was not.	Nisem bil.
I can see that now.	To zdaj vidim.
I told him everything.	Povedal sem mu vse.
I can't do this anymore.	Tega ne morem več.
He couldn't speak.	Ni mogel govoriti.
I went to him	Šla sem do njega
I'll tell her what you said.	Povedal ji bom, kar si rekel.
I just can't believe it	To preprosto ne morem verjeti
I think we all did a little	Mislim, da smo vsi naredili malo
In this place.	Na tem mestu.
They had a job.	Imeli so delo.
Boy, you can.	Fant, lahko.
But that's certainly not all.	Zagotovo pa še ni vse.
I love what he's doing here	Všeč mi je, kaj počne tukaj
I would be there the next day	Naslednji dan bi bil tam
I should help you.	Moral bi ti pomagati.
I didn't mean to say that	Nisem hotel tega povedati
That's because he couldn't.	To je zato, ker ni mogel.
I won't help you if you want to	Ne bom ti pomagal, če si to želiš
I can not do it anymore	ne morem več
We didn't know it ourselves.	Sami nismo vedeli.
Which is not.	Kar pa ni.
Probably not good.	Verjetno ni dobro.
The car was right.	Avto je bil pravi.
But he didn't like it.	Vendar mu ni bilo všeč.
I should never go with him	Nikoli ne bi smel iti z njim
Maybe more than that.	Morda več kot to.
I let him go.	Pustil sem ga.
I mean, he said.	Mislim, rekel je.
I have no help, nothing	Nimam pomoči, nič
I want more than that	Želim si več kot to
My father had a car.	Moj oče je imel avto.
I don't know what they are	Ne vem, kaj so
I never liked it.	Nikoli mi ni bilo všeč.
I already told you all this	Vse to sem ti že povedal
I ate there.	Tam sem jedel.
Now this has happened.	Zdaj se je to zgodilo.
He was not sorry.	Ni mu bilo žal.
I'll be leaving soon	Kmalu bom odšel
He died in the afternoon.	Popoldne je umrl.
They had to play.	Morali so igrati.
Maybe I'll lose her again.	Morda jo bom spet izgubil.
I really need help.	Res potrebujem pomoč.
What to do with it.	Kaj storiti s tem.
I did a lot of things wrong	Veliko stvari sem naredil narobe
I just wasn’t sure yet what to do with it	Samo še nisem bil prepričan, kaj naj s tem
He was right about the time.	Glede časa je imel prav.
But we know he knew he needed to.	Vemo pa, da je vedel, da potrebuje.
But there was never anything there.	Tam pa nikoli ni bilo ničesar.
I feel much better from what happened	Od tega, kar se je zgodilo, se počutim veliko bolje
That's the only way you'll succeed.	To je edini način, da ti bo uspelo.
I understand.	Razumem.
And you know it.	In ti to veš.
No one knew where to go.	Nihče ni vedel, kam naj gre.
I couldn’t get there fast enough	Nisem mogel priti dovolj hitro
Not so in front of me.	Ne tako pred mano.
I can't do this without you	Tega ne morem brez tebe
That may be so.	To je lahko tako.
But I wasn’t so sure she succeeded	Nisem pa bil tako prepričan, da ji je uspelo
This is neither here nor there at the moment.	Tega trenutno ni ne tukaj ne tam.
We are perfectly fine.	Mi smo popolnoma v redu.
I've never done that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem storil.
And still.	In še vedno.
And if you succeed.	In če vam bo uspelo.
Now what?.	Kaj pa zdaj?.
No, you're definitely not.	Ne, zagotovo nisi.
I never needed anyone else	Nikoli nisem potreboval nikogar drugega
I know you would like it	Vem, da bi ti bilo všeč
I don't want that.	Ne želim tega.
They did so well.	Tako dobro so naredili.
I stayed put and waited	Ostal sem na mestu in čakal
You met him yesterday.	Včeraj si ga srečal.
I just know that's not true.	Vem samo, da to ni res.
But I was too good at it	Vendar sem bil v tem preveč dober
He has been doing this for a long time.	To je že dolgo storil.
I didn't do that for you	Tega nisem naredil zate
Lots of things you don't.	Veliko stvari, ki jih ne.
Something like that.	Nekaj ​​takega.
I didn’t know he was waiting for me there	Nisem vedela, da me je tam čakal
It was after that.	Bilo je po tem.
I couldn't even help myself	Niti sam si nisem mogel pomagati
I know what's wrong with him	Vem, kaj je narobe z njim
No, not at all.	Ne, niti malo.
I loved everything in this city	V tem mestu mi je bilo všeč vse
Not the only one.	Ni edini.
I see him for the first time	Vidim ga prvič
Lots of work, lots of work.	Veliko dela, veliko dela.
It wasn't easy for me to be with	Ni mi bilo lahko biti z
I won't need it tonight	Nocoj ga ne bom potreboval
But he will forget.	Bo pa pozabil.
I couldn't go.	nisem mogel iti.
I liked it.	Všeč mi je bilo.
Because this is my life right now.	Ker je to trenutno moje življenje.
You know that's not true.	Veš, da to ni res.
That was me.	To sem bil jaz.
I definitely got that	To sem zagotovo dobil
And on.	In še naprej.
I didn't expect you to do that	Nisem pričakoval, da boš to storil
I think he would make it	Mislim, da bi mu to uspelo
I didn't like it.	Ni mi bilo všeč.
We have children.	Imamo otroke.
I hope not.	Upam, da ne.
I would never say that	Tega ne bi nikoli rekel
I will definitely be back	zagotovo se bom vrnil
I can't see them now	Zdaj jih ne morem videti
You can't be.	Ne moreš biti.
I've been doing this for years	To sem delal leta
However, I did not do that	Vendar tega nisem storil
Nice to meet you again.	Lepo, da sem te spet srečal.
And that's definitely what's happening.	In zagotovo se prav to dogaja.
I did my job.	Opravil sem svoje delo.
He was still a boy, but he was no longer a child.	Bil je še fant, a ni bil več otrok.
He is my life.	On je moje življenje.
Enough, enough, enough already.	Dovolj, dovolj, dovolj že.
I like everything a little bit	Všeč mi je vsega po malo
I would do so	Tako bi naredil
Fine! 	V redu!
He really was.	Res je bil.
I will do whatever you want.	Naredil bom vse, kar želiš.
It is also completely wrong.	Prav tako je popolnoma narobe.
That 's why I' il never forget you	Zaradi tega te ne bom nikoli pozabil
I still didn’t want to believe it	Še vedno nisem hotel verjeti
I do that.	To počnem.
I just want to know why	Želim samo vedeti zakaj
You had nothing.	Nisi imel ničesar.
This is going really fast.	To gre res hitro.
I need to talk to him	Moram govoriti z njim
I knew this was no ordinary life	Vedel sem, da to ni običajno življenje
But unfortunately it's not that simple.	A žal ni tako preprosto.
This is not the first time.	To ni prvič.
I went on.	sem šel naprej.
Something, but not too much	Nekaj, a ne preveč
I know you mean it	Vem, da to misliš
I saw that he was at home.	Videl sem, da je doma.
That's what I wanted you for here	Za to sem te želel tukaj
Maybe I haven't told you everything yet	Morda ti še nisem povedal vsega
I had to believe him	Moral sem mu verjeti
I wouldn't expect anything else !.	Nič drugega ne bi pričakoval!.
I want to do that with him	To želim narediti z njim
But it is something else.	Je pa nekaj drugega.
I bought it a long time ago	Dolgo sem ga kupil
I can't do without losing my life	Ne morem, ne da bi pri tem izgubil življenje
I asked you and you said no	Vprašal sem te in si rekel ne
He didn't want anything.	Nič ni hotel.
I know very well.	zelo dobro vem.
I could have been a child	Lahko sem bil otrok
I have a lot of work to do today.	Danes imam veliko dela.
I almost wish it was	Skoraj si želim, da bi bilo
I know what needs to be done	Vem, kaj je treba narediti
Maybe it's you.	Mogoče si ti.
We only had three.	Imeli smo samo tri.
But who knows what he will do next.	Vendar kdo ve, kaj bo naredil naprej.
A friend told me about it.	Prijatelj mi je povedal o tem.
All right, I'm going into this.	V redu, grem v to.
I mean that and more than that	Mislim to in še več kot to
I said she was fine with me.	Rekel sem, da je v redu z mano.
Such a good boy.	Tako dober fant.
I hadn't heard them at all before	Prej jih sploh nisem slišal
But I just didn’t know what to do	Vendar preprosto nisem vedela, kaj naj storim
I hope he can be there	Upam, da je lahko tam
She won't say anything about us being here.	Nič ne bo rekla o tem, da smo tukaj.
I can't do this for you	Tega ne morem narediti namesto tebe
He seemed to have forgotten her.	Zdelo se je, da jo je pozabil.
Maybe I'd rather not know.	Mogoče raje ne bi vedel.
We used to do that.	Nekoč smo to storili.
I can’t believe this is happening to me	Ne morem verjeti, da se mi to dogaja
We've been here before.	Tukaj smo že bili.
I think maybe he's my father	Mislim, da je morda moj oče
I can't tell you how we know	Ne morem vam povedati, kako vemo
I want to know if this kid is going anywhere	Rad bi vedel, če gre ta otrok kam
I've wanted to say this for so long	To sem želel povedati tako dolgo
It wasn't that good anymore.	Ni bilo več tako v redu.
I see you like it too	Vidim, da ti je tudi všeč
I think he wants to do what is right	Mislim, da želi narediti, kar je prav
Not so before us.	Pred nami ni tako.
If I had known, I wouldn’t have been able to do that.	Če bi vedel, tega ne bi mogel storiti.
I was better than him	Bil sem boljši od njega
No need to talk about it.	O tem ni treba govoriti.
There was no need.	Ni bilo treba.
The reason for this was the person.	Razlog za to je bila oseba.
I know more things.	Vem več stvari.
I know you didn't want to do anything wrong to me.	Vem, da mi nisi hotel narediti nič narobe.
Must be.	Mora biti.
It's still hard to see.	Še vedno ga je težko videti.
I hope you don't let go	Upam, da ne boš pustil
That's a good thing	To je dobra stvar
I didn't want to play	Nisem hotel igrati
I knew it would	Vedel sem, da bo
Nobody saw you.	Nihče te ni videl.
I knew immediately what had happened	Takoj sem vedel, kaj se je zgodilo
And now he needs me.	In zdaj me potrebuje.
You don't know where you are.	Ne veš kje si.
I never do anything myself	Sam nikoli ničesar ne počnem
I could do that.	Lahko bi to storila.
And he can do it here	In to lahko stori tukaj
I'm busy now anyway.	Zdaj sem tako ali tako zaposlen.
Not much to see.	Ne da bi bilo veliko videti.
I never saw him again	Nisem ga več videl
She knew where she was.	Vedela je, kje je.
I heard you last night.	Sinoči sem te slišal.
I've never done that.	Tega nisem nikoli naredil.
It was good for me that way.	Na ta način mi je bilo dobro.
She did nothing more.	Nič več ni storila.
I never really thought this was going to happen	Nikoli si res nisem mislil, da se bo to zgodilo
He went home.	Odšel je domov.
Nobody likes him.	Nihče ga ne mara.
I didn't want to know.	Nisem želel vedeti.
It just seems like there are enough of them.	Preprosto je videti, da jih je dovolj.
I know you will not become human	Vem, da ne boš postal človek
I didn't mean anything by that	Nič nisem mislil s tem
I wanted to be that.	Hotel sem biti to.
No one has heard her yet.	Nihče je še ni slišal.
I think there will be more	Mislim, da bo še kaj
I didn’t come back right away and he’s angry	Nisem se takoj vrnil in on je jezen
I could definitely do better.	Zagotovo bi lahko naredil bolje.
I was sure he would lose.	Bil sem prepričan, da bo izgubil.
My father returned to work.	Oče se je vrnil v službo.
That was really it.	To je bilo res to.
Which it really isn't.	Kar pravzaprav ni.
I've never seen him.	Nikoli ga nisem videl.
It wasn't very good.	Ni bilo veliko dobro.
That's enough for me.	To mi je dovolj.
I had to go with him.	Moral sem iti z njim.
Right, that was what he needed.	Prav, to je bilo tisto, kar je potreboval.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ni.
And they knew.	In vedeli so.
I see you know something.	Vidim, da nekaj veš.
I don't think there's anything you can do.	Mislim, da ne moreš nič narediti.
I've never seen anyone else but you	Nikoli nisem videl nikogar drugega, samo tebe
You have me.	Imaš mene.
Must be.	Mora biti.
I don't like this part.	Ne maram tega dela.
I want some time alone with you	Želim si malo časa sam s tabo
We are really sorry for the trouble.	Res nam je žal za težave.
Because it's not you.	Ker to nisi ti.
He's already back.	On je že nazaj.
I'm sure he will	Prepričan sem, da bo
Maybe that was it.	Mogoče je bilo to to.
There may be nothing there.	Tam morda ni nič.
I didn't need that.	Tega nisem potreboval.
I'll be fine without it	brez tega bom v redu
I wouldn't meet him either.	Tudi jaz ga ne bi srečal.
He is often here.	Pogosto je tukaj.
I knew she wouldn't like it	Vedel sem, da ji ne bo všeč
He's doing well.	Dobro mu gre.
A lot of things happen to me, you know	Veliko stvari se mi dogaja, veš
This is not difficult.	To ni težko.
Instead, I spoke quickly	Namesto tega sem hitro govoril
I will try not to.	Poskušal bom ne.
It's always been like that with me.	Pri meni je bilo vedno tako.
I'm not interested in money.	Denar me ne zanima.
You haven't learned enough yet.	Nisi se še dovolj naučil.
That is, until a few days ago.	Se pravi do nekaj dni nazaj.
v	v
That's how it is here.	Tukaj je tako.
We can't tell.	Ne moremo povedati.
No need, really.	Ni treba, res.
He hadn't done that in a long time.	Tega že dolgo ni storil.
He probably got lost.	Verjetno se je izgubil.
I realized he was serious	Spoznal sem, da misli resno
You never asked me for that.	Nikoli me nisi prosil za to.
I didn’t know how long.	Nisem vedel, kako dolgo.
I really wish I didn’t have to leave tomorrow.	Res si želim, da mi jutri ne bi bilo treba oditi.
Probably not, he decided.	Verjetno ne, se je odločil.
I just want to say as it is	Želim samo povedati, kot je
Maybe it's a good thing he knows them.	Mogoče je dobro, da jih pozna.
I'm happy for you.	Vesel sem zate.
Not everyone will like you.	Ne boš vsem všeč.
Soon it was there.	Kmalu je bilo tam.
He still has it.	Še vedno ga ima.
He knows us so well.	Tako dobro nas pozna.
A lot of people feel that way.	Veliko ljudi se tako počuti.
He is in favor and says it is good.	On je za in pravi, da je dobro.
I asked to go with him.	Prosil sem, da grem z njim.
I didn't do anything.	Nič nisem storil.
He had time for everything.	Imel je čas za vse.
He did his thing.	Svoje je naredil.
He has it.	Ima ga.
That's what I'd like to tell him	To bi mu rad povedal
Maybe I have something for you	Mogoče imam nekaj zate
I was lucky to have my own room	Imel sem srečo, da sem imel svojo sobo
I would still be with him if I could.	Še vedno bi bila z njim, če bi.
I felt completely out of place	Počutil sem se popolnoma na mestu
I needed him to know he was okay	Potreboval sem ga, da ve, da je v redu
I just want to know what's going on	Želim samo vedeti, kaj se dogaja
I helped her make it.	Pomagal sem ji narediti.
I was not surprised at all	Sploh nisem bil presenečen
I'm ready for anything	Pripravljen sem na vse
There are so many.	Toliko jih je.
Something will happen.	Nekaj ​​se bo zgodilo.
And not much else.	In ne veliko drugega.
Just not here.	Samo ne tukaj.
That's what he meant.	To je mislil.
That was a few years ago.	To je bilo nekaj let nazaj.
I feel simple.	Počutim se preprosto.
Like you.	Tako kot ti.
I was here alone	Tukaj sem bil sam
I asked him to do it	Prosil sem ga, naj to stori
I'm just going for it.	Samo grem na to.
That was really good.	To je bilo res dobro.
Everything.	Vse.
I really haven't seen it	Res nisem videl
I wasn't ready to tell you then	Takrat ti nisem bil pripravljen povedati
You've seen me do it.	Videli ste me, kako to počnem.
She didn't say anything wrong.	Nič ni rekla narobe.
Maybe I should say a little more about that	O tem bi morda moral povedati malo več
I do not know what you mean.	Ne vem, kaj misliš.
Too much time.	Preveč časa.
But it must be done.	Vendar je treba storiti.
I actually learned things	Pravzaprav sem se naučil stvari
He doesn't know how to make them.	Ne ve, kako jih narediti.
I thought he was just tired	Mislil sem, da je samo utrujen
I stayed with you for a long time	Dolgo sem ostal pri vas
I understand.	razumem.
This is no time at all, this is nothing.	To sploh ni čas, to ni nič.
Not a man.	Ne človek.
I think it is.	Mislim, da je.
Now no one could reach him.	Zdaj nihče ni mogel priti do njega.
He's never done that before.	Še nikoli tega ni storil.
In fact, this is not the case.	Pravzaprav temu ni tako.
I did this yesterday and the day before	To sem naredil včeraj in dan prej
It isn't and isn't.	Ni in ni.
They didn't do that.	Tega niso storili.
He will do it.	On bo to naredil.
I really wasn’t sure	Res nisem bil prepričan

We really were.	Res smo bili.
I have things to do here	Tukaj imam stvari za početi
We know he is a good person.	Vemo, da je dobra oseba.
Sometimes I wonder why.	Včasih se sprašujem zakaj.
I needed her to know me	Potreboval sem jo, da me pozna
He had problems.	Imel je težave.
I didn't think so a little while ago.	Malo prej nisem tako mislil.
There we are.	Tam smo.
But that's not all.	To pa še ni vse.
There is work.	Obstaja delo.
I'm glad to be here.	Vesel sem, da sem tukaj.
We don't know where to go next.	Ne vemo, kam naprej.
And it was absolutely true.	In bilo je popolnoma res.
And it never will be.	In nikoli ne bo.
Because they are not.	Ker niso.
He didn't wait long.	Ni čakal dolgo.
He had no one now, nothing.	Zdaj ni imel nikogar, nič.
I understand very well.	Zelo dobro razumem.
I know that's not all	Vem, da to ni vse

But there is a lot of work.	Vendar je veliko dela.
I can't do everything for you	Ne morem narediti vsega zate
I thought that was it	Mislil sem, da je to to

I knew where he was going	Vedel sem, kam gre
Fortunately, you don't have to.	Na srečo vam ni treba.
And it's time.	In čas je.
They were not helpful.	Niso bili v pomoč.
I won't go back to school now.	Zdaj se ne bom vrnil v šolo.
In fact, you are right.	Pravzaprav imaš prav.
It was pretty obvious why.	Precej očitno je bilo zakaj.
I just played.	Pravkar sem igral.
She is afraid to tell her thoughts.	Boji se povedati svoje misli.
He was my everything.	Bil je moje vse.
I don't know who this is.	Ne vem kdo je to.
This is not a problem at the moment.	To trenutno ni problem.
And three.	In tri.
I’ve heard it’s really good, but hard.	Slišal sem, da je res dobro, a težko.
I won't be long	Ne bom dolgo odšel
But he lost it.	Vendar ga je izgubil.
Is it true.	Ali je res.
We'll just have to see.	Samo videti bomo morali.
Not everyone is like you.	Niso vsi kot ti.
I don't want to be here	Nočem biti tukaj
I've seen and heard enough	Dovolj sem videl in slišal
We will do ours.	Mi bomo naredili svoje.
She needed to know what it was.	Morala je vedeti, kaj je to.
It was too much.	Bilo je preveč.
I didn’t have much to say about it	O tem nisem imel veliko za povedati
That was it for the day.	To je bilo to za ta dan.
That was the thing he needed.	To je bila stvar, ki jo je potreboval.
Maybe today.	Morda pa danes.
It never is and never will be.	Nikoli ni in nikoli ne bo.
I heard people talking.	Slišal sem ljudi govoriti.
I heard he came last night	Slišal sem, da je prišel sinoči
We need to know.	Moramo vedeti.
I wanted to stay here	Hotel sem ostati tukaj
Learn more at.	Več o tem na.
If anyone knew, they would.	Če bi kdo vedel, bi.
And so it was.	In tako je bil.
But he never told us anything.	Vendar nam ni nikoli ničesar povedal.
I have things to do and where I need to go.	Imam stvari za početi in kam moram iti.
A child will never learn if he does not play.	Otrok se ne bo nikoli naučil, če se ne bo igral.

Okay, he says.	Prav, pravi.
You talked to him.	Govoril si z njim.
It wasn't enough.	Ni bilo dovolj.
I wonder about that.	sprašujem se o tem.
If so, fine.	Če je, v redu.
But I believe you	Vendar ti verjamem
I had a hard time getting to him again	Spet sem težko prišel do njega
But I know how I would feel about it	Vem pa, kako bi se ob tem počutil
He was a man.	Bil je človek.
I wonder what it was	Sprašujem se, kaj je bilo
And you won’t have them anymore.	In ne boste jih imeli več.
I never really liked it	Nikoli mi ni bilo zelo všeč
I saw him there this morning	Danes zjutraj sem ga videl tam
He doesn't do that.	On tega ne počne.
It's simply more.	To je preprosto več.
Someone has to tell them.	Nekdo jih mora povedati.
They knew.	Saj so vedeli.
It doesn’t help anyone.	To nikomur ne pomaga.
Good work, everyone.	Dobro delo, vsi.
I want to tell you something	Rad bi vam povedal nekaj
He was too good at it.	Bil je preveč dober v tem.
But it didn't look like that.	A ni bilo videti tako.
I just hope no one comes	Upam samo, da ne pride nihče
I could do that.	To bi lahko naredil.
I didn't know he was here.	Nisem vedel, da je tukaj.
I could never see myself doing that	Nikoli si nisem mogel videti, da to počnem
We had enough money.	Imeli smo dovolj denarja.
I was ready for this life	Bil sem pripravljen na to življenje
I wouldn't come back here	Ne bi se vrnil sem
I would never come back from that	Nikoli se ne bi vrnil iz tega
He doesn't even have to talk to him.	Niti mu ni treba govoriti s tem.
I knew what it could be	Vedel sem, kaj bi lahko bilo
I should never have told him that	Tega mu ne bi smel nikoli povedati
I decided not to tell him anything at the moment	Odločil sem se, da mu trenutno ne bom ničesar rekel
No one will die.	Nihče ne bo umrl.
I started to see things.	Začel sem videti stvari.
It was just too much.	To je bilo preprosto preveč.
He was better.	Bil je boljši.
I had to know what he was talking about	Moral sem vedeti, kaj govori
This seems obvious.	To se zdi očitno.
.	.
I would never let go.	Nikoli se ne bi pustil.
He saw what needed to be done, and he did.	Videl je, kaj je treba narediti, in to je storil.
He could have told her.	Lahko ji je povedal.
I knew where he lived	Vedel sem, kje živi
This is something we have already seen.	To je nekaj, kar smo že videli.
I can't tell you what to do	Ne morem ti povedati, kaj narediti
No need to leave.	Ni treba oditi.
That's not it.	To ni to.
He was tired now.	Zdaj je bil utrujen.
It would be difficult, but it would be possible.	Težko bi bilo, vendar bi bilo mogoče.
I can't believe it happened	Ne morem verjeti, da se je zgodilo
I can’t believe he did this to me	Ne morem verjeti, da je to naredil zame
And it was still hard.	In to je bilo še vedno težko.
He said this could be a problem.	Rekel je, da je to lahko problem.
I didn’t know there were so many	Nisem vedel, da jih je toliko
I can hardly believe it	Skoraj ne morem verjeti
Tell me.	Povej mi.
Not fast enough again.	Spet ne dovolj hitro.
I see now.	zdaj vidim.
I have something after that	Po tem imam nekaj
I'm not going home.	ne bom šel domov.
I wouldn't do that to her again	Tega ji ne bi več naredil
I knew it was only a matter of time	Vedel sem, da je samo vprašanje časa
The thing with you.	Stvar s tabo.
I never talked to him about it	Nikoli nisem govoril z njim o tem
I knew what it was all about	Vedel sem, za kaj gre
It just happened.	Pravkar se je zgodilo.
I was out of money.	Bila sem brez denarja.
Often not.	Pogosto ni.
I know you can't see	Vem, da ne moreš videti
I couldn’t be sure to say that	Nisem se mogel prepričati, da bi to rekel
I completely forgot about it	Popolnoma sem pozabil na to
There is nothing to see here either.	Tudi tukaj ni kaj videti.
But he is no more.	Vendar ga ni več.
It was definitely a day for me.	Zame je bil zagotovo dan.
And that's the problem.	In to je problem.
I was there when it happened.	Bil sem tam, ko se je zgodilo.
He didn't do that.	Tega ni storil.
Everything nice and simple.	Vse lepo in preprosto.
Talk and talk and talk.	Govori in govori in govori.
You should be here.	Moral bi biti tukaj.
I hope everything is fine	Upam, da bo vse v redu
I couldn't do that to her	Tega ji nisem mogel storiti
It would be wrong.	Bilo bi narobe.
I didn’t think he was good enough.	Nisem mislil, da je dovolj dober.
I know better than that	Vem bolje kot to
She was nobody.	Bila je nihče.
Is that right?	Je to prav?.
Everyone should know this.	To bi morali vedeti vsi.
I better go home	Bolje, da grem domov
I did almost nothing	Skoraj nič nisem naredil
I’m not sure if that’s the real reason or not.	Nisem prepričan, ali je to pravi razlog ali ne.
It was early, but for sure.	Bilo je zgodaj, a zagotovo.
I think you would be fine.	Mislim, da bi ti bilo dobro.
I didn't expect that to be the case	Nisem pričakoval, da bo temu tako
I knew it couldn't be done	Vedel sem, da se tega ne da narediti
And not only that.	Pa ne samo to.
I want to be ready	Želim biti pripravljen
No one can stay here long.	Nihče ne more ostati tukaj dolgo.
There she did it again.	Tam je spet to storila.
From what he told me, it was a possibility.	Glede na to, kar mi je povedal, je bila to možnost.
Nobody knew anything.	Nihče ni vedel ničesar.
And it was beautiful.	In bilo je lepo.
I didn't find anything	Nič nisem našel
I don't think so.	Jaz pa ne mislim tako.
But I understand why	Razumem pa zakaj
I was already there when he met me	Bila sem že, ko me je spoznal
I did what needed to be done	Naredil sem, kar je bilo treba
I'm glad he was here.	Vesel sem, da je bil tukaj.
We can't do that.	Tega ne moremo storiti.
Maybe that's the reason.	Morda je to razlog.
Not much to work on.	Ni veliko za delo.
Actually, it's not.	Pravzaprav ni.
I have some work to do.	Imam nekaj dela.
You didn't help us.	Nisi nam pomagal.
I couldn't.	ne bi mogel.
I became the one who was always there	Postal sem tisti, ki je bil vedno tam
I was really fine	Res mi je bilo vse v redu
in.	in.
It wasn't like that for me.	Zame ni bilo tako.
It was that.	Je bilo to.
You are human.	Ti si človek.
I saw it and so did he	Videl sem in tudi on je
It looked wrong.	Videti je bilo narobe.
I wanted him to have her	Želela sem, da jo ima
That's how he felt.	Tako se je počutil.
He was there too.	Tudi on je bil tam.
I believe we are really much more than that	Verjamem, da smo res veliko več kot to
Quite a lot of that.	Precej tega.
Serious work has happened.	Zgodilo se je resno delo.
I didn't feel sorry for you	Ni mi bilo žal zate
He will stay again.	Bo spet ostal.
I knew it wouldn’t be easy.	Vedel sem, da to ne bo lahko.
He said he hoped he would come.	Rekel je, da upa, da bo prišel.
I want to know how your day was	Želim vedeti, kako je bil tvoj dan
I said yes, that's right.	Rekel sem, da, tako je.
I told him so much too	Toliko sem mu tudi povedal
I wanted to be with him forever	Želela sem biti z njim za vedno
There's nothing I can do about it	Glede tega ne morem nič
I would love to hear from you	rad bi slišal od vas
I also thought he was a child	Tudi jaz sem mislil, da je otrok
He saw it himself.	Sam je to videl.
Now I know what it is	Zdaj vem, kaj je to
And it goes on and on.	In gre naprej in naprej.
You never knew.	Nikoli nisi vedel.
I will do everything right.	Vse bom naredil prav.
I think you were fine	Mislim, da si bil v redu
If anything, people are more interested.	Če kaj, ljudi bolj zanima.
I couldn't convince you at all	Sploh te nisem mogel prepričati
I wanted to get to that.	Želel sem priti do tega.
You have to help him.	Moraš mu pomagati.
But it's right away.	Vendar je takoj.
And you came with me.	In ti si prišel z mano.
Don't be sorry.	Naj ti ne bo žal.
I used to.	Včasih sem.
Life has happened.	Življenje se je zgodilo.
But I didn't really work	Nisem pa res delal
I have a question for you.	Imam vprašanje za vas.
I didn't know you were there	Nisem vedel, da si tam
I'm actually pretty good at this	V tem sem pravzaprav kar dober
It probably wouldn't even be good.	Verjetno niti ne bi bilo dobro.
I can't tell her.	Ne morem ji povedati.
You know it is.	Saj veš, da je.
Many of us are there	Veliko nas je tam
We did that.	To smo storili.
He has something else to say.	Še nekaj mora povedati.
I will be with you from now on	Od zdaj naprej bom s tabo
They didn't see him.	Niso ga videli.
I knew we wouldn't be here long.	Vedel sem, da ne bomo dolgo tukaj.
There is nothing to do here.	Tukaj ni kaj storiti.
I won't be here long	Ne bom več dolgo tukaj
I will have nowhere to go	Ne bom imel kam iti
I can't do that right now	Tega trenutno ne morem storiti
I didn't say anything	Nič nisem rekel
Not you and me.	Ne ti in jaz.
I went to the room like you said	Šla sem v sobo, kot si rekel
I can't get there alone	Sam ne morem priti tja
I still haven't.	Še vedno nisem.
For a while, for a while.	Za nekaj časa, za nekaj časa.
I completely forgot	Popolnoma sem pozabil
Maybe that's why she did it.	Mogoče je zato to storila.
I will say this only once	To bom rekel samo enkrat
They didn't see me.	Niso me videli.
It won't be long.	Ne bo dolgo.
Still nothing from me.	Od mene še vedno nič.
Tired of it.	Utrujen od tega.
No, you're right.	Ne, prav imaš.
I hope it works for you.	Upam, da bo zate delo.
A game that wasn’t always a game	Igra, ki ni bila vedno igra
There is nothing that can be done.	Nič se ne da narediti.
He could have died because of him now	Zaradi njega bi zdaj lahko umrl
I am still convinced of that.	Še vedno sem prepričan v to.
I loved being there.	Rad sem bil tam.
I knew what he was going to tell me	Vedel sem, kaj mi bo povedal
Maybe not.	Morda pa ne.
They won't know, not here.	Ne bodo vedeli, ne tukaj.
How beautiful it was.	Kako lepo je bilo.
I've done that before	To sem že delal
You just like it.	Samo všeč ti je.
You think you are.	Misliš, da si.
What was mine.	Kaj je bilo moje.
Who was that.	Kdo je bil tako.
I will succeed again	Uspelo mi bo še enkrat
I feel like I have it now	Počutim se, da imam to zdaj
I wish I would never come back	Želim si, da se ne bi nikoli vrnil
But that was then.	Vendar je bilo to takrat.
I need to know what else he knows	Moram vedeti, kaj še on ve
You know we have it.	Veš, da ga imamo.
I didn’t ask how he managed that	Nisem vprašal, kako mu je to uspelo
It is only a matter of time and time.	To je le vprašanje časa in časa.
It's about life.	Gre za življenje.
I couldn’t do that once	Enkrat tega nisem mogel storiti
I didn't want to be.	Nisem hotel biti.
I know everything.	poznam vse.
In fact, he was convinced he wanted to.	Pravzaprav je bil prepričan, da si želi.
I've never met you before	Še nikoli te nisem srečal
It wasn't possible.	Ni bilo mogoče.
He just played with us	Pravkar se je igral z nami
I can't tell you how to be who you are	Ne morem ti povedati, kako biti to, kar si
But there is much more.	Je pa še veliko več.
He would be there.	On bi bil tam.
It wasn't good enough.	Ni bilo dovolj dobro.
And you are here because.	In tukaj ste, ker.
Maybe because something like this hasn't happened yet.	Morda zato, ker se kaj takega še ni zgodilo.
That's what I love about it.	To mi je všeč pri tem.
I never would.	nikoli ne bi.
I know a lot from home.	Vem veliko od doma.
I wish they hadn't done that	Želim si, da tega niso storili
This early in the morning.	To zgodaj zjutraj.
I see something ahead	Vidim nekaj naprej
I didn’t know what was going to happen.	Nisem vedel, kaj se bo zgodilo.
This is no longer a problem.	To ni več problem.
And she will succeed	In ji bo uspelo
I said it would be fine.	Rekel sem, da bo to v redu.
I would never come back	nikoli se ne bi vrnil
I just didn't expect it	Samo nisem pričakoval
I didn't have time to do anything.	Nisem imel časa narediti ničesar.
It must be you.	To moraš biti ti.
I still wonder what happened to him	Še vedno se sprašujem, kaj se je zgodilo z njim
I left.	Odšel sem.
That is absolutely right.	To je popolnoma prav.
I said it was okay	Rekel sem, da je v redu
It's really nice.	Res je lepo.
I don't think they're there now	Mislim, da jih zdaj ni več
I told him yes.	Rekel sem mu, da.
I could call for help.	Lahko bi poklical na pomoč.
I had my job	Imel sem svoje delo
I thought that was nice	Mislil sem, da je to lepo
I can't go home again	Ne morem spet domov
They were already there with him.	Bili so že tam z njim.
Maybe there aren’t many of them or there are a lot of them.	Morda jih ni veliko ali pa jih je veliko.
I like a man who knows how to work	Všeč mi je človek, ki zna delati
It seems so good.	Zdi se tako dobro.
I think that's it, so far	Mislim, da je to vse, do zdaj
I haven't actually seen that	Tega pravzaprav nisem videl
I understand her better now	Zdaj jo bolje razumem
Or maybe it just seemed that way.	Ali pa se je morda samo tako zdelo.
Not after that.	Po tem pa ne.
We need to do better.	Moramo narediti bolje.
I really believe in these things	Res verjamem v te stvari
They are nothing.	Niso nič.
I've never met her.	Nikoli je nisem srečal.
No matter what, no matter when.	Ne glede na vse, ne glede na to kdaj.
There are no children at home.	Doma ni otrok.
For the rest of my life.	Za vse moje življenje.
I had a nice time last night	Sinoči sem se imel lepo
I said yes, and he said you had	Rekel sem, da, on pa je rekel, da si imel
I met her once at a party.	Enkrat sem jo srečal na zabavi.
They weren't.	Niso bili.
And from.	In od.
That seems likely to me.	To se mi zdi verjetno.
I just haven't seen you here yet	Samo tukaj te še nisem videl
So I'm asking for help.	Zato prosim za pomoč.
This man was not your father.	Ta človek ni bil tvoj oče.
I can't believe you're here.	Ne morem verjeti, da si tukaj.
I know he loves me and needs me	Vem, da me ima rad in me potrebuje
I didn't even see who it was	Sploh nisem videl, kdo je to
It may have to go, ”he said.	Morda bo treba iti,« je rekel.
I didn’t see it happen	Nisem videl, da se je zgodilo
For you too.	Zate tudi.
I mean, he's not here anymore	Mislim, ni ga več tukaj
I left right there	Odšel sem kar od tam
I knew he was my father.	Vedel sem, da je moj oče.
That is the problem.	Prav v tem je problem.
I saw he did something, and it was very wrong	Videl sem, da je nekaj naredil, in bilo je zelo narobe
If you know anything more, please tell me.	Če veš kaj več, mi prosim povej.
I really like it right now	Trenutno mi je res všeč
I wanted more, more than they had	Želel sem več, več, kot so imeli
At the moment, I don’t feel good about it	Trenutno se zaradi tega ne počutim dobro
And maybe it was.	In morda je bilo.
Even then, he was not well.	Tudi takrat mu ni bilo dobro.
Or maybe every day.	Ali morda vsak dan.
Actually, that's not true.	Pravzaprav to ni res.
It's hard going.	Težko gre.
He did it pretty well.	To je naredil kar dobro.
I wasn’t sure what else was going on	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj se še dogaja
I wanted to see everything	Hotel sem videti vse
I would like to know.	Rad bi vedel.
This is not happening at the moment.	Trenutno se to ne dogaja.
I came home this morning	Danes zjutraj sem prišel domov
Saying things, maybe.	Govoriti stvari, morda.
I made them.	Naredil sem jih.
I’m not entirely sure if this is good or not.	Nisem popolnoma prepričan, ali je to dobro ali ne.
I wasn’t sure how long.	Nisem bil prepričan, kako dolgo.
That's hard for me.	To mi je težko.
I can’t believe no one wants to buy this	Ne morem verjeti, da tega nihče noče kupiti
This is because.	To je zato, ker.
But I still really hope he has some time left	Še vedno pa res upam, da ima še kaj časa
You are mine and only mine.	Ti si moj in samo moj.
She didn't know if any of that was true.	Ali je kaj od tega res, ni vedela.
I wanted to get to him too much	Preveč sem si želel priti do njega
I have time for that	Imam čas za to
There's nothing you can do to me.	Nič mi ne moreš storiti.
I already told you that	To sem ti že povedal
That it was true.	Da je bilo res.
He can still do something.	Še vedno lahko nekaj naredi.
Long before that I was alone	Dolgo pred tem sem bil sam
He could lose his job because of that	Zaradi tega bi lahko izgubil službo
I didn't do anything	Nič nisem storil
There is really nothing to say.	Pravzaprav ni kaj za povedati.
I still can’t believe it’s really here	Še vedno ne morem verjeti, da je res tukaj
I didn't know who you were	Nisem vedel, kdo si
Right on the money.	Prav na denar.
I want to work on that	Želim delati na tem
We will as soon as we can.	Bomo takoj, ko bomo lahko.
This is not the case.	S tem ni tako.
That's the way it has to be.	Tako mora biti.
I failed at that.	Pri tem mi ni uspelo.
I hope you will like it	Upam, da ti bo všeč
You know what you are.	Veš kaj si.
But I wanted to do more	Želel pa sem narediti več
It was wrong then and it's wrong now.	Narobe je bilo takrat in narobe zdaj.
Instead, do none of this.	Namesto tega ne naredi ničesar od tega.
I hope it's okay tomorrow	Upam, da bo jutri v redu
I didn’t know it existed	Nisem vedel, da to obstaja
It was not.	Ni bilo.
Maybe he really thought he was.	Mogoče je res mislil, da je.
Maybe I could have done better	Mogoče bi lahko naredil bolje
Knowing things you can’t know.	Vedeti stvari, ki jih ne moreš vedeti.
I didn't know he lived here	Nisem vedel, da živi tukaj
I thought it was just a child	Mislil sem, da je to samo otrok
And really, it’s not too hard.	In res, ni preveč težko.
I never forgot what she told me	Nikoli nisem pozabil, kaj mi je rekla
They had a lot more.	Imeli so veliko več.
You did what no one thought you could or would.	Naredili ste tisto, za kar nihče ni mislil, da bi lahko ali da bi.
I keep asking her, but she doesn’t speak	Kar naprej jo sprašujem, vendar ne govori
I saw you.	Videl sem te.
I need to know what happened	Moram vedeti, kaj se je zgodilo
I couldn't help myself anymore	Nisem si mogel več pomagati
I may never see him again.	Morda ga nikoli več ne bom videl.
I was right behind him	Bil sem takoj za njim
I'm sorry about that.	Žal mi je za to.
I'm not so sure you're a boy	Nisem tako prepričan, da si fant
I just thought I could	Samo mislil sem, da bi lahko
I didn't do anything	Nič nisem storil
Okay, that's a lot better.	V redu, to je veliko bolje.
I like you.	Všeč si mi.
I didn't know who you were	Nisem vedel kdo si
I still am.	Še vedno sem.
The work was beautiful.	Delo je bilo lepo.
I hope he feels good	Upam, da se počuti dobro
Please, you are right	Prosim, da imaš prav
He knew they would see him.	Vedel je, da ga bodo videli.
I do, obviously.	To počnem, očitno.
I've never seen them here before	Še nikoli jih nisem videl tukaj
She went out again.	Spet je šla ven.
I didn't expect it to be that way	Nisem pričakoval, da bo tako
So you know, you don't know.	Tako da veš, a ne veš.
I wanted to be there	Hotel sem biti tam
I just know who.	Samo vem kdo.
I would do it now.	Zdaj bi to storil.
He doesn't even know you.	Sploh te ne pozna.
I almost got something	Skoraj sem nekaj dobil
Here's a question.	Tukaj je vprašanje.
He made it.	Naredil jo je.
I am anything but that	Jaz sem vse prej kot to
For the better.	Na bolje.
He had to do it himself.	To je moral narediti sam.
He came to me.	Prišel je do mene.
I think maybe I should go home	Mislim, da bi morda moral iti domov
I left you	Odšel sem od tebe
It was none of those things.	To ni bilo nič od tega.
I didn't like that	Tega mi ni bilo všeč
I didn't try to do that	Tega nisem poskušal narediti
I just have to eat.	Samo jesti moram.
I knew that all along	To sem vedel ves čas
I shouldn't have done that.	Tega ne bi smel storiti.
You saw him.	Videli ste ga.
If he came out.	Če je prišel ven.
Everything your father called me.	Vse, kar me je poklical tvoj oče.
But that might not happen here.	Vendar se to morda ne bo zgodilo tukaj.
I think it all happened so fast	Mislim, da se je vse to zgodilo tako hitro
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
I think it would be better to work fast	Mislim, da bi bilo bolje delati hitro
You were always there.	Vedno si bil tam.
I think you got what you wanted now	Mislim, da si zdaj dobil, kar si želel
And yet it is good for something.	Pa vendar je za nekaj dobro.
I saw how he made up his mind.	Videl sem, kako se je odločil.
There really was no money.	Denarja res ni bilo.
I don't understand yet.	Ne razumem še.
I'll look like you again soon	Kmalu bom spet videti kot si
I didn't expect to find anything	Nisem pričakoval, da bom kaj našel
I wish my father was here.	Želim si, da bi bil moj oče tukaj.
It's just you.	Ti si samo ti.
Now it seems so long ago.	Zdaj se zdi tako dolgo nazaj.
I knew it would never be possible	Vedel sem, da to nikoli ne bo mogoče
I just wanted to make sure you were okay	Hotel sem se samo prepričati, da si v redu
I don't think they would know	Mislim, da ne bi vedeli
Everything that can be.	Vse, kar je lahko.
I just learned something	Pravkar sem se nekaj naučil
It never happened and it never will.	Nikoli se ni zgodilo in se nikoli ne bo zgodilo.
I haven't done this in a long time	Tega že dolgo nisem počel
I don't do that anymore.	tega ne počnem več.
It's just, he's not there for me	Samo, zame ni tam
I am happy.	Sem vesel.
Just do it once.	Samo to enkrat.
It was a game.	To je bila igra.
I wanted that as much as you did	To sem si želel tako kot ti
I don't like that.	To mi ni všeč.
It's so good that day.	Tako dober je tisti dan.
Which was pretty good.	Kar je bilo precej dobro.
I never learned that and I always played alone	Tega se nisem nikoli naučil in sem vedno igral sam
I love seeing them.	Rad jih vidim.
It was simpler.	Bilo je bolj preprosto.
I know you're here.	Vem, da si tukaj.
I'm sure it's about the money	Prepričan sem, da gre za denar
I didn't ask him for help either	Tudi jaz ga nisem prosil za pomoč
I want to see you all	Vse vas želim videti
I'm above him.	Nad njim sem.
That's when he came.	Takrat je prišel.
It is hard.	Težko je.
You know how.	Veš kako.
A few more days, he told himself	Še nekaj dni, si je rekel
I have to leave immediately	Takoj moram oditi
I thought you might have gone out already	Mislil sem, da si morda že šel ven
I didn't go to school at all	Sploh nisem šel v šolo
I didn't have that either	Tudi tega nisem imel
I'm the one you want	Jaz sem tisti, ki ga želiš
I hope someone can help me.	Upam, da mi lahko kdo pomaga.
But we'll see.	Vendar bomo videli.
You weren't here.	Nisi bil tukaj.

You may be convinced of that.	Morda ste prepričani v to.
He should have done as he asked in the morning	Moral bi narediti, kot je prosil zjutraj
How are you.	Kako ste.
I know they were here	Vem, da so bili tukaj
We are not that.	Mi nismo to.
Once a week is good.	Enkrat na teden je dobro.
I am also absolutely everything	Jaz sem tudi popolnoma vse
I will speak for him.	Jaz bom govoril namesto njega.
This could be my chance.	To bi lahko bila moja priložnost.

There was a good kid for you.	Tam je bil dober otrok zate.
I never succeeded.	Nikoli mi ni uspelo.
I can't do anything.	nič ne morem.

It was good to know.	Dobro je bilo vedeti.
You saw her.	Videl si jo.
You should be fine.	Moral bi biti v redu.
You didn't have to do that.	Tega ti ni bilo treba narediti.
That would be him.	To bi bil on.
Not the only one.	Ni edini.
And we should.	In morali bi.
There is nothing else	Nič drugega ni

I think today is a good day	Mislim, da je danes dober dan
And it happened.	In to se je zgodilo.

I just think I should know that	Samo mislim, da bi to moral vedeti
I wouldn't let anything happen to him	Ne bi dovolil, da bi se mu kaj zgodilo
I wanted to stay.	Hotel sem ostati.
But I wouldn't tell him that	Tega pa mu ne bi rekel

I didn't know then.	takrat nisem vedel.
I hope this will be a good job.	Upam, da bo to dobro delo.
He simply thought he was right.	Preprosto je mislil, da ima prav.

I may have to do something	Morda bom moral nekaj narediti
Please don't tell her that.	Prosim, ne povej ji tega.
I had to go after him	Moral sem iti za njim
I've never been there before.	Še nikoli nisem bil tam.
I would love to hear about it	Rad bi slišal o tem

I still have it too	Tudi jaz ga še vedno imam

What should he do?	Kaj naj naredi?
You could say something is wrong	Lahko bi rekel, da je nekaj narobe
And that would be fine.	In to bi bilo v redu.
Either did something or didn’t do something else.	Ali naredil nekaj ali ne naredil nekaj drugega.

I thought we were in this together	Mislil sem, da sva v tem skupaj

I didn't hear them come into the room	Nisem jih slišal priti v sobo
I have too much work to do	Imam preveč dela
Regardless.	Ne glede tega.
Maybe not anymore, not like it used to be.	Mogoče ne več, ne tako kot nekoč.
She was truly alone now.	Zdaj je bila res sama.
I didn't expect anyone to be there	Nisem pričakoval, da bo kdo tam
Apparently he wasn't expecting me there.	Očitno me ni pričakoval tam.
This is true, if not true enough.	To je res, če ne dovolj res.
You had me there for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa si me imel tam.
But I have a question	Imam pa vprašanje
Not so.	Ne tako.

The only question is when.	Samo vprašanje je, kdaj.
I mean nothing of the sort.	Nič takega ne mislim.
The problem is that he will be gone.	Problem je v tem, da ga ne bo več.
She knew he didn't mean what he said.	Vedela je, da ni mislil tega, kar je rekel.
He asked what we had.	Vprašal je, kaj imamo.
I just feel like we're not alone	Samo počutim se, kot da nismo sami
I can't believe it happened	Ne morem verjeti, da se je zgodilo

I mean, he talks about it every day	Mislim, vsak dan govori o tem
I'm back now.	zdaj sem nazaj.
I don't think he'll ever know it was me.	Mislim, da nikoli ne bo vedel, da sem bil jaz.
I've done this before	To sem storil že prej

Which is a problem.	Kar je problem.
You would too.	Tudi ti bi.
I want to have it now	Rad bi ga imel zdaj

I was probably thinking there.	Verjetno sem tam mislil.
There was nothing else to say.	Nič drugega ni bilo za povedati.
And you saw very few people.	In videl si zelo malo ljudi.

I am more than a human being.	Sem več kot človek.
He must be happy.	Mora biti vesel.
I mean, you've heard so much	Mislim, toliko si slišal
Even if it isn't.	Tudi če ni.
And my father never did that.	In moj oče tega nikoli ni storil.
All this is something.	Vse to je nekaj.
I mean, nobody.	Mislim, nihče.
It's nice to do that.	Lepo je to narediti.
But there was more to it than that.	Vendar je bilo nekaj več kot to.
I hope you got that.	Upam, da si to dobil.
That's wrong.	To je narobe.

There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
I expected more from him	Od njega sem pričakoval več

I can't come now	Ne morem priti zdaj
She didn't have to tell me where she was.	Ni ji bilo treba povedati, kje je.
Both for you and for me.	Tako zate kot zame.
You're not because you can't.	Nisi, ker ne moreš.
Is that enough?	Je to dovolj?
He decided.	Odločil se je.
I wasn’t sure before	Prej nisem bil prepričan

I knew what it was all about	Vedel sem, za kaj gre

Everything is right.	Vse je prav.
He wasn’t there when they did this to me.	Ni ga bilo tam, ko so mi to naredili.
I never made it.	Nikoli mi ga ni uspelo.
I told her to go.	Rekel sem ji, naj gre.
I never saw him again	Nisem ga več videl
However, this is not common.	Vendar to ni običajno.
I heard what you have to say	Slišal sem, kaj imaš za povedati
And on and on.	In še in še.
That's the one.	To je tisti.
They probably didn’t even know how.	Verjetno niti niso vedeli, kako.

I could tell she wouldn’t like that about me	Lahko bi rekel, da ji to ne bi bilo všeč pri meni
Maybe he has.	Mogoče ima.
I probably would.	Verjetno bi.
You shouldn't eat them	Ne bi jih smel jesti
I wanted these things.	Želel sem te stvari.
And you know what, he's right.	In veš kaj, prav ima.
And now they are gone.	In zdaj jih ni več.
He won.	Zmagal je.
That's what he told himself.	To si je rekel.
She didn't say anything to me either.	Tudi meni ni nič rekla.
We know all this for sure now.	Vse to zdaj zagotovo vemo.
And you can be together again.	In spet ste lahko skupaj.
I stayed there for a while and just waited	Tam sem ostal nekaj časa in samo čakal
Okay, really okay.	V redu, res v redu.
We had nothing to say.	Nismo imeli kaj povedati.
The only me is me.	Edini jaz sem jaz.
I hope he found you well	Upam, da te je dobro našel
I didn't see when they were	Nisem videl, ko so
He's not there.	Ni ga tam.
If or for.	Če ali za.
I believe he wanted to	Verjamem, da je hotel
I've never seen him	Nikoli ga nisem videl
You are someone who has things.	Ti si nekdo, ki ima stvari.
Maybe I should choose that too	Mogoče bi se tudi jaz odločil za to
You're not a good man.	Nisi dober človek.
I'm surprised he's here.	Presenečen sem, da je tukaj.
I thought it would be okay	Mislil sem, da bo v redu
Nothing was in place.	Nič ni bilo na mestu.
It could work.	Lahko bi uspelo.
I wasn't expecting you or anyone, really	Nisem pričakoval tebe ali nikogar, res
Go ahead and do just that.	Kar naprej in naredi prav to.
No one saw her out.	Nihče je ni videl ven.
I really did that	Res sem to počel
I think we need to know more about this	Mislim, da moramo vedeti več o tem
We had to go back.	Morali smo nazaj.
I love you here	Rad te imam tukaj
I already said that.	To sem že rekel.
I know why he went on like this	Vem zakaj je šel tako naprej
You know it always will.	Veš, da bo vedno.
I didn't have to work	Ni mi bilo treba delati
I would still like to do that	Še vedno bi rad to naredil
I have this all the time.	To imam ves čas.
I was sure he heard me	Prepričan sem bil, da me je slišal
I knew you would say something	Vedel sem, da boš nekaj rekel
I can't tell you about this anymore	Ne morem ti več povedati o tem
I thought that would be it.	Mislil sem, da bo to to.
I wanted my money	Hotel sem svoj denar
I always feel sorry for them	Vedno mi jih je žal
Because of this, something is going to happen.	Zaradi tega se bo nekaj zgodilo.
But only a little.	Vendar le malo.
I knew something was wrong	Vedel sem, da je nekaj narobe
I want you to know that you are not alone	Želim, da veš, da nisi sam
We are not so sure.	Nismo tako prepričani.
It's not like you.	To ni kot ti.
He really liked it.	Res mu je bil všeč.
We did it all together.	Naredili vse skupaj.
Really, there can be nothing.	Res, ne more biti nič.
They also saw something.	Videli tudi nekaj.
I had more time and more and more	Imel sem več časa in vedno več
I gave him what he needed	Dal sem mu, kar je potreboval
There was little time.	Časa je bilo malo.
I was ready for that	Na to sem bil pripravljen
I don't think you had anything to do with it.	Mislim, da nisi imel nič s tem.
We never did.	Nikoli nismo.
I don't need anything.	nič ne potrebujem.
I could go there.	Lahko bi šel tja.
I think you're right.	Mislim, da imaš prav.
We saw her.	Videli smo jo.
And we will do that.	In to bomo storili.
I thought he did a good job	Mislil sem, da je opravil dobro delo
It would be very easy.	Bilo bi zelo lahko.
We have problems.	Imamo težave.
It wasn't what you expected.	Ni bila to, kar si pričakoval.
He has three more.	Ima še tri.
I suspect that is the case.	Sumim, da je temu tako.
That was something more.	To je bilo nekaj več.
I just told her everything	Pravkar sem ji povedal vse
I have to eat.	moram jesti.
I would play it alone in my room	Igral bi ga sam v svoji sobi
He never told me when.	Nikoli mi ni povedal kdaj.
He couldn't stay here.	Ni mogel ostati tukaj.
I was no longer in my room	Nisem bil več v svoji sobi
Nobody wanted them.	Nihče jih ni hotel.
You seem to know a few things.	Zdi se, da veš nekaj stvari.
Her father told her that when he gave it to her.	Oče ji je to povedal, ko ji ga je dal.
I was here now.	Zdaj sem bil tukaj.
I wonder what I did wrong.	Sprašujem se, kaj sem naredil narobe.
That was not my problem.	To ni bil moj problem.
I wanted to know everything	Hotel sem vedeti vse
I really liked her.	Zelo mi je bila všeč.
I thought you were going to say that	Mislil sem, da boš to rekel
Me or mine.	Jaz ali moj.
I doubt anyone ever did	Dvomim, da je kdo kdaj storil
She said it was okay.	Rekla je, da je v redu.
Nothing will happen to him.	Nič se mu ne bo zgodilo.
I already told you that.	To sem ti že povedal.
I just thought it was time	Samo mislil sem, da je čas
This time will be upon us.	Ta čas bo na nas.
Can anyone help me please.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga prosim.
She's good at it.	V tem je dobra.
I don't want anything from you	Nič ne želim od tebe
He wants to talk to you.	Želi govoriti s tabo.
I'm glad to see you here.	Vesel sem, da te vidim tukaj.
Instead, he saw that there was no need to do them.	Namesto tega je videl, da jih ni treba narediti.
I am sure that is the case	Prepričan sem, da je temu tako
I didn't say no	Nisem rekel, da ni
I couldn't because you couldn't	Nisem mogel, ker ti nisi mogel
I want my money back	Želim svoj denar nazaj
And maybe it's true.	In morda je res.
You always were.	Vedno si bil.
I could come tomorrow and stay a few days.	Lahko bi prišel jutri in ostal nekaj dni.
I think everything is happening to me here.	Mislim, da se mi tukaj vse dogaja.
Probably because there wasn’t much else to eat	Verjetno zato, ker ni bilo veliko drugega za jesti
It seemed like no one else was there.	Zdelo se je, kot da ni nikogar drugega.
I feel a little better about what’s going on right now	Malo bolje se počutim glede tega, kar se zdaj dogaja
That's why it was hard for him.	Zato mu je bilo težko.
No one has done this before.	Tega ni počel še nihče.
I feel good.	Počutim se dobro.
I believe that is the case.	Verjamem, da je temu tako.
And nothing else.	In nič drugega.
Do this, do that, do that.	Naredi to, naredi to, naredi to.
I didn’t even think it was possible	Sploh si nisem mislil, da je to mogoče
I think that would be fine	Mislim, da bi bilo to v redu
There is nothing more to say.	Nič več ni za povedati.
He had a few more at home.	Še nekaj jih je imel doma.
There is usually a good reason for this.	Običajno obstaja dober razlog za to.
Life is not like that.	Življenje ni tako.
I love it when he does that	Všeč mi je, ko to počne
I hope you leave soon	Upam, da boš kmalu odšel
I wasn’t always there for you	Nisem bil vedno tam zate
Maybe he's busy.	Mogoče je zaposlen.
It was the whole time.	To je bilo ves čas.
I often think that.	To pogosto mislim.
I need to know everything	Vse moram vedeti
I will never be alone again	Nikoli več ne bom sam
I knew it was for me	Vedel sem, da je zame
Even if she was good.	Tudi če bi bila dobra.
He didn’t want to stay and help anyone.	Ni hotel ostati in nikomur pomagati.
It's because of you.	To je zaradi tebe.
There would be so many.	Toliko bi jih.
After from.	Po od.
And there is nothing wrong.	In nič ni narobe.
I didn’t see him too much after that.	Po tem ga nisem preveč videl.
I knew I wanted to move on	Vedel sem, da bi želela, da grem naprej

I found nothing wrong with that	S tem nisem našel nič narobe
I was fine with that.	S tem sem bil v redu.
I've never seen him like that before	Še nikoli ga nisem videl takega
I let you do that.	To sem ti dovolil.
I'm sure your teacher didn't tell you that	Prepričan sem, da vam učitelj tega ni rekel
He will come back to me.	Vrnil se bo k meni.
I asked him what happened	Vprašal sem ga, kaj se je zgodilo
Everything was there, everything she could want and more.	Vse je bilo tam, vse kar si je lahko želela in še več.
I'm not at all surprised.	Niti malo nisem presenečen.
You shouldn't do that at all.	Tega sploh ne bi smeli storiti.
But it's not possible.	Vendar ni mogoče.
A lot had to be done	Veliko je bilo treba narediti
I'm sure they never were.	Prepričan sem, da nikoli niso bili.
You know how he's doing.	Saj veš kako mu gre.
No one will talk to us.	Nihče ne bo govoril z nami.
No.	Ne.
There were too many of them.	Bilo jih je preveč.
He saw, but wouldn't tell her.	Videl je, a ji ni hotel povedati.
Just a lot of that is happening.	Samo veliko tega se dogaja.
However, this is not happening.	Vendar se to ne dogaja.
They had no money.	Niso imeli denarja.
I didn’t know how long he would stay.	Nisem vedel, kako dolgo bo ostal.
And on and on.	In še in naprej.

I didn't have to do that	Tega mi ni bilo treba storiti
That's why they're there.	Zato so tam.
I was a.	Jaz sem bil.
He's been there before.	Tam je bil že prej.
He knew so well.	Tako dobro je vedel.
He succeeded.	Uspelo mu je.
He sat back.	Sedel je nazaj.
We know little about this.	O tem vemo malo.
It happened very quickly.	Zgodilo se je zelo hitro.
One no longer knows who he is.	Človek ne ve več, kdo je.
I just need to know he's there	Samo vedeti moram, da je tam
I didn't want to know.	Nisem hotel vedeti.
There was nothing like here.	Nič ni bilo tako kot tukaj.
You will have to do something about it.	S tem boste morali nekaj narediti.
I lost too much.	Izgubil sem preveč.
I probably should have told her earlier	Verjetno bi ji moral povedati že prej
I could go back	Lahko bi šel nazaj

I mean, you were there	Mislim, bil si tam
It actually feels good.	Pravzaprav se dobro počuti.
I didn't say that at all	Tega sploh nisem rekel

It must be good.	Mora biti dobro.
There is nothing more to say.	Nič več ni za povedati.

I'm just not sure.	Samo nisem prepričan.
Something like that.	Nekaj ​​takega.
I want to do it	Želim to narediti

None of this felt right to me.	Nič od tega se mi ni zdelo prav.
There were things and more.	Bilo je stvari in še več.

I’m not sure if that’s true.	Nisem prepričan, če je to res.

I can’t believe they’re still a thing	Ne morem verjeti, da so še vedno stvar
I tried to believe that	Poskušal sem verjeti v to
I need to know what he wanted to say	Moram vedeti, kaj je hotel povedati
Maybe I won't go long	Mogoče ne grem še dolgo
That's what I'll do.	Tako bom naredil.
I wonder what that says? 	Zanima me, kaj to pravi?
he wondered	se je vprašal
We have to help her.	Pomagati ji moramo.
I wouldn't ask for that	Tega ne bi prosil
I could go to my room	Lahko bi šel v svojo sobo
And he left me at home.	In pustil me je doma.
We did it right.	Naredili smo prav.
But I couldn’t say for sure	Nisem pa mogel povedati zagotovo
He's better than that.	On je boljši od tega.
I know it is.	Vem, da je.
I would like to know	Rad bi vedel
I believe what he says	Verjamem v to, kar pravi
You think you can, but you can't.	Misliš, da lahko, pa ne moreš.
I think he should stay with us for now	Mislim, da bi za zdaj moral ostati z nami
We don't.	Mi pa ne.
He became angry.	Postal je jezen.
He won and we both knew.	Zmagal je in oba sva vedela.
I wanted to be with you	Hotel sem biti s tabo
It's nice to see that.	Lepo je to videti.
It can't be anymore.	Več ne more biti.
I thought that's why we're here	Mislil sem, da smo zato tukaj
Maybe I would like to buy it.	Mogoče bi jo želela kupiti.
I know where they are	Vem, kje so
I asked, but it wasn't enough	Prosil sem, a ni bilo dovolj
He is here to help you.	Je tukaj, da vam pomaga.
I've already lost everything	Vse sem že izgubil
I was pretty tired	Bil sem precej utrujen
Maybe it's nothing.	Mogoče ni nič.
I am the one who started it.	Jaz sem tisti, ki ga je začel.

And he was definitely a good friend.	In zagotovo je bil dober prijatelj.
I have a lot of work	Imam veliko dela

It seemed like it needed to be done.	Zdelo se je, da je treba narediti.
I think that's true	Mislim, da je to res

That's my father.	To je moj oče.
She said nothing more.	Nič več ni rekla.
Without o.	Brez o.
Who would have thought.	Kdo bi si mislil.
.	.
Definitely yes, he says.	Zagotovo da, pravi.
Again, no.	Še enkrat, ne.
And maybe it's true.	In morda je res.
I could never eat like that again	Nikoli več ne bi mogel jesti tako
That's the good thing about it.	To je dobra stvar za to.
I can't help but get tired	Ne morem si pomagati, da sem utrujen
It could be him.	To bi lahko bil on.
I also thought it was pretty good	Tudi sam sem mislil, da je to precej dobro

We should do this going forward.	To bi morali narediti naprej.
I think you may be right	Mislim, da imaš morda prav
I wanted to know who he was	Hotel sem vedeti, kdo je
But maybe that's not right.	Morda pa to ni prav.
A lot of this is happening	Veliko tega se dogaja
He wanted something else.	Želel je nekaj drugega.

I don’t think there’s much else to talk about	Mislim, da ni veliko drugega za govoriti
So it was with him.	Tako je bilo tudi z njim.
He also lost his job.	Izgubil je tudi službo.
He did this for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa je to storil.
However, he could not do that.	Vendar tega ni mogel storiti.
He is the one for you.	On je pravi zate.
I can not.	Ne morem.
I gave it to him	To sem mu dal
I'm not alone in this	Pri tem nisem sam

There seemed to be nothing here.	Zdelo se je, da tukaj ni nič.

How can I do that.	Kako lahko to storim.
I know how it is.	Vem, kako je.
I've never seen anyone like that before.	Še nikoli nisem videl nikogar takega.

I thought you might know something	Mislil sem, da morda nekaj veš
Maybe I’m the only one who’s not surprised	Morda sem edini, ki ni presenečen

I didn't want to do that	Nisem hotel tega narediti
Maybe you will too.	Mogoče boš tudi ti.

I don't have to tell her what's wrong.	Ni mi treba ji povedati, kaj je narobe.

It all seems too much to me.	Vse skupaj se mi zdi preveč.
It's been there so long.	Tako dolgo je bilo tam.
I know life will not be easy for us	Vem, da nam življenje ne bo lahko
Unfortunately, this is not the case.	Temu žal ni tako.
Everything they ever did to me.	Vse, kar so mi kdaj storili.
I wonder how often he does that.	Zanima me, kako pogosto to počne.
It wouldn’t be what it is now.	Ne bi bil to, kar je zdaj.
He has to move on.	Mora naprej.
I have, you have, we all have	Jaz imam, ti imaš, vsi imamo
I just didn’t know this was it	Samo nisem vedel, da je to to
I came a long time to see you	Dolgo sem prišel, da bi te videl

I still have that.	Še vedno imam to.
I completely understand.	Popolnoma razumem.

I can't see him like that	Ne morem ga videti tako
That’s when I saw why there’s nothing here	Takrat sem videl, zakaj tukaj ni ničesar
That's more money for us.	To je za nas več denarja.
He will be waiting for you.	Čakal te bo.
All the what ifs.	Vse kaj če.
That will be a lot.	To bo veliko.
I want to go home and	Želim iti domov in
That's all I want to do.	Samo to želim narediti.
She probably didn't know what else to say.	Verjetno ni vedela, kaj bi še rekla.
I couldn’t believe this was it	Nisem mogel verjeti, da je to to
There was no help.	Ni bilo pomoči.
You have enough time.	Časa imaš dovolj.
Maybe next.	Mogoče naslednji.
I wanted some time alone with you	Želel sem nekaj časa sam s tabo
There was no reason.	Ni bilo zakaj.
Someone had to do it	Nekdo je to moral narediti
We have time.	Imamo čas.
None of that.	Nič od tega.
That's it.	To je to.
I wasn't sure.	Nisem bil prepričan.

I didn't talk to him	Nisem govoril z njim
I have to go home.	moram domov.
I know you know what happened	Vem, da veš kaj se je zgodilo
I need to know if you have	Moram vedeti, če imaš
I’ve been around long enough to know when it’s not good.	Dovolj dolgo sem že, da vem, kdaj ni dobro.
I will always be here for you	Vedno bom tukaj zate
It seems right.	Zdi se prav.
And she was out of money.	In bila je brez denarja.
This is wrong.	To je narobe.
I know how that is possible	Vem, kako je to mogoče
I never asked.	Nikoli nisem vprašal.
And and that may or may not be true.	In in to je lahko res ali pa tudi ne.
And that's the problem.	In to je problem.
I know too many things.	Preveč stvari vem.

I see well.	Vidim dobro.
We've seen that before.	To smo že videli.
You will.	Ti boš.
I can't say what he thinks	Ne morem povedati, kaj si misli
I'm sorry I told you.	Žal mi je, da sem ti povedal.
I've been there before.	Bil sem že tam.
I don't think that was my thing	Mislim, da to ni bila moja stvar
I knew it was day	Vedel sem, da je to dan
I will do that and nothing more.	To bom naredil in nič več.
I didn’t even expect that to happen	Sploh nisem pričakoval, da se bo to zgodilo
I can't stay here anymore	Ne morem več ostati tukaj
And that was today.	In to je bilo danes.
I didn't buy anything at all	Sploh nisem nič kupil
And I'm like.	In jaz sem kot.
I had to do that.	To sem moral narediti.
I'll tell you when we do	Povedal vam bom, ko bomo to naredili

I have decided	Odločil sem se
He was still there.	Še vedno je bil tam.
It was pretty hard.	Bilo je precej težko.
You will never do that.	Tega ne boste nikoli storili.
I could see she liked it.	Videl sem, da ji je to všeč.
They had a good life.	Imeli so dobro življenje.
I wish we could all see us together	Želim si, da bi nas vsi videli skupaj
Nobody likes her.	Nihče je ne mara.
I was not good.	nisem bil dober.
Today is supposed to be a good day.	Danes naj bi bil dober dan.
He saw more than that.	Videl je več kot to.
And she was.	In bila je.
Maybe you're right.	Mogoče imaš prav.
You've been around a lot.	Veliko si bil.
But I would never do that.	Tega pa nikoli ne bi storil.
No, there was no one at the moment.	Ne, trenutno ni bilo nikogar.
Or very simple.	Ali zelo preprosto.
I will stay with you	ostal bom s tabo
There is .	Obstaja .
I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.	Žal mi je, nič ne moremo storiti.
You can imagine what he was doing.	Lahko si mislite, kaj je počel.
Long and hard.	Dolgo in težko.
I suspect everything and everything	Sumim na vse in na vse
I will not ask you again	ne bom te več prosil
Now that's not the case.	Zdaj temu ni tako.
We will have to come to me.	Morali bomo k meni.
It was afternoon.	Bilo je popoldne.
I've never seen her tonight	Še nikoli je nisem videl nocoj
No one wanted to talk about it.	Nihče ni hotel govoriti o tem.
Do what you have to do.	Naredi, kar moraš.
It doesn’t seem like much, does it.	Ne zdi se veliko, kajne.
I haven't even seen that.	Tega niti nisem videl.
I mean, there weren't that many.	Mislim, ni jih bilo toliko.
That happened.	To se je zgodilo.
I thought you'd be here	Mislil sem, da boš tukaj
I know some of them.	Nekaj ​​jih poznam.
I can't come to dinner.	Ne morem priti na večerjo.

No, seriously, it is.	Ne, resno, je.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​ni bilo v redu.
That wasn't true either.	Tudi to ni bilo res.
And I wouldn't.	In ne bi.
However, there is more.	Vendar pa je še več.
This is done as follows.	To se naredi na naslednji način.
I have nothing.	Nimam ničesar.
I didn't want to see her	Nisem je hotel videti
I think that's just the thing	Mislim, da je to samo stvar
She never knew it could look so beautiful.	Nikoli ni vedela, da je mogoče videti tako lepo.
I think they always have been	Mislim, da so bili vedno
But they are not the only ones.	Vendar nista edina.
I really like this question.	To vprašanje mi je zelo všeč.
Yes yes Yes.	Da da Da.

I don't know what.	ne vem kaj.

I think she will do very well	Mislim, da ji bo to zelo dobro uspelo
She looked wrong.	Videti je bila narobe.
I know a lot of people have them.	Vem, da jih ima veliko ljudi.
I don't think I could either.	Zdi se, da tudi ne bi mogel.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo stvari.
I have to do things my own way	Moram narediti stvari po svoje
I've never seen him play better	Še nikoli ga nisem videl igrati bolje
I didn't expect to see you again	Nisem pričakoval, da te bom še kdaj videl

It simply does not exist.	To preprosto ne obstaja.

I wanted to talk to you	Hotel sem govoriti s tabo

I wonder if he knows	Zanima me, če ve

Maybe he's there.	Morda je tam.

I've never heard of such a thing	Še nikoli nisem slišal za kaj takega

I always am.	Vedno sem.
I didn’t even wait to see where it was going	Nisem niti čakal, da vidim, kam gre
But I didn't like it.	Vendar mi ni bilo všeč.
I thought he needed some time.	Mislil sem, da potrebuje nekaj časa.
I really don’t see that happening.	Res ne vidim, da bi se to zgodilo.
Alas, this is not the case.	Žal, temu ni tako.
He wants me now.	Želi me takoj.
Probably years.	Verjetno leta.
I have to be with him	Moram biti z njim
I need to know that's not true	Moram vedeti, da to ni res
He's sorry.	Žal mu je.
There really is little more to say.	Res je malo več za povedati.

I wonder who will be next?	Zanima me kdo bo naslednji?
This is going to happen.	To se bo zgodilo.
I'll have to know more	Moral bom vedeti več

I can't even speak	Ne morem niti govoriti

That's how she succeeded.	Tako ji je uspelo.
I'm ready for something.	Pripravljen sem na nekaj.
I'm sure he is.	Prepričan sem, da je.
I can't do that to you right now	Tega ti trenutno ne morem storiti
Not because it was good.	Ne zato, ker je bilo dobro.
I'm a very, very good guy.	Sem zelo, zelo dober fant.
I have nothing to say to any of you.	Nikomur od vas nimam kaj povedati.
I thought you should see me more.	Mislil sem, da bi me morala več videti.

That's not good.	To ni dobro.
This could be my chance.	To bi lahko bila moja priložnost.

It was not.	Ni bilo.
I have my problems too.	Tudi jaz imam svoje težave.
I could get it for you	Lahko bi ga dobil zate

He could come alone	Lahko bi prišel sam
Either way, we haven’t seen her in years.	Tako ali tako je nismo videli več let.
I am convinced of that.	v to sem prepričan.

I wasn’t sure if they were right	Nisem bil prepričan, če so imeli prav

He told me how he felt.	Povedal mi je, kako se počuti.
Now he has.	Zdaj ima.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
I know I wouldn't.	Vem, da ne bi.
I can't believe she's gone	Ne morem verjeti, da je ni več

I first met him three days earlier.	Prvič sem ga srečal tri dni prej.
I never asked for that	Tega nisem nikoli prosil

i will try to be.	poskušal bom biti.
Alone.	Sam.

So very, very tired.	Tako zelo, zelo utrujen.
And until then.	In do takrat.
I was not very happy.	Nisem bil zelo vesel.
It could be you too.	Lahko bi bil tudi ti.
It might not.	Morda ne bo.
I just didn’t want to believe it	Preprosto nisem hotel verjeti

I wish it was that simple.	Želim si, da bi bilo tako preprosto.
You went out this morning.	Danes zjutraj si šel ven.
If not.	Če ni.

I haven't done anything in a long time	Že dolgo nisem nič naredil

You certainly can't do that.	Tega zagotovo ne moreš storiti.

Also not next or next.	Prav tako ne naslednji ali naslednji.
Just like she did.	Tako kot je storila.
He was supposed to help with that	Pri tem naj bi pomagal

I've never heard of it.	Še nikoli nisem slišal za to.
I am very happy to be	Zelo sem vesel, da sem
I'm just doing this with you	To počnem samo s tabo
I can't see her as my own yet	Ne morem je še videti kot svojo
Can you please help me.	Mi lahko prosim kdo pomaga.

There was never enough of it.	Nikoli ga ni bilo dovolj.
I won't do anything for you	Nič ne bom storil zate
I can't say what he did to him	Ne morem povedati, kaj je naredil z njim
I never wanted to be in this place	Nikoli nisem hotel biti na tem mestu
There must be nothing.	Mora biti nič.
I don't want help.	Nočem pomoči.
I saw he was home	Videl sem, da je doma
I wonder what that was	Sprašujem se, kaj je bilo to
Apparently it wasn't then.	Očitno takrat ni bilo.
He needed it.	Ta je to potreboval.
Really very long ago	Res zelo dolgo nazaj
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
He just told me he wanted to see us right away.	Pravkar mi je rekel, da nas želi takoj videti.
I didn't have much time	Nisem imel veliko časa
That should be a good thing.	To naj bi bila dobra stvar.
I didn’t expect any of this at all	Sploh nisem pričakoval nič od tega
Much better.	Veliko bolje.
I didn't have anything like that	Nisem imel nič takega
We should stay together.	Morali bi ostati skupaj.
A man in need of help.	Človek, ki potrebuje pomoč.
I'm not the only one	nisem edini
He is with us.	Z nami je.
You were a child.	Bil si otrok.
Someone will start talking.	Nekdo bo začel govoriti.
Z.	Z .
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
I think that's what we have to do.	Mislim, da je to tisto, kar moramo narediti.
I had to do something.	Moral sem nekaj narediti.
Do so.	Narediti tako.
Right.	Prav.
There was nothing that I could do	Nič nisem mogel narediti
Very busy.	Zelo zaposlen.
I could never see you like that	Nikoli te ne bi mogel videti tako
He had never seen him before.	Še nikoli ga ni videl.
I don't know what you are.	ne vem kaj si.
And he was good at it.	In bil je dober v tem.
I have to get out.	moram ven.
I had never been so happy to come home before.	Nikoli prej nisem bil tako vesel, da sem prišel domov.
I doubt much will come of it.	Dvomim, da bo iz tega veliko.
I can't be.	ne morem biti.
I played really well.	Igral sem res dobro.
I can't believe you had time	Ne morem verjeti, da si imel čas
You will only need to do this once.	To boste morali storiti samo enkrat.
I was waiting for someone like you	Čakal sem na nekoga, kot si ti
I would never do anything	Nikoli ne bi naredil ničesar
I don't think that's right.	Mislim, da to ni prav.
I think he realized it was me	Mislim, da je spoznal, da sem jaz
The time for that with him has not yet come.	Čas za to z njim še ni prišel.
This was the first time.	To je bilo prvič.
I can never tell you how much.	Nikoli ti ne morem povedati, koliko.
I don't want him to know we saw him.	Nočem, da ve, da smo ga videli.
I mean, something happened today	Mislim, danes se je nekaj zgodilo
I don't want money.	Nočem denarja.
You have to go, he said.	Moraš iti, je rekel.
I'm here for you.	Tukaj sem zate.
We had to know.	Morali smo vedeti.
I just know it happened	Samo vem, da se je zgodilo
He almost didn't want to.	Skoraj ni hotel.
That's it.	To je to.
Obviously not.	Očitno ni.
I very much hope that everything will be fine	Zelo upam, da bo vse v redu
I want you to talk to me about it	Želim si, da bi govoril z mano o tem
How long have we been there.	Kako dolgo smo že tam.
This is really good work.	To je res dobro delo.
You used to play me.	Prej si me igral.
It's not very difficult.	Ni zelo težko.
Because he said he would.	Ker je rekel, da bo.
I didn’t think he could do that	Nisem si mislil, da lahko to stori
We have three children.	Imamo tri otroke.
I asked if he needed anything else	Vprašal sem, če še kaj potrebuje
I much prefer children	Veliko raje imam otroke
Without letting me.	Ne da bi mi dovolil.
I feel at home	Počutim se kot doma
Today, I am even more convinced of that.	Danes sem v to še bolj prepričan.
And I'm so tired.	In tako sem utrujen.
You are the problem.	Ti si problem.
Just your own.	Samo svoje.
Actually, no, that wouldn’t happen.	Pravzaprav ne, to se ne bi zgodilo.
That's probably why.	Verjetno zato.
I didn't want that.	Tega nisem hotel.
Without him, we would be much better off.	Brez njega bi nam bilo veliko bolje.
I didn't say that	Nisem tako govoril
Someone should.	Nekdo bi moral.
He helped me.	Pomagal mi je.
And as it is.	In kot je.
It's not what it seems.	Ni to kar se zdi.
Unfortunately, this would never happen.	Žal se to ne bi nikoli zgodilo.
We all had a great time.	Vsi smo se imeli lepo.
In fact, I didn’t like them too much	Pravzaprav mi niso bili preveč všeč
We didn't need it.	Ni nam bilo treba.
They didn't do that.	Tega niso storili.
It's easy.	Lahko je.
Maybe you already are.	Morda ste že.
More needs to be done.	Več je treba narediti.
So much was true.	Toliko je bilo res.
I asked if anyone wanted to go with me	Vprašal sem, če želi kdo iti z mano
I mean, if you're not ready yet.	Mislim, če še nisi pripravljen.
I am very tired of this	Zelo sem utrujen od tega
I believe and that is enough	Verjamem in to je dovolj
Nobody said that.	Tega ni rekel nihče.
I was lucky she was there	Imel sem srečo, da je bila tam
I hope it will be soon	Upam, da bo kmalu
I worked with him once.	Enkrat sem delal z njim.
You just have to do it	Samo narediti moraš
I'm going for it.	Grem za to.
I have to go home now	Zdaj moram domov
I don’t want to see what’s out there right now	Ne bi rad videl, kaj je zdaj tam
I would love to help too	Tudi jaz bi rad pomagal
I know better than to do that.	Vem bolje kot to storiti.
And it's not easy for her.	In ji ni lahko.
It was really right.	Res je bilo prav.
I don't have time to go into this	Nimam časa iti v to
If anyone can help me, I can.	Če mi lahko kdo pomaga, mi lahko.
Fortunately, we don't have to	Na srečo nam ni treba
I wasn’t sure what was in front of me	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj je pred mano
We were too many kids.	Preveč otrok smo bili.
I needed something to live on	Potreboval sem nekaj za življenje
we really aren't.	res nismo.
She didn't need to say more.	Ni ji bilo treba povedati več.

I think it's okay.	Mislim, da je v redu.
You should know these things.	Te stvari bi moral vedeti.
I want to know what's going on	Želim vedeti, kaj se dogaja
I've never seen that.	Tega nisem nikoli videl.
Actually.	Pravzaprav.
As you must.	Kot moraš.
I will help you all	Vsem vam bom pomagal
Okay, that's it.	V redu, to je to.
I'll tell you everything	vse ti bom povedal
I don't think so.	Ne mislim tako.
I tried to speak, but nothing happened.	Poskušal sem govoriti, a se ni zgodilo nič.
I failed	Ni mi uspelo
This is all good.	Vse to je dobro.
I'll be leaving before tomorrow.	Odšel bom pred jutri.
I'm really sorry you know	Res mi je žal, da veš
Which was right for me.	Kar mi je bilo prav.
But they did not know what they had done.	Vendar niso vedeli, kaj so storili.
I wanted to know who it was	Hotel sem vedeti, kdo je to
A boy too.	Tudi fant.
I was just surprised.	Bil sem samo presenečen.
No need to go together.	Ni treba iti skupaj.
Which is not.	Kar pa ni.
I had something to do	Imel sem nekaj za početi
A lot of money.	Veliko denarja.
He came out and he really did.	Prišel je ven in res je to storil.
I didn't like him either	Tudi meni ga ni bilo všeč
Not so hard.	Niti tako težko.
I said everything.	povedal sem vse.
It was really hard work for me.	Zame je bilo res težko delo.
I really thought it was more than more	Res sem mislil, da je to več kot več
This is a very difficult question.	To je zelo težko vprašanje.
I won't, not even for you.	Ne bom, tudi zate.
It was there, right there.	Tam je bilo, prav tam.
He was ready to go.	Bil je pripravljen iti.
But I know better	Vem pa bolje
I feel like there’s something there	Počutim se, kot da je tam nekaj
I know it will happen.	Vem, da se bo zgodilo.
He had so much to tell her.	Toliko ji je imel povedati.
So we did just that.	Tako smo naredili prav to.
I wasn’t sorry, not then	Ni mi bilo žal, takrat ne
He went out.	Odšel je ven.
I didn’t come here to start trouble	Nisem prišel sem, da bi začel težave
And you know that's true.	In veš, da je to res.
He played them for me.	Igral mi jih je.
It feels like forever.	Počuti se kot za vedno.
And so for us.	In tako tudi za nas.
I was trying to see who he was	Poskušal sem videti, kdo je
I hope he does too.	Upam, da tudi on.
Okay, a lot.	V redu, veliko.
She's better now.	Zdaj ji je bolje.
That's what he meant.	To je mislil.
It will be very soon.	To bo zelo kmalu.
I won't be here long	Ne bom več dolgo tukaj

I didn't expect to see you	Nisem pričakoval, da te vidim
She would say she was sorry and .	Rekla bi, da ji je žal in .
I just want you to be ready	Želim samo, da si pripravljen
I was there.	Bil sem tam.
He said he was right, you know.	Rekel je, da ima prav, veš.
I think so	Mislim, da je bilo tako
I gave her a chance not to go.	Dal sem ji možnost, da ne gre.
I don’t know how that happened	Ne vem, kako se je to zgodilo
But he didn't do more.	Več pa ni naredil.
I thought no one could be there	Mislil sem, da nihče ne more biti tam
Or much else.	Ali veliko drugega.
There is nothing before that.	Pred tem ni nič.
I tried to make sure there was nothing	Poskušal sem se prepričati, da ni nič
You told me.	Povedal si mi.
I mean, none of that is my thing	Mislim, nič od tega ni moja stvar
I think she loves him more than I do	Mislim, da ga ima rad bolj kot jaz
I have a lot to tell you and little time	Veliko ti imam za povedati in malo časa
He gave it to me.	To mi je dal.
I didn't have to tell anyone that.	Tega mi ni bilo treba povedati nikomur.
I waited and saw that you went to him	Čakal sem in videl, da si šel do njega
I hope we always will	Upam, da bomo vedno
It’s hard, but we wouldn’t like it if it could be.	Težko je, a nam ne bi bilo všeč, če bi bilo lahko.

I need time alone with you	Potrebujem čas sam s tabo
I just want to leave	Samo oditi želim

It was hard to see him.	Težko ga je bilo videti.
I have to go.	moram iti.
She was really very.	Bila je res zelo.
I didn't need to know that.	Tega mi ni bilo treba vedeti.
I did it.	uspelo mi je.
I just didn't find it.	Preprosto ga nisem našel.
I think someone told me something.	Mislim, da mi je nekdo nekaj povedal.
The question is when and not.	Vprašanje je kdaj in ne.
I think we have it all	Mislim, da imamo vse
I think he has to be very good	Mislim, da mora biti zelo dober
I need help with that.	Za to potrebujem pomoč.
I won't have that	tega ne bom imel
There was no time for school.	Za šolo ni bilo časa.
It's really not hard.	Res ni težko.
This is actually my job.	To je pravzaprav moje delo.
They didn't even see him.	Sploh ga niso videli.
You still know nothing, but you know you know nothing.	Še vedno nič ne veš, a veš, da ne veš nič.
He didn't know if it was true.	Ni vedel, če je res.
I want you to have them	Želim, da jih imaš
I said it was almost there	Rekel sem, da je skoraj tam
I knew he didn't want to be there	Vedela sem, da noče biti tam
I didn't hear that.	Tega nisem slišal.
I never told anyone about it	Nikoli nisem nikomur povedal o tem
I really like it	Res mi je zelo všeč
To work or not to work.	Delati ali ne delati.
They are now.	Zdaj so.
That's a good thing, too.	Tudi to je dobra stvar.
No, no, no.	Ne, ne, ne.
It was like yes.	Bilo je kot da.
If I weren’t human, I wouldn’t be.	Če ne bi bil človek, ne bi bil.
I had him here, he'll be alone soon	Imel sem ga tukaj, kmalu bo sam
I hope they will.	Upam, da bodo.
I should never have done that.	Nikoli tega ne bi smel storiti.
If nothing goes wrong.	Če ne gre nič narobe.
It was a game.	To je bila igra.
I'm doing better.	bolje mi gre.
Just something about that.	Samo nekaj o tem.
No one knows anymore or does anything better than him.	Nihče ne ve več ali ne naredi ničesar bolje od njega.
I also asked about it	Tudi jaz sem vprašal o tem
Let him come to them.	Naj pride k njim.
I didn’t want to do any of that	Nič od tega nisem hotel narediti
He never sat down.	Nikoli ni sedel.
Probably not.	Verjetno ga ni.
I wanted to make sure.	Hotel sem se prepričati.
I actually like this one	Ta mi je pravzaprav všeč
I don't want to go there anymore	Nočem več iti tja
Not to be a father.	Ne, da bi bil oče.
I really felt like this was it	Res sem se počutil, kot da je to to
No one has ever managed to do this.	To še nikomur ni uspelo.
It's us.	Nas to je.
He had a reason to tell her.	Imel je razlog, da ji je povedal.
That's us.	To smo mi.

I need him so badly now	Zdaj ga tako zelo potrebujem

I could no longer go to work or school	Nisem mogel več v službo ali šolo
I wish none of us were angry	Raje bi, da nihče od nas ni jezen
They were not then and they are not now.	Niso bili takrat in niso zdaj.
I probably didn't say it right	Verjetno nisem prav povedal
Probably because we are	Verjetno zato, ker smo
Neither do you.	Niti ti ne.
I believe I am there.	Verjamem, da sem tam.
Nice afternoon.	Lepo popoldne.
I think that's probably true.	Mislim, da je to verjetno res.
In fact, we can't.	Pravzaprav ne moremo.
I told you that.	To sem ti govoril.
I’m not too sure about that myself.	Sam nisem preveč prepričan o tem.
Went to work.	Odšel v službo.
He wants more.	Želi več.
He never comes out.	Nikoli ne pride ven.
I think we'll be fine	Mislim, da bomo v redu
That just isn’t good enough.	To preprosto ni dovolj dobro.
I am much more than that.	Jaz sem veliko več kot to.
I was sure you were here because you found me.	Prepričan sem bil, da si tukaj, ker si me našel.

But I didn't ask her	Nisem je pa vprašal

The day did not start well.	Dan se ni dobro začel.
I knew nothing about being a father.	Nič nisem vedel o tem, da sem oče.
I spoke to him last night	Sinoči sem govoril z njim
I couldn't do that to her	Tega ji nisem mogel storiti
I didn't call you.	Nisem te poklical.
She was human.	Bila je človek.
That's right now.	Zdaj je tako.
I was convinced of that	O tem sem bil prepričan
I won't need it for so long	Ne bom ga potreboval tako dolgo

It seems to be getting better every week.	Zdi se, da je vsak teden bolje.
I haven't been here that long either	Tudi jaz nisem bil tako dolgo tukaj

I didn't.	Nisem.
Don't say that.	Ne govori tako.
I know you wanted to help	Vem, da si hotel pomagati
Or maybe it wasn't him.	Ali pa morda ni bil on.
I just thought I should know	Samo mislil sem, da bi moral vedeti
I was gone	Ni mi bilo več
I want to work again	Rad bi spet delal
No one asked them.	Nihče jih ni vprašal.
But I seemed to know what to do with it	Zdelo se mi je pa, da vem, kaj narediti s tem

I will do this every day forever.	To bom počel vsak dan za vedno.

I don't know what to do about it	Ne vem, kaj naj storim glede tega
There was not enough time.	Ni bilo dovolj časa.
And it's not just me.	In nisem samo jaz.
Nothing does that today.	Danes nič ne naredi tega.
I’m not sure if that’s a problem or not.	Nisem prepričan, ali je to problem ali ne.
Just like we have.	Tako kot imamo.
I wonder why that is	Sprašujem se, zakaj je tako
I have to stay after that	Po tem moram ostati
I don't know what, even today	Ne vem kaj, še danes
And he was there.	In bil je tam.
I understand you want to do a good thing	Razumem, da želite narediti dobro stvar
However, there are not many of them.	Vendar jih ni veliko.
Everything was fine with me	Z mano je bilo vse v redu
There is no time for that.	Ni časa za to.
I didn’t know why he did it	Nisem vedel, zakaj je to storil
He'll be there tomorrow morning.	Tam bo že jutri zjutraj.
I thought you were going to tell her something like that	Mislil sem, da ji boš povedal kaj takega
I didn't have any money either	Tudi denarja nisem imel
I felt good	Dobro sem se počutil
That would be wrong.	To bi bilo narobe.
I would be happy.	Bil bi vesel.
They almost felt like they were here with me	Skoraj se mi je zdelo, da so tukaj z mano
Not much to do.	Ni veliko za početi.
I didn't ask.	nisem vprašal.
When he came out, he could not see her.	Ko je prišel ven, je ni mogel videti.
He has to believe.	Mora verjeti.
I saw for myself that it was true	Sam sem videl, da je res
I hope none of this.	Upam, da ni nič od tega.
I didn't know what she said	Nisem vedel, kaj je rekla
You know, probably not.	Veste, verjetno ne.
I never thought you would give me time.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da mi boš dal čas.
Not at all.	Niti malo.
That seemed wrong to me.	To se mi je zdelo narobe.
You'd better tell me	Raje bi mi povedal
I think you already know why	Mislim, da že veš zakaj
I've been here all along	Ves čas sem bil tukaj
We knew absolutely nothing.	Popolnoma nič nismo vedeli.
We have to be there.	Moramo biti tam.
But it is so.	Vendar je tako.
That wouldn't be a problem.	To ne bi bil problem.
She was often there alone.	Pogosto je bila tam sama.
I haven't been there in a long time	Že dolgo nisem bil tam
Nothing is as it seems.	Nič ni tako, kot se zdi.
I just don't know how to proceed.	Samo ne vem, kako naprej.
Which you may or may not want.	Kar morda želite ali pa ne.
I almost knew what it was	Skoraj sem vedel, kaj je to
I would love to do that.	rad bi to naredil.
You should go there too.	Tudi ti bi moral iti tja.
I want to start these things	Te stvari želim početi
I hope you think so, Father.	Upam, da tako misliš, oče.
He couldn't do that to us	Tega nam ne bi mogel storiti
I hope we don't see him for a while.	Upam, da ga še nekaj časa ne bomo videli.
Unfortunately, this is not possible.	Žal to ni mogoče.
I asked him if something was wrong	Vprašal sem ga, če je kaj narobe
He probably needs money.	Verjetno potrebuje denar.
We can't do that.	Tega ne moremo storiti.
However, knowing is not enough.	Vendar pa vedeti ni dovolj.
The question is how to do it.	Vprašanje je, kako to narediti.
I didn't feel good with him.	Nisem se dobro počutil z njim.
I doubt he will be surprised	Dvomim, da bo presenečen
There is a reason for this.	Za to obstaja razlog.
I waited here instead	Namesto tega sem čakal tukaj
In fact, it often is.	Pravzaprav je pogosto tako.
I can't help you there	Tam ti ne morem pomagati
I had problems because of you.	Zaradi tebe sem imel težave.
I was surprised to see him	Bil sem presenečen, ko sem ga videl
He always knows.	Vedno ve.
you have to come to me.	moraš priti k meni.
Like you said.	Kako si rekel.
I don't think any of that.	Nič od tega ne mislim.
I think it could be very good	Mislim, da bi lahko bilo zelo dobro
Then and there.	Takrat in tam.
I lost everything there	Tam sem izgubil vse
He asked if I could get it.	Vprašal je, če bi ga lahko dobil.
You know it's not.	Saj veš, da ni.
He did that.	To je storil.
Like a boy.	Kot fant.
Maybe he had.	Morda je imel.
Little by little.	Malo po malo.
He said again that he was sorry.	Spet je rekel, da mu je žal.
I will always see you	vedno te bom videl
I thought it might be you	Mislil sem, da si to morda ti
Maybe we should.	Mogoče bi morali.
Someone will find a way to do it.	Nekdo bo našel način za to.
She likes you, boy.	Všeč si ji, fant.
Now he saw.	Zdaj je videl.
There aren't many people.	Ni veliko ljudi.
I was glad he came back	Vesel sem bil, da se je vrnil
I understand why he did it	Razumem, zakaj je to storil
And I succeeded.	In mi je uspelo.
I’m not sure what the reason was	Nisem prepričan, kaj je bil razlog
Certainly not.	Zagotovo niso.
No, better not.	Ne, bolje ne.
I just wasn’t sure what to do about it	Preprosto nisem bil prepričan, kaj naj storim glede tega
That was not the case.	To ni bilo tako.
Much needs to be done	Veliko je treba narediti
I know him well enough	Poznam ga dovolj dobro
I have to do.	moram narediti.
It must be so.	Tako mora biti.
And just like that.	In prav tako.
I don’t care to try to do that.	Ne zanima me, da bi to poskušal narediti.
It was really nice, but it wasn't me.	Bilo je res lepo, a to nisem bil jaz.
But he found nothing, no one.	Vendar ni našel ničesar, nikogar.
But it seems that this would already be the case.	A zdi se, da bi temu že bilo tako.
I just need time	Potrebujem samo čas
I need some money.	Potrebujem nekaj denarja.
I never worked with him.	Nikoli nisem delal z njim.
I needed more than that	Potreboval sem več kot to
And I would.	In bi.
He knew more.	Vedel je več.
This is very likely.	To je zelo verjetno.
You can't work.	Ne moreš delati.
I felt better knowing that	Bolje sem se počutil, da to vem
he should know better	moral bi vedeti bolje
We should leave.	Morali bi oditi.
And saw there.	In videl tam.
I knew it.	Vedel sem.
These are just a few.	To je le nekaj.
I have not returned to this room since	Od takrat se nisem več vrnil v to sobo
Apparently a little too much	Očitno malo preveč
I still have a lot of work to do.	Imam še veliko dela.
Maybe that would be good for us.	Mogoče bi bilo to dobro za nas.
He's good at it.	V tem je dober.
I haven't even seen him yet	Sploh ga še nisem videl
It may never come.	Morda nikoli ne pride.
Because it's me.	Ker sem jaz.
There was so little time and so much to say.	Bilo je tako malo časa in toliko za povedati.
I have enough for a week	Za teden imam dovolj
I was happy about that	Bil sem vesel tega
I've never had it before	Nikoli prej je nisem imel
He did his best.	Naredil je vse mogoče.
You just don't know that.	Samo tega ne veš.
I was fine with that	Bilo mi je v redu s tem
He wanted to.	Je želel.
I want to do something too.	Tudi jaz si želim nekaj narediti.
I think it probably is.	Mislim, da verjetno je.
I didn’t know it was that long	Nisem vedel, da je tako dolgo
These are problems.	To so težave.
I have to leave.	Moram oditi.
It can't be true.	Ne more biti res.
I was surprised he said so much to me	Presenečen sem bil, da je toliko povedal z mano
I can do that if you want	To lahko storim, če želiš
And work in the city.	In delati v mestu.
It was what it was.	Bilo je, kar je bilo.
We have never seen her since.	Od takrat je nismo nikoli videli.
I have to do this now	To moram storiti zdaj
I can't come now, not today	Ne morem priti zdaj, ne danes
I haven’t been able to do this to anyone for years	Tega nisem mogel nikomur narediti že leta
I already know what happened	Že vem, kaj se je zgodilo
No, not like that.	Ne, ne tako.
All so fast.	Vse tako hitro.
I passed.	opravil sem.
However, this is clearly not the case.	Vendar očitno temu ni tako.
I met you and I knew it was you	Spoznal sem te in vedel sem, da si to ti
I think he was right	Mislim, da je imel prav
I couldn't be either	Tudi jaz ne bi mogel biti
I won't have it.	Ne bom ga imel.
I would die here alone	Umrl bi tukaj sam
I mean, you gave me everything	Mislim, dal si mi vse
I tried and I failed	Poskušal sem in mi ni uspelo
I can't talk about it	Ne morem govoriti o tem
Just once.	Samo enkrat.
I'm too sorry.	preveč mi je žal.
I know where that kid is.	Vem, kje je ta otrok.
I would never for nothing	Nikoli ne bi za nič
He didn't mean anything.	Ničesar ni mislil.
Maybe I'll do it sometime this week	Mogoče bom to naredil kdaj ta teden
I was there last night	Sinoči sem bil tam
I couldn't see her yet	Nisem je še mogel videti
They can and have been.	Lahko in so bili.
You really are.	Res ste to.
Did that really happen ?, he says.	Se je to res zgodilo?, pravi.
I couldn't tell you that.	Tega ti ne bi mogel povedati.
I couldn't help you	jaz ti ne bi mogel pomagati
Maybe I should do it.	Morda bi moral to storiti.
I'm glad if that was the case.	Vesel sem, če je bilo tako.
I'm so sorry this happened to you	Zelo mi je žal, da se ti je to zgodilo
I didn't feel well	Nisem se počutil dobro
This is not a question.	To pa ni vprašanje.
I have nowhere to go	nimam kam iti
I should have said that a long time ago	To bi moral povedati že dolgo prej
It's not us.	To nismo mi.
I heard something	nekaj sem slišal
I know what he's thinking	Vem, kaj si misli
I wanted to go.	hotel sem iti.
Now that he had.	Zdaj, ko je imel.
Everything was nice.	Vse je bilo lepo.
I won't tell you anything.	Ne bom ti nič povedal.
I mean, it's really happening	Mislim, res se dogaja
Years and years.	Leta in leta.
Now tell me what happened.	Zdaj mi povej, kaj se je zgodilo.
I don't think it was an issue at all	Mislim, da sploh ni bilo vprašanje
I didn't expect it from you	Nisem pričakoval od tebe
It was fine.	Bilo je v redu.
I expected a lot more from you	Od tebe sem pričakoval veliko več
Maybe he didn't see her.	Mogoče je ni videl.
I will never, ever forget you	Nikoli, nikoli te ne bom pozabil

Sometimes it can be difficult.	Včasih je lahko težko.
In fact, I think he expected it	Pravzaprav mislim, da je pričakoval
I feel almost fine again	Spet se počutim skoraj v redu
I should talk to him about it.	O tem bi moral govoriti z njim.
I'd rather stay and not leave	Raje bi ostal in ne odšel
He is like a father to me.	On mi je kot oče.
Maybe we should.	Morda bi morali.
I have a lot more to tell her	Še veliko ji moram povedati
It's nice to be here.	Lepo je biti tukaj.
I used to really like it	Včasih mi je bil zelo všeč
In fact, I know him very well	Pravzaprav ga zelo dobro poznam
I think money is good	Mislim, da je denar dober

I know she wants to tell you herself	Vem, da ti želi sama povedati
I feel at home.	Počutim se kot doma.
Let it be.	Naj bo.
Maybe it will be good.	Mogoče bo pa to dobro.
Work here.	Delo še tukaj.
I know what you mean	Vem kaj misliš

I just wanted you back in my life	Samo hotel sem te nazaj v moje življenje
I still can’t talk about it	Še vedno ne morem govoriti o tem
It's just you here.	Tukaj si samo ti.
I will know.	bom vedel.
I will come back for you	vrnil se bom po vas
We will never know if we were right or not.	Nikoli ne bomo vedeli, ali smo imeli prav ali ne.
There's really nothing to it.	Res ni nič na tem.
I started talking.	Začel sem govoriti.
Just live your life.	Samo živi svoje življenje.
I hope she failed	Upam, da ji ni uspelo

I want to move on	želim naprej
I wanted that too, but not now	Tudi jaz sem si to želela, a ne zdaj
And no money.	In brez denarja.
I understand you very well	zelo dobro te razumem

I don't even know anymore.	Sploh ne vem več.
You want to be there.	Želiš biti tam.
But if you think	Če pa misliš.
The question is why.	Vprašanje je zakaj.
I didn’t do those things	Te stvari nisem počel

He came alone.	Prišel je sam.
We don’t know what else it is.	Ne vemo, kaj drugega je.

I didn't really like it	Ni mi bilo prav všeč

With all this, I feel much better now	Ob vsem tem se zdaj počutim veliko bolje
I went back to my room	Vrnil sem se v svojo sobo
And we know who came back or came earlier.	In vemo, kdo se je vrnil ali prišel prej.

I can't tell you why.	Ne morem ti povedati zakaj.
I knew that was not the case	Vedel sem, da ni tako
But it was pretty obvious.	Vendar je bilo precej očitno.
I can't seem to help her	Zdi se, da ji ne morem pomagati
He wants to go with you.	Želi iti s tabo.
That didn't happen.	To se ni zgodilo.
None of us can.	Nihče od nas ne more.
There was something.	Nekaj ​​je bilo.
He sat next to me the whole time.	Ves čas je sedel ob meni.
Just like him.	Tako kot on.

I told her never to feel that way	Rekel sem ji, naj se nikoli tako ne počuti

I think that's enough	Mislim, da je to dovolj
I think he's good	Mislim, da je dober
Really very sorry.	Res zelo žal.
I wanted him to know	Hotel sem, da ve
i don't know how to do it.	ne vem, kako to narediti.

I've never seen him like that before	Še nikoli ga nisem videl takega
And what it’s like to want to talk.	In kako je, da želite govoriti.
I knew he was my father	Vedel sem, da je moj oče

Or me.	Ali pa jaz.
So, I learned so fast.	Tako, tako hitro sem se naučil.
He wants to go home again.	Spet želi domov.

Your father.	Tvoj oče.
I just wanted to go home	Hotel sem samo domov
I didn’t even know it was possible	Sploh nisem vedel, da je to mogoče
I hope you all succeed	Upam, da vam bo uspelo vsem

I was not sorry	Ni mi bilo žal
He couldn't even go and help her with that.	Sploh ni mogel iti in ji pri tem pomagati.
No, it can't be.	Ne, ne more biti.
I think we should just leave.	Mislim, da bi morali kar oditi.

It seems to be getting better.	Zdi se, da gre na bolje.
I wish you were here with me	Želim si, da bi bil tukaj z mano

I think you'll like it	Mislim, da ti bo všeč

I think maybe it's time you knew	Mislim, da je morda čas, da veš
But I have a problem.	Imam pa problem.
I didn’t even expect anything more	Sploh nisem pričakoval, da bo kaj več
I don't know, really.	Ne vem, res.

I know what he will say all the time	Vem, kaj bo ves čas rekel
I'm sure it will work.	Prepričan sem, da bo uspelo.
I may not succeed	Morda mi ne bo uspelo
He had to be.	Moral je biti.
I will do it again.	To bom storil še enkrat.
No one seemed to know where he was.	Zdelo se je, da nihče ni vedel, kje je.

Let him play.	Naj igra.
We will do this for you.	To bomo naredili za vas.
I’ve never felt this way about anyone before	Nikoli prej se nisem tako počutil do nikogar
I'm much better today	Danes mi je veliko bolje
No, she's good.	Ne, dobra je.
You will have plenty of time.	Imeli boste dovolj časa.
You didn't want anything else.	Drugega nisi hotel.
I'm not enough.	nisem dovolj.
I really wasn’t all there	Res nisem bil ves tam
This seemed hard to believe.	To se je zdelo težko verjeti.
I think he needs her	Mislim, da jo potrebuje
I'm afraid you're right	Bojim se, da imaš prav
He called her.	Poklical jo je.
I am you and you are me	jaz sem ti in ti si jaz
I wouldn’t ask him for help, ever again	Ne bi ga prosil za pomoč, nikoli več
However, it was not enough.	Pa vendar ni bilo dovolj.
And enough about me.	A dovolj o meni.
I'd like to get it.	Rad bi ga dobil.
I just didn’t want him in my room	Preprosto ga nisem hotel v svoji sobi
He didn't get much.	Ni dobil veliko.
He couldn't say for sure.	Ni mogel zagotovo povedati.
I didn't know all this	Vsega tega nisem vedel
If so.	Če je temu tako.
That he needed help.	Da je potreboval pomoč.
One can hope.	Človek lahko upa.
I didn't know you were in town	Nisem vedel, da si v mestu

I think that would happen	Mislim, da bi se to zgodilo
Yes, we are.	Da, smo.
I'm sure of that.	Prepričan sem o tem.
i really believe in it	res verjamem v to
I haven’t felt that way in a long time	Že dolgo se nisem tako počutil
I tried to make sure it was all a game	Poskušal sem se prepričati, da je vse igra
I only have a little time to live.	Imam le malo časa za življenje.
I didn’t know how to call it at the time	Takrat nisem vedel, kako bi temu rekel
I can't see you anymore	ne morem te več videti

I'm just a man.	jaz sem samo človek.
And there was more.	In bilo je še več.
I can't speak right away	Ne morem govoriti takoj

I understand that now	Zdaj to razumem
I could see that now	To sem lahko videl zdaj
It's going again.	Spet gre.

There is enough time now.	Zdaj je dovolj časa.
I know what it is.	Vem kaj je to.
I only left for a few things	Odšel sem samo zaradi nekaj stvari

But I knew it was much more than that	Vedel pa sem, da je veliko več kot to
I wished that day would come	Želela sem si, da bi prišel ta dan
He would love you.	Všeč bi mu bili.
I have not forgotten	nisem pozabil
I mean it	Mislim resno glede tega
Which is good, because it wasn't.	Kar je dobro, ker ni bilo.
You are absolutely right.	Imaš popolnoma prav.
You didn’t just do that.	Niste naredili samo tega.
I wouldn't be surprised if he left you here	Ne bi bil presenečen, če te je pustil tukaj
Only he could not do that.	Samo on tega ni mogel storiti.
It just didn’t seem like it.	Samo ni se zdelo.
I don't know what to think.	Ne vem kaj naj si mislim.
We have to stay there for a while.	Tam moramo ostati nekaj časa.
I was quite happy about that	Tega sem bil precej vesel
I can't do that	Tega si ne morem narediti

I was more than a little surprised	Bil sem več kot malo presenečen
I know he would go with me	Vem, da bi šel z mano
But I didn't come here alone.	Sem pa nisem prišel sam.
When she wasn't, he knew that too.	Ko ni bila, je to vedel tudi on.
Maybe there would never be time.	Mogoče nikoli ne bi bil čas.
I've been here a long time	Dolgo sem prišel
I never have and I never will	Nikoli nisem in nikoli ne bom
And how it feels.	In kot se počuti.
He was pretty sure he had it.	Precej prepričan je bil, da ima to.
I didn't ask him why	Nisem ga vprašal zakaj
And it goes on and on.	In gre naprej in naprej.
I decided not to.	Odločil sem se, da ne.
They never saw you.	Nikoli te niso videli.
He is what he is.	On je, kar je.
He was absolutely convinced of that.	V to je bil popolnoma prepričan.
I did something then	Takrat sem nekaj naredil
I haven't told anyone yet	Nikomur še nisem povedal

This is life .	To je življenje .
With you.	Pri vas.
I was lucky last night	Sinoči sem imel srečo

I could have done it sooner	Lahko bi to storil že prej
And it was wrong.	In bilo je narobe.
I didn't want to do that	Tega nisem hotel narediti
I need something, man	Potrebujem nekaj, človek
It was simple.	Bilo je preprosto.
i don't want to do that.	tega nočem storiti.
At as much as.	Na toliko kot.
In fact, it’s almost all about me.	Pravzaprav je skoraj vse o meni.
But my life.	Ali moje življenje.
That's almost true.	To je skoraj res.
We can't tell.	Ne moremo povedati.
But I probably don’t need it.	Verjetno ga pa ne potrebujem.
I shouldn't talk about it	Ne bi smel govoriti o tem
Everything had to be done.	Vse je bilo treba narediti.
Today is your day.	Danes je tvoj dan.
I knew she probably was	Vedel sem, da je verjetno bila
I did my job and did it well.	Opravil sem svoje delo in to dobro.
And maybe so.	In morda je tako.
However, it is not that simple.	Vendar ni tako preprosto.
I'm sure of it.	Prepričan sem o tem.
I always see everything	Vedno vidim vse
I thought it might be difficult for you.	Mislil sem, da ti bo morda težko.
I thought that was a good thing	Mislil sem, da je to dobra stvar
I would be better prepared	Bolje bi bil pripravljen
That was fine for that.	To je bilo v redu za to.
None of us should.	Nihče od nas ne bi smel.
That is what they are supposed to do.	To je tisto, kar naj bi storili.
I'll do it myself	To bom naredil sam
He didn't wait long.	Ni dolgo čakal.
We have more than that.	Imamo več kot to.
It was very, very difficult.	Bilo je zelo, zelo težko.
I'm lucky it's not.	Imam srečo, da ni.
However, it seems a bit simple.	Vendar se zdi nekoliko preprosto.
I think you have to do it	Mislim, da moraš to narediti
It's just there when it wasn't there yesterday.	Preprosto je tam, ko ga včeraj ni bilo.
I wouldn't wait for them.	Jaz jih ne bi čakal.
I'll tell her, just not yet	Povedal ji bom, samo še ne
They are few.	Malo so.
I think he knew it was that day.	Mislim, da je vedel, da je bil tisti dan.
I stayed there for three days	Tam sem ostal tri dni
Me too.	Tudi jaz.
Maybe you too.	Morda tudi ti.
Now here we are again.	Zdaj smo spet tukaj.

Not all of us liked it.	Vsem nam ni bilo všeč.
And today was the day.	In danes je bil dan.
I decided not to call anyone back now	Odločil sem se, da zdaj ne bom nikogar poklical nazaj

I haven't seen him since.	Od takrat ga nisem več videl.
I wished I was home	Želela sem si, da bi bil doma
I had a lot of work to do	Imel sem veliko dela
That's the way things are.	Tako so stvari.
I used to think it existed.	Včasih sem mislil, da obstaja.
I may never be able to eat again.	Morda nikoli več ne bom mogel jesti.
I hope one of you will hear from me.	Upam, da se bo kdo od vas slišal.
I didn’t feel like a person	Nisem se počutil kot oseba
He had done this before.	To je storil že prej.
I like it too.	Tudi meni je všeč.
I will never forget that.	Tega ne bom nikoli pozabil.
He could die tomorrow	Jutri bi lahko umrl
I think that's obvious.	Mislim, da je to očitno.
I wanted to know too	Tudi jaz sem hotel vedeti
I think he's right.	Mislim, da ima prav.
It only took me a little while.	Potreboval sem le malo časa.
It doesn't feel right.	Ne zdi se prav.
And there was nothing wrong with that.	In s tem ni bilo nič narobe.
That is certainly true.	To je zagotovo res.
As if it were true.	Kot da bi bilo res.
I should tell you something	Nekaj ​​bi ti moral povedati
I don't need to talk much.	Ni mi treba veliko govoriti.
I really need to go home	Res moram domov
You could do that.	To bi lahko storili.
There were very few of them.	Zelo malo jih je bilo.
My father wouldn't.	Moj oče ne bi.
I did this for fun.	To sem naredil za zabavo.
I found him right away	Takoj sem ga našel
I didn't see anyone	Nikogar nisem videl
A child I would probably never see	Otrok, ki ga verjetno ne bi nikoli videl
And so you will.	In tako boste.
I know you'd like that	Vem, da bi ti to bilo všeč

It's the same for us.	Tako je tudi za nas.
That's how we did it.	Tako smo to naredili.
Just don't tell him you got it from me.	Samo ne povej mu, da si to dobil od mene.
You really should	Res bi moral
Just none of that.	Samo nič od tega.
I may not see her again for a long, long time.	Morda je ne bom več videl dolgo, dolgo.
I hope you are there	Upam, da boš tam
I already wanted to go home	Želel sem že domov
I already called him	Sem ga že poklical
And so good.	In tako dobro.
So it just felt right.	Tako se mi je preprosto zdelo prav.
I think this person is also good	Mislim, da je ta oseba tudi dobra
I could almost hear her.	Skoraj bi jo slišal.
I think you may have helped.	Mislim, da si morda pomagal.
He has known me for a long time.	Pozna me že dolgo.
I need help with that.	Potrebujem pomoč pri tem.
Everything was wrong, he told himself.	Vse je bilo narobe, si je rekel.
We would be there tomorrow.	Jutri bi bili tam.
That was for a while.	To je bilo nekaj časa.
He's not there yet.	Še ni tam.
I wasn’t sure what to believe	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj naj verjamem
There is someone who.	Je nekdo, ki.
I told you.	Sem ti rekel.
I myself do not believe in this.	Sam ne verjamem v to.
I'm glad you stayed.	Vesel sem, da si ostal.
I didn't know anyone else was here	Nisem vedel, da je tukaj še kdo
I knew it too.	Tudi jaz sem vedel.
I understand you're fine	Razumem, da si dobro
It's pretty simple.	To je precej preprosto.
Sometimes.	Včasih.
All of these may be true.	Vse to je lahko res.
That’s when I knew something was wrong	Takrat sem vedel, da je nekaj narobe
It was too much for me.	Zame je bilo to preveč.
He never asked for that.	Tega ni nikoli prosil.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
I just didn't see it	Samo nisem videl
That's how it's supposed to be.	Tako naj bi bilo.
I was convinced we could have done much better ourselves	Prepričan sem bil, da bi lahko sami naredili veliko bolje
There's nowhere to go.	Ni kam iti.
You really should know better	Res bi moral vedeti bolje
Or if not.	Ali če ne.
I wonder where she was	Sprašujem se, kje je bila
I lost.	Izgubil sem.
However, there may be more.	Vendar pa je morda več.
I want something.	Želim si nekaj.
And it's hard to get here.	In težko je priti sem.
That's what I said.	Tako sem rekel.
No, not that.	Ne, ne to.
Maybe nothing at all.	Morda sploh nič.
I am your friend.	Jaz sem tvoj prijatelj.
I think maybe someone ate them	Mislim, da jih je morda kdo jedel
I thought no one would know what it was	Mislil sem, da nihče ne bo vedel, kaj je to
In this.	In ta.
I really wanted to talk to you	Res sem hotel govoriti s tabo
You shouldn’t know about this option	Za to možnost ne bi smel vedeti
I felt good.	Dobro sem se počutil.
He did something.	Je kaj naredil.
I mean, he was always a kid	Mislim, vedno je bil otrok
I lost so much.	Toliko sem izgubil.
I felt that way myself.	Tudi sam sem se tako počutil.
I'm going back.	Grem pa nazaj.
He was that.	On je bil to.
I thought you just said that	Mislil sem, da si to pravkar rekel
I thought something had happened.	Mislil sem, da se je nekaj zgodilo.
I feel like he knows more than he speaks	Počutim se, da ve več, kot govori
And that was hard enough.	In to je bilo dovolj težko.
Nobody asked.	Nihče se ni vprašal.
I'm a little better than him	Jaz sem malo boljši od njega
Nothing like this has ever happened to her.	Kaj takega se ji še ni zgodilo.
It was more what.	Bolj je bilo, kaj.
I know your father was with you yesterday	Vem, da je bil tvoj oče včeraj s tabo
I didn't find anyone	Nikogar nisem našel
I just know where he is	Samo vem, kje je
It's hard to do.	Težko je to narediti.
I have to go to school	Moram v šolo
They didn't do that.	Tega niso storili.
I also didn’t know when this was going to happen	Prav tako nisem vedel, kdaj se bo to zgodilo
I will never see him again	Nikoli več ga ne bom videl
I think it was him	Mislim, da je bil on
I'm glad to meet you.	Vesel sem, da sem te spoznal.
I know what she's going to say	Vem, kaj bo rekla
And that's that.	In to je to.
Me too for a few days.	Tudi jaz nekaj dni.
He actually has more.	Pravzaprav ima več.
And we can't help ourselves.	In ne moremo si pomagati.
And here we are.	In tukaj smo.
I asked him if something was wrong.	Vprašal sem ga, če je kaj narobe.
There are already too many of them in this.	Preveč jih je že v tem.
But he couldn't help himself.	Vendar si ni mogel pomagati.
Just talk to me.	Samo povej z mano.
Can anyone please help ??	Ali lahko kdo prosim pomaga??
I haven't bought it yet	Nisem še kupil
And you know.	In ali veš.
All he had to do was go to school.	Vse, kar je moral narediti, je bilo iti v šolo.
It seemed fine.	Zdelo se je v redu.
It was a question in its own way.	To je bilo na svoj način vprašanje.
I couldn’t believe he said that	Nisem mogel verjeti, da je to rekel
She said it had happened before.	Rekla je, da se je to zgodilo že prej.
And it wasn't me.	In to nisem bil jaz.
I want to know what you did.	Želim vedeti, kaj si naredil.
I know everyone in town	Poznam vse v mestu
He just kept going.	Samo še in naprej je šel.
I told you it was going to happen	Rekel sem ti, da se bo to zgodilo
I could help you	Lahko bi ti pomagal
He was everything.	Bil je vse.
I didn't know he was there	Nisem vedel, da je tam
I wanted you to know if anything happened to me.	Želel sem, da veš, če bi se mi kaj zgodilo.
Learn more here.	Več o tem tukaj.
It is still not enough.	Še vedno ni dovolj.
But he would have his chance soon.	Kmalu pa bi imel svojo priložnost.
I didn't like that at all	To mi sploh ni bilo všeč
I want to be so sure.	Rad bi bil tako prepričan.
I know him a little better now	Zdaj ga poznam malo bolje
There's a little bit of everything.	Vsega je po malo.
He is still my child.	Še vedno je moj otrok.
I expected her to go to work right away	Pričakoval sem, da bo šla takoj v službo
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
And it's that simple.	In to je tako preprosto.
Apparently she said yes.	Očitno je rekla da.
I can't believe I would do this to her	Ne morem verjeti, da bi ji to naredil
I do not have it.	Nimam ga.
I understand why this can be.	Razumem, zakaj je to lahko.
I always have problems with that	Pri tem imam vedno težave

I will definitely return to this hotel.	Zagotovo se bom vrnil v ta hotel.
We should go.	Morali bi iti.
I knew who this man was	Vedel sem, kdo je ta človek

I know you too.	Vem, da tudi ti.
I think you have enough for today	Mislim, da imaš dovolj za danes

I failed there	Tam mi ni uspelo
I have a job here	Tukaj imam delo
I know it was wrong now.	Vem, da je bilo zdaj narobe.
That was right.	To je bilo prav.
It's simple.	Preprosto je.
I don't know what's wrong with that.	Ne vem, kaj je s tem narobe.
Sometimes I wish it was me, but it’s not	Včasih si želim, da bi bil to jaz, pa ni
They had to.	Morali so.
It would be too obvious.	Bilo bi preveč očitno.
I wish it weren't so	Želim si, da ne bi bilo tako
That's us.	To smo mi.
You don't need to do anything else.	Ni vam treba storiti ničesar drugega.
I should have told you earlier	Moral bi ti povedati že prej
What else needs to be said ?.	Kaj je še treba povedati?.
He's seen that before.	To je že videl.
I thought there would be more than that	Mislil sem, da bo več kot to
We know that.	To vemo.
But I would like to ask her.	Vendar bi jo rad vprašal.
I'll be fine.	ven bom v redu.
The ones like me.	Tisti kot jaz.
I know you liked this car.	Vem, da ti je bil ta avto všeč.
I never expected that	Tega nisem nikoli pričakoval

I think he liked it	Mislim, da mu je bilo všeč
She knew who she was.	Vedela je, kdo je.
Unfortunately, I can't tell you more than that	Več kot to vam žal ne morem povedati
I think you will succeed	Mislim, da ti bo to uspelo
I asked her to come get me	Prosil sem jo, naj pride po mene
That was.	To je bilo.
It helps me see.	Pomaga mi videti.
But I didn't think it would be tonight	Nisem pa mislil, da bo nocoj
We had such a nice time.	Imeli smo se tako lepo.
Maybe I could find something.	Mogoče bi lahko kaj našel.
She was what he needed.	Bila je tisto, kar je potreboval.
I want it to be fast	Želim, da bi bilo hitro
He asked her why.	Vprašal jo je zakaj.
Mine won't be like that.	Moj ne bo tako.
I would put everything out	Vse bi dal ven
I think he already knows	Mislim, da že ve
I'll be sure and tell him you asked him.	Prepričan bom in mu povedal, da si ga vprašal.
I didn’t expect much more	Nisem pričakoval veliko več
I'll get a room and we'll see what happens.	Dobil bom sobo in bomo videli kaj bo.
He's just really good.	Samo res je dober.
I didn't know where he lived	Nisem vedel, kje živi
I know exactly where you are	Prav vem, kje si
I don't know who would have it either.	Tudi ne vem, kdo bi ga imel.

I just have to stay here tonight	Samo nocoj moram ostati tukaj
Not enough money.	Ni dovolj denarja.
If there really is no one else.	Če res ni nikogar drugega.
It's not true.	Ni res.
Because we are right.	Ker imamo prav.
I had someone who helped me here	Imel sem nekoga, ki mi je pomagal tukaj
Do something.	Narediti nekaj.
But we are.	Ali smo.
He fears this and only hopes.	Tega se boji in samo upa.
I'll be here if you need anything.	Tukaj bom, če boš kaj potreboval.
There's a lot of them.	Veliko jih je.
He expected to stay with me.	Pričakoval je, da bo ostal z mano.

It needs to be said.	Treba je povedati.
So is he.	Tudi on.
Maybe you.	Mogoče ti.

I wonder how long we've been here	Sprašujem se, koliko časa smo že tukaj
We just don't know, kid.	Preprosto ne vemo, otrok.

However, this is not the case.	Vendar pa ni tako.
I did that with us too, you know	Tudi pri nas sem to naredil, veš

None of this was true.	Nič od tega ni bilo res.
I was tired.	Utrujen sem bil.

Everything is going well.	Vse gre prav.
I told you that.	To sem ti rekel.

I didn't know it was you	Nisem vedel, da si ti
I know you would like it.	Vem, da bi ti bilo všeč.
The reason for everything	Razlog za vse
In fact, this is not the case.	Pravzaprav temu ni tako.
I always feel much better	Počutim se vedno veliko bolje
I doubt we ever did that	Dvomim, da smo to sploh kdaj storili
I want my life back.	Želim si svoje življenje nazaj.
I couldn't do that now.	Zdaj tega ne bi mogel storiti.
But it was just that.	Vendar je bil samo ta.
I didn't put him there.	Nisem ga dal tja.
He couldn't do that.	Tega ni mogel storiti.
We know that was not the case.	Vemo, da ni bilo tako.
I can't do that much.	Ne morem narediti toliko.
But I can understand why she succeeded	Lahko pa razumem, zakaj ji je uspelo
There was a time when.	Bil je čas, ko.
I would be alone	jaz bi bil sam
Okay, enough of that.	V redu, dovolj tega.
It was hard to leave.	Težko je bilo oditi.
I will lose everything	Izgubil bom vse
That's fine.	To je v redu.
I've seen that before	To sem že videl
I would be alone.	Bil bi sam.
I think everyone wants to go if they have the chance.	Mislim, da vsak želi iti, če ima možnost.
This is nice.	To je lepo.
But you can have more children.	Lahko pa imaš več otrok.
You probably know more than you think.	Verjetno veste več, kot si mislite.
You did what you did.	Naredil si, kar si naredil.
That’s how I’ve felt before.	Tako sem se že prej počutil.
I think you're right	Mislim, da imaš prav
He knows it was hard for you.	Ve, da ti je bilo težko.
If you don't feel like it, that's fine too.	Če se vam ne zdi, je tudi v redu.
They were simply together.	Preprosto sta bila skupaj.
It was always there.	Vedno je bilo tam.
I always feel better when he's with me	Vedno mi je bolje, ko je z mano
If he does anything at all.	Če sploh kaj naredi.
It's simply more	To je preprosto več
It would be better.	Bolje bi bilo.
That happened to me	To se mi je zgodilo
I didn’t want to do anything wrong	Nisem hotel narediti nič narobe
I think she knew that	Mislim, da je to vedela
I told you about that.	O tem sem ti povedal.
There was a lot of money.	Bilo je veliko denarja.
I didn’t ask him, I didn’t need to know	Nisem ga vprašal, ni mi bilo treba vedeti
Don't think about anything else.	Ne misli na nič drugega.
I've never done that before	Tega še nikoli nisem storil
And that's what I want to see.	In to želim videti.
I want more than that	Želim si več kot to
I would love to see him	rad bi ga videl
I knew I would meet her	Vedel sem, da bi jo spoznal
The day must come soon.	Kmalu mora priti dan.
I could ask her so many things	Lahko bi jo vprašal toliko stvari
I really was.	Res sem bil.
Nobody wanted that.	Nihče si tega ni želel.
That's good for both of us.	To je dobro za oba.
I can't buy someone	Ne morem kupiti nekoga
However, it seemed quite true.	Vendar se je to zdelo precej res.
I had to go after him	Moral sem iti za njim
Maybe a little.	Mogoče malo.
I can't be what you want me to be	Ne morem biti to, kar želiš, da sem
I hope it helps.	Upam, da pomaga.
It was true enough.	Bilo je dovolj res.
I will not promise anything	Nič ne bom obljubil
There is nothing like that here.	Tukaj ni nič takega.
I couldn’t be sure to say anything more	Nisem se mogel prepričati, da bi rekel kaj več
Tell me it's something else.	Povej mi, da je to nekaj drugega.
See you out	Vidim se ven
I doubt it will be that long	Dvomim, da bo tako dolgo
We saw.	Videli smo.
I'm not feeling well.	Ne počutim se dobro.
I wouldn't give it back	Ne bi ga vrnil
I would never know.	Nikoli ne bi vedel.
I have to go to work today	Danes moram v službo
No one will ask you for anything.	Nihče te ne bo prosil za nič.
I had to swim to him	Moral sem plavati do njega
There was nothing that I could do about it	Nič ji nisem mogel storiti
I thought they were right	Mislil sem, da sta prav
That doesn't help.	To ni v pomoč.
It's too much.	Preveč je.
Well, there is something else.	Pa še nekaj je.
If he's into it, fine.	Če je v to, v redu.
I don't have time for that	Nimam časa za to
I want to make sure it's okay	Želim se prepričati, da je v redu
What is.	Kaj je.
And yet.	Pa vendar.
She would be alone, completely alone	Bila bi sama, popolnoma sama
Her father always told her that.	Oče ji je to vedno govoril.
He was no longer angry.	Ni bil več jezen.
I wanted to do this for you	To sem hotel narediti zate
So he didn’t want anyone to hear him.	Zato ni hotel, da bi ga kdo slišal.
I haven't seen him much	Nisem ga veliko videl
You're actually helping.	Pravzaprav si v pomoč.
I will have no other	ne bom imel drugega
I'm glad to meet you.	Vesel sem, da sem te spoznal.
I didn't want to come here	Nisem hotel priti sem
I doubt he needs much help	Dvomim, da potrebuje veliko pomoči
Which is unlikely.	Kar pa ni verjetno.
So we have to do something about it.	Zato moramo glede tega nekaj narediti.
You should stay on this	Moral bi ostati na tem
I was quite a kid.	Bil sem precej otrok.
Not for me yet.	Zame še ne.
So much to know.	Toliko da veš.
I was glad to see her	Vesel sem bil, da sem jo videl
It was simple enough.	Bilo je dovolj preprosto.
I'll start tonight.	Nocoj bom začel.
But that's how it seemed to me at the time.	Ali tako se mi je takrat zdelo.
It was just a question of when.	Bilo je samo vprašanje kdaj.
I should talk to more.	Govoriti naj bi z več.
I was here and I saw it all	Bil sem tukaj in vse sem videl
I believe there is still a possibility	Verjamem, da še obstaja možnost
I just hope the topic	Samo upam se temu
He had heard so much about it.	Toliko je slišal o tem.
I mean here.	mislim tukaj.
I was up to everything else	Bil sem do vsega drugega
I mean, I really should go ahead already	Mislim, res bi morala že iti naprej
And we failed.	In nam ni uspelo.
I will always be yours	vedno bom tvoj
Yes yes Yes.	Da da Da .
I don't see that anymore	Tega ne vidim več
Obviously this is a problem.	Očitno je to problem.
Now I'm glad to have him here	Zdaj sem vesel, da ga imam tukaj
This is my friend.	To je moj prijatelj.
I want to see people	Želim videti ljudi
She did it.	To ji je uspelo.
I think he wants you	Mislim, da te želi
It doesn't feel good to me either.	Tudi meni se ne zdi dobro.
Just something.	Samo nekaj .
I could sit here all day	Lahko bi sedel tukaj ves dan
I was trying to help	Poskušal sem pomagati
He needed help to know what to do with it.	Potreboval je pomoč, da je vedel, kaj storiti s tem.
that doesn't interest me	to me ne zanima
I just believe that.	Samo to verjamem.
This is never easy.	To ni nikoli lahko.
It often is.	Pogosto je.
I wanted to see more	Želel sem videti več
I can't reach him.	Ne morem priti do njega.
There was little time now.	Časa je bilo zdaj malo.
A lot of time.	Veliko časa.
Boy, really.	Fant, res.
I will not ask why.	Ne bom vprašal zakaj.
It was pretty simple.	Bilo je precej preprosto.
As it should be.	Kot bi morala biti.
I've never heard her talk so much before.	Še nikoli je nisem slišal toliko govoriti.
I'll tell you everything	Povedal ti bom vse
Yours because you found him.	Tvoj, ker si ga našel.
I don’t know if it is or not.	Ne vem, ali je ali ne.
I'm not so happy about that	Nisem tako vesel tega
I am convinced of that.	v to sem prepričan.
It seems not.	Zdi se, da ne.
That was all.	To je bilo vse.
I haven't seen her yet	Nisem je še videl
It's not just about money.	Ne gre samo za denar.
I need to know where you are all the time	Ves čas moram vedeti, kje si
You know you would.	Veš, da bi.
And that's a good thing.	In to je dobra stvar.
I wanted to see where he was going	Hotel sem videti, kam gre
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
My father, not my father.	Moj oče, ne pa oče.
I am tired.	Utrujen sem.
No matter what happens to me.	Ne glede na to, kaj se mi dogaja.
I have three now.	Zdaj imam tri.
I know what it does to us	Vem, kaj nam to dela
I never knew what happened	Nikoli nisem vedel, kaj se je zgodilo
I understand why you didn't hear	Razumem, zakaj nisi slišal
But it's not just that.	Vendar ni samo to.
When it exists.	Ko obstaja.
He would never succeed.	Nikoli mu ne bi uspelo.
Must be.	Mora biti.
I started quite a few of them.	Kar nekaj sem jih začel.
I knew what needed to be done	Vedel sem, kaj je treba storiti
Certainly, he said.	Zagotovo, je rekel.
Without that money, we were so penniless.	Brez tega denarja smo bili tako brez denarja.
He knows he'll get it.	Ve, da ga bo dobil.
He's just a kid.	On je samo otrok.
He wasn't ready for this at all.	Na to sploh ni bil pripravljen.
It's already happened.	Se je že zgodilo.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi morali biti.
I just said it again	Rekel sem samo še enkrat
Sometimes it is.	Včasih je tako.
If only it could be like that again.	Ko bi le lahko bilo spet tako.
I thought it was really good.	Zdelo se mi je res dobro.
I haven't been right since	Od takrat nisem imel prav
Maybe he was just tired.	Mogoče je bil samo utrujen.
I just want to see that it's okay	Želim samo videti, da je v redu
He couldn't see anything.	Ničesar ni mogel videti.
And you shouldn't.	In ne bi smel.
We like it.	Všeč nam je.
I wanted to say all these things, but I couldn’t	Vse te stvari sem hotel povedati, a nisem mogel
And there was something.	In nekaj je bilo.
I'm totally fine.	sem popolnoma v redu.
And definitely a reason.	In zagotovo razlog.
I hope it's there.	Upam, da je tam.
I still wonder why he is not there	Še vedno se sprašujem, zakaj ga ni
Because obviously no one could do everything.	Ker očitno nihče ne bi mogel narediti vsega.
Okay, he had a little more time.	V redu, imel je še malo časa.
It's not just me.	Nisem samo jaz.
I probably wouldn't make it	Verjetno mi ne bi uspelo
It wasn’t enough to do.	Ni bilo dovolj za narediti.
I didn't get much	Nič nisem veliko dobil
He's too good.	Preveč je dober.
However, this no longer seems true.	Vendar se to ne zdi več res.
It just didn’t happen.	Preprosto se ni zgodilo.
Or better for that.	Ali bolje za to.
And now you are so good to me.	In zdaj si tako dober do mene.
I wanted to be alone	Hotel sem biti sam
And that is exactly what happened.	In prav to se je zgodilo.
I can't go to school	Ne morem v šolo
I have to get out	Moram priti ven
You can do it again.	Lahko še enkrat.
I wish it was me	Želim si, da bi bil to jaz
But I can't get home yet	Vendar še ne morem priti domov
But I only have a thing for you	Imam pa samo stvar zate
I didn’t think it was for me.	Nisem si mislil, da je to zame.
I knew who this man was.	Vedel sem, kdo je ta človek.
Either you are or you are not.	Ali si ali pa nisi.
He did this for three years.	To je delal tri leta.
Now you are.	Zdaj pa si.
They never were.	Nikoli niso bili.
I thought we should go	Mislil sem, da bi morali iti
I hope you succeed	Upam, da ti bo uspelo
I wouldn't be sure about that	Glede tega ne bi bil prepričan
Should not.	ne bi smel.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
Just like him.	Tako kot on.
I myself do not know what to think	Sam ne vem, kaj naj si mislim
Maybe you will.	Mogoče boš.
She really did.	Res je to storila.
More than you.	Več kot ti.
I was not feeling well when he left	Ni mi bilo dobro, ko je odšel
No one would see anything.	Nihče ne bi ničesar videl.
It used to be mine.	Nekoč je bil moj.
These are the ones.	To so tisti.
I want to make sure it's okay	Želim se prepričati, da je v redu
That is a lot.	To je veliko.
You have to help him.	Moraš mu pomagati.
But she didn't know.	Vendar ni vedela.
It was you.	To si bil ti.
I want to be a teacher.	Želim biti učitelj.
I have to see for myself.	Sam se moram prepričati.
Keep it up.	Kar tako naprej.
Everything that was was there.	Vse, kar je bilo, je bilo tam.
I can't believe it myself	Sam ne morem verjeti
I will do right again	Spet bom naredil prav
I found it here.	Našel sem ga tukaj.
That's what it does.	To je tisto, kar počne.
You've done all you can so far.	Do zdaj ste naredili vse, kar ste lahko.
I'm not going to help much	Ne bom veliko pomagal
I do not understand.	ne razumem.
Not me, no.	Ne jaz, ne.
I don't anymore.	jaz ne več.
I can't do that to him	Tega mu ne morem storiti
He needs to be persuaded, convinced or believed.	Treba ga je prepričati, prepričati ali verjeti.
I knew she was gone, that's all	Vedel sem, da je šla, to je vse
Just not now.	Samo ne zdaj.
I knew he would like it.	Vedel sem, da mu bo všeč.
And life there was hard.	In življenje tam je bilo težko.
I think if I asked anyone, I would say that.	Mislim, da če bi koga vprašal, bi to rekel.
And there's a reason for that.	In za to obstaja razlog.
It could only be me.	To sem lahko samo jaz.
Really long ago	Res dolgo nazaj
I wouldn't want to do anything else.	Ne bi želel početi ničesar drugega.
I lost it for a while, I got lost	Izgubil sem ga za nekaj časa, izgubil sem se
Maybe not.	Mogoče pa ni.
That's the problem, I think.	To je problem, meni.
He knows that.	On to ve.
I don't mean anything by that	Nič ne mislim s tem
I like to see that.	To rad vidim.
I know him a little.	Poznam ga malo.
I'm not surprised.	Nisem presenečen.
Keep going.	Kar naprej in naprej.
I didn’t know what it was all about	Nisem vedel, za kaj vse gre
It just wasn’t hard.	Samo ni bilo težko.
I couldn’t go back, I wouldn’t go back	Nisem mogel nazaj, ne bi šel nazaj
What he did.	Kaj je naredil.
And it wasn't him.	In to ni bil on.
I need to know what's going on	Moram vedeti, kaj se dogaja
He doesn't play.	Ne igra.
Or maybe it is.	Ali pa je morda.
I understand why that was so	Razumem, zakaj je bilo tako
I already said that.	To sem že rekel.
I didn't think it would be like that	Nisem si mislil, da bo tako
Nothing is nothing.	Nič ni nič.
But he heard the question.	Vendar je slišal vprašanje.
They did nothing to him.	Nič mu niso storili.
I thought they certainly would	Mislil sem, da bodo zagotovo
It's just that it's so hard.	Samo to je tako težko.
I know you stayed here just to be with me	Vem, da si ostal tukaj samo zato, da bi bil z mano
It's not hard, just long.	Ni težko, samo dolgo.
There aren't that many.	Ni jih toliko.
They're still fine.	Še vedno so v redu.
I learned so much	Toliko sem se naučil
I liked her, a lot.	Všeč mi je bila, precej.
I didn't do anything wrong	Nič nisem naredil narobe
I just left him there	Pravkar sem ga pustil tam
I asked him to come	Prosil sem ga, naj pride
He began to look tired.	Začel je videti utrujen.
I was waiting for him	Čakal sem ga
I think it was wrong	Mislim, da je bilo narobe
I don’t know how this happens.	Ne vem, kako se to dogaja.
I know that.	Vem pa to.
Now everyone can do it a little better.	Zdaj lahko vsak to naredi nekoliko bolje.
But it was too much.	Vendar je bilo preveč.
I knew you would find him	Vedel sem, da ga boš našel
He was the only one to do so.	Bil je edini, ki je to storil.
I’ve wanted to do this before, but I didn’t know how.	Želel sem to narediti že prej, pa nisem vedel, kako.
I still couldn’t believe this had happened	Še vedno nisem mogel verjeti, da se je to zgodilo
He works with me.	Dela z mano.
I want him to keep talking	Želim, da še naprej govori
From there I knew how to play it.	Od tam sem vedel, kako jo igrati.
I quickly followed him	Hitro sem šel za njim
I feel like now is my time	Počutim se, kot da je zdaj moj čas
I didn't know what to say to him.	Nisem mu vedel ničesar povedati.
For what he did to you.	Za to, kar ti je naredil.
That seemed right.	To se je zdelo prav.
Maybe he got lost when he arrived.	Mogoče se je izgubil, ko je prišel.
There were a lot of kids there.	Tam je bilo veliko otrok.
I don't even know him.	Sploh ga ne poznam.
I think that will be all for today	Mislim, da bo to vse za danes
We have a lot of work to do.	Imamo veliko dela.
And it probably will.	In verjetno tudi bo.
I shouldn't be here at all	Sploh ne bi smel biti tukaj
Sometimes not.	Včasih ni.
Not a hotel.	Ni hotel.
You are much more than that.	Ti si veliko več kot to.
Even then it is not easy.	Tudi takrat ni lahko.
And there you were.	In tam si bil ti.
Not so much anymore.	Ne več toliko.
I just got things.	Pravkar imam stvari.
I saw some people there	Tam sem videl nekaj ljudi
I was so happy to get it.	Bil sem tako vesel, da sem ga dobil.
You want to believe.	Želite verjeti.
I know something happened	Vem, da se je nekaj zgodilo
If you know, you know.	Če veš, veš.
I think someone did something to her.	Mislim, da ji je nekdo nekaj naredil.
I hope you succeed	Upam, da ti bo uspelo
I was also busy this morning	Danes zjutraj sem bil tudi zaposlen
I would go back to work	Vrnil bi se v službo
I only met him once	Spoznal sem ga le enkrat
But even that was not enough.	A tudi to ni bilo dovolj.
And now I am.	In zdaj sem.
I knew he would do it	Vedel sem, da bo to storil
This is no longer the case.	Zdaj tega ni več.
They can be made by a child	Lahko jih naredi otrok
I won't say either	Tudi jaz ne bom rekel
I knew what happened	Vedel sem, kaj se je zgodilo
I always knew what was going on	Vedno sem vedel, kaj se dogaja
It does a lot of things.	To naredi veliko stvari.
I didn't know what you meant	Nisem vedel, kaj si mislil
That wasn't a problem either.	Tudi to ni bil problem.
I know what's good for you	Vem, kaj je dobro zate
I'm glad he is	Vesel sem, da je
I wonder where she was last night	Sprašujem se, kje je bila sinoči
I wouldn't wish that on anyone	Tega ne bi želel nikomur
I thought he'd be here by now	Mislil sem, da bo že tukaj
He didn't see him there.	Tam ga ni videl.
I saw the problem right away	Takoj sem videl problem
All you want is.	Vse, kar želite, je.
She doesn’t seem to have done that.	Zdi se, da tega ni storila.
He couldn't get out.	Ni mogel ven.
I had it with you	Imel sem ga s tabo
I got back in the car	Vrnil sem se v avto
And how will you get there.	In kako boš prišel tja.
He could never do it again.	Nikoli več ni mogel.
I was thinking about tonight	Mislil sem na nocoj
He knew how he could help.	Vedel je, kako lahko pomaga.
Where would you go? 	Kam bi šel?
.	.
I'll give it to him	To mu bom dal
I won't tell her anything	Nič ji ne bom povedal
It will be a long time.	To bo dolgo.
There is a lot of help there.	Tam je veliko pomoči.
Better than good.	Bolje kot dobro.
Not for days.	Ne več dni.
I have to do this for myself	To moram narediti zame

Or anyone could.	Ali pa bi kdo lahko.
All is not well with you.	S tabo ni vse v redu.
I can't believe how much it is	Ne morem verjeti, koliko je
You should do more	Moral bi narediti več
I've seen it all	Vse to sem videl
I know what's going on there	Vem, kaj se tam dogaja

I have something to tell everyone	Vsem moram nekaj povedati
It really wasn't much.	Res ni bilo veliko.
I wish it was me instead of you	Želim si, da bi bil to jaz namesto tebe
I thought you were coming to me.	Mislil sem, da boš prišel k meni.
I want you more than you know	Želim te bolj, kot veš
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
I like it that way.	Všeč mi je tako.
I'm not feeling well	ne počutim se dobro
You know little about me.	Malo veš o meni.
I know, right.	Vem, kajne.
I'll be back for you	Vrnil se bom po vas
He wanted everything to be right.	Želel je, da je vse prav.
Let and.	Naj in.
I liked both of them.	Oba sta mi bila všeč.
He knows how.	On ve kako.
I'll say it was him.	Rekel bom, da je bil on.
We haven't seen each other in a long time.	Dolgo časa se nismo videli.
I will never forget them	Nikoli jih ne bom pozabil
I'm afraid not	Bojim se, da ni
I'd rather be too prepared	Raje bi bil preveč pripravljen
Keep it simple.	Naj bo preprosto.
You should probably see this	Verjetno bi to moral videti
I wouldn't hear of it	Ne bi slišal za to
I hope you had a nice time here.	Upam, da ste se imeli lepo tukaj.
I was not surprised.	nisem bil presenečen.
I was just, you know	Bil sem samo, veš

I didn't know about that	Nisem vedel za to
I love that you're there	Všeč mi je, da si tam
I will let you go, ”he said.	Pustil te bom,« je rekel.
You too.	Tudi ti.
Even if it weren’t, it could be.	Tudi če ne bi bilo, bi lahko tudi bilo.
I think he wants to talk to you	Mislim, da želi govoriti s tabo
The first time was good.	Prvič je bilo dobro.
I won't talk about it anymore.	O tem ne bom več govoril.
I don’t know when that happened	Ne vem, kdaj se je to zgodilo
I know that now.	Zdaj to vem.
I want to have you more	Rad bi te imel bolj
Early in the morning.	Zgodaj zjutraj.
I understand.	Razumem.
I felt wrong.	Počutil sem se narobe.
I wish you luck.	Želim ti srečo.
I didn't mean to tell you	Nisem ti hotel povedati
But he didn't want to do that.	Vendar tega ni hotel storiti.
I just knew.	Preprosto sem vedel.
I never want anything to do with him	Nikoli si ne želim ničesar z njim
He knows he will see them again soon.	Ve, da jih bo kmalu spet videl.

A lot of time	Veliko časa
And maybe it will be like that again.	In morda bo spet tako.

I was not angry.	nisem bil jezen.
You were right.	Imel si prav.
I'm sure you want to talk	Prepričan sem, da želite govoriti
And it's not just you.	In nisi samo ti.

You are now.	Zdaj si.
They were gone.	Ni jih bilo več.
That could be it too.	To bi lahko bilo tudi to.
Or it used to be.	Ali pa je nekoč bilo.
Not many people do that.	To ne počne veliko ljudi.
I'm alone.	Sama sem.
I wish that didn't happen.	Želim si, da se to ne bi zgodilo.
That's what I did.	To sem naredil.
I have to go to school	Moram iti v šolo

This is not this time.	To ni ta čas.
What they did.	Kaj so naredili.
I decided to work alone	Odločil sem se, da bom delal sam
He said all he could.	Povedal je vse, kar je lahko.
I didn’t expect to talk to him	Nisem pričakoval, da bom govoril z njim
I gave it my all	Dal sem vse
I was the only one left	Ostal sem edini jaz
But I want to see more	Želim pa videti več
It happened to us.	Zgodilo se nam je.
Here is your father.	Tukaj je tvoj oče.

I can't go on like this anymore	Ne morem več tako naprej
And we have to go back.	In moramo nazaj.

No need to tell anyone.	Nikomur tega ni treba povedati.
I have already decided	Odločil sem se že
He must be really angry.	Mora biti res jezen.
I mean, it's true	Mislim, res je
I can't believe what you just did for me	Ne morem verjeti, kaj si pravkar naredil zame
You just knew he wanted you.	Vedel si le, da te želi.

That's how he thought of us.	Tako je mislil o nas.

I always wanted to know more	Vedno sem želel vedeti več
I mean, no one's here	Mislim, nikogar ni tukaj
I actually wanted to go with him	Pravzaprav sem hotel iti z njim
Can anyone help me with this.	Ali mi lahko kdo pomaga pri tem.
And there was a lot of work for everyone now.	In dela je bilo zdaj za vse veliko.
There is a chance.	Obstaja možnost.
It happened so long ago.	Zgodilo se je tako dolgo nazaj.
It's happening here all the time.	Tukaj se ves čas dogaja.

I have decided	Odločil sem se
I didn’t expect him to be gone for so long	Nisem pričakoval, da ga tako dolgo ni več
I'm not going to make it now.	Zdaj mi ne bo uspelo.
This is not happening here.	To se tukaj ne dogaja.
I'm having a very good time	Zelo dobro se imam
No, that wasn't it.	Ne, to ni bilo to.
I just know.	Samo vem.
Together we would succeed.	Skupaj bi nam uspelo.
I don't know how to do it.	ne vem narediti.
That's probably not it.	To verjetno ni to.
I still want it.	Še vedno si to želim.
I started without you	Začel sem brez tebe
I tried them.	Poskušal sem jih.
I think I could do something.	Mislim, da bi lahko nekaj naredil.
You should know that nothing will come of it	Moral bi vedeti, da iz tega ne bo nič
That's a little nice.	To je malo lepo.
We are not.	Nismo.
He was not there.	Ni ga bilo tam.
I saw the problem.	Videl sem problem.
But I didn't think so	Nisem pa mislil
This is clearly not the case.	To očitno ni tako.
I’ll still leave if that’s what you want	Še vedno bom odšel, če je to tisto, kar želiš
I want to be better and better and better.	Rad bi bil boljši in boljši in boljši.
Please.	Lepo vas prosim.
I know they are here	Vem, da so tukaj
You should be ready	Moral bi biti pripravljen
I'll only be gone for a few days	Odšel bom le nekaj dni
He knew it was wrong.	Vedel je, da je narobe.
I didn't go back to work	Nisem se vrnil v službo
I told her to help herself	Rekel sem ji, naj si pomaga
She only knew he was gone.	Vedela je le, da ga ni več.
I had nothing to say	Nisem imel kaj povedati
There was something about that.	Nekaj ​​je bilo na tem.
Life is for life.	Življenje je za življenje.
I wonder if that's true	Zanima me, če je to res

You should stay with him	Moral bi ostati z njim
That's fine.	To je v redu.
I didn't get help there	Tam nisem dobil pomoči
To like.	Bi ti všeč.
I will leave and no one will die	Odšel bom in nihče ne bo umrl
But we weren't.	Nismo pa bili.
I didn’t see any of that yesterday	Včeraj nisem videl nič od tega
I want to be alone.	Želim biti sam.
I knew how he felt.	Vedel sem, kako se počuti.
I did not know.	Nisem vedel.
I know this because we must continue to do so	To vem, ker to moramo še naprej početi
I go back and forth on this	Grem naprej in nazaj na to
It wasn't always possible.	Ni bilo vedno mogoče.
I don’t like it and I don’t like it	Ne maram in ne maram ga
He said he only saw him once.	Rekel je, da ga je videl samo enkrat.
He was simply good at everything.	Bil je preprosto dober v vsem.
I just wish we were together.	Želim si samo, da sva skupaj.
Not many people	Veliko ljudi ni

I want to help him.	Rad bi mu pomagal.
It can be nothing.	Lahko ni nič.
I know what he will do	Vem, kaj bo naredil
Not with me.	Ne pri meni.
And yet it was him.	Pa vendar je bil on.
Now, however, he decided he had to go home.	Zdaj pa se je odločil, da mora iti domov.
He probably likes it.	Verjetno mu je všeč.
If it could be, everyone would do it.	Če bi bilo lahko, bi to storili vsi.

he thought.	mislil je.
I understand things.	Razumem stvari.
It's happening here too.	Tudi pri nas se dogaja.
Doing what feels right.	Delati, kar se zdi prav.
I wanted you to know that	Hotel sem, da to veš
She never made it there.	Nikoli ji ni uspelo tja.
I didn't really like it	Ni mi bilo zelo všeč
No one can do much about it.	Nihče ne more veliko narediti glede tega.
I want him back	Rad bi ga vrnil
I've had enough of this.	Dovolj imam tega.
I believe that is the case here	Verjamem, da je tukaj tako
What could be simpler than that.	Kaj je lahko bolj preprosto kot to.
Just like at home.	Tako kot doma.
They never had children	Nikoli niso imeli otrok

I used to have them, now they are gone	Včasih sem jih, zdaj jih ni več
It wasn't like that here.	Tukaj ni bilo tako.
And found nothing.	In našel nič.
I didn't do well	Tega nisem dobro opravil

What's happening.	Kaj se dogaja.
She likes you.	Všeč si ji.
I didn't see anything or anyone	Nisem videl ničesar ali nikogar
We don’t even know they’re still there.	Sploh ne vemo, da so še vedno tam.

I would be alone.	Jaz bi bil sam.
I was already pretty busy this morning	Danes zjutraj sem bil že precej zaposlen
That would be right.	To bi bilo prav.
I've never been there before	Še nikoli nisem bil tam
It was so simple.	Bilo je tako preprosto.
I didn't expect it	Nisem pričakoval
I didn't make it, I really didn't	Ni mi uspelo, res ne
And they are not problems.	In niso težave.
They knew what to do and they did it.	Vedeli so, kaj storiti, in to so storili.
There is a good reason for this.	Za to obstaja dober razlog.
I will not do that again	Tega ne bom več storil
I went out without telling her anything else	Odšel sem ven, ne da bi ji rekel kaj drugega
It was not like forever.	Ni bilo takega kot za vedno.
You're still there.	Si še tam.
There too.	Tudi tam.
She didn't have to.	Ni ji bilo treba.
I think you like it	Mislim, da ti je všeč
I felt like we had it forever	Počutil sem se, kot da bi imeli za vedno
I want everything he just said, and more	Želim si vse, kar je pravkar rekel, in še več

I will be your life	jaz bom življenje zate
Time they didn't have.	Čas, ki ga niso imeli.
That does not seem to be the case.	Zdi se, da ni tako.
There was much more.	Bilo je veliko več.
There was no choice but to go back to my house.	Ni bilo drugega kot iti nazaj v svojo hišo.
I couldn't leave.	nisem mogel oditi.
A lot before.	Prej veliko.

I never asked why.	Nikoli nisem vprašal zakaj.
I totally saw it	Popolnoma sem videl
This has not happened yet.	To se še ni zgodilo.

I felt better than that	Počutil sem se bolje kot to
I didn't think so.	nisem mislil tako.
She didn't go.	Ni šla.
I know what you did tonight.	Vem, kaj si naredil nocoj.
i hope this happens.	upam, da se bo to zgodilo.
I'm not there yet.	Nisem še tam.
I told you everything	vse sem ti povedal
Everyone has that.	To ima vsak.
You will see them again if you want.	Spet jih boste videli, če želite.
And it will have to be done.	In to bo treba storiti.
I don't want to know	nočem vedeti
This time was not like today.	Ta čas ni bil kot danes.
How is it?	Kako je?
My friend asked me to do it.	Moj prijatelj me je prosil, naj to storim.
I didn't do everything myself	Vsega nisem naredil sam
We have to get out.	Moramo ven.
He was a very busy man.	Bil je zelo zaposlen človek.
You know better.	Ti bolje veš.
It's just not who he is.	Samo ni to, kdo je.
I never expected that	Tega nisem nikoli pričakoval
There really isn't much to do.	Pravzaprav ni veliko dela.
I had to get out of there.	Moral sem od tam.
It is always there in front of you.	Vedno je tam pred tabo.
When, she didn't know.	Kdaj, ni vedela.
A little more than.	Nekaj ​​več kot.
He wants something more.	Želi nekaj več.
I would really like to meet you.	Res bi te rad spoznal.
You should come home.	Moral bi priti domov.
I wasn’t sure what happened	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj se je zgodilo
I thought I'd stay here with you	Mislil sem ostati tukaj, s tabo
I could tell he was tired	Lahko bi rekel, da je utrujen
I haven't met you before	Prej te nisem srečal
I couldn't take it anymore	Nisem mogel več
Maybe even more.	Mogoče še bolj.
I need it now.	Potrebujem zdaj.
You are very right.	Imaš zelo prav.
Now I have decided.	Zdaj sem se odločil.
I'm still you to have me	Še vedno sem ti, da me imaš
I like this kid.	Ta otrok mi je všeč.
I have no doubt she will do that.	Ne dvomim, da bo to storila.
I gave it all back, you know	Vse sem vrnil, veš
You don't want that.	Tega si ne želiš.
I was the only one I had to convince	Bil sem edini, ki sem ga moral prepričati
I don’t think that’s a very good way to do that.	Mislim, da to ni zelo dober način za to.
You know, usually.	Veste, običajno.
Obviously not obvious.	Očitno ni očitno.
Not because of that.	Ne zaradi tega.
I didn’t know this was happening	Nisem vedel, da se to dogaja
I still have it today.	Še danes ga imam.
I asked him how many he has.	Vprašal sem ga, koliko jih ima.
She wanted to see what would happen.	Želela je videti, kaj se bo zgodilo.
I told you it would be fine	Rekel sem ti, da bo v redu
Everyone did it.	To so storili vsi.
Maybe you will succeed.	Morda vam bo to uspelo.
I actually want to help him	Pravzaprav mu želim pomagati
Because they were.	Ker so bili.
And we didn’t even know.	In sploh nismo vedeli.
I'm ready for that	Na to sem pripravljen
But that didn't happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
Not that.	Ni to.
I couldn't help myself.	Nisem si mogel pomagati.
Where it was.	Kje je bilo.
We need to move fast.	Hitro moramo naprej.
It looked like he wanted to help her.	Videti je bilo, da ji želi pomagati.
But I knew it wasn't	Vedel sem pa, da ni
It's like he's someone else's child.	Kot da je otrok nekoga drugega.
There was no way of knowing anyway.	Tako ali tako ni bilo mogoče vedeti.
Maybe it’s just as good.	Morda je prav tako dobro.
That's how he died.	Tako je umrl.
I wasn't sure you were going to make it	Nisem bil prepričan, da ti bo uspelo
He didn't want to be here.	Ni hotel biti tukaj.
No one knows about everything.	Nihče ne ve o vsem.
That was not good enough.	To ni bilo dovolj dobro.
And if not.	In če ne.
He didn't see her at all.	Sploh je ni videl.
Which isn't.	Kar ni.
I know I wouldn’t have any of that	Vem, da ne bi imel ničesar od tega
This kid is coming no matter what.	Ta otrok pride ne glede na vse.
And he didn't tell us everything, man.	In ni nam povedal vsega, človek.
I just didn't see it.	Samo nisem videl.
He returned to work early in the morning.	Zgodaj zjutraj se je vrnil v službo.
That's hard for me.	To mi je težko.
I thought he was right	Mislil sem, da je prav
I wanted to see him	Želela sem ga videti
I could do it myself.	To bi lahko storil sam.
She knew nothing.	Nič ni vedela.
I wasn't sure if you'd be angry	Nisem bil prepričan, če boš jezen
I've met him once before	Enkrat sem ga že srečal
They did not have.	Niso imeli.
I think they are better now	Mislim, da so zdaj boljši
That was not necessary either.	Tudi to ni bilo treba.
We know where everyone is.	Vemo, kje so vsi.
This cannot be done.	Tega ni mogoče storiti.
And he was.	In je bil.
I don't understand how that would be.	Ne razumem pa, kako bi bilo tako.
Like they had nothing to do with him.	Kot da niso imeli nič z njim.
I know about these things.	Vem za te stvari.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ga ni.
You could too.	Lahko bi tudi.
if you don't tell.	če ne povej.
I think we could already be there	Mislim, da bi lahko že bili tam
I wish I was there	Želim si, da bi bil tam
I think it would be	Mislim, da bi bilo
I think like never before	Mislim, kot nikoli
I wonder.	Sprašujem se.
I think he will win more	Mislim, da bo zmagal več
I think he loves me.	Mislim, da me ima rad.
I heard it here.	Tukaj sem slišal.
I've never seen anything like it	Nič takega še nisem videl
It's at home for me.	Meni je doma.
I think they were pretty much right	Mislim, da so imeli precej prav
This is often not the case.	To pogosto ni tako.
This could not be done either.	Tudi tega ni bilo mogoče storiti.
I know you already know that	Vem, da to že veš
But you.	Ali ti.
We have seen this to be the case.	Videli smo, da je temu tako.
It wasn't even that serious.	Niti ni bilo tako resno.
I know why we didn't see more	Vem, zakaj nismo videli več
He couldn't now.	Zdaj ni mogel.
And then.	In po tem.
It was what she liked, but never.	Je bilo to tisto, kar ji je bil všeč, a nikoli.
My father died early.	Oče je zgodaj umrl.
I could never go home	Nikoli nisem mogel domov
But it was still there.	Vendar je bilo še vedno tam.
Everything can be bought.	Vse se da kupiti.
I'm sorry about what happened	Žal mi je za to, kar se je zgodilo
I lost people because of it	Zaradi tega sem izgubil ljudi
There is something.	Nekaj ​​je.
I didn’t even know he was in town	Sploh nisem vedel, da je v mestu
I thought there would be more	Mislil sem, da jih bo več
That's it, she said.	To je to, je rekla.
I know a lot about this	O tem vem veliko
I didn't know what my father was doing to me	Nisem vedel, kaj mi oče počne
Not so here.	Tukaj ni tako.
You can and you have to.	Lahko in moraš.
Either you like it or you don't.	Ali ti je všeč ali ti ni.
This may or may not be true.	To je lahko res ali pa tudi ne.
I shouldn't be surprised	Ne bi smel biti presenečen
I was sure you would forget	Prepričan sem bil, da boš pozabil
I'll tell him.	Povedal mu bom.
It's about me.	Zame gre.
It was so hard, so hard, so hard.	Bilo je tako težko, tako težko, tako težko.
Feel like home.	Počuti se kot doma.
And now she doesn't like it that much.	In zdaj ji ni tako všeč.
Except it's not.	Le da ni.
I have money, a lot of money	Imam denar, veliko denarja
But it didn't happen that way.	Vendar se ni zgodilo tako.
I shouldn't have been there with him	Nisem smel biti tam z njim
He had to do something right.	Moral je nekaj narediti prav.
I know you must have been tired	Vem, da si moral biti utrujen
I'm the one you want.	Jaz sem tisti, ki ga želiš.
I really didn't want to go out	Res nisem hotel ven
No one saw him for even a few days.	Nihče ga ni videl niti nekaj dni.
All the while, I thought maybe someone was behind me	Ves čas sem mislil, da je morda nekdo za mano
I will not die again.	Ne bom več umrl.
He needed it.	Potreboval ga je.
I felt better than the day before	Počutil sem se bolje kot prejšnji dan
As they are now.	Kot so zdaj.
I have all these things	Vse te stvari imam
Question.	Vprašanje.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.	A žal temu ni tako.
I still believe that today.	To verjamem še danes.
I really wish I hadn’t said that	Res bi si želel, da tega ne bi rekel
I have enough to eat.	Imam dovolj za jesti.
I said.	sem rekel.
Something even earlier.	Nekaj ​​tudi prej.
Now she knew.	Zdaj je vedela.
But she knew that wasn't going to happen.	A vedela je, da se to ne bo zgodilo.
It seemed like a lot of work.	Zdelo se je kot veliko dela.
He will be fine.	Dobro mu bo.
And it won't.	In ne bo.
I never thought that day would come.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da bo prišel ta dan.
Maybe he really didn't want to.	Mogoče res ni hotel.
And now you wouldn't be here.	In zdaj te ne bi bilo tukaj.
This is very difficult.	To je zelo težko.
Nothing was good for me	Nič mi ni bilo dobro
Maybe, if you're lucky, you won't meet.	Mogoče je, če boš imel srečo, ne boš srečal.
That he was right.	Da je imel prav.
I can't help you again	Spet ti ne morem pomagati
He had to make sure no one was home.	Prepričati se je moral, da ni nikogar doma.
This happens here all the time.	To se tukaj ves čas dogaja.
I believe in many things	Verjamem v veliko stvari
And there was no one for a long, long time.	In dolgo, dolgo ni bilo nikogar.
I don't know who he is.	Ne vem kdo je.
They were all right.	Vsi so imeli prav.
I just want to say.	Rad bi samo povedal.
I saw that too.	To sem tudi videl.
It wouldn't be right.	Ne bi bilo prav.
I asked them what happened	Vprašal sem jih, kaj se je zgodilo
He used to do that.	Včasih je to počel.
I never want to be without you again	Nikoli več ne želim biti brez tebe
I wanted to see how you were	Hotel sem videti, kako si
I found someone else	Našel sem nekoga drugega
He doesn't do that.	Tega ne naredi.
He thought he was the only one who found it.	Mislil je, da ga je našel edini.
I just wanted it done	Samo želel sem, da se to naredi
You didn't want to.	Nisi hotel.
I don't have time right now	Trenutno nimam časa
They had theirs.	Imeli so svoje.
It's hard for me.	Težko mi je.
And it's you.	In to si ti.
I thought that was what he wanted	Mislil sem, da je to tisto, kar želi
He didn't see it.	Ni ga videl.
I’m sure this isn’t my time	Prepričan sem, da to ni moj čas
I immediately decided to go there	Takoj sem se odločil, da grem tja
She still knows him.	Še vedno ga pozna.
I wonder if this is true	Sprašujem se, če je to res
I actually felt good	Pravzaprav sem se počutil dobro
You can have anything you want.	Lahko imaš vse, kar želiš.
I know everyone is for it	Vem, da so vsi za to
I just wanted to make sure you were okay	Želel sem se samo prepričati, da si v redu
I didn't help there.	Tam nisem pomagal.
I had things to do last night	Sinoči sem imel stvari za početi
I didn’t have any of that	Nič od tega nisem imel
I am nothing and everything.	Jaz sem nič in vse.
I don't think that's the case	Mislim, da temu ni tako
I thought not.	Mislil sem, da ne.
He wants to.	Želi, da bi.
I know you want that too	Vem, da si tudi to želiš
There's nobody like me.	Nihče ni kot jaz.
I don't want to talk about it.	Nočem govoriti o tem.
I don't want him.	nočem ga.
Just like before, he felt like it was true.	Tako kot prej se je počutil, kot da je res.
I didn't want to see anyone	Nikogar nisem hotel videti
I wouldn't go.	Ne bi šel.
But it's pretty wrong.	Je pa precej narobe.
Maybe not even that.	Mogoče niti to ne.
They both said yes.	Oba sta rekla da.
Forever.	Za vedno.
I've never seen them before.	Še nikoli jih nisem videl.
I feel good with you	s tabo se počutim dobro
She was good.	Bila je dobra.
I'm fine, he said.	V redu sem, je rekel.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe.
I didn't do anything wrong here	Tukaj nisem naredil nič narobe
I know you've seen it all	Vem, da si videl vse
He went out there	Šel je tja ven
That's what I wanted to say	To sem hotel povedati
I have money, a lot of money	Imam denar, veliko denarja
Really obvious this is going to happen.	Res očitno, da se bo to zgodilo.
I talked to him.	govoril sem z njim.
She told herself everything would be fine.	Rekla si je, da bo vse v redu.
And that was the problem.	In to je bil problem.
I can not.	ne morem.
It's just a game.	To je samo igra.
I didn't ask that.	Tega nisem vprašal.
Wrong.	Narobe.
What he wants	Kar si želi
You did it.	Uspelo vam je.
I would love to see him	Rad bi ga videl
We are in this together.	Skupaj sva v tem.
This is more likely.	To je bolj verjetno.
I didn't ask her.	Nisem je vprašal.
You can't either.	Tudi ti ne moreš.
Do it once.	Naredi to enkrat.
I don't think anything about it	Nič ne mislim o tem
I wonder what happened to it.	Sprašujem se, kaj se je zgodilo s tem.
They were fine by themselves.	Sami so bili v redu.
I was fine.	Bil sem v redu.
It was true.	Res je bilo.
If I was, I would have left by now.	Če bi bil, bi že odšel.
I'm not interested in anything right now.	Trenutno me nič ne zanima.
I didn't want to do that	Tega nisem hotel narediti
I see a lot.	Veliko vidim.
I just said.	Pravkar sem rekel.
I just wanted to see him	Hotel sem ga samo videti
Except they didn't.	Le da niso.
I see you.	Vidim te.
I didn't tell you.	Nisem ti povedal.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
I was lucky	Imel sem srečo
I had never been so happy to come home before	Nikoli prej nisem bil tako vesel, da sem prišel domov
I was here today.	Danes sem bil tukaj.
I already had that.	To sem že imel.
But it seems like it would.	Vendar se zdi, kot da bi bilo.
I'm a good father.	Jaz sem dober oče.
Because that's right.	Ker je to prav.
It wouldn't be the first time.	Ne bi bilo prvič.
Dad started.	Oče je začel.
A lot more money.	Veliko več denarja.
I never went back there.	Nikoli se nisem vrnil tja.
I'm afraid of her too	Tudi jaz se je bojim
This is done every day.	To se dela vsak dan.
I felt like not enough had happened.	Počutil sem se, kot da se ni zgodilo dovolj.
I have.	Imam.
I knew it was you.	Vedel sem, da si ti.
It's not mine anymore.	Ni več moj.
I have no doubt that this is true.	Ne dvomim, da je to res.
I had met her once before and I immediately liked her	Enkrat sem jo že srečal in takoj mi je bila všeč
The child is at home.	Otrok je doma.
He taught them well.	Dobro jih je naučil.
Now it's better that you have it too.	Zdaj pa je bolje, da ga imaš tudi ti.
Maybe because you don't have to.	Mogoče zato, ker ti ni treba.
I had to see if you had me	Moral sem videti, če me boš imel
Would stay again.	Spet bi ostal.
It seems like a good opportunity.	Zdi se, da je dobra priložnost.
I want to talk to you about what you know.	Rad bi govoril s tabo o tem, kar veš.
This is not really the case.	To pravzaprav ni tako.
A man who has no money does not do this	Človek, ki je brez denarja, tega ne počne
He works many days.	Dela veliko dni.
He didn't look good.	Ni bil videti dobro.
Because he knows better.	Ker ve bolje.
It was really good for me	Res mi je bilo kar dobro
And what it is, it is.	In kaj je, je to.
No one knew where he lived.	Nihče ni vedel, kje živi.
I didn’t know there was such a thing	Nisem vedel, da obstaja kaj takega
I will not allow this	tega ne bom dovolil
So it feels good.	Tako da se počuti dobro.
I saw a long time ago that nothing comes.	Že dolgo nazaj sem videl, da nič ne pride.
I always wanted to do that	Vedno sem si želel to narediti
Not a day more.	Niti dan več.
Just like now.	Tako kot zdaj.
I don't want to stay here.	Nočem ostati tukaj.
I said wrong.	Narobe sem povedal.
I absolutely loved it!.	Popolnoma mi je bilo všeč!.
I can see why he meant that.	Vidim, zakaj je to mislil.
He won't do anything about it.	Glede tega ne bo storil ničesar.
I don't see it myself	Sam tega ne vidim
You need to know.	Moraš vedeti.
I came back for it	Vrnil sem se po to
I know you know who he is	Vem, da veš kdo je
I would be very happy	zelo bi bil vesel
That’s what I needed to leave	To sem potreboval, da sem odšel
Maybe I could teach you a little	Mogoče bi te lahko malo naučil
I wanted to tell her that everything would be fine	Hotel sem ji povedati, da bo vse v redu
One would soon not know what to do.	Človek kmalu ne bi vedel, kaj bi naredil.
He wasn't so sure now.	Zdaj ni bil tako prepričan.
I told you you were going to learn something	Rekel sem ti, da se boš nekaj naučil
I used to want to go there	Nekoč bi rad šel tja
that's how I want you.	tako te želim.
I don't want to know.	nočem vedeti.
Man to man.	Človek o človek.
I can't talk about it yet	Ne morem še govoriti o tem
I told myself that was why he helped us	Rekel sem si, da nam je zato pomagal

Maybe he thought it was you.	Mogoče je mislil, da si ti.

I don’t have much to do today	Danes nimam veliko za početi
I know, this is life.	Vem, to je življenje.
I saw a lot of things here	Tukaj sem videl veliko stvari
Not everyone is like me.	Vsi niso kot jaz.
There was no one else.	Nikogar več ni bilo.
He can have it.	Lahko jo ima.
I came to talk to you	Prišel sem govoriti s tabo
So I wasn’t ready for it	Tako nisem bil pripravljen na to
I was too busy.	Bil sem preveč zaposlen.
He would be such a good father.	Bil bi tako dober oče.
He's probably right.	Verjetno ima prav.
I wanted to see everything.	Hotel sem videti vse.
Tired.	Utrujen.
I wanted to do right	Hotel sem narediti prav
I see your true self	Vidim tvoj pravi jaz
I can't tell you what to do or not	Ne morem vam povedati, kaj storiti ali ne
I wanted it to be you	Hotel sem, da si to ti
That's all happened.	To se je vse zgodilo.
I don't think he found it.	Mislim, da ga ni našel.
I still couldn't see her	Še vedno je nisem mogel videti
No one left them.	Nihče jih ni ostal.
And something else.	In še nekaj.
I think it was probably me	Mislim, da sem bil verjetno jaz
I told you he knew everything	Rekel sem ti, da ve vse
I thought it was for me	Mislil sem, to je zame
It is everything and nothing.	Je vse in nič.

He did that.	To je storil.
I was there to see it	Bil sem tam, da bi to videl
I couldn't do this without you	Brez tebe tega ne bi mogel
I'm sure not.	Prepričan sem, da ne.
Help, help and more help.	Pomoč, pomoč in še enkrat pomoč.

I will not buy again	ne bom več kupil
That really happened.	To se je res zgodilo.
From there it was very easy.	Od tam je bilo zelo preprosto.
I wonder how long he's been doing this	Zanima me, kako dolgo že to počne
I just hope not for me.	Samo upam, da ne zame.
If you don’t like it, it’s simple.	Če vam ni všeč, je preprosto.
They both did.	Oba sta to storila.
Or just.	Ali pa samo.
This is indeed a possibility, but it is not the only one.	To je res možnost, vendar ni edina.
I know what you think of me	Vem, kaj si misliš o meni
I went to the hotel.	Šel sem v hotel.
I just couldn't believe it was you	Preprosto nisem mogel verjeti, da si to ti
I will try to be a good guy.	Poskušal bom biti dober fant.
If he is, we have never seen him.	Če je, ga nikoli nismo videli.

That doesn't seem right.	To se ne zdi prav.
There may be a reason.	Morda obstaja razlog.
I didn't mean it, really	Nisem mislil, res ne

I was very surprised	Bil sem zelo presenečen
I knew there had to be something like that	Vedel sem, da mora biti nekaj takega
I think he might know where he's going	Mislim, da morda ve, kam gre
He will never find us.	Nikoli nas ne bo našel.
Someone will come for you.	Nekdo bo prišel po vas.
I love what he does	Všeč mi je, kar počne

I really have to go.	Res moram iti.
I thought he'd be here by now	Mislil sem, da bo že tukaj
I will never come here again	Nikoli več ne bom prišel sem
We'll see if he's right.	Bomo videli, če ima prav.
And there is a lot of time.	In časa je veliko.
However, this was not the case	Vendar temu ni bilo tako
And something else.	In še nekaj.
I thought it was so beautiful	Zdelo se mi je tako lepo
I think maybe he's my father.	Mislim, da je morda moj oče.
I have to go now.	Moram iti zdaj.

There is nothing more to say.	Ni kaj več za povedati.
I didn't go ready	Nisem šel pripravljen
It's probably for the better.	Verjetno je tako na bolje.
Actually no.	Pravzaprav ne.

I just wanted to see what he did	Hotel sem samo videti, kaj je naredil
I only have this once	To imam samo enkrat
We could have a good time.	Lahko bi se imeli lepo.

There just isn’t enough time to do that.	Preprosto ni dovolj časa, da bi to storila.

And in us.	In v nas.
I would like to.	Rad bi.
I don’t care how good he is.	Ne zanima me, kako dober je.

I need to know they're fine	Moram vedeti, da so v redu
You should know better than to do that	Moral bi vedeti bolje kot to storiti
I can't do enough	Ne morem narediti dovolj
I had nothing to do with it	S tem nisem imel nič
And so on.	In tako naprej.

You should do these things	Moral bi narediti te stvari

I'm the only one in town.	Jaz sem edini na mestu.
He wanted to.	Želel je.

Which has never been the case for me.	Kar zame nikoli ni bilo.

I see her.	Vidim jo.
You will have to do something else.	Morali boste narediti nekaj drugega.
I could never be better than him	Nikoli ne bi mogel biti boljši od njega

I think he is very angry	Mislim, da je zelo jezen
There is a lot of work there.	Tam je veliko dela.
I wanted to see him today	Želel sem ga videti danes
But I never knew what it was	Nikoli pa nisem vedel, kaj je to
I promised to call	Obljubil sem, da bom poklical
He's doing well.	Dobro mu gre.
We don't know what's going on.	Ne vemo, kaj se dogaja.
I am very happy to be here	Zelo sem vesel, da sem tukaj
I didn't buy him anything	Nič mu nisem kupil
This is something more.	To je nekaj več.
No, that's not good.	Ne, to ni dobro.
I see you quite often	Vidim te kar pogosto
I was more than ready to move on.	Bil sem več kot pripravljen iti naprej.
I hope we have time.	Upam, da imamo čas.
It was nothing.	To je bil nič.
There, right then.	Tam, prav takrat.
I didn't like it.	Ni mi bilo všeč.
I came here and found you	Prišel sem sem in te našel
I didn't do that	Nisem delal tako
I would never do that to her	Tega ji nikoli ne bi storil
This is really hard.	To je res težko.
Nobody wanted them.	Nihče jih ni hotel.
I thought maybe you were.	Mislil sem, da si morda.
I can't even talk about it	O tem sploh ne morem govoriti
I just couldn’t believe it	Preprosto nisem mogel verjeti
I didn't come back just for the money.	Nisem se vrnil samo zaradi denarja.
I'm glad you asked	Vesel sem, da si vprašal
I knew he wasn’t that good for me	Vedela sem, da zame ni tako dober
I want to know what he's doing	Želim vedeti, kaj počne
I never thought you would come	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da boš prišel
I started doing it again	Spet sem začel to početi
I can't seem to help myself	Zdi se, da si ne morem pomagati
And you could see them.	In lahko si jih videl.
I haven't seen you or talked to you	Nisem te videl ali govoril s tabo
He knew better.	Vedel je bolje.
I'm ready when you are	Jaz sem pripravljen, ko si ti
I understand you needed time after what happened	Razumem, da si potreboval čas po tem, kar se je zgodilo
Not for me.	Ni zame.
I really didn’t know how to do that	Tega res nisem vedela narediti
We've had enough.	Imeli smo dovolj.
I didn't want anyone to see them	Nisem hotel, da bi jih kdo videl
I just want to be your friend	Želim biti samo tvoj prijatelj
He didn't expect that.	Tega ni pričakoval.
He will have.	Imel bo.
I didn't say anything.	Nič nisem rekel.
I didn't expect to find anything now	Nisem pričakoval, da bom zdaj kaj našel
I just asked him what he meant by that.	Samo vprašal sem ga, kaj je mislil s tem.
Every person.	Vsak človek.
A lot of people are working on it.	Veliko ljudi dela na tem.
I thought as if I wanted to know.	Mislil sem, kot bi rad vedel.
I’m too tired to do that	Preveč sem utrujen, da bi to naredil
I would say this is unlikely	Temu bi rekel malo verjetno
You made it.	Uspelo ti je.
I'll call him.	Poklical ga bom.
That was always the question.	To je bilo vedno vprašanje.
And he has to do it right away.	In to mora storiti takoj.
He had never seen her before.	Še nikoli je ni videl.
I've been like this my whole life	Tako sem že vse življenje
Maybe you won't.	Mogoče ne boš.
I probably shouldn't	Verjetno ne bi smel
He says he wants to talk to you.	Pravi, da želi govoriti s tabo.
I have to work here.	Tukaj moram delati.
He just never did.	Samo nikoli ni storil.
I forgot that	To sem pozabil
I wanted to see if you were okay	Hotel sem videti, če si v redu
Maybe he's right.	Mogoče ima prav.
I want to see how they will be now.	Želim videti, kako bodo zdaj.
That's exactly what you should do.	Prav to bi moral storiti.
I couldn't say more simply !.	Ne bi mogel povedati več preprosto!.
I want you to have a good time	Želim ti, da se imaš lepo
I always thought we would all be together forever	Vedno sem mislil, da bomo vsi skupaj za vedno
I did that.	To sem naredil.
I could give you everything you ever wanted	Lahko bi ti dal vse, kar si si kdaj želel
It really is you.	Res si ti.
It's not true.	Ni res.
I want to do it.	Želim si to narediti.
I really don't know how to do it.	Res ne vem, kako to narediti.
I told you and told you.	Povedal sem ti in povedal.
Maybe that was the reason.	Mogoče je bil to razlog.
I am very interested to know.	Zelo me zanima vedeti.
I'll know where you are	Vedel bom, kje si
That was.	To je bilo.
I just forgot for a while	Samo za nekaj časa sem pozabil
First, we are interested in many things.	Prvič, zanima nas veliko stvari.
That's it.	To je to.
It wouldn't happen.	Ne bi se zgodilo.
I want to be there when you are.	Želim biti tam, ko boš ti.
Maybe.	Mogoče .
I don’t know what’s going on about that.	Ne vem, kaj se dogaja glede tega.
I knew something was going to happen	Vedel sem, da se bo nekaj zgodilo
It didn't look so good now.	Zdaj ni bilo videti tako dobro.
I bought for all three	Kupil sem za vse tri
This is what happened this week.	To se je zgodilo ta teden.
Maybe we should.	Mogoče bi morali.
He was tired.	Bil je utrujen.
I mean, not like that	Mislim, ne tako
I totally heard them	Popolnoma sem jih slišal
It really is that simple.	Res je tako preprosto.
I will do that soon.	To bom storil kmalu.
I always wanted to leave	Vedno sem hotel oditi
I'd really rather not eat that.	Tega res raje ne bi jedel.
I would love that.	To bi mi bilo všeč.
It's simple.	Preprosto je.
My father was.	Moj oče je bil.
I hope you like it	Upam, da vam bodo všeč
I loved the way he said them	Všeč mi je bilo, kako jih je rekel
I could totally do that	Popolnoma bi to lahko naredil
And no one has done that yet.	In tega še nihče ni storil.
He knew he wasn't.	Vedel je, da ni.
I wanted you to know.	Hotel sem, da veš.
Does not exist.	Ne obstaja.
I got a little lost here	Tukaj sem se malo izgubil
I'm not sorry either	Tudi meni ni žal
Just for me.	Samo zame.
I wasn't in the room	Nisem bil v sobi
You should actually know that.	To bi pravzaprav morali vedeti.
I think this may need to be done for now	Mislim, da bo morda to za zdaj treba storiti
He thought he knew what it could be for.	Mislil je, da ve, za kaj bi to lahko bilo.
.	.
I thought you were here	Mislil sem, da si tukaj ti
It's a game.	To je igra.
Seriously, that's it.	Resno, to je to.
But it can be a problem.	Lahko pa je problem.
I was all these things	Bil sem vse te stvari
I didn’t know what was going to happen to me	Nisem vedel, kaj se mi bo zgodilo
He doesn't know me.	On me ne pozna.
He needs you.	Potrebuje te.
And it can be beautiful.	In lahko je lepo.
I really started from scratch	Res sem začel iz nič
Few people live.	Malo ljudi živi.
We did it.	Uspelo nam je.
I had no money to give him.	Nisem imel denarja, da bi mu dal.
I like it very much too	Tudi meni je zelo všeč
I knew she wouldn't be well	Vedel sem, da ji ne bi bilo dobro
No, I don't have to tell.	Ne, ni mi treba povedati.
She will have to.	Morala bo.
Not good enough.	Ne dovolj dobro.
I want to play with you	Želim se igrati s tabo
I knew it wasn't true	Vedel sem, da ni res
We are nothing like that.	Mi nismo nič takega.
He doesn't know what that would be.	Ne ve, kaj bi to bilo.
No one can do that.	Tega nihče ne more storiti.
As we all are.	Kot smo vsi.
But I didn’t know she was going to do it	Nisem pa vedel, da bo to storila
He thought it wasn't true.	Mislil je, da ni res.
I asked him what he did	Vprašal sem ga, kaj je naredil
It was fast.	Bilo je hitro.
I still didn’t know if it was okay	Še vedno nisem vedela, če je v redu
It had to be a reason.	Moral je biti razlog.
I will definitely be back	zagotovo se bom vrnil
No one knows this better than you.	Nihče ne ve tega bolje kot ti.
I found a lot the day before.	Prejšnji dan sem našel veliko.
I knew something was wrong now	Vedel sem, da zdaj nekaj ni v redu
He was a boy.	Bil je fant.
Nothing else feels so good.	Nič drugega se ne počuti tako dobro.
This is very difficult.	To je zelo težko.
I didn't expect that	Tega nisem pričakoval
We can’t really stay long tonight.	Nocoj pravzaprav ne moremo ostati dolgo.
He is very good.	On je zelo dober.
He's up to something.	Nekaj ​​namerava.
I'll tell you when	ti bom povedal kdaj
I have enough	Dovolj mi je
I can't be seen here	Tukaj me ni mogoče videti
But not all of them were.	Vendar niso bili vsi.
I had to know what just happened	Moral sem vedeti, kaj se je pravkar zgodilo
I would lose him.	Izgubil bi ga.
I was there with you	Bil sem tam s tabo
I really don't need to	res mi ni treba
I still haven't found her	Še vedno je nisem našel
He just knew.	Samo vedel je.
That's what he told me.	To mi je rekel.
He was there.	Tam je bil.
I haven't seen her in years	Nisem je videl že leta
Your father doesn't know that.	Tvoj oče tega ne ve.
So it was really hard.	Tako da je bilo res težko.
He was in me now.	Zdaj je bil v meni.
Maybe you are.	Mogoče si.
I've seen that before.	To sem že videl.
He tells me he's not sure.	Pravi mi, da ni prepričan.
It's really, really good.	Res je, res dobro.
I need a little help	Potrebujem malo pomoči
What would you do.	Kaj bi naredili.
I didn't like him going after you	Ni mi bilo všeč, da je šel za tabo
You know that now.	To zdaj veš.
I'm actually much better.	Pravzaprav sem veliko bolje.
I never would have thought	Nikoli si ne bi mislil
I didn’t know why it was so hard for me	Nisem vedel, zakaj mi je bilo to tako težko
I was sure it was true	Bil sem prepričan, da je res
Let me move on.	Naj grem naprej.
It's not right with him today.	Danes z njim ni prav.
If only I had it.	Ko bi ga le imel.
But apparently they weren't.	A očitno niso bili.
I will not promise.	ne bom obljubil.
Now, obviously, not everyone.	Zdaj to očitno niso vsi.
I know you did something to her	Vem, da si ji nekaj naredil
Better than good, really.	Bolje kot dobro, res.
I haven’t felt so good in a long time	Že dolgo se nisem počutil tako dobro
I've been waiting for this for a long time	Na to sem čakal že dolgo
I feel good about that.	Ob tem se dobro počutim.
I just have to be sure	Samo biti moram prepričan
I never understand things	Nikoli ne razumem stvari
She's really good.	Res je dobra.
I know how it can be	Vem, kako je lahko
First, the issue is not before us.	Prvič, vprašanje ni pred nami.
I know what you mean.	Vem, kaj misliš.
You should play better than that	Moral bi igrati bolje kot to
See you again.	Se pa spet vidim.
I felt like I was doing a lot	Zdelo se mi je, da to počnem veliko
I’m sorry I never got to know him better	Žal mi je, da ga nisem nikoli bolje spoznal
Even more, perhaps.	Še bolj, morda.
She didn't like me going out.	Ni ji bilo všeč, da sem šel ven.
I wonder why.	Sprašujem zakaj.
Who will know for sure.	Kdo bo zagotovo vedel.
I believe.	Verjamem.
If I didn’t, I certainly would.	Če ne bi, bi zagotovo.
I'm glad I did	Vesel sem, da sem to storil
That was my job.	To je bilo moje delo.
I wasn’t sure what to do about it.	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj naj storim glede tega.
It would be fine.	Bilo bi v redu.
It's actually nice.	Pravzaprav je lepo.
But he's right.	Vendar ima prav.
I never go out	Nikoli ne grem ven
I didn't really mean that	To pravzaprav nisem mislil
It's just .	To je samo .
I never wanted any of that	Nikoli si nisem želel ničesar od tega
That was not the case.	To ni bilo.
I didn't tell him where you were going	Nisem mu povedal, kam si šel
You can never be.	Nikoli ne moreš biti.
I think he meant it	Mislim, da je to mislil
I wonder where they are	Sprašujem se, kje so
All that.	Vse to.
I never found him	Nikoli ga nisem našel
No one said that, but he was convinced of it.	Nihče ni rekel tega, vendar je bil v to prepričan.
I have to tell you something	Nekaj ​​ti moram povedati
I'm glad he's my father	Vesel sem, da je moj oče
He wanted me home.	Hotel me je domov.
I heard something about that	Nekaj ​​sem slišal o tem
I hope you know that	Upam, da to veš
He can't stop it from happening.	Ne more narediti, da se to ne bi zgodilo.
Not just you.	Ne samo ti.
They certainly did enough.	Zagotovo so naredili dovolj.
I don't know where he's going.	Ne vem, kam gre.
I thought you were happy for me	Mislil sem, da si vesel zame
This can be bought.	To se da kupiti.
It just takes time.	Samo potrebuje čas.
It's too much for me these days.	Te dni mi je preveč.
A lot of people do that.	Veliko ljudi to počne.
Not another.	Ne drugega.
That's actually a good question.	To je pravzaprav dobro vprašanje.
I have to do this.	To moram narediti.
They had to.	Morali so.
She really knew how to do things.	Res je vedela, kako narediti stvari.
I almost knew they would	Skoraj sem vedel, da bodo
Not for many years actually.	Pravzaprav ne več let.
I need someone out there who knows what he's doing	Potrebujem nekoga tam, ki ve, kaj počne
I waited to see if he would die	Čakal sem, da vidim, če bo umrl
I wasn’t sure what would happen after that	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj se bo zgodilo po tem
He told me that himself.	To mi je sam povedal.
And he did it well.	In to je dobro naredil.
I didn't do it for the money.	Tega nisem naredil za denar.
You did it.	Ti si naredil.
I will teach him myself	Sam ga bom naučil
i.e.	se pravi.
i would do that.	jaz bi to naredil.
Maybe it was just as good.	Morda je bilo prav tako dobro.
You know, he lives life.	Veste, on živi življenje.
I thought you meant it	Mislil sem, da si to mislil
He certainly did a lot for it.	Zagotovo je naredil veliko za to.
I don't need to talk to him.	Ni mi treba govoriti z njim.
And that can be nice.	In to je lahko lepo.
I still have a lot of work to do	Imam še veliko dela
I had it.	Imel sem ga.
You could also have	Lahko bi tudi imel
I didn't give that either.	Tudi tega nisem dal.
I certainly didn't.	Jaz zagotovo nisem.
I don't know what will go wrong.	Ne vem, kaj bo narobe.
He had to get out quickly.	Hitro je moral ven.
This is life.	To je življenje.
I'm sorry we didn't have more time	Žal mi je, da nismo imeli več časa
He wanted to talk yesterday.	Včeraj je hotel govoriti.
I believe what happened to him is true	Verjamem, da je to, kar se mu je zgodilo, res
I can't stay home today	Danes ne morem ostati doma
That's not what it is.	To ni tisto, kar je.
I wanted to be alone.	Hotel sem biti sam.
I just needed enough time	Potreboval sem le dovolj časa
It's not long now.	Zdaj ni dolgo.
Think well.	Dobro misli.
This is the one you want.	To je tisti, ki ga želiš.
He knew what it was.	Vedel je, kaj je.
Not at your place, please.	Ne pri vas, prosim.
I'm not good enough.	Nisem dovolj dober.
It's about money.	Gre za denar.
I never played anything.	Nikoli nisem nič igral.
Each of them got what they wanted.	Vsak je od tega dobil, kar je hotel.
Not angry either.	Tudi ne jezen.
I knew what happened	Vedel sem, kaj se je zgodilo
I never wanted any of that	Nikoli si nisem želel ničesar od tega
I followed him.	Šla sem za njim.
I haven't seen you in years	Nisem te videl že leta
I haven't decided yet	Nisem se še odločil
And not for anything they did.	In ne za nič, kar so storili.
Fortunately, it looks fine.	Na srečo je videti v redu.
I didn't see her that way	Nisem je videl tako
Do you think? 	Ali misliš?
And here he was.	In tukaj je bil.
I hope all is well with you.	Upam, da je s tabo vse v redu.
You know why we are here.	Veste zakaj smo tukaj.
There I asked someone what was going on	Tam sem nekoga vprašal, kaj se dogaja
This is not an option.	To ni možnost.
Me neither.	Jaz tudi ne.
I loved it when he was home	Všeč mi je bilo, ko je bil doma
I just have to believe	Samo verjeti moram
I couldn't see well	Nisem mogel dobro videti
I asked him not to, but he did	Prosil sem ga, da ne, a je storil
But she failed.	Vendar ji ni uspelo.
Yes.	Je.
I've never heard her speak	Še nikoli je nisem slišal govoriti
I will never say	nikoli ne bom povedal
He helped me a lot.	Zelo mi je pomagal.
I was waiting for her there.	Tam sem jo čakal.
I have to do it myself	To moram narediti sam
He said he really needs the money.	Rekel je, da zelo potrebuje denar.
In fact, I was surprised by it	Pravzaprav sem bil presenečen nad tem
But there is more to it than that.	Vendar je več kot to.
However, this is clearly not the case.	Vendar očitno ni tako.
What did you expect?	Kaj si pričakoval.
I don't know if that's possible	Ne vem, če je to mogoče
Nobody came here.	Nihče ni prišel sem.
I just wanted to be alone	Hotel sem biti samo sam
I used to have a nice life like you.	Nekoč sem imel lepo življenje, kot ti.
I think that's enough for today	Mislim, da je za danes dovolj
Right now.	Takoj zdaj.
We had to.	Morali smo.
I almost dropped out of school.	Skoraj sem pustil šolo.
I can't believe he just told me that	Ne morem verjeti, da mi je to pravkar rekel
This is more than just a game.	To je več kot le igra.
I will do as you wish	Naredil bom tako, kot ti želiš
Keep it up!!!!!!.	Kar tako naprej!!!!!!.
I did it for the money	To sem naredil zaradi denarja
He's so glad he's here.	Tako je vesel, da je tukaj.
Now he has his work to do.	Zdaj ima svoje delo.
And they have so far.	In so do zdaj.
We knew we had to do it.	Vedeli smo, da moramo to storiti.
I certainly would.	zagotovo bi.
I tried, you have to believe me	Poskušal sem, moraš mi verjeti
I didn't like being a kid.	Ni mi bilo všeč biti otrok.
I knew who he was now	Vedel sem, kdo je zdaj
Early in the morning.	Zgodaj zjutraj.
When she wasn't with him.	Ko ni bila z njim.
I mean, that's all it was	Mislim, to je vse, kar je bilo
It just goes on.	Preprosto gre naprej.
I probably should go	Verjetno bi moral iti
I mean, you've done too much already	Mislim, naredil si že preveč
He wouldn't want that.	On si tega ne bi želel.
As they are tonight.	Kot so nocoj.
I almost want him	Skoraj si ga želim
He's there now.	Zdaj je tam.
I'll tell you that	To vam bom povedal
I can’t talk to him about what’s going on.	Ne morem govoriti z njim o tem, kaj se dogaja.
I could have started.	Lahko sem začel.
We failed.	Ni nam uspelo.
I hope everything is allright	Upam, da je vse v redu
And you would be so good at it.	In ti bi bil tako dober v tem.
I will ask you again	še enkrat vas bom vprašal
That was no longer possible.	To ni bilo več mogoče.
I have no more money	Nimam več denarja
But it was true.	Vendar je bilo res.
I never saw her again.	Nisem je več videl.
Apparently he didn't do anything.	Očitno ni naredil nič.
Nothing happened to us.	Nič se nam ni zgodilo.
Much more.	Veliko več.
I think it is.	Mislim, da je.
I didn’t expect them to	Nisem pričakoval, da bodo
I have to work on it	Moram delati na tem
He never asked me about it again.	Nikoli več me ni vprašal o tem.
I forgot about it because there was nothing out of it	Pozabil sem na to, ker iz tega ni bilo nič
If only.	Če bi le.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Nisem prepričan, kako to storiti.
I understand why it all happened	Razumem, zakaj se je vse zgodilo
I kept thinking that someone would definitely come soon	Ves čas sem mislil, da bo zagotovo kdo kmalu prišel
I've never felt this way before.	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil.
I never wanted anything	Nikoli si nisem želel ničesar
And now we are back.	In zdaj smo nazaj.
I want to do something that feels more my age.	Želim delati nekaj, kar se bolj zdi moja leta.
I was very happy.	Bil sem zelo vesel.
I want to be alone today	Danes želim biti sam
Just a matter of time.	Samo vprašanje časa.
I wanted to go alone	Hotel sem iti sam
It was so good that I got it back.	Bilo je tako dobro, da sem ga dobil nazaj.
I wouldn't say.	ne bi rekel.
Not much.	Ni veliko.
I'm unlikely to die.	Malo verjetno je, da bom umrl.
He is a good father.	On je dober oče.
I should never have left	Nikoli ne bi smel oditi
And neither are you.	In tudi ti nisi.
I didn't need it.	nisem ga potreboval.
I wonder why that is.	Sprašujem se, zakaj je tako.
But it can be difficult.	Lahko pa bo težko.
I don't have much time	Nimam veliko časa
Can anyone help.	Ali lahko kdo pomaga.
I came in front of the house.	Prišel sem pred hišo.
You were alone.	Bila si sama.
It's been that way ever since.	Od takrat je tako.
Which is pretty long.	Kar je precej dolgo.
I was me.	jaz sem bil jaz.
She didn't know what to do with him.	Ni vedela, kaj naj stori z njim.
It would be nice for the kids.	Za otroke bi bilo lepo.
Why in this place? 	Zakaj na tem mestu?
he thought.	mislil je.
If you want it, we probably have it.	Če želite, verjetno ga imamo.
That was then, that is now.	To je bilo takrat, to je zdaj.
I found you without knowing it	Našel sem te, ne da bi vedel
But not then.	Vendar ne takrat.
I want to see her	Rad bi jo videl
No one saw her.	Nihče je ni videl.
You've done enough.	Naredili ste dovolj.
It wouldn't happen again.	To se ne bi več zgodilo.
He said he fears for his life.	Rekel je, da se boji za svoje življenje.
They have done this before and would do it again.	To so storili že prej in bi to storili še enkrat.
If not, no.	Če ne, ne.
Can anyone help me with this.	Ali mi lahko kdo pomaga pri tem.
You know how to do it.	Veš, kako to narediti.
I did that to myself	To sem si naredil
never.	nikoli ne.
I have to go.	Moram iti.
You don't have to believe it.	Ni vam treba verjeti.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo to.
I needed that.	To sem potreboval.
Very much after him.	Zelo za njim.
I thought it was.	Mislil sem, da je.
That was not good.	To ni bilo dobro.
They are with us.	Z nami so.
So is mine.	Tako tudi moj.
We all have our problems.	Vsi imamo svoje težave.
He wanted to help.	Hotel je pomagati.
He said he didn't like it.	Rekel je, da mu to ni všeč.
I think she likes you.	Mislim, da si ji všeč.
I will also need some help	Potreboval bom tudi nekaj pomoči
I said too much	Preveč sem povedal
That's what it is.	To je tisto, kar je.
We succeeded.	Nam je uspelo.
I know very well.	zelo dobro vem.
Sometimes not.	Včasih ne.
You said no.	Rekel si, da ne.
There was no one here who shouldn’t be.	Tukaj ni bilo nikogar, ki ne bi smel biti.
I really don't need them.	Res jih ne potrebujem.
I came here thinking only of my work	Sem prišel sem mislil samo na svoje delo
I didn’t feel better for a week	Teden dni se nisem počutil bolje
No one will go out.	Nihče ne bo šel ven.
I didn't do anything tonight anyway	Nocoj tako ali tako nisem nič počel
I can’t believe this is happening	Ne morem verjeti, da se to dogaja
I will do everything for you.	Vse bom naredil zate.
I did everything	naredil sem vse
I do all these things myself now.	Vse te stvari zdaj počnem sam.
I was glad it was there.	Vesel sem bil, da je bilo tam.
And they really are.	In res so.
She didn't like that.	To ji ni bilo všeč.
We are the only ones who can.	Mi smo edini, ki lahko.
Do what is right.	Naredi, kar je prav.
She didn't know where she was going.	Kam gre, ni vedela.
And my stuff.	In moje stvari.
That's what I decided.	To sem se odločil.
In fact, it may be more true.	Pravzaprav je morda bolj res.
You know who you are.	Veš kdo si.
I didn’t want to feel good	Nisem hotel, da bi se počutil dobro
And there are actually a lot of them.	In pravzaprav jih je veliko.
I just want to call a few of them.	Samo nekaj bi jih rad poklical.
I knew what was going to happen	Vedel sem, kaj se bo zgodilo
Now he knew why.	Zdaj je vedel zakaj.
You didn't do anything like that.	Nič takega niste storili.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I didn’t even know about it	Sploh nisem vedel za to
Maybe or not.	Morda ali pa tudi ne.
And that's it, you know.	In to je vse, veš.
And I wouldn't.	In ne bi.
I was there.	Jaz sem bila tam.
Too much.	Preveč.
He didn't want to talk about it either.	Tudi o tem ni hotel govoriti.
I have a lot of that	Tega imam veliko
I was glad it wasn't	Vesel sem bil, da ni
I never knew he could do that	Nikoli nisem vedel, da lahko to stori
I only met him once.	Spoznal sem ga samo enkrat.
Given this, they may be lucky.	Glede na to bodo morda imeli srečo.
It's actually here.	Pravzaprav je tukaj.
He probably thought it was nice.	Verjetno se mu je to zdelo lepo.
I'll give it back.	dal ga bom nazaj.
I can't say more at the moment	Več trenutno ne morem povedati
Not everyone likes that.	To ni vsem všeč.
I was glad to be here.	Bil sem vesel, da sem bil tukaj.
I knew what he was thinking	Vedel sem, kaj si misli
You don't have to come back for us.	Ni vam treba priti nazaj po nas.
I did things and be someone	Počel sem stvari in biti nekdo
I know you know that.	Vem, da to veš.
It's really good to have someone like that.	Res je dobro, če imaš nekoga takega.
Let him come.	Naj pride.
And that has been a long time.	In to je bilo dolgo časa.
It's going well.	Dobro gre.
I wasn’t even sure if that was possible	Sploh nisem bil prepričan, če je to mogoče
I get this question quite often	To vprašanje sem dobil precej pogosto
I've seen that before.	To sem že videl.
He also doesn’t seem to have much else.	Prav tako se zdi, da nima veliko drugega.
This is not a man.	To ni človek.
The work is good.	Delo je dobro.
That there will be more and more of us	Da nas bo vedno več
When he was sorry.	Ko mu je bilo žal.
They were together.	Bila sta skupaj.
This is not the case now.	Zdaj pa ni tako.
What's happening? 	Kaj se dogaja?
They had no money.	Niso imeli denarja.
He was ready.	Bil je pripravljen.
They may not be sure how to do it.	Morda niso prepričani, kako to storiti.
I should be gone by then	Takrat bi moral že oditi
It has now begun.	Zdaj se je začel.
They did nothing about it.	Nič niso storili glede tega.
On, and on, and on.	Naprej, in naprej, in naprej.
As you can.	Kot lahko.
They were very helpful.	Bili so v veliko pomoč.
He has as much as he told me.	Ima toliko, kot mi je rekel.
I see this happening every day.	Vidim, da se to dogaja vsak dan.
Now we have to go.	Zdaj moramo iti.
Neither does my father.	Tudi moj oče ne.
All of them.	Prav vsi.
I thought that was it	Mislil sem, da je to vse
He was right.	Prav je imel.
I just had to be alone	Moral sem biti samo sam
I wasn’t entirely sure	Nisem bil popolnoma prepričan
Maybe it was.	Mogoče je bilo tako.
And much more!!.	In še veliko več!!.
He will do it for you.	Vam bo naredil.
It was like home.	Bilo je kot doma.
I don't know how or why.	Ne vem, kako in zakaj.
Instead, you gave it for me.	Namesto tega si ga dal namesto mene.
But right now, I like it	Trenutno pa mi je všeč
I'm not interested in anything else right now.	Trenutno me ne zanima nič drugega.
I just wanted to talk	Hotel sem samo govoriti
She was not well at the time.	Takrat ji ni bilo dobro.
It still seems to me that he is not ready yet.	Še vedno se mi zdi, da še ni pripravljen.
you are with me.	ti si z mano.
And you can !.	In lahko si!.
I prefer to think so	Raje mislim, da je
I just left everything	Samo pustil sem vse
I didn't think you'd ever come back.	Nisem si mislil, da se boš kdaj vrnil.
I wonder how long they've been here	Sprašujem se, kako dolgo so že tukaj
She really didn't know.	Res ni vedela.
I think I could help	Mislim, da bi lahko pomagal
I needed the book tomorrow	Knjigo sem potreboval jutri
I'm a little tired today	Danes sem malo utrujen
That will be a lot.	To bo veliko.
I forgot all about it	Vse sem pozabil na to
I didn't like it too much either	Tudi meni ni bil preveč všeč
You are not human.	Ti nisi človek.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Tako ne mora biti.
I know he has.	Vem, da ima.
That is, not yet.	Se pravi še ne.
It can't be that there aren't any.	Saj ne more biti, da jih ni.
There was nothing that I could do	Nič nisem mogel storiti
I know how busy you are.	Vem, kako si zaposlen.
I want to know what's going on	Želim vedeti, kaj se dogaja
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
I lost a lot	Precej sem izgubil
I thought it was hard to play	Mislil sem, da se težko igra
I'm sure he'll call.	Prepričan sem, da bo poklical.
I'll go to dinner with you	S tabo bom šel na večerjo
Could.	Lahko bi.
Tell me what he says.	Povej mi, kaj pravi.
I mean, he's a nobody.	Mislim, on je nihče.
I should leave now.	Zdaj bi moral oditi.
I've learned so much already	Toliko sem se že naučil
Apparently he liked it here.	Očitno mu je bilo tukaj všeč.
I should be the one	Jaz bi moral biti tisti
I knew it had to be for me	Vedel sem, da mora biti zame
I had three children.	Imel sem tri otroke.
I didn’t know what was going on	Nisem vedel, kaj se dogaja
Anything you like.	Vse, kar vam je všeč.
And why.	In zakaj.
I don't think that's true anymore	Mislim, da to ni več res
He always knew.	Vedno je vedel.
We still didn’t know.	Še vedno nismo vedeli.
It can be quite difficult.	Lahko je precej težko.
He needed to know what was going on.	Moral je vedeti, kaj se dogaja.
He won't like it at all.	Niti malo mu ne bo všeč.
And maybe it won't.	In morda ne bo.
That must be something.	To mora biti nekaj.
I can't believe what you just told me	Ne morem verjeti, kaj si mi pravkar povedal
I wish you had it.	Želel bi, da ga imaš.
We will be what we are.	Mi bomo to, kar smo.
Sometimes it's more.	Včasih je več.
You have to see that.	To moraš videti.
I’m not sure what it was either.  	Tudi jaz nisem prepričan, kaj je bilo.  
a.	a.
I wonder if this is happening here	Zanima me, če se to dogaja tukaj
In fact, I’ve never been to town before.	Pravzaprav še nikoli nisem bil v mestu.
But I’m not sure if that’s any better.	Nisem pa prepričan, če je to kaj bolje.
I definitely feel better this morning.	Danes zjutraj se zagotovo počutim bolje.
I do not know why.	Ne vem, zakaj.
I shouldn't be here	Ne bi smel biti tukaj
it really isn't.	res ni.
He didn't ask him now.	Zdaj ga ni vprašal.
Who is the better man.	Kdo je boljši človek.
He doesn't like to talk about it.	O tem ne mara govoriti.
I died alone.	Umrl sem sam.
I know because they are.	Vem, ker so.
I can't tell you who	Ne morem ti povedati kdo
I've known him for several years.	Poznam ga že nekaj let.
Some of them need to go home	Nekaj ​​jih mora domov
He didn't know why, but they were there.	Ni vedel zakaj, a tam so bili.
Simple as that.	Tako preprosto.
Nevermind.	Nič za to.
I still haven't seen him	Še vedno ga nisem videl
You shouldn't see him there.	Tam ga ne bi smeli videti.
I went out a little	Malo sem šel ven
A man is still a man.	Človek je še vedno človek.
My father couldn't help me.	Oče mi ni mogel pomagati.
We have so much work to do.	Toliko dela imamo.
I want to see what he can do.	Želim videti, kaj lahko naredi.
I didn’t know what happened	Nisem vedel, kaj se je zgodilo
So I hope this is true	Tako upam, da je to res
You're all day.	Ves dan si samo.
I let everyone believe he succeeded	Vsem sem pustil verjeti, da mu je uspelo
I would help her, you know.	Pomagal bi ji, veš.
I didn't know about you	Nisem vedel zate
I thought you might want your own book	Mislil sem, da bi si morda želel svojo knjigo
That wasn't enough.	To ni bilo dovolj.
They always have been	Vedno so bili
I won't say them.	Ne bom jih rekel.
That was fine with me.	To mi je bilo v redu.
That's the way it is right now.	Trenutno je tako ali tako.
I should be there for you	Moral bi biti tam zate
You should have told him then.	Takrat bi mu morala povedati.
I can't tell you how long.	Ne morem vam povedati, kako dolgo.
He always was.	Vedno je bil.
A long, long time.	Dolgo, dolgo časa.
In boy.	In fant.
he will say.	bo rekel.
I knew it was him	Vedel sem, da je to on
I knew it would.	Vedel sem, da bo.
He has been doing this for a long time.	Dolgo časa to počne.
Something is happening.	Nekaj ​​se dogaja.
I didn't have that either	Tudi tega nisem imel
It was already difficult.	Bilo je že težko.
I had to be home more	Moral sem biti več doma
I haven't forgotten anything	Nič nisem pozabil
You should go back to school.	Morala bi nazaj v šolo.
A little too much.	Malo preveč.
I made you what you are	Naredil sem te, kar si
They will probably never see her again.	Verjetno je ne bodo nikoli več videli.
I got it.	Dobil sem ga.
what we have.	kar imamo.
I should go there tomorrow	Jutri bi moral iti tja
You can't know.	Ne moreš vedeti.
I could have you now	Lahko bi te imel zdaj
I don't see who he is	Ne vidim, kdo je
He didn't tell anyone about it.	Nikomur ni povedal o tem.
I called her	Poklical sem jo
I'm not sure about that.	o tem nisem prepričan.
I didn't have to go alone	Ni mi bilo treba iti sam
I needed money.	Potreboval sem denar.
I knew you'd be better off without me	Vedel sem, da ti bo bolje brez mene
It's not ok.	Ni v redu.
That seemed right.	To se je zdelo prav.
They're just there.	Samo tam so.
Nobody knows at the moment.	Trenutno nihče ne ve.
I knew what he was thinking	Vedel sem, kaj si misli
No one stayed.	Nihče ni ostal.
Let it be here for more very soon !.	Naj bo tukaj za več zelo kmalu!.
In fact, I like you very much	Pravzaprav si mi zelo všeč
Now he will give them to you.	Zdaj ti jih bo dal.
But there was also something else.	Vendar je bilo tudi nekaj drugega.
Something just him.	Nekaj, kar je samo on.
I'd rather not	raje mi ne bi bilo treba
He decided.	Odločil se je.
It happened then, it will happen now.	Zgodilo se je takrat, zgodilo se bo zdaj.
But I don't know where he is now.	Ne vem pa, kje je zdaj.
Never with us.	Nikoli pri nas.
I wasn’t the one who needed help	Nisem bil tisti, ki je potreboval pomoč
I thought he came to us earlier	Mislil sem, da je prišel k nam prej
I didn't know what to do with you	Nisem vedel, kaj naj s tabo
I need to talk to you.	Moram govoriti s tabo.
There was nothing then.	Takrat ni bilo nič.
It's always there.	Vedno je tam.
I thought you'd be ready sooner	Mislil sem, da boš prej pripravljen
I simply.	jaz preprosto.
What do you think will happen?	Kaj mislite, da se bo zgodilo?
This is a serious issue for me.	To je zame resno vprašanje.
He looked too tired to speak.	Videti je bil preveč utrujen, da bi govoril.
I wish I was more here	Želim si, da bi bil več tukaj
A while ago.	Pred nekaj časa.
That may be so.	To je lahko tako.
Everything is going well.	Vse gre prav.
I went there once.	Enkrat sem šel tja.
I hope that doesn’t happen	Upam, da se to ne bo zgodilo
It was obvious to me that he was not there.	Očitno mi je bilo, da ga ni.
I have seen a few of them now.	Zdaj sem jih videl nekaj.
They certainly were.	Zagotovo so bili.
I heard little, saw nothing	Malo sem slišal, nič videl
I didn’t know this was going to be a problem	Nisem vedel, da bo to problem
I know you have to go.	Vem, da moraš iti.
I'll do it right away.	Takoj bom naredil.
I waited quite a bit and saw what happened.	Precej sem čakal in videl, kaj se je zgodilo.
I've been doing this for a very long time	To počnem že zelo dolgo
What will happen?	Kaj se bo zgodilo?
I just want to know where you've been so far	Želim samo vedeti, kje si bil do zdaj
Probably not.	Verjetno pa ne.
I learned.	naučil sem se.
I actually mean that seriously	To pravzaprav mislim resno
I need to see things	Moram videti stvari
He is good.	On je dober.
I wonder how he was able to get it right	Sprašujem se, kako je lahko dobil prav
I have nothing more to say.	Nimam več kaj povedati.
I said he wouldn't come home	Rekel sem, da ne bo prišel domov
I need help with that	Potrebujem pomoč pri tem
I didn't ask him to come	Nisem ga prosil, naj pride
I doubt that is the case.	Dvomim, da je temu tako.
Apparently not from what he saw.	Glede na to, kar je videl, očitno ne.
I didn't help her at all	Sploh ji nisem bil v pomoč
It was difficult for him.	Težko mu je bilo.
I'm not right.	Nimam prav.
I still haven't.	Še vedno nisem.
I have to go home next week	Naslednji teden moram domov
I saw it all	Vse sem videl
I want to do things	Želim narediti stvari
I do not know where it is.	Ne vem kje je.
Which any of us had.	Kar je kdo od nas imel.
That's fine too.	Tudi to je v redu.
Probably not.	Verjetno pa ne.
I told him he probably wouldn't like it	Rekel sem mu, da mu verjetno ne bo všeč
The problem remained.	Problem je ostal.
And we had.	In smo imeli.
No one saw him again.	Nihče ga ni več videl.
I just thought it would be nice	Samo mislil sem, da bi bilo lepo
If they ever did.	Če so to kdaj storili.
I know what you did	Vem, kaj si naredil
You can't believe it.	Ne moreš verjeti.
I was more than ready to do it	Bil sem več kot pripravljen, da to stori
Because they are not.	Ker niso.
I had to see here	Moral sem videti tukaj
He doesn't know what he's doing.	Ne ve, kaj počne.
It took me a while to get to know her myself.	Potreboval sem nekaj časa, da sem jo tudi sam spoznal.
I knew you were there	Vedel sem, da si tam
Not for that.	Ne za to.
I want to do what is right	Želim narediti, kar je prav
So what about me.	Pa kaj jaz.
I still want to see what happens.	Še vedno želim videti, kaj se bo zgodilo.
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
And now so do we.	Zdaj pa tudi mi.
I worked with him for years	Z njim sem delal leta
We will do it ourselves.	To bomo naredili sami.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
I'll be fine now.	Zdaj bom v redu.
I know you were there	Vem, da si bil tam
Seriously, you're going to die.	Resno, umrl boš.
I thought he was angry	Mislil sem, da je jezen
If that was even possible.	Če bi bilo to sploh mogoče.
He can only do so much.	Lahko naredi le toliko.
You should go home.	Moral bi iti domov.
I will go there too.	Tudi jaz bom šel tja.
Probably a boy too.	Verjetno tudi fant.
I'm glad you're here.	Vesel sem, da si tukaj.
Not there either.	Tudi tam ne.
It was very difficult for everyone.	Vsem je bilo zelo težko.
It really happened to me	Res se mi je to zgodilo
I'm not home, it's not home.	Nisem doma, to ni doma.
There's nothing I can do about it now	Zdaj ne morem storiti ničesar glede tega
I would love to see them	rad bi jih videl
It's just that we think so.	Samo da se nam zdi.
She did that today.	To je storila danes.
I just want to stay here for a while	Samo nekaj časa želim ostati tukaj
I asked her how she intended to do it	Vprašal sem jo, kako namerava to narediti
I can't know for sure.	Ne morem vedeti zagotovo.
We can't do without it.	Brez tega ne moremo.
All that stuff.	Vse te stvari.
I'm glad you have	Vesel sem, da imaš
Without knowing.	Ne da bi vedel.
That could be it.	To bi lahko bilo to.
I wish I could see that	Želim si, da bi to videl
I know what it is.	Vem kaj je.
I knew they wouldn't	Vedel sem, da ne bodo
I didn’t know it was hard for him.	Nisem vedel, da mu je to težko.
you said.	si rekel.
Definitely more today.	Danes zagotovo več.
I hope so.	Upam, da je tako.
We shouldn't be here.	Ne bi smeli biti tukaj.
I'm not sure why that is	Nisem prepričan, zakaj je temu tako
One can never tell.	Človek ne more nikoli povedati.
I had to tell him that	To sem mu moral povedati
But that alone is not enough.	A samo to ni dovolj.
I will feel much better then.	Takrat se bom počutil veliko bolje.
I already said that.	To sem že rekel.
It didn't look possible at all.	Sploh ni bilo videti mogoče.
Mine wasn't the only one.	Moj ni bil edini.
I've never made it	Še nikoli mi ni uspelo
The question is what to do about it.	Vprašanje je, kaj storiti glede tega.
He knows when the time is right.	Ve, kdaj je pravi čas.
I actually liked it.	Pravzaprav mi je bilo všeč.
That's all I had to say	Samo to sem moral povedati
I'll call ahead.	Poklical bom naprej.
I just got back from there	Pravkar sem prišel od tam
I was just working time	Samo delal sem čas
Obviously I can't be friends with him	Očitno ne morem biti prijatelj z njim
I think you all know about it	Mislim, da vsi veste o tem
I still love her very much	Še vedno jo imam zelo rad
I get it wrong.	Narobe razumem.
I'll ask him what he thinks about it.	Vprašal ga bom, kaj si misli o tem.
It was very difficult to see him like that.	Videti ga takega je bilo zelo težko.
It's so good.	Tako dobro je.
Say it the way it is.	Povej tako kot je.
If it's there.	Če je tam.
I made up my mind yesterday	Včeraj sem se odločil
I don't understand that myself.	Sam tega ne razumem.
I wouldn’t know what happened	Ne bi vedel, kaj se je zgodilo
I thought you wanted that	Mislil sem, da si to želel
He will start after me.	Začel bo za mano.
I will die.	umrl bom.
I just arrived.	pravkar sem prišel.
And not only that.	In ne samo to.
I'm doing very well.	mi gre zelo dobro.
It wasn't like that.	Ni bilo tako.
I mean, you think that's okay with that	Mislim, zdi se ti v redu s tem
I tried, but there was no time	Poskušal sem, a ni bilo časa
I can definitely see it now.	Zdaj zagotovo vidim.
He is much better now.	Zdaj mu je veliko bolje.
Now they both knew why.	Zdaj sta oba vedela, zakaj je tako.
It was like she was saying don't go.	Bilo je, kot da bi rekla, naj ne gre.
Nobody knew that for a long time.	Tega pa dolgo nihče ni vedel.
I didn't want anyone to know	Nisem hotel, da bi kdo vedel
He was good with that.	S tem je bil dober.
I didn't do it right	Nisem naredil prav
For my work.	Za moje delo.
You should be there.	Moral bi biti tam.
He started right away.	Takoj je začel.
Again again.	Spet spet spet.
I haven't seen him in a while	Že nekaj časa ga nisem videl
I wasn’t ready for that	Nisem bil pripravljen na to
I was glad to see him too	Tudi jaz sem bil vesel, da sem ga videl
I want to stay with you	Želim ostati s tabo
They are not that good.	Niso tako dobro.
I still didn’t know who called them	Še vedno nisem vedel, kdo jih je poklical
I told you what was going to happen	Povedal sem ti, kaj se bo zgodilo
I think he did something more today	Mislim, da je danes naredil nekaj več
All this has already happened.	Vse to se je že zgodilo.
Yes, he knew.	Da, vedel je.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
Everything was fine.	Vse je bilo dobro.
No one seemed to be home.	Videti je bilo, da ni nikogar doma.
I didn't ask if it was you	Nisem vprašal, če si to ti
I knew what he was thinking.	Vedel sem, kaj si misli.
He knew so much.	Toliko je vedel.
he asked himself.	se je vprašal.
You have to tell me how you know.	Moraš mi povedati, kako veš.
I did as he did	Naredil sem tako, kot je storil on
Even tonight, if you want.	Tudi nocoj, če želiš.
I've never felt this way before.	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil.
I had to do something about it	Moral sem nekaj storiti glede tega
I'm not completely surprised.	Nisem popolnoma presenečen.
It was a good time.	Bil je dober čas.
I will decide what will happen.	Odločil se bom, kaj se bo zgodilo.
You have children.	Imaš otroke.
This is hard.	To je težko.
And so it goes.	In tako gre.
Or something else.	Ali kaj drugega.
I did that last week	To sem storil prejšnji teden
I have to see him too	Tudi jaz ga moram videti
I think you'll like it here	Mislim, da ti bo tukaj všeč
That's as good as it gets	To je tako dobro, kot je
I was left there alone, which was fine	Tam sem ostal sam, kar je bilo v redu
As if we were never there.	Kot da nikoli ne bi bili tam.
If I were home.	Če bi bila doma.
I am absolutely convinced of that	V to sem popolnoma prepričan
It looked like something he had done before.	Videti je bilo kot nekaj, kar je storil že prej.
That's none of my business.	To ni moja stvar.
I haven't heard that yet.	Tega še nisem slišal.
If I only knew.	Če bi vedel.
He can never get out.	Nikoli ne more ven.
And no one should know that better than you.	In tega nihče ne bi smel vedeti bolje kot ti.
i wouldn't do that	jaz tega ne bi storil
I probably didn't hear you	Verjetno te nisem slišal
He doesn't know.	On ne ve.
And it should be.	In moral bi biti.
We have a lot of work ahead of us.	Pred nami je veliko dela.
I don't want to leave.	Nočem oditi.
It's hard to believe.	Težko je verjeti.
I don't understand what he's saying	Ne razumem, kaj pravi
He had so much.	Imel je toliko.
Not once did they have them.	Niti enkrat, ko so jih imeli.
I don't feel good about it.	Ne počutim se dobro glede tega.
I shouldn't have come to school	Ne bi smel priti v šolo
This is not serious.	To ni resno.
Things will be there.	Stvari bodo tam.
He wanted life.	Želel je življenje.
That's what she said.	Tako je rekla.
And maybe he's right.	In morda je prav.
Until then, everything is fine.	Do takrat pa je vse v redu.
I never met them.	nikoli jih nisem srečal.
I didn't want to see you	Nisem te hotel videti
What are they.	Kaj so.
I had a job.	Imel sem službo.
They weren't here tonight.	Nocoj jih ni bilo tukaj.
I knew it would be fine	Vedel sem, da bo v redu
That she was fine.	Da je bila v redu.
We know that for sure now	Zdaj to zagotovo vemo
You shouldn't just go there.	Samo oditi tja ne bi.
And when it goes, it goes well.	In ko gre, gre dobro.
I may not have heard of it yet.	Morda še nisem slišal za to.
Years.	Leta.
He saw how he did it.	Videl je, kako to počne.
I just wanted to see how you were.	Želel sem samo videti, kako si.
Just like it was for me.	Tako kot je bilo zame.
Maybe we should move on.	Mogoče bi morali iti naprej.
I was lucky to have it	Imel sem srečo, da sem ga imel
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
We were better off than we were.	Nam je bilo bolje, kot smo bili.
I had to see things	Moral sem videti stvari
I'm interested in him.	On me zanima.
I wasn’t sure what that was	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj je to
Everything seems fine to me.	Vse se mi zdi v redu.
I just wanted to be angry	Hotel sem biti samo jezen
I was so tired of it	Bil sem tako utrujen od tega
It never happened.	Nikoli se ni zgodilo.
Sometimes you have to tell me more than once.	Včasih mi moraš povedati več kot enkrat.
What is s.	Kaj je s.
I know what they are.	Vem, kaj so.
And we haven't seen him before.	In pred tem ga še nismo videli.
It's day.	To je dan.
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni več.
Maybe even more.	Mogoče še bolj.
I thought that was good	Mislil sem, da je to dobro
I think that was right	Mislim, da je bilo to prav
He has to move on right away.	Takoj naprej mora iti.
It's not just about that.	Ne gre samo za to.
And he knew.	In vedel je.
I didn't know where you were	Nisem vedel kje si
Maybe you can.	Mogoče lahko.
I can't do this with you anymore	Ne morem več tega s tabo
I won't wait for you	Ne bom te čakal
Now I found it difficult.	Zdaj se mi je zdelo težko.

I'm glad he's coming with me	Vesel sem, da gre z mano

I'm afraid you won't like me anymore	Bojim se, da ti ne bom več všeč
I went once	Enkrat sem šel

I just need my money back	Samo denar potrebujem nazaj

She wasn't even in the room.	Sploh je ni bilo v sobi.

There has been nothing there for a long time.	Tam že dolgo ni ničesar.
It failed again	Še enkrat ni uspelo
I will promise you.	Obljubil ti bom.
I know what you did	Vem, kaj si naredil
It will be even better for you.	Za vas bo še bolje.
She must have said something.	Verjetno je kaj rekla.
As a kid.	Kot otrok.
I haven't forgotten anything	Nič nisem pozabil
That’s when I knew what it was all about	Takrat sem vedel, za kaj je vse to
I wasn’t sure it was true	Nisem bil prepričan, da je res
I'm afraid you're right	Bojim se, da imaš prav
I just want my life back	Samo svoje življenje želim nazaj
I failed.	Ni mi uspelo.
Not even very long.	Niti ne prav dolgo.
I just wasn’t good enough	Preprosto nisem bil dovolj dober
I understand.	Razumem.
I shouldn't be there at all	Sploh ne bi smel biti tam
And still.	In še vedno.
I'm not going to do that tonight	Nocoj tega ne bom storil
I was with him when he got them	Bil sem z njim, ko jih je dobil
No one could have done more than you.	Nihče ne bi mogel narediti več kot ti.
We should stay.	Morali bi ostati.
You could say he feels better	Lahko bi rekel, da se počuti bolje
I'm lucky.	jaz imam srečo.
I don't think so yet	Mislim, da morda še ni
And she didn't want anything else.	In drugega si ni želela.
Which is not easy.	Kar ni lahko.
I didn't make it.	To mi ni uspelo.
I didn't think so	Nisem mislil tako
I can't tell you how	Ne morem ti povedati, kako
The question now is, will it?	Vprašanje je zdaj, ali bo?
He told me not to go.	Rekel mi je, naj ne grem.
I will never do that again.	Nikoli več tega ne bom storil.
There is actually very little time.	Časa je pravzaprav zelo malo.
Which they still aren't.	Kar še vedno niso.
And it was so good.	In bilo je tako dobro.
I will only do so much	Naredil bom samo toliko
This morning would be the right time.	Danes zjutraj bi bil pravi čas.
He will come.	Prišel bo.
I asked him to come right away.	Prosil sem ga, naj pride takoj.
There's nothing I can do right	Nič ne morem narediti prav
That was fine with me.	To mi je bilo v redu.
He needed time alone.	Potreboval je čas sam.
So he found something every day.	Tako je vsak dan nekaj našel.
We need to do something about it.	Nekaj ​​moramo storiti glede tega.
There must be more people.	Mora biti več ljudi.
That can't be right.	To ne more biti prav.
I heard about you, you know	Slišal sem zate, veš
I can't be sure of that	Ne morem biti prepričan v to
All that.	Vse to.
I don't have time for that	Nimam časa za to
I wish I could just leave that.	Želel bi, da bi to kar pustil.
It's not about us.	Ne gre za nas.
I haven't seen him in years.	Že leta ga nisem videl.
No one has ever seen him.	Nihče ga ni nikoli videl.
I think he knows now	Mislim, da zdaj ve
I could tell him why	Lahko sem mu povedal zakaj
And that's hard.	In to je težko.
You can't go on.	Ne moreš naprej.
I just didn't see it.	Samo nisem videl.
I hope she won't be sorry	Upam, da ji ne bo žal
he thought.	mislil je.
I can't talk either	Tudi jaz ne morem govoriti
that doesn't interest me	to me ne zanima
Not even a human.	Niti človek.
That may be true.	To je morda res.
I think we will	Mislim, da bomo
I decided that now was not the time	Odločil sem se, da zdaj ni pravi čas
This is a serious issue.	To je resno vprašanje.
He couldn't see me more than me.	Ne bi me mogel več videti kot mene.
I'm not afraid anymore	ne bojim se več
I did it without telling anyone	To sem storil, ne da bi nikomur povedal
I wanted you to know everything	Hotel sem, da veš vse
I have to be alone for a while	Nekaj ​​časa moram biti sam
I wanted to know what and why and how	Želel sem vedeti, kaj in zakaj in kako
It seems very.	Zdi se zelo.
I'm anything but good	Sem vse prej kot dobro
I shouldn't be coming to work today	Danes ne bi smel priti v službo
I've never seen them before	Še nikoli jih nisem videl
I can't even speak.	Ne morem niti govoriti.
It used to be that way.	Prej je bilo tako.
I want to think they will.	Rad bi mislil, da bodo.
Or they were.	Ali pa so bili.
Not from me.	Ne od mene.
I could tell he was up to something	Lahko bi rekel, da nekaj namerava
Maybe.	Mogoče se.
You should know better than that.	Moral bi vedeti bolje kot to.
He didn’t want to leave and that was it.	Ni hotel oditi in to je bilo to.
It was mine now.	Zdaj je bil moj.
I knew they were here	Vedel sem, da so bili tukaj
That's the only way to play.	Samo tako se igra.
That's all I came to say.	Samo to sem prišel povedati.
I would leave	odšel bi
I don't want to believe anything.	nič nočem verjeti.
I've never seen her before.	Še nikoli je nisem videl.
I should tell you	Moral bi ti povedati
I'll never do that again, you know that	Tega ne bom nikoli več storil, to veš
That's why you're here.	Zato si tukaj.
I mean, everyone liked you	Mislim, vsem si bil všeč
I needed him to keep feeling that way	Potreboval sem ga, da se še naprej tako počutim
It's too much.	Preveč je.
You will love it.	Všeč ti bo.
I didn't think it would.	Nisem si mislil, da bo.
Not sure how to proceed.	Nisem prepričan, kako naprej.
He didn't need to speak.	Ni mu bilo treba govoriti.
Glad to see you all here.	Vesel sem, da vas vse vidim tukaj.
You couldn't tell what he was.	Nisi mogel povedati, kaj je bil.
I had nowhere to go	Nisem imel kam
This is my job.	To je moje delo.
i have children	imam otroke.
But I knew what it was	Vedel sem pa, kaj je to
I wish everything would be fine again	Želim si, da bi bilo spet vse v redu
It's all because of what dad did.	Vse je zaradi tega, kar je naredil oče.
I will never forget what he told me	Nikoli ne bom pozabil, kaj mi je rekel
We had our own house, a car.	Imeli smo svojo hišo, avto.
But she was here.	Vendar je bila tukaj.
Here you are.	Tukaj si.
We'll have to come again.	Bomo morali še priti.
I just didn’t know what it was	Samo nisem vedel, kaj je to
Me, a good friend.	Jaz, dober prijatelj.
I didn't expect that	Tega nisem pričakoval
I know you very well	zelo dobro te poznam
I needed it.	Sem potreboval.
You should just tell him	Moral bi mu samo povedati
I can see that well	To lahko dobro vidim
No one had, for that matter.	Nihče ni imel, glede tega.
Then you have to be ready.	Takrat moraš biti pripravljen.
I learned that here	To sem se naučil tukaj
I met him when.	Spoznal sem ga, ko.
We know we need to be better and be better.	Vemo, da moramo biti boljši in biti boljši.
Nothing is just what it is.	Nič ni samo to, kar je.
I don't see another.	ne vidim drugega.
I came back and told her so	Vrnil sem se in ji tako rekel
I hope this works out	Upam, da bo to uspelo
Oh boy, oh boy.	O fant, o fant.
It's hard.	Težko gre.
I hope you are doing well	Upam, da ti gre dobro
I just can't do this anymore	Samo tega ne morem več
I want to know that he will be fine	Želim vedeti, da bo z njim v redu
Never, never again.	Nikoli, nikoli več.
That is the reason you are here today.	To je razlog, da ste danes tukaj.

I would never have done it without you	Brez tebe tega ne bi nikoli naredil
I called them right away.	Takoj sem jih poklical.
You have enough without me.	Brez mene imaš dovolj.
It was mine too.	Bil je tudi moj.
I know you're not for it.	Vem, da nisi za to.
But it wasn't like that.	Vendar ni bilo tako.
I know it has to be hard	Vem, da mora biti težko
I knew something was going on here.	Vedel sem, da se tukaj nekaj dogaja.
He couldn't do anything well.	Ničesar ni mogel narediti dobro.
I didn’t think they would do that.	Nisem si mislil, da bodo to storili.
That's the only reason.	To je edini razlog.
He feels better.	Počuti se bolje.
I would never do that.	Tega ne bi nikoli naredil.
I was more than angry	Bil sem več kot jezen
Maybe if we did.	Mogoče če bi mi.
They did it today.	Danes so to storili.
I wasn't a good friend of yours	Nisem ti bil dober prijatelj
I've been waiting a long time for this.	Dolgo sem čakal na to.
And maybe that's a good thing.	In morda je to dobro.
Sam didn't feel too well about it.	Sam se ob tem ni počutil preveč dobro.
I was sure he was no more	Prepričan sem bil, da ni več
I don't know.	sam ne vem.
That wasn't too good either.	Tudi to ni bilo preveč dobro.
This cannot be done for now.	Za zdaj tega ni mogoče storiti.
But not him.	Vendar ne on.

I have been feeling this way for a few days now	Tako se počutim že nekaj dni
I wasn't sure.	nisem bil prepričan.
I haven't been there that long	Tako dolgo nisem bil tam
I think she said she wasn't and didn't know him	Mislim, da je rekla, da ni in da ga ne pozna
We both knew better.	Oba sva vedela bolje.
There are too many to say.	Preveč jih je za povedati.
They had no children	Niso imeli otrok
She said yes.	Rekla je da.
I thought that was it.	Mislil sem, da je to to.
He also died.	Tudi on je umrl.
But I didn't want to be there to see him	Nisem pa hotel biti tam, da bi ga videl
I couldn't do that alone.	Sam tega ne bi mogel narediti.
Soon again.	Kmalu spet.
And he did just that.	In naredil je prav to.
I wouldn't bring them back	Ne bi jih vrnil
I'd rather have it if I didn't	Raje bi ga imel, če ne bi

I need you to be there for me	Potrebujem te, da si tam zame
That’s how I see myself going out like that	Tako vidim, da grem tako ven
I'm not really ready.	Nisem res pripravljen.
That’s when I knew it was a possibility	Takrat sem vedel, da je to možnost

A lot of people tell me that	Veliko ljudi mi to pravi

Eating together is always better.	Jesti skupaj je vedno bolje.
He thought it was very good.	Mislil je, da je zelo dobro.
You did what you could.	Naredili ste, kar ste lahko.
But there was much more to it than that.	Vendar je bilo veliko več kot to.
I thought things were fine	Mislil sem, da so stvari v redu
I didn't expect that.	Tega nisem pričakoval.
He didn't tell us anything else.	Nič drugega nam ni povedal.
I know I will meet you again.	Vem, da te bom spet srečal.
He had never heard it before.	Nikoli prej ga ni slišal.

Because you told me all this.	Ker si mi vse to povedal.
I think she was from there	Mislim, da je bila od tam
I called everyone and said he was gone	Vse sem poklical in povedal, da je odšel

No one knew how he got there.	Nihče ni vedel, kako je prišel tja.
I was surprised to see a lot of people there	Bil sem presenečen, ko sem tam videl veliko ljudi

I have nowhere to go, as you all know	Nimam kam, kot vsi veste

That was really the case.	To je bilo res tako.
I didn't see him come	Nisem videl, da bi prišel
I don’t know anymore what could be wrong.	Ne vem več, kaj bi lahko bilo narobe.
However, this did not happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
I can't believe you meant that	Ne morem verjeti, da si to mislil
Here is.	Tukaj je.
Or him and me.	Ali on in jaz.
I was not ready	nisem bil pripravljen
I couldn't tell him that	Tega mu nisem mogel povedati
I don't believe that either.	Tudi jaz tega ne verjamem.
It's just about that.	Samo gre za to.
Sam was fine.	Sam je bil dobro.
I think it's too much.	Mislim, da je preveč.
Nima.	Nima.
I have it now.	Zdaj ga imam.
I still haven't seen him	Še vedno ga nisem videl
I won't, she told herself.	Ne bom, si je rekla.
I want to know where he is now	Rad bi vedel, kje je zdaj

And still.	In še vedno.
I can't be the only one who knows	Ne morem biti edini, ki ve
I'd rather have	Raje sem si želel, da bi

I would like to say something, but nothing comes	Nekaj ​​bi rad povedal, pa nič ne pride

I still think he likes it	Še vedno mislim, da mu je všeč
This person is ourselves.	Ta oseba smo mi sami.
They are in me.	V meni so.
I could do that, you know.	Lahko bi to storil, veš.
I should probably go home	Verjetno bi moral iti domov
He is right about that.	Glede tega ima prav.
I'm really sorry it has to be this way.	Res mi je žal, da mora biti tako.
I never saw the things he did	Nikoli nisem videl stvari, ki jih je počel
All this time.	Ves ta čas.
Why? 	Zakaj?
I doubt my father ever knew	Dvomim, da je moj oče kdaj vedel
I didn't give him time.	Nisem mu dal časa.
Her father gave them to her.	Dal ji jih je oče.
I just thought I should know	Samo mislil sem, da bi moral vedeti
Or it should be.	Ali pa bi moral biti.
They will continue to be.	Še naprej bodo.
Now I see what’s a little more.	Zdaj vidim to, kar je malo bolj.
It doesn't feel good.	Ne počuti se dobro.
It simply has to do.	To preprosto mora storiti.
There will be nothing better here.	Tukaj ne bo nič bolje.
He doesn't want it.	Noče je.
I played alone and did all the things myself	Igral sem sam in vse stvari delal sam
I was so lucky	Imel sem tako veliko srečo
No, that can't be right.	Ne, to ne more biti prav.
He came and did well.	Prišel je in delal dobro.
And it worked.	In uspelo je.
And you are the one for me.	In ti si pravi zame.
I already asked you.	Sem te že vprašal.
I always wanted to do more	Vedno sem želel narediti več
I know very little.	zelo malo vem.
He's so good.	Tako dober je.
But it can be much different or more than that.	Lahko pa je veliko drugega ali več kot to.
He's not sorry.	Ni mu žal.
You should too.	Prav tako bi morali.
I know you still have a problem with me	Vem, da imaš še vedno težave z mano
That's all he needs.	To je vse, kar potrebuje.
I wanted to know what he was doing	Hotel sem vedeti, kaj počne
How will you look.	Kako boš videti.
I didn’t need him to be my father	Nisem ga potreboval, da bi bil moj oče
Yes, something is wrong with you.	Da, nekaj je narobe s tabo.
They simply did their thing.	Preprosto so naredili svoje.
I hope it never will	Upam, da nikoli ne bo
Or he saw.	Ali pa je videl.
Maybe that was true.	Mogoče je bilo to res.
I can't believe you are	Ne morem verjeti, da si
I never played it.	Nikoli ga nisem igral.
It's a little like that.	Malo tako je.
He didn't see much.	Ni videl veliko.
Yes it was.	Da je bilo.
But I didn't tell her that	Vendar ji tega nisem povedal
Which is really fine.	Kar je res v redu.
I’m not sure if that’s possible.	Nisem prepričan, če je to mogoče.
If I wanted to, I would say so.	Če bi si tega želel, bi to rekel.
You never were.	Nikoli nisi bil.
I know she'll be better	Vem, da ji bo bolje
I don't see anymore.	ne vidim več.
It never will.	Nikoli ne bo.
This is who and what we are.	To je kdo in kaj smo.
I probably should go	Verjetno bi moral iti
Can also.	Lahko tudi.
I've never told anyone this before	Nikoli prej tega nisem povedal nikomur
He would do it.	On bi to naredil.
I just want to see him play.	Samo rad bi ga videl igrati.
I still know.	še vedno vem.
None of this was true.	Nič od tega ni bilo res.
That was my father.	To je bil moj oče.
I did a good job with that	S tem sem opravil dobro delo
Is it working ?.	Je kaj dela?.
That's so beautiful.	To je tako lepo.
And it was there.	In bilo je tam.
No, no, not yet.	Ne, ne, še.
I taught him a lot of things	Naučil sem ga veliko stvari
I thought it would be time	Mislil sem, da bo čas
I think you will like them	Mislim, da vam bodo všeč
I didn't give that either	Tudi tega nisem dal
I am no one to talk about it	Nisem nihče, ki bi govoril o tem
I would do anything to get her back.	Naredil bi vse, da bi jo dobil nazaj.
I just wanted you to know, we're here for you	Hotel sem samo, da veš, tukaj smo zate
He said he didn't know.	Rekel je, da ne ve.
I need to talk to you	Moram govoriti s tabo
I wish we could do something	Želim si, da bi lahko kaj naredili
I was right about everything	V vsem sem imel prav
Much more if I could help him.	Veliko več, če bi mu dal v pomoč.
In fact, quite a lot.	Pravzaprav precej.
I said okay because I thought he needed some time alone	Rekel sem v redu, saj sem mislil, da potrebuje nekaj časa sam
Because.	Zaradi.
It's out of place.	Ni na mestu.
I knew he was going forever	Vedel sem, da mu gre za vedno
Would definitely stay there again.	Zagotovo bi spet ostal tam.
There can be no other.	Ne more biti drugega.
I told her you weren't ready	Povedal sem ji, da nisi pripravljen
I just thought I should know, that’s all	Samo mislil sem, da bi moral vedeti, to je vse
I always wanted to be alone	Vedno sem si želel biti sam
I always wanted to be more with him	Vedno sem si želela biti bolj z njim
I was very happy to see him	Zelo sem bil vesel, da sem ga videl
It's pretty simple.	To je precej preprosto.
Talk about us.	Govori o nas.
It is very.	Je zelo.
I just want to know	Samo rad bi vedel
And you have to be	In to moraš biti
He needed help.	Potreboval je pomoč.
I wouldn't want her either	Tudi jaz ji ne bi želel
It took me so long to be okay with that.	Tako dolgo sem potreboval, da sem bil v redu s tem.
He wasn't sure why, but he was.	Ni bil prepričan zakaj, a je.
We know better now.	Zdaj vemo bolje.
so I don't care.	tako me ne zanima.
I really haven't seen her today	Danes je res še nisem videl
I hope to see more	Upam, da bomo videli več
But no one seems to be talking about it.	A zdi se, da nihče ne govori o tem.
He's still a friend.	Še vedno je prijatelj.
So many things have happened.	Toliko stvari se je zgodilo.
I don't like them.	ne maram jih.
You should have come earlier	Moral bi priti prej
You have to go.	Moraš iti.
I haven't been there yet.	Nisem še bil tam.
we are now.	zdaj smo.
We just have it.	Samo ga imamo.
I wanted to do him wrong and I was right	Želel sem narediti njega narobe in jaz prav
I left and went home	Odšel sem in odšel domov
Sometimes he did what he had to.	Včasih je naredil, kar je moral.
I think he's there.	Mislim, da je tam.
It has to be more than that.	Mora biti več kot to.
He worked for me for three years.	Pri meni je delal tri leta.
You are no longer a child, he says.	Nisi več otrok, pravi.
He couldn't believe what he heard.	Ni mogel verjeti, kaj je slišal.
I will be everything you want me to be	Bom vse, kar si želiš, da bi bil
We really liked it.	Res nam je bilo všeč.
I have you in my room	Imam te v svoji sobi
It wasn't like that.	Ni bilo tako.
I know you really love him	Vem, da ga imaš res rad
It's never good.	Nikoli ni dobro.
I never wanted that.	Tega si nisem nikoli želel.
They probably were, but they didn't know it.	Verjetno so bili, a tega niso vedeli.
I did not know.	nisem vedel.
I can’t believe this is really happening to me	Ne morem verjeti, da se mi to res dogaja
And it was.	In bilo je.
That little bit more.	Tisto malo več.
I am very happy about that	Tega sem zelo vesel
I haven’t seen her in years and years.	Nisem je videl leta in leta.
I hope to come soon	Upam, da pride kmalu

I just want to be with you	Samo želim biti s tabo
Not from here.	Ne od tukaj.
I never had to say that	Nikoli mi tega ni bilo treba povedati
It's too much.	Preveč je.
I loved it when it was.	Všeč mi je bilo, ko je.
I was waiting for him	Čakal sem ga
I don't think we did anything wrong.	Mislim, da nismo naredili nič narobe.
Whether they did it or not.	Ali so to storili ali ne.
And you are not.	In ti nisi.
If not, that's your problem.	Če ne, je to tvoj problem.
It will be fine.	V redu bo.
It should be.	Morala bi biti.
I just wasn’t sure if it was true or not	Samo nisem bil prepričan, ali je res ali ne
I haven’t felt so good in a long time	Že dolgo se nisem počutil tako dobro
I hadn’t seen him, but it was obvious he had	Nisem ga videl, vendar je bilo očitno, da ga je
Or there are very few of them.	Ali pa jih je zelo malo.
I'm not so sure why anymore	Nisem več tako prepričan, zakaj
I had it and I didn’t want to see it	Sem ga in ga nisem hotel videti
But it is only a matter of time.	Je pa samo vprašanje časa.
Together.	Skupaj .
Not just me, you too.	Ne samo jaz, tudi ti.
I'm just not ready for that yet	Samo na to še nisem pripravljen
But nothing happened.	A zgodilo se ni nič.
I've been doing this for a long time	To sem počel že dolgo
Now he heard.	Zdaj je slišal.
I met him more than once.	Ne le enkrat sem ga srečal.
He had to help me.	Moral mi je pomagati.
I understand we shouldn't stay	Razumem, da ne bi smeli ostati

I'll be fine.	Jaz bom v redu.
More.	Več.
I think you may have helped me	Mislim, da si mi morda pomagal
This is a very serious issue.	Gre za zelo resno vprašanje.
You will see me when you see me.	Videli me boste, ko me boste videli.
I wouldn’t want anyone else	Ne bi želel nikogar drugega
I like that even more	To mi je še bolj všeč
I hadn't heard him before	Prej ga nisem slišal
I know about these things	Vem za te stvari
I just want to be alone	Samo želim ostati sam

I made it almost for fun	Naredil sem ga skoraj za zabavo
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
I know that would not be enough	Vem, da to ne bi bilo dovolj
Maybe I’m not ready, but he was	Mogoče nisem pripravljen, on pa je bil
She's fine with me.	Z mano je v redu.
He may or may not do this	To lahko stori ali pa tudi ne
I thought I'd go after you	Mislil sem iti za tabo
This is not possible.	To ni mogoče.
Right behind him.	Takoj za njim.

I didn’t know what it was	Nisem vedel, kaj je to
I never thought this would happen	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da se bo to zgodilo

I just didn’t want to talk about it	Preprosto nisem hotel govoriti o tem
I've been doing this my whole life	To sem počel vse življenje

I probably am.	Verjetno sem.
That's really good.	To je res dobro.
It can still be.	Še vedno je lahko.

I'm not sure, really	Nisem prepričan, res
I have to do this once	To moram enkrat narediti
That would be obvious.	To bi bilo očitno.
I asked him for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa sem ga vprašal.
I know you want me for everything	Vem, da me želiš vsega
That will probably do the trick.	To bo verjetno uspelo.
I just wasn’t good at it at the time.	Takrat preprosto nisem bil dober v tem.
No, no, really.	Ne, ne, res.
And better.	In bolje.

I could never have told you before	Nikoli ti ne bi mogel povedati prej

You should buy them all	Moral bi jih vse kupiti
I was as good as I left	Bil sem tako dober kot odšel
I hope this happens soon.	Upam, da se bo to zgodilo hitro.

I wished I could go often	Želel sem, da bi lahko šel pogosto

I immediately felt at home	Takoj sem se počutil kot doma
And maybe not.	In morda ne.

That was it.	Bilo je to.

And that was it for me.	In zame je bilo to to.
I know it's there.	Vem, da je tam.

It was so hard to believe what he said.	Tako težko je bilo verjeti, kar je rekel.
I will find a way.	bom našel način.
I think that was absolutely true	Mislim, da je bilo to popolnoma res
The next day I couldn’t even speak.	Naslednji dan nisem mogel niti govoriti.
I didn’t ask where he learned them	Nisem vprašal, kje se jih je naučil
Good for me.	Dobro zame.
I'm like him.	jaz sem kot on.
Who knows why.	Kdo ve zakaj.
If you want to work for me, do it here.	Če me želiš delati, naredi to tukaj.

He told me last night.	Sinoči mi je povedal.
I forgot he left yesterday	Pozabil sem, da je odšel včeraj

This is life.	To je življenje.
They never were.	Nikoli jih ni bilo.
It would be nice.	Bilo bi lepo.
I hope you had a nice time here	Upam, da ste se imeli lepo tukaj
I saw what was going on	Videl sem, kaj se dogaja
I would love to see him play again.	Rad bi ga videl spet igrati.
Instead, she went ahead.	Namesto tega je šla naprej.
I already told you about that	O tem sem ti že povedal
He still felt like him.	Še vedno se je počutil kot on.
It can't be done.	Ni mogoče storiti.
I can't go there with you	Ne morem tja s tabo
And it's not true at all.	In sploh ni res.
Which is nice, obviously.	Kar je lepo, očitno.
Then.	Takrat.
I immediately felt at home. 	Takoj sem se počutil kot doma. 
And left him there.	In ga pustil tam.
I always did it first	Vedno sem naredil prvič
And it's both me.	In oba sem jaz.
He was obviously right.	Očitno je imel prav.
There were more.	Bili so več.
But I will be ready to play it	Bom pa to pripravljen igrati

I wanted to know why	Hotel sem vedeti zakaj

I bought.	Jaz sem kupil.
He did very well.	Zelo dobro mu je uspelo.
Now we know why.	Zdaj vemo zakaj.
And there he had me.	In tam me je imel.
That was better for you and better for me.	To je bilo bolje zate in bolje zame.
They really knew what to do	Res so vedeli, kaj storiti
I think you did the right thing.	Mislim, da si naredil prav.
I was fine with that	S tem sem bil v redu
My dad still does that, sometimes.	Moj oče to še vedno počne, včasih.
I've never done that before	Tega še nikoli nisem storil
I just knew it wouldn't	Samo vedela sem, da ne bo
I think that's the only way	Mislim, da je to edini način
And that's just me.	In to sem samo jaz.
He saw nothing more.	Nič več ni videl.
He knew well.	Dobro je vedel.
I used to be a kid.	Nekoč sem bil otrok.
So much the better.	Toliko bolje.
I can never go home now	Zdaj nikoli ne morem domov
I would love to know where he is	Zelo rad bi vedel, kje je

It's me again.	Spet sem jaz.
He could definitely stay with me.	Zagotovo bi lahko ostal pri meni.

He was sure he would see her.	Bil je prepričan, da jo bo videl.
I just need a chance	Potrebujem samo priložnost
No need to go into it.	Ni treba iti v to.
I doubt anyone knows.	Dvomim, da kdo ve.
I didn't want any of that.	Nič od tega nisem hotel.
Because you are what you are.	Ker si to, kar si.
It does a lot with very little.	To naredi veliko z zelo malo.
I told you it wasn't him.	Rekel sem ti, da ni bil on.
I never knew why	Nikoli nisem vedel zakaj
I am nothing and everything	Jaz sem nič in vse
Not so here.	Tukaj ni tako.
I won't, he told himself.	Ne bom, si je rekel.
And it wasn't like that.	In ni bilo tako.
yes yes yes.	da da da.
I know what he's saying	Vem, kaj pravi

There is nothing we can do at this time.	Trenutno ne moremo storiti ničesar.
I can still almost see from that	Še vedno lahko skoraj vidim iz tega

I won't have anything to do with you	Ne bom imel nič s tabo
He was there to do the job.	Bil je tam, da bi opravil to delo.
I had nothing left	Nisem imel kaj naprej
I saw them once in town.	Videl sem jih enkrat v mestu.
No, that's not enough.	Ne, to ni dovolj.
I think he wanted to tell me something	Mislim, da mi je hotel nekaj povedati
And they did.	In to so storili.
I'm pretty tired.	Precej sem utrujen.

There is no one in the room.	V sobi ni nikogar.
I will never know.	Nikoli ne bom vedel.
I wonder where that might be	Zanima me kje bi to lahko bilo
Everything seemed to be in place.	Zdelo se je, da je vse na mestu.
He's not home.	Ni ga doma.
Maria back with him.	Marija nazaj z njim.
He never liked it.	Nikoli mu ni bilo všeč.

Everyone in town.	Vsi v mestu.
I have something you have to do for me	Imam nekaj, kar moraš narediti zame

He doesn't sing you, you sing him.	Ne poje te, ti ga poje.
I could leave it at that.	Lahko bi pustil pri tem.
I wish you would stay with me	Želim si, da bi ostal z mano
He couldn't believe what had happened.	Ni si mogel verjeti, kaj se je zgodilo.

I had to do what was better for me	Moral sem narediti tisto, kar je bilo zame bolje
I think he wanted to tell us something	Mislim, da nam je hotel nekaj povedati
I had to believe her.	Moral sem ji verjeti.
I didn't see where	nisem videl kje
Not much is being done anymore.	Ne dela se več veliko.
I mean, what needed to be done had to be done.	Mislim, kar je bilo treba narediti, je bilo treba narediti.
But I succeeded.	Vendar mi je uspelo.
She never wanted him.	Nikoli si ga ni želela.
I want to be there to meet you	Rad bi bil tam, da bi te spoznal
We can't help ourselves.	Ne moremo si pomagati.
I would never even meet her	Nikoli je ne bi niti srečal

I couldn't find him to talk to	Nisem ga našel, da bi govoril z njim
And it was very, very difficult.	In bilo je zelo, zelo težko.
I knew nothing.	Nič nisem vedel.
You helped me so often.	Tako pogosto si mi pomagal.
And he's right.	In prav ima.
I don't want to see anything.	Nočem videti ničesar.
He returned that afternoon.	Tisto popoldne se je vrnil.
I think the question is.	Mislim, da je vprašanje.
Nobody has anything for me here.	Nihče nima ničesar zame tukaj.
There is no one here, he told her.	Tukaj ni nikogar, ji je rekel.
I can't do that right now	Tega trenutno ne morem storiti

I never asked for anything	Nikoli nisem ničesar prosil
No one knows how long.	Nihče ne ve, kako dolgo.
I didn't ask her tonight	Nocoj je nisem vprašal

And we are not alone.	In nismo sami.
Maybe he knew.	Mogoče je vedel.
You should have come earlier	Moral bi priti prej

He's too busy right now.	Trenutno je preveč zaposlen.
We knew.	Vedeli smo.
I see what you did there.	Vidim, kaj si naredil tam.
Fortunately, you don't have to stay in the city.	Na srečo vam ni treba ostati v mestu.
I wish that was not the case.	Želim si, da temu ni tako.
I shouldn't tell you	Ne bi ti smel povedati
Maybe it was my job, but it wasn’t.	Morda je bilo to moje delo, vendar ni bilo.
But they didn’t do anything like that.	Vendar niso naredili nič takega.

That's the way it has to be.	Tako mora biti.

That's my problem.	To je moj problem.
I didn't want to talk about it anymore	O tem nisem želel več govoriti

Or if he saw or heard nothing.	Ali če ni ničesar videl ali slišal.

He knows nothing else.	Ničesar drugega ne ve.
Maybe not likely.	Morda ni verjetno.
He was a child.	Bil je otrok.
I could hardly see	Skoraj nisem mogel videti
I could do so much.	Toliko bi lahko naredil.
I knew this one would get me.	Vedel sem, da me bo ta dobil.

The thing you would.	Stvar, ki bi jo.
I need to talk to you in the morning	Zjutraj moram govoriti s tabo

Not for any of us.	Ne za nikogar od nas.

I will not be surprised anymore, not like before	Ne bom več presenečen, ne kot prej
It's really just a kid.	Res je samo otrok.

She had to believe that.	To je morala verjeti.

I got it.	Dobil sem ga.
I didn't know enough	Nisem vedel dovolj
There is a lot wrong with that.	S tem je veliko narobe.

And how they did it.	In kako so to storili.
I knew it was going to be hard, really, really hard.	Vedel sem, da bo vse težko, res, zelo težko.

So many people.	Toliko ljudi.
I saw it all happen	Videl sem, da se je vse to zgodilo
There in front of him.	Tam pred njim.
I couldn't tell who he was	Nisem mogel povedati, kdo je
I never expected him to be here	Nikoli nisem pričakoval, da bo tukaj

That's all that's going on.	To je vse kar se dogaja.
What else is there ?.	Kaj je še tam?.
I should be the one to talk to you	Jaz bi moral biti tisti, ki bi govoril s tabo
I feel much better now.	Zdaj se počutim veliko bolje.

It wasn't that.	Ni bil da.
I will never ask again.	Nikoli več ne bom vprašal.

i will buy it.	ga bom kupil.
I'm not good at this.	Nisem dober v tem.

I haven't played it in a while	Že nekaj časa ga nisem igral

I could hear her now	Zdaj sem jo lahko slišal
We don't know where we are.	Ne vemo, kje smo.
I didn't mean anything	Nič nisem mislil
Not him either.	Tudi njega ne.
Nothing was out of place.	Nič ni bilo na mestu.
And yet it happened.	Pa vendar se je zgodilo.
I really wanted to help her	Zelo sem ji želel pomagati
I needed to know what he was up to	Moral sem vedeti, kaj namerava
It wasn’t easy, but he succeeded.	Ni bilo lahko, vendar mu je uspelo.
Let me know what you think.	Naj vem, kaj misliš.
I won't tell you where they are.	Ne bom vam povedal, kje so.
And that's when he thought.	In takrat je to mislil.
I have to do everything right	Vse moram narediti prav

It seemed to me everything one could hope for	Zdelo se mi je vse, na kar si lahko človek upa

Maybe you could.	Mogoče bi lahko.
I know you have something to say	Vem, da imaš kaj za povedati

I very much doubt it.	zelo dvomim.
I would like to tell him that.	To bi mu rad povedal.
Oh my oh my oh my oh my.	O moj o moj o moj o moj.
I wouldn't do that to her	Jaz ji tega ne bi naredil
I had to do it myself.	To sem moral narediti sam.
I hope you like it here	Upam, da vam je tukaj všeč
Nothing was in place.	Nič ni bilo na mestu.

I saw it too.	Tudi jaz sem videl.
I have to work as usual	Delati moram kot običajno
Something else will happen.	Zgodilo se bo nekaj drugega.
It's actually true.	Pravzaprav je res.
Just like I want you home	Tako kot ti želim domov

She was a child, all right.	Bila je otrok, v redu.
Even more than herself.	Še bolj kot sama.
I was sitting here.	Sedel sem tukaj.
Maybe not.	Mogoče ni tako.
I didn't know you were coming today	Nisem vedel, da boš prišel danes
Because of what you saw.	Zaradi tega, kar si videl.
I could help you, you know	Lahko bi ti pomagal, veš
How do you know if a guy is mad at you.	Kako veš, če je fant jezen nad tabo.

I want to talk to him	Želim govoriti z njim

I probably wouldn't.	Verjetno ne bi.
I was surprised there was nowhere else to go	Bil sem presenečen, da je bilo še kam iti

I will be gone from tomorrow.	Od jutri me ne bo več.
Someone has to do something with it now.	Nekdo mora zdaj nekaj narediti z njim.
But it wasn't always like that.	Vendar ni bilo vedno tako.
And then he realized something else.	In takrat je spoznal nekaj drugega.
I was right.	Prav sem imel.
Maybe she just likes me.	Mogoče sem ji samo všeč.
I have to stay with you here	Tukaj moram ostati s tabo
I can't do all this alone	Vsega tega ne morem narediti sam
I wonder if anyone knows if this is the case.	Zanima me, če kdo ve ali je temu tako.

I didn't mean anything like that.	Nič takega nisem mislil.
They should be something.	Morali bi biti nekaj.
I probably won't be able to stay long	Verjetno ne bom mogel dolgo ostati

We will never know now.	Zdaj ne bomo nikoli vedeli.

I had a nice time with him	Imel sem se lepo z njim
I know what he means	Vem, kaj misli

I almost forgot you were here	Skoraj sem pozabil, da si tukaj
That seems very nice to me.	To se mi zdi zelo lepo.
I was sure it had happened	Bil sem prepričan, da se je to zgodilo
I wasn't ready for that yet	Na to še nisem bil pripravljen

I did a good job too	Tudi jaz sem opravil dobro delo
I'll just say, he loves you too	Rekel bom le, tudi on te ima rad
I didn't want that at all	Tega si sploh nisem želel
Too fine, perhaps.	Preveč v redu, morda.
I have no doubt and neither do you	Jaz ne dvomim in tudi ti ne
I don't have time for that	Nimam časa za to
I think we'll see what happens tomorrow	Mislim, da bomo videli, kaj bo jutri
Still, I will forever	Še vedno, za vedno bom
This was the first time.	To je bilo prvič.
I decided to go home.	Odločil sem se, da grem domov.
He was a good boy.	Bil je dober fant.
That's why he speaks.	Zato govori.
You won't be sorry.	Ne bo vam žal.
It can only take a few days.	Lahko le nekaj dni.
Not that she would be much help.	Saj ne, da bi bila v veliko pomoč.
And I wouldn't be here.	In ne bi bila tukaj.
I didn't even make it	Niti mi ni uspelo
I wanted to leave	Hotel sem oditi

That's what she told herself.	To si je rekla.
I waited a while	Čakal sem nekaj časa
Also good.	Prav tako dobro.
In fact, no one did.	Pravzaprav nihče ni storil.
I can't, I can't, I can't	Ne morem, ne morem, ne morem
And not just you.	In ne samo ti.
They certainly did.	To so zagotovo storili.
I wonder if he himself began to believe that.	Zanima me, ali je tudi sam začel verjeti v to.
I learned a lot today	Danes sem se veliko naučil
And that's a good job.	In to je dobro delo.
I couldn’t believe this was happening	Nisem mogel verjeti, da se to dogaja
Nobody wanted to do it for you.	Nihče tega ni hotel narediti namesto tebe.
I was not surprised or angry	Nisem bil presenečen ali jezen
I often wouldn't.	Pogosto ne bi.

I've never seen them before.	Še nikoli jih nisem videl.
It's not.	Ni se.
I can’t believe this has never happened to me before	Ne morem verjeti, da se mi to še nikoli ni zgodilo

How he felt.	Kako se je počutil.
Please tell me what you can do.	Prosim, povej mi, kaj lahko.
I haven't seen that yet	Tega še nisem videl
Tell me there is a better way.	Povej mi, da obstaja boljši način.
They won't see me at all.	Sploh me ne bodo videli.
That was who he was now.	To je bil, kdo je bil zdaj.
And it probably should be.	In verjetno bi tudi moral biti.
There is something after that.	Po tem je nekaj.
I never learned.	Nikoli se nisem naučil.
I just need more time	Potrebujem samo več časa
He knew he would never see him again.	Vedel je, da ga nikoli več ne bo videl.
I think that is a good thing.	To mislim kot dobro stvar.
I should probably go to school	Verjetno bi moral iti v šolo
They never are.	Nikoli niso.
He needs her.	Potrebuje jo.
I don't want to do that.	Nočem narediti tako.
But the thing.	Ali stvar.

I feel very good.	Počutim se zelo dobro.
I haven't done that in a long time	Tega že dolgo nisem storil
I hope you get better soon	upam, da boš kmalu bolje

He went fast.	Hitro je šel.
I know it’s not enough to just be there.	Vem, da ni dovolj samo biti tam.
It's just good.	Preprosto je dobro.
He just wasn't ready.	Preprosto ni bil pripravljen.
There was something wrong with him.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe z njim.
I've had enough of you today.	Danes te imam dovolj.
That's why it works for you.	Zaradi tega te dela.
I'm glad to be back.	Vesel sem, da sem se vrnil.
I was just amazed at how much it all put together	Bil sem samo presenečen, kako veliko je vse skupaj
However, this is clearly not the case.	Vendar očitno ni tako.
I would tell her that.	To bi ji rekel.
They were lucky.	Imeli so srečo.
I know why he had to go	Vem zakaj je moral iti
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
So very, very wrong.	Tako zelo, zelo narobe.
I know it is.	Vem, da je.
However, it can be.	Vendar pa je to lahko.
I could do it myself	Lahko bi to naredil sam
I never did anything wrong	Nikoli nisem naredil nič narobe
Keep it simple.	Naj bo preprosto.
I'll do it quickly.	Hitro bom naredil.
I'm here all the time.	Ves čas sem tukaj.
He's just.	On je samo.
I wouldn't let anyone do that	Tega ne bi dovolil nikomur
I like this person	Všeč mi je ta oseba
There was nothing he could do.	Nič ni mogel storiti.
I just want to be sure	Želim biti samo prepričan
Not many people were seen.	Ni bilo videti veliko ljudi.
But he himself knew nothing about it.	A sam o tem ni vedel ničesar.
I talked to him before.	Prej sem govoril z njim.
I shouldn't leave like that	Ne bi smel tako oditi
Yes, very good.	Da, zelo dobro.
I know because he told me so	Vem, ker mi je tako rekel
A lot of work.	Veliko dela.
I can't tell you about that	Ne morem ti povedati o tem
And he did.	In to je storil.
I'm the only one there.	Jaz sem edini jaz tam.
It's better for the kids now.	Zdaj je bolje za otroke.
It was wrong.	Bilo je narobe.
He loved me too.	Tudi mene je imel rad.
We're there again.	Spet smo tam.
And that has been a problem so far.	In to je bil problem do zdaj.
I was there when it happened	Bil sem tam, ko se je zgodilo
I wanted children and a simple life	Želela sem otroke in preprosto življenje
That can't be done.	To se ne da narediti.
I came to talk to you	Prišel sem govoriti s tabo
It's all true, you know.	Vse je res, veš.
I think we have it	Mislim, da ga imamo
I didn't want to do that	Tega nisem hotel narediti
I know this will not be a problem.	Vem, da to ne bo problem.
Maybe he knew.	Morda je vedel.
I can't do this to you	Tega ti ne morem storiti
Or when it is, what it was.	Ali ko je, kaj je bilo.
I've said my piece.	Povedal sem svoje.
I know that can't be right	Vem, da to ne more biti prav
He knows about me.	On ve zame.
I never said that.	Tega nisem nikoli rekel.
Probably too much.	Verjetno preveč.
I would really like to hear from you	Resno bi rad slišal od vas
I mean, you.	Mislim, ti.
He made up his mind.	Odločil se je.
Sam would be angry	Sam bi bil jezen
This is neither here nor there.	Tega ni ne tukaj ne tam.
I didn't know why then	Takrat nisem vedel zakaj
No one can do anything.	Nihče ne more storiti ničesar.
I wouldn't have made it without you.	Brez tebe mi ne bi uspelo.
I used to have people	Prej sem imel ljudi
A few years.	Nekaj ​​let.
You can't know what it's like.	Ne moreš vedeti, kako je.
Nobody wants that!.	Tega si nihče ne želi!.
Maybe they weren't.	Mogoče pa niso bili.
More than enough.	Več kot dovolj.
Just one more time.	Samo še enkrat.
He met you.	Te je spoznal.
Obviously not.	Očitno je ni.
I wanted them all out	Hotel sem jih vse ven
I have to be.	moram biti.
I was waiting for something else and still nothing happened	Čakal sem še nekaj in še vedno se ni zgodilo nič
I understand he's busy	Razumem, da je zaposlen
A lot of things are done that way	Veliko stvari se naredi tako
I'm much better than that	Sem veliko boljši od tega
The problem is who to buy.	Problem je koga kupiti.
We will do everything.	Naredili bomo vse.
No you haven't yet.	Ne še nisi.
I think I could have done better	Mislim, da bi lahko naredil bolje
I really liked this guy.	Ta fant mi je bil zelo všeč.
It really has to be.	To res mora biti.
But there was also something else.	A bilo je tudi nekaj drugega.
I'll call them right away.	Takoj jih bom poklical.
And he will be with us.	In on bo z nami.
They were still there then.	Takrat so bili še tam.
I wonder when it will be.	Sprašujem se, kdaj bo.
I made several.	Naredil sem jih več.
Again, nothing is as it seems.	Spet nič ni tako, kot se zdi.
They are for you.	So za vas.
I haven't had that in a long time	Tega že dolgo nisem imel
It must be so.	Mora biti tako.
He does that a lot tonight.	Nocoj to pogosto počne.
As if what he said was even possible.	Kot da je bilo to, kar je rekel, sploh mogoče.
I would very much like to win	Zelo rad bi zmagal
I just worked hard for you	Samo težko sem ti delal
And that's the real me.	In to sem pravi jaz.
I could work.	Lahko bi delal.
He is a child.	On je otrok.
I'm so glad you're back.	Tako sem vesel, da si nazaj.
I do not understand	ne razumem
And everyone knew it.	In vsi so to vedeli.
You can go home.	Lahko boš šel domov.
I didn't know what he meant	Nisem vedel, kaj je mislil
I'll ask you one more time.	Te bom še enkrat vprašal.
He seems to be the only one.	Zdi se, da je edini.
Maybe something happened.	Mogoče se je kaj zgodilo.
He will never do that.	Tega ne bo nikoli storil.
.	.
I know it was for me.	Vem, da je bilo zame.
I know you have a job	Vem, da imaš delo
But I didn't ask her about it.	Nisem je pa vprašal o tem.
This one is mine.	Ta je moj.
I was there when your father died	Bil sem tam, ko je umrl tvoj oče
Couldn't help.	Ni bilo mogoče pomagati.
She's really scared.	Res se boji.
You are absolutely right.	Popolnoma prav imaš.
I never want to see them again	Nikoli več jih ne želim videti
It doesn't seem to come.	Zdi se, da ne pride.
I heard a.	Slišal sem a.
I thought it was nice	Zdelo se mi je lepo
Because it was never a problem for me.	Ker mi to nikoli ni bil problem.
Something needs to be done.	Nekaj ​​je treba narediti.
I didn't say anymore	nisem več rekel
I know that.	To vem.
It wasn't hard.	Ni bilo težko.
I didn't want to see anything	Ničesar nisem hotel videti
Probably still the case.	Verjetno je še vedno tako.
I don't see anything wrong with that.	Ne vidim nič narobe s tem.
It seemed like years.	Zdelo se je kot leta.
And that's the thing.	In to je stvar.
He had money.	Imel je denar.
I shouldn't be here	Ne bi smel biti tukaj
If it exists.	Če obstaja.
I never saw them again.	Nikoli več jih nisem videl.
I'm here.	Tukaj sem.
I had to know what was happening to her	Moral sem vedeti, kaj se ji dogaja
There were too many thoughts.	Misli je bilo preveč.
I want to, but not here	Želim, a ne tukaj
It's happened to me before.	Zgodilo se mi je že.
I really want you there	Res bi te rad tam
If only we could see each other that week.	Če bi se lahko videli tisti teden.
I shouldn't do that	Tega ne bi smel početi
I couldn't believe you did that	Nisem mogel verjeti, da si to naredil
That you didn't want him.	Da si ga ni želel.
I gave her everything	Vse sem ji dal
There is none of that here.	Tukaj ni nič od tega.
I wanted to help her	Hotel sem ji pomagati
I didn't know why then	Takrat nisem vedel zakaj
But it wasn't always like that.	Vendar ni bilo vedno tako.
I didn’t think of anything more than that	Nisem mislil na nič več kot to
Only.	Samo.
Unfortunately, that doesn’t really help.	Žal to res ne pomaga.
And yet it isn't.	Pa vendar ni.
I didn’t find much about it	Nisem našel veliko o tem
He was gone for three years.	Ni ga bilo tri leta.
I just need some time alone	Potrebujem samo nekaj časa sam
I just didn’t make it at all	Preprosto mi sploh ni uspelo
Very good person.	Zelo dobra oseba.
This is probably wrong.	To je verjetno narobe.
you know something	nekaj veš.
That is, before.	Se pravi, prej.
No, friend.	Ne, prijatelj.
It was obvious to him now that he didn't know.	Zdaj mu je bilo očitno, da ne ve.
I mean, really good money	Mislim, res dober denar
time.	čas.
Today I wanted to eat alone	Danes sem hotel jesti sam
I didn't have to come here	Ni mi bilo treba priti sem
He didn't know where we were.	Ni vedel, kje smo.
I really don't know.	res ne vem.
I just never see him	Samo nikoli ga ne vidim
I'd like to hear what else he has to say.	Rad bi slišal, kaj še ima za povedati.
I didn't have to tell	Ni mi bilo treba povedati
That's all.	To je vse.
I think that's it for me	Mislim, da je to zame
I have to believe that	To moram verjeti
He will know what to do.	Vedel bo, kaj storiti.
Maybe he's right.	Morda ima prav.
I want to be a real child for you	Zate želim biti pravi otrok
He is no longer here.	Zdaj ga ni več tukaj.
It can't be helped.	Ni mogoče pomagati.
She knew everything.	Vse je vedela.
I just wanted to see what would happen	Hotel sem samo videti, kaj se bo zgodilo
Maybe I won't see her again	Mogoče je ne bom več videl
That's how I got it from you.	Tako sem dobil od tebe.
I need to do more of this	Moram narediti več tega
I'm sure you'll see that.	Prepričan sem, da boste to videli.
I just want you more	Samo več te želim
I loved how he felt	Všeč mi je bilo, kako se je počutil
And yet it was there all along.	Pa vendar je bilo ves čas tam.
I won't talk here long	Tukaj ne bom dolgo govoril
I kept saying that to myself.	To sem si kar naprej govoril.
I keep going	Grem kar naprej
That has already happened.	Tako se je že zgodilo.
He said that.	On je to rekel.
That would be for you	To bi bil zate
They’re pretty much over it.	Precej so nad tem.
Not now.	Ne zdaj.
It was hard work.	To je bilo težko delo.
I was happy to see him.	Bil sem vesel, ko sem ga videl.
And how often.	In kako pogosto.
I really understand.	Res razumem.
He won't tell you.	Ne bo ti povedal.
I certainly didn't expect that	Tega zagotovo nisem pričakoval
I need to do something about it	Moram nekaj storiti glede tega
I want to make sure nothing like this happens here.	Želim se prepričati, da se tukaj ne bo zgodilo nič takega.
That was simply not true.	To preprosto ni bilo res.
and all that.	in vse to.
It's just you.	Ti si samo.
In fact, I wanted to tell him everything	Pravzaprav sem mu hotel povedati vse
I think this would be the right time	Mislim, da bi bil to pravi čas
What does he know.	Kaj on ve.
I certainly never would	Jaz zagotovo nikoli ne bi
It was hard at times.	Včasih je bilo težko.
I said too much.	Preveč sem povedal.
I never want to be alone	Nikoli ne želim biti sam
I brought you back to life	Vrnil sem te v življenje
I was.	Bilo je.
And good.	In dober.
He is perfectly fine and wants to play.	Je popolnoma v redu in želi igrati.
I am very busy.	zelo sem zaposlen.
I know he will be alone and will be waiting for me	Vem, da bo sam in me bo čakal
I said it's hard to believe	Rekel sem, da je težko verjeti
I wanted out.	Hotel sem ven.
This one too.	Tudi ta.
I don’t know how he was able to do that	Ne vem, kako je lahko to storil
There is nothing to buy.	Ni kaj kupiti.
This is really my life.	To je res moje življenje.
I know what he's doing	Vem kaj počne
No one did.	Nihče ni storil.
I really, really liked it.	Zelo, zelo mi je bilo všeč.
We know where he is.	Vemo, kje je.
I didn't even hear what he said	Sploh nisem slišal, kaj je rekel
But now there is simply nothing there.	Zdaj pa tam preprosto ni ničesar.
I heard little, saw nothing.	Malo sem slišal, nič videl.
I could have her tonight	Lahko bi jo imel nocoj
And he wondered how that was possible.	In vprašal se je, kako je to mogoče.
I would not want more	ne bi želel več
I knew it never would.	Vedela sem, da nikoli ne bo.
I still want a job	Še vedno želim delo
If I may please.	Če lahko prosim.
I seem to keep waiting	Zdi se, da bom še naprej čakal
If they are, they are.	Če so, so.
I was convinced that was it	Bil sem prepričan, da je to to
I don’t know what’s going on before.	Ne vem, kaj se dogaja prej.
I thought you might have done it.	Mislil sem, da si morda naredil.
I never asked for any of that	Nikoli nisem prosil za nič od tega
But he didn't want to stay there.	A tam ni hotel ostati.
That was not good.	To ni bilo dobro.
If not, you don't.	Če ne, ti ne.
Now we have to buy it.	Zdaj pa ga moramo kupiti.
He will give her everything.	Dal ji bo vse.
Just do what you have to do.	Samo naredi, kar moraš.
A little here, a little there	Malo tukaj, malo tam
However, he did not return.	Vendar se ni vrnil.
And where she was now.	In kje je bila zdaj.
I let him do that	To sem mu dovolil
It was very nice.	Bilo je zelo lepo.
I wish he didn't do that.	Rad bi, da tega ne počne.
I could work with that	Lahko bi delal s tem
He got it all by himself.	Vse je dobil sam.
I never saw her again	Nisem je več videl
That was not good for us.	To ni bilo dobro za nas.
He had his chance.	Imel je svojo priložnost.
I'm interested right now	Trenutno me zanima
I didn’t feel well that day	Tisti dan se nisem počutil dobro
You don't like it.	Ni ti všeč.
I want to be that	rad bi bil to
Which is actually not wrong.	Kar pravzaprav ni narobe.
But I know they did something	Vem pa, da so nekaj naredili
There seems to be little to it.	Zdi se, da je malo za to.
Or not.	Ali pa ne.
He is the only child	Je edini otrok
But she didn't know that.	A tega ni vedela.
A matter of time	Vprašanje časa
That never felt right to us.	To se nam nikoli ni zdelo prav.
He's gone and he's never coming back.	Odšel je in nikoli se ne bo vrnil.
I liked it right away	Takoj mi je bil všeč
That was now.	To je bilo zdaj.
Not the only one.	Ni edina.
I’m not going to talk much about it here.	Tukaj ne bom veliko govoril o tem.
I'm sorry you were happier at home	Žal mi je, da si bil doma bolj vesel
There is nothing we can do about it now.	Zdaj ne moremo storiti ničesar glede tega.
He has no money.	Brez denarja je.
What you thought, you thought.	Kar si mislil, si mislil.
I'll do it right away.	To bom storil takoj.
I think it is.	Mislim, da je.
I wish he wasn't there	Želim si, da ga ne bi bilo
I won't allow that.	Tega ne bom dovolil.
It would really be simple.	Res bi bilo preprosto.
Sometimes it's not like that.	Včasih ni tako.
And really more than that.	In res več kot to.
I know how she feels, she told herself.	Vem, kako se počuti, si je rekla.
I will try to help you	poskušal ti bom pomagati
I don't want that.	tega ne želim.
Or a week.	Ali teden dni.
Now I could see what he could see	Zdaj sem lahko videl, kar je lahko videl on
This is so beautiful.	To je tako lepo.
I always thought he was a boy	Vedno sem mislil, da je fant
Not everything is as you think it would be.	Ni vse tako, kot mislite, da bi bilo.
I'm going to have to do this.	To bom moral narediti.
Or he lives here.	Ali pa živi tukaj.
I really didn't have to.	Res mi ni bilo treba.
Now we're not the only ones.	Zdaj nismo edini.
We will do that here.	To bomo storili tukaj.
There would never be children.	Nikoli ne bi bilo otrok.
Maybe I don't have time	Mogoče nimam časa
I wish I could see them	Želim si, da bi jih videl
I knew he wanted out	Vedel sem, da želi ven
They're not here.	Niso tukaj.
All that is left is mine.	Vse, kar je več, je moje.
He was.	On je bil.
I can't help myself.	Ne morem si pomagati.
And it will.	In bo.
Because he was no longer his own man.	Ker ni bil več svoj človek.
It was helpful.	Bilo je v pomoč.
From then on.	Od takrat naprej.
I don’t think any of us can.	Mislim, da nihče od nas ne more.
Just to see how it feels.	Samo da vidim, kako se počuti.
I asked what he meant by that	Vprašal sem, kaj je mislil s tem
And it won't be good either.	In tudi ne bo dobro.
I also want to know everything	Tudi jaz želim vedeti vse
He doesn't need me.	On me ne potrebuje.
I knew right away what was wrong	Takoj sem vedel, kaj je narobe
I didn't do anything either	Tudi jaz nisem nič naredil
And he was good.	In bil je dober.
And he is happy because he played so well.	In vesel je, ker je igral tako dobro.
He knows more.	On ve več.
It's not serious.	Ni resno.
And it's okay for me.	In zame je v redu.
I asked him what he was doing there	Vprašal sem ga, kaj počne tam
Because he knows.	Ker ve.
I was just waiting.	Samo čakal sem.
Sometimes I still need a car	Včasih še vedno potrebujem avto
I can't do this.	Ne morem narediti tega.
I didn't mean not to tell you	Nisem ti hotel ne povedati
I want everything, forever, every day	Želim si vse, za vedno, vsak dan
I had a few, but it wasn’t enough	Nekaj ​​sem jih imel, a ni bilo dovolj
That's what I'd like to give you	To bi ti rad dal
You wanted more.	Želel si več.
I am the one who knows everything that was before.	Jaz sem tisti, ki pozna vse, kar je bilo prej.
I shouldn't have gone	Nisem smel iti
I mean, he wanted to know why	Mislim, hotel je vedeti zakaj
I found the book.	Našel sem knjigo.
I don't know where.	Ne vem kje.
I can't say more.	Ne morem povedati več.
It just happened.	Preprosto se je zgodilo.
And we will do that.	In to bomo tudi storili.
It was fine then.	Takrat je bilo v redu.
I wasn’t sure how that would be possible	Nisem bil prepričan, kako bi bilo to mogoče
Without being sure.	Ne da bi bil prepričan.
I was not alone in this.	V tem nisem bil sam.
I was there last week too.	Tudi prejšnji teden sem bil tam.
I'll tell you what to do.	Povedal vam bom, kaj storiti.
Play the right way.	Igra na pravi način.
We need to be better again.	Spet moramo biti boljši.
I won't be able to see anything	Ničesar ne bom mogel videti
That's really true.	To je res tako.
Not so much, really.	Ne tako zelo, res.
I don't want to talk to you	Ne želim govoriti s tabo
I tried to help him, but he wouldn't	Poskušal sem mu pomagati, a ni hotel
That's why I did it.	Zaradi tega sem to naredil.
I do this almost all the time.	To počnem skoraj ves čas.
I told her the next day	Povedal sem ji naslednji dan
He needed to eat.	Potreboval je jesti.
This is actually happening.	To se pravzaprav dogaja.
Still, I couldn’t do that	Še vedno pa tega nisem mogel storiti
Now I was convinced of that.	Zdaj sem bil prepričan v to.
It remains to be seen whether you did it or not.	Še vedno je treba videti, ali ste to storili ali ne.
I didn't even know if you were going to have me	Sploh nisem vedel, če me boš imel
I think we could do that	Mislim, da bi to lahko naredili
He is a good man.	On je dober človek.
I've been here a long time.	Dolgo sem prišel.
I learned that I like it here	Naučil sem se, da mi je tukaj všeč
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow.	Mogoče ne danes, morda ne jutri.
I would know now.	Zdaj bi vedel.
In fact, he didn't.	Pravzaprav tega ni storil.
I just had to see him again	Samo še enkrat sem ga moral videti
maybe I won't.	morda ne bom.
I know you wanted to talk	Vem, da si hotel govoriti
But that's not the case here.	Vendar tukaj ni tako.
I never thought that was possible	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da je to mogoče
He was a very good friend of mine.	Bil je moj zelo dober prijatelj.
I'm going out for a while.	Za nekaj časa grem ven.
It's nothing right now.	Trenutno je nič.
That’s it and much more.	To je to in še veliko več.
I think you'll like it	Mislim, da ti bo všeč
He didn't even try to talk.	Niti ni poskušal govoriti.
I wanted to see what was going on	Hotel sem videti, kaj se dogaja
Because of me.	Zaradi mene.
No one needed to know about it.	Nikomur ni bilo treba vedeti za to.
Sometimes you don’t know why, but it seems right.	Včasih ne veste, zakaj, vendar se zdi prav.
I'm just not sure about that	Samo o tem nisem prepričan
I will definitely do it myself	Sama bom zagotovo to storila
A little, not so much.	Malo, a ne toliko.
Or he couldn't.	Ali pa ne bi mogel.
It wasn't us.	Nismo bili mi.
I was lucky to find him	Imel sem srečo, da sem ga našel
He became a good friend of mine.	Postal je moj dober prijatelj.
Not enough time.	Ni dovolj časa.
I knew he was gone, but you didn't say that	Vedel sem, da ga ni več, vendar tega nisi rekel
I came to do it.	Prišel sem, da to storim.
I did it right away	Takoj sem storil
Never, never, never is.	Nikoli, nikoli, nikoli ni.
He didn't want to leave.	Ni hotel oditi.
It wouldn’t be a lot of stuff.	Ne bi bil veliko stvari.
I had to see you again	Moral sem te videti še enkrat
I need to talk to you	moram govoriti s tabo
I never want to see them again.	Nikoli več jih ne želim videti.
Everyone had a nice time	Vsi so se imeli lepo
I almost didn't.	Skoraj nisem.
I hope you're doing well.	Upam, da ti gre dobro.
That's not my question.	To ni moje vprašanje.
I see this happening again	Vidim, da se to spet dogaja
I spoke to him yesterday	Včeraj sem govoril z njim
We just know what they did.	Samo vemo, kaj so naredili.
I thought I wouldn't see you	Mislil sem, da te tega ne bom videl
I didn't find anything either	Tudi jaz nisem nič našel
I am a man who has nowhere to go	Sem človek, ki nima kam iti
I am very happy that all this is happening	Zelo sem vesel, da se vse to dogaja
Just with you.	Samo s tabo.
I hope we do well here	Upam, da nam bo tukaj dobro
I hope it's okay.	Upam, da je v redu.

You started it all.	Ti si vse začel.
Like who are you.	Kot, kdo si.
It is very simple.	Je zelo preprosto.
I couldn't be.	Ne bi mogel biti.
It never was.	Nikoli ni bilo.
Maybe a little more.	Mogoče še malo.
Someone should tell her.	Nekdo bi ji moral povedati.
I want to play with you more	Želim se več igrati s tabo
I wonder where he lives	Sprašujem se, kje živi
I can’t help but wonder why	Ne morem si pomagati, da se ne bi vprašal zakaj
Much better without it.	Veliko bolje brez tega.
I don't think so at all	Sploh tega ne mislim
Something is wrong.	Nekaj ​​ni v redu.
It seems like he’s supposed to do something.	Zdi se, kot da naj bi nekaj naredil.
You should be a friend	Moral bi biti prijatelj
I didn’t think all this had already happened	Nisem si mislil, da se je vse to že zgodilo
I thought he was going to say no, but he said yes.	Mislil sem, da bo rekel ne, pa je rekel da.
I wanted all the money	Hotel sem ves denar
I would say too.	Tudi jaz bi rekel.
It cannot be said.	Ni mogoče povedati.
I'm not feeling well.	Ne počutim se dobro.
In fact, quite good.	Pravzaprav kar dobro.
All of him.	Vsega njega.
I can't believe we're the only ones	Ne morem verjeti, da smo edini

You told me that yesterday.	To si mi rekel včeraj.

I know it doesn’t seem that way right now	Vem, da se zdaj ne zdi tako
And the day didn't come long.	In dan ni dolgo prišel.
I was right too.	Tudi jaz sem imel prav.
And not just an opportunity.	In ne le priložnost.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
I thought we would have time	Mislil sem, da bomo imeli čas
I saw him last night	Sinoči sem ga videl
I know where he's going	Vem, kam gre
I haven't decided yet	Nisem se še odločil
That never comes.	To nikoli ne pride.
Alone.	Sami.
That's not a problem.	To ni problem.
We both wanted it that way.	Oba sva si želela tako.
I hope he tells us soon	Upam, da nam bo kmalu povedal
But we'll have to work fast.	Vendar bomo morali delati hitro.
Simply not.	Preprosto ne.
He was fine.	Bil je v redu.
He asked her to come with him.	Prosil jo je, naj gre z njim.
They were right about him.	Glede njega so imeli prav.
I went quickly and helped	Hitro sem šel in pomagal
I probably knew before him	Verjetno sem vedel pred njim
I mean, probably not	Mislim, verjetno ne
That is the question.	To je vprašanje.
Everything will be fine for you here.	Tukaj bo vse v redu za vas.
It's always been true.	Vedno je bilo res.
I arrived the day before.	Prišel sem dan prej.
And so true.	In tako res.
I actually feel good	Pravzaprav se počutim dobro
I can't right now.	Trenutno ne morem.
There was a teacher	Tam je bil učitelj
I don't see you, he says	Ne vidim te, pravi
I didn't expect it.	Nisem pričakoval.
I knew my father would not say anything	Vedel sem, da moj oče ne bo rekel ničesar
I can see that.	To lahko vidim.
I had a lot of time alone	Imel sem veliko časa sam
Everything for work.	Vse za delo.
I'm definitely back	Zagotovo sem nazaj
There has never been anything like it.	Nikoli ni bilo nič takega.
And you knew it would.	In vedel si, da bo.
This person is going.	Ta oseba gre.
I probably would never have known.	Verjetno nikoli ne bi vedela.
You may think so.	Morda mislite tako.
I hope you had a good time	Upam, da ste se imeli dobro
Maybe I'll do that too.	Mogoče bom tudi to storil.
This happened behind us.	To se je zgodilo za nami.
I bought both.	Kupil sem oba.
I think they did it right here.	Mislim, da so naredili prav pri nas.
It was never like that.	Nikoli ni bilo tako.
At home, I felt much better about everything	Domov sem se počutil veliko bolje glede vsega
It was more than good.	Bilo je več kot dobro.
I am? 	Sem jaz?
she said.	je rekla.
I would be at home.	Bila bi doma.
I wasn't happy either	Tudi jaz nisem bil vesel
I did it all	Vse to sem naredil jaz
But I was surprised.	Vendar sem bil presenečen.
I haven't spoken to him in years	Že leta nisem govoril z njim
I still do all those things.	Še vedno počnem vse te stvari.
I could hardly believe it	Skoraj nisem mogel verjeti
I just wanted to be with you	Samo hotel sem biti s tabo
I saw what he meant	Videl sem, kaj je mislil
I wanted more of that	Želel sem več tega
No one knows what they are.	Nihče ne ve, kaj so.
However, this is not possible.	Vendar to ni mogoče.
Maybe there were only a few	Morda jih je bilo le nekaj
Go ahead if you want.	Povej naprej, če želiš.
I just have to be alone	Samo biti moram sam
I mean, with everything	Mislim, z vsem
I didn't hear you	Nisem te slišal
I was never busy	Nikoli nisem bil zaposlen
I know you like it.	Vem, da ti je všeč.
It was all about me.	To je bilo vse o meni.
Apparently a little more than a child.	Očitno malo več kot otrok.
Not good enough today.	Danes ni dovolj dobro.
I can't do things anymore	Ne morem več delati stvari
I understand what you did	Razumem, kaj si naredil
I don't want to believe that	Temu nočem verjeti
I used to really like her	Včasih mi je bila res všeč
However, much remains to be done.	Še vedno pa je treba narediti veliko.
I understand a little and that is enough	Malo razumem in to je dovolj
I probably couldn’t if I wanted to.	Verjetno ne bi mogel, če bi hotel.
Just, really.	Samo, res.
I told him what it was.	Povedal sem mu, kaj je bilo.
Now he has done it.	Zdaj je to storil.
And he just doesn't care.	In preprosto ga ne zanima.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikomur ni povedal.
I didn't want to either	Tudi jaz nisem hotel
Not for something like that.	Ne za kaj takega.
As certainly today.	Kot zagotovo danes.
He was so happy.	Bil je tako vesel.
I doubt that's true.	Dvomim, da je to res.
He says he is.	Pravi, da je.
And there is a reason for that.	In za to obstaja razlog.
He plays three more.	Igra še tri.
Nobody was there.	Nihče ni bil tam.
Now he is singing.	Zdaj poje.
You can think.	Lahko si mislite.
This was no longer my child.	To ni bil več moj otrok.
I could get to him	Lahko bi prišel do njega
I found it a long, long time ago	Našel sem ga že dolgo, dolgo nazaj
I want, no need, to move on	Želim, ni treba, iti naprej
No one seemed to be.	Zdelo se je, da nihče ni.
I almost believe you	Skoraj ti verjamem
I never thought of that	Nikoli si tega nisem mislil
I didn't really have anything to say	Pravzaprav nisem imel kaj za povedati
And you continue to be.	In še naprej si.
I want you in my room tonight	Želim te nocoj v svoji sobi
I didn't hear them leave	Nisem jih slišal oditi
It's just a little more.	Samo malo več je.
That is	To je
I wanted to.	hotel sem.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
I know you want me too	Vem, da si me tudi želiš
It seems to you as it is now.	To se vam zdi kot zdaj.
I told you how it will be	Povedal sem ti, kako bo
I need to talk to you	Moram govoriti s tabo
I won't be here long	Ne bom dolgo tukaj
I heard about it.	Slišal sem za to.
That would be something.	To bi bilo nekaj.
Maybe not.	Morda ni tako.
I haven't been in a long time	Že dolgo nisem bil
It hasn't happened yet, but it will, and soon.	Ni še bilo, a bo, in to kmalu.
I'm sure you'll like it	Prepričan sem, da vam bo všeč
Or maybe she just knew.	Ali pa je morda samo vedela.
Not so good.	Ne tako dobro.
He won't be able to get out.	Ne bo mogel ven.
But maybe that was a good thing.	Morda pa je bilo to dobro.
Tonight is for us.	Nocoj je za nas.
No, not everyone.	Ne, vsi ne.
I had to be ready.	Moral sem biti pripravljen.
I would like that.	To bi mi bilo všeč.
I'm sure he didn't go there	Prepričan sem, da ni šel tja
I love that too much	To imam preveč rad
And so we like it.	In tako nam je všeč.
I haven't seen that yet.	Tega še nisem videl.
But I think that may be true	Mislim pa, da je morda res
I would never know.	nikoli ne bi vedel.
Right away, please.	Takoj, prosim.
We are at home.	Doma sva.
I would never say that.	Tega ne bi nikoli rekel.
I was yours for the question	Bil sem tvoj za vprašanje
I would be here now.	Zdaj bi bila tukaj.
I think we have time for that	Mislim, da imamo čas za to
There’s not much you can do about it.	Glede tega ne moreš veliko narediti.
you have everything.	imaš vse.
She knew what to do.	Vedela je, kaj storiti.
I knew he would lose.	Vedel sem, da bo izgubil.
After that, I would like to talk to him	Po tem bi rad govoril z njim
Me too	Tudi jaz glede tega
I would stay there again.	Spet bi ostal tam.
There was no help for him.	Ni mu bilo pomoči.
I should do something	Nekaj ​​bi moral narediti
I didn't want to know.	Nisem hotel vedeti.
I haven't been here in a long time	Že dolgo me ni bilo
He lost his men.	Izgubil je svoje ljudi.
I had a good day.	Imel sem dober dan.
All that stuff.	Vse te stvari.
This is not the first time he has done something like this.	To ni prvič, da je naredil kaj takega.
When asked how you are, I said good	Na vprašanje, kako si, sem rekel dobro
I need to know where you went	Moram vedeti, kam si šel
Even then, it would be difficult.	Tudi takrat bi bilo težko.
Just keep going and going on and on.	Samo še in še in naprej.
I had to say something	Nekaj ​​sem moral povedati
This is often not the case.	Pogosto ni tako.
This is not happening much anymore.	To se ne dogaja več veliko.
And it still failed.	In še vedno ni uspelo.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
It felt wrong.	Zdelo se je narobe.
I could be next.	Lahko bi bil naslednji.
Not until now.	Ne do zdaj.
I knew she would like it	Vedel sem, da ji bo všeč
I knew there were a lot of them these days	Vedel sem, da jih je te dni veliko
I just can’t work on it anymore today.	Danes preprosto ne morem več delati na tem.
He has to do this for the book.	To mora storiti za knjigo.
Maybe you are, maybe you are not.	Morda ste, morda niste.
There is still something wrong.	Še vedno nekaj ni v redu.
Or maybe he didn’t leave.	Ali pa morda ni odšel.
I told you as much.	Toliko sem ti povedal.
I knew nothing.	Nič nisem vedel.
Here's just it.	Tukaj je samo to.

That's the way it has to be.	Tako mora biti.

I would give anything to make that happen	Vse bi dal, da bi se to zgodilo
I almost lost it then	Takrat sem ga skoraj izgubil
A person who is out of place	Oseba, ki ni na mestu
Maybe it wasn't right here.	Morda ni bilo prav tukaj.
I just couldn't see anything	Samo ničesar nisem mogel videti
It was not possible.	Ni bilo mogoče.
I can't believe what just happened	Ne morem verjeti, kaj se je pravkar zgodilo
After that, she still wanted me.	Po tem me je še vedno želela.
I want to be me.	Želim biti mi.
This is not the help he needs.	To ni pomoč, ki jo potrebuje.
I never knew it was possible	Nikoli nisem vedel, da je to mogoče
He didn't find it.	Ni ga našel.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
I'm sure you have a lot to say	Prepričan sem, da imaš veliko za povedati
For this time.	Za ta čas.
And that is exactly what happened.	In prav to se je zgodilo.
I hope it becomes.	Upam, da bo to postal.
I forgot about everything	na vse sem pozabil
You are here now.	Tukaj ste zdaj.
I should never have come here	Nikoli ne bi smel priti sem
He kept talking.	Kar naprej je govoril.
He was sorry the baby was here.	Žal mu je bilo, da je bil otrok tukaj.
Even if we know what we know.	Tudi če vemo, kar vemo.
I can't see them right	Ne morem jih videti prav
He would know.	On bi vedel.
I just have to do these things myself	Samo te stvari moram narediti sam
I told him and he's fine with that	Povedal sem mu in je v redu s tem

This is so hard.	To je tako težko.
I like them very much	Zelo so mi všeč
I am not sure.	Nisem prepričan.
I need him to need me	Potrebujem, da me potrebuje
He was the one she wanted.	On je bil tisti, ki ga je želela.
I knew he had me.	Vedel sem, da me ima.

I should have told you sooner	Moral bi ti povedati prej

I would expect to be with you	Pričakoval bi, da bom s tabo

That's how I've seen her before	Tako sem jo že videl
I just didn’t expect it	Preprosto nisem pričakoval
It wasn’t that hard to do.	Ni bilo tako težko narediti.
I think he intends to talk to you	Mislim, da namerava govoriti s tabo

That's why we're here.	Zato smo tukaj.
Can anyone please help me.	Mi lahko kdo prosim pomaga.
I have to convince him	Moram ga prepričati

I did a good job of that too	Tudi jaz sem to dobro opravil

She was still with him.	Še vedno je bila z njim.
I'm so glad you came back to me	Tako sem vesel, da si se vrnil k meni

I knew something was going on with him	Vedel sem, da se z njim nekaj dogaja

You will love it.	Všeč vam bo.
I hope no one heard.	Upam, da nihče ni slišal.

To talk about it.	Če želite govoriti o tem.

I know the house.	Poznam hišo.
I haven't heard people talk to me	Nisem slišal ljudi govoriti z mano
When it comes to.	Ko gre za.

He loves me so much.	Tako zelo me ima rad.
No matter what, he should be there for you	Ne glede na vse bi moral biti tam zate
A lot is happening to me right now	Trenutno se mi veliko dogaja
I couldn't see anything.	Ničesar nisem mogel videti.

A man is not supposed to need much	Človek naj ne bi potreboval veliko
I told her to come home to me	Rekel sem ji, naj pride domov k meni

I think that's my problem	Mislim, da je to moj problem
And neither should we.	In tudi ne bi smeli.
Maybe not.	Morda ne bo.
What could be the problem.	Kaj bi lahko bil problem.
I told you he wouldn't stay	Rekel sem ti, da ne bo ostal
He simply failed.	Preprosto mu ni uspelo.
I mean, please.	Mislim, prosim.
I still used to go to them	Še vedno sem včasih šel k njim
I know he'll ask you	Vem, da te bo vprašal
There is no such thing.	Nič takega ni.
I know what you told me	Vem, kaj si mi povedal
I knew what he was doing	Vedel sem, kaj počne
And the one over there.	In tisti tam.
I really was alone	Res sem bil sam
i will stay here.	ostal bom tukaj.
I want to know what happened here	Želim vedeti, kaj se je zgodilo tukaj
I'm sure you are.	Prepričan sem, da si.
There aren't any.	Niti jih ni.
But he also knew what he should do.	Vendar je tudi vedel, kaj bi moral storiti.
I do not understand.	ne razumem.
I always wanted you	Vedno sem te želel
I need to know if it's true	Moram vedeti, če je res
And yet this is not enough to know.	In vendar tega ni dovolj vedeti.
Your father died because of it.	Tvoj oče je umrl zaradi tega.
I didn't need anything else from him	Nič drugega nisem potreboval od njega
I understand what you mean	razumem, kaj misliš
I want him to go home	Želim, da gre domov
I know what you mean now	Vem, kaj misliš zdaj
I was sure it would be okay	Bil sem prepričan, da bo v redu
It doesn't seem that way.	Ne zdi se tako.
I really have to go	Res moram iti
However, there are a few.	Vendar pa jih je nekaj.
What he did.	Kaj je naredil.
Just forward.	Samo naprej.
I'm not interested in anything else.	Nič drugega me ne zanima.
I’m not even sure that’s possible today.	Niti nisem prepričan, da je to trenutno mogoče danes.
He already knew that.	To je že vedel.
Because they are nothing.	Ker niso nič.
The problem should be something else.	Problem bi moral biti nekaj drugega.
I've always been here.	Vedno sem bil tukaj.
I don't want someone like that.	Ne želim si nekoga takega.
I want to live with you	Želim si življenje s tabo
It won't be much.	Ne bo veliko.
I lost so much	Toliko sem izgubil
I know this is not always the way it is	Vem, da to ni vedno tako, kot je
I'm doing better without it	Brez tega mi gre bolje
I didn’t have any of that.	Nič od tega nisem imel.
I haven’t seen anything better than him	Nisem videl nič bolje kot on
And it's a lot.	In veliko je.
I was and still am angry	Bil sem in sem še vedno jezen
He could die.	Lahko bi umrl.
I was totally ready to move on.	Bil sem popolnoma pripravljen, da grem naprej.
If that were the case, I might be right.	Če bi bilo tako, bi morda imel prav.
We will just do it together and everything will be fine.	Samo to bomo naredili skupaj in vse bo v redu.
I won't need him for that now	Zdaj ga za to ne bom potreboval
And she knew she knew.	In vedela je, da ve.
And therefore.	In zato.
It's already three.	Je že tri.
I have to get out of there	Moram oditi od tam
I am sure he will buy more.	Prepričan sem, da bo kupil več.
I can't say more.	Več ne morem povedati.
I absolutely am.	Popolnoma sem.
I can't be sure.	Ne morem biti prepričan.
I didn’t know how many people.	Nisem vedel, koliko ljudi.
I feel good.	Počutim se dobro.
He didn't want to go.	Ni hotel iti.
I thought he was.	Mislil sem, da je bil.
And you will win.	In zmagal boš.
He is alone.	On je sam.
Do it, do it.	Naredi to, naredi to.
I've been waiting for you	Čakal sem te
She was in place.	Bila je na mestu.
None of us had.	Nihče od nas ni imel.
I doubt this is the only one	Dvomim, da je to edini
I think he knows more than he speaks	Mislim, da ve več, kot govori
I hadn't seen them there before.	Tam jih prej nisem videl.
That wasn't for me.	To ni bilo zame.
I think there are a few.	Mislim, da jih je nekaj.
You have to be here.	Moraš biti tukaj.
But I was lucky.	Imel sem pa srečo.
I can't do that.	Tega ne morem storiti.
That is the question.	To je vprašanje.
I knew everything I needed to know	Vedel sem vse, kar sem moral vedeti
I didn’t know what was going on	Nisem vedel, kaj se dogaja
I know now.	zdaj vem.
I understand why you didn't tell me	Razumem, zakaj mi nisi povedal
This is still the case.	To je še vedno tako.
I don't know where he got them.	Ne vem, kje jih je dobil.
Someone has to.	Nekdo mora.
Or as my father would say.	Ali kot bi rekel moj oče.
He didn't help her.	Ni ji pomagal.
I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not.	Nisem prepričan, ali je to dobra stvar ali ne.
You should say that.	Moral bi to povedati.
I'm sorry about that.	Žal mi je za to.
I will continue to work on this	Še naprej bom delal na tem
I just saw everything you did	Pravkar sem videl vse, kar si naredil
I also learned something from him	Od njega sem se tudi nekaj naučil
I will tell you when the time is right	Povedal vam bom, ko bo pravi čas
Not that way.	Ne na ta način.
I saw what happened to him	Videl sem, kaj se mu je zgodilo
I really like how hard it is	Zelo mi je všeč, kako težko je
You think it's true.	Misliš, da je res.
I see.	Vidim.
It's still going.	Še vedno gre.
I went for it right away	Takoj sem šel na to
I don’t know enough to say that’s not the case.	Ne vem dovolj, da bi rekel, da ni tako.
But much more can and must be done.	A veliko več je mogoče in je treba narediti.
I have a job for you	Imam službo zate
He can't do that.	On tega ne more storiti.
You don't like it.	Ni ti všeč.
I needed a little more time	Potreboval sem malo več časa
It was, nothing more.	Bilo je, nič več.
I need to see if it looks that way	Moram videti, če je videti tako
You should have come earlier	Moral bi priti prej
I don't see anything.	ne vidim nič.
That really didn't look good.	To res ni bilo videti dobro.
You want to do something.	Želiš nekaj narediti.
It will happen.	Zgodilo se bo.
I think you are, actually	Mislim, da si, pravzaprav
But this did not happen to us.	A pri nas se to ni zgodilo.
I haven't been there in a while	Že nekaj časa nisem bil tam
And it seems very good.	In zdi se zelo dobro.
I don't know who he is then.	Takrat ne vem, kdo je.
I understand why.	razumem zakaj.
She is doing very well.	Zelo dobro ji gre.
I'm sure they'll have something else there.	Prepričan sem, da bodo tam še kaj imeli.
It was the same last night.	Tako je bilo tudi sinoči.
He knows and so should you.	On ve in tudi ti bi moral.
I always believe you	vedno ti verjamem
I didn't talk to you	Nisem govoril s tabo
I didn’t come back just for the money	Nisem se vrnil samo zaradi denarja
For all of us.	Za vse nas.
Your father taught you.	Tvoj oče te je naučil.
It does a lot of things well.	Veliko stvari počne dobro.
So they've been here for a while.	Tako so bili tukaj že nekaj časa.
I wish it would be.	Želim si, da bi bilo.
Not too much.	Ne preveč.
Not really.	Pravzaprav ni.
I wanted to believe it was.	Hotel sem verjeti, da je.
I know you weren't your own	Vem, da nisi bil svoj
I just need a little time	Potrebujem samo malo časa
I need to know what's going on and where	Moram vedeti, kaj se dogaja in kje
I knew we would never see him again	Vedel sem, da ga ne bomo nikoli več videli
After that, I could decide	Po tem bi se lahko odločil
Some were missing.	Nekaj ​​jih ni bilo.
And it certainly did.	In zagotovo se je.
I can do this for you	To lahko storim zate
I'm sure I can.	Prepričan sem, da lahko.
I really didn’t think it was going to be that hard	Res si nisem mislil, da bo tako težko
I won't be long	Ne bom dolgo odšel
I'm glad I'm helping.	Vesel sem, da sem v pomoč.
No, it wasn't.	Ne, ni bilo.
He'll love that.	To mu bo všeč.
Me too, he says.	Jaz tudi, pravi.
It happened just a few days ago.	Zgodilo se je le nekaj dni nazaj.
I don't believe any of it.	Ne verjamem nič od tega.
They still weren't home.	Še vedno jih ni bilo doma.
He failed in this.	Pri tem mu ni uspelo.
I just knew it would	Samo vedel sem, da bo
And that was actually a really good thing.	In to je bila pravzaprav res dobra stvar.
You can't tell.	Ne moreš povedati.
So is the boy.	Tako je tudi fant.
But there is much more to it than that.	Vendar je veliko več kot to.
I have to do this.	To moram narediti.
I didn’t want to like what he was doing	Nisem hotel biti všeč, kar je počel
I didn't want to see	Nisem hotel videti
Maybe we were.	Mogoče smo bili.
Maybe because it's so fast.	Mogoče zato, ker je tako hitro.
I haven't seen that.	Tega nisem videl.
And sometimes not even then.	In včasih tudi takrat ne.
I feel better now, much better	Zdaj se počutim bolje, veliko bolje
Only he doesn't come.	Samo on ne pride.
I very much doubt you just ate here	Zelo dvomim, da si samo jedel tukaj
He was sitting in his car.	Sedel je v svoj avto.
I can't believe you haven't seen her here	Ne morem verjeti, da je nisi videl tukaj
I did something right	Nekaj ​​sem naredil prav
It can't be.	Ne more biti.
I'll start you.	Začel te bom.
I had to know what happened	Moral sem vedeti, kaj se je zgodilo
I should do that	To bi moral narediti
I had to know the reason.	Moral sem vedeti razlog.
I want to know everything that's going on	Želim vedeti vse, kar se dogaja
I don’t see why that would be.	Ne vidim, zakaj bi to bilo.
That's a lot.	To je zelo.
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
I'm afraid of you right now	trenutno se te bojim
They could, but they didn't.	Lahko bi, a niso.
I know he’s gone, but it can be done	Vem, da ga ni več, vendar je to mogoče storiti
I haven't heard that yet.	Tega še nisem slišal.
Really too much.	Res preveč.
Actually very good.	Pravzaprav zelo dobro.
Here’s a thing he’s never seen before	Tukaj je stvar, ki je še nikoli ni videl
We must go forward, not back.	Moramo naprej, ne nazaj.
We did a few things.	Naredili smo nekaj stvari.
He's the one who didn't want you here.	On je tisti, ki te ni hotel tukaj.
I've never, ever met anyone like him.	Nikoli, še nikoli nisem srečal nikogar, kot je on.
I mean, no, not at all	Mislim, ne, sploh ne
I told you what it was	Povedal sem vam, kaj je bilo
I could probably get it.	Verjetno bi ga lahko dobil.
Yes, maybe it is.	Da, morda je.
I will do all these things for you	Vse te stvari bom naredil zate
I think that's all.	Mislim, da je to vse.
No one in town could know they were here.	Nihče v mestu ni mogel vedeti, da so tukaj.
I wouldn't have any of that	Nič od tega ne bi imel
I should do that	To bi moral narediti
I have so much to tell him	Toliko mu moram povedati
And he certainly was.	In zagotovo je bil.
I'm glad I found myself	Vesel sem, da sem se našel
I know it's been a very long time.	Vem, da je zelo dolgo.
I didn’t think he had said anything like that before	Nisem si mislil, da je prej rekel kaj takega
That's how it feels.	Tako se počuti.
He just left.	Pravkar je odšel.
That's good to know.	To je dobro vedeti.
I would never say anything like that	Nikoli ne bi rekla kaj takega
Without it, what is it for ?.	Brez tega, za kaj je sploh?.
I have too much money	imam preveč denarja
But it would not be easy to convince her.	Prepričati je pa ne bi bilo lahko.
Someone has already done this.	Nekdo je to že naredil.
I want to tell you these things	Te stvari ti želim povedati
He had enough of that.	Tega je imel dovolj.
I never wanted to do that either	Tudi tega nisem nikoli hotel početi
I've been for quite some time	Sem že kar nekaj časa
She's not the only one.	Ni edina.
I was the good one.	jaz sem bil tisti dober.
It will never be enough for me	Nikoli mi ne bo dovolj
I would do it again.	Še enkrat bi to storil.
He says he is.	Pravi, da je.
What did I do? 	Kaj sem naredil?
'nothing'.	'nič'.
I met him at a party	Spoznal sem ga na zabavi
That's what I thought.	To sem mislil.
This is still happening today.	To se dogaja še danes.
I don't think it ever will	Mislim, da nikoli ne bo
He's in his room.	V svoji sobi je.
I'm a good boy now.	Zdaj sem dober fant.
Maybe you know something, but maybe you don't.	Mogoče kaj veš, mogoče pa ne.
As soon as he did, it was obvious.	Takoj ko je to storil, je bilo očitno.
This is not a game.	To ni igra.
It wasn't always like that.	Ni bilo vedno tako.
I just want you back	Samo nazaj te želim
I don't think he knew anything.	Mislim, da ni vedel ničesar.
I'm sure I would.	Prepričan sem, da bi.
It's so nice to come home.	Tako lepo je priti domov.
However, this never happened.	Vendar se to nikoli ni zgodilo.
I will tell.	Povedal bom.
I didn’t know where, how, he lives.	Nisem vedel, kje, kako, živi.
I'm glad he's back.	Vesel sem, da se je vrnil.
It didn't and still doesn't.	Ni in še vedno ne.
Because we went together.	Ker sva šla skupaj.
We're pretty sure we know who it is.	Prepričani smo, da vemo, kdo je to.
However, this will obviously never happen.	Vendar se to očitno nikoli ne bo zgodilo.
A man like you and me	Človek kot ti in jaz
And he was right in what he said.	In imel je prav, kar je povedal.
When he's here.	Ko je tukaj.
I really didn't even want him	Res si ga niti nisem želela
He is.	Ves on.
I really needed that	To sem res potreboval
You know, someone lost their life.	Veste, nekdo je izgubil življenje.
I don’t know how they did it.	Ne vem, kako so to naredili.
I heard about it.	Slišal sem za to.
I think that's a good thing	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar
You have to believe me on this.	To mi moraš verjeti.
I just didn’t say anything	Preprosto nisem rekel ničesar
I think we did it today.	Mislim, da smo to storili danes.
I could find out why.	Lahko bi našel zakaj.
I mean, hard.	Mislim, težko.
We just don't know.	Samo ne vemo.
I haven't really seen him since.	Od takrat ga res nisem videl.
That's more.	To več.
I can't do anything else	Ne morem nič drugega
I just know you would	Samo vem, da bi
Everyone knew, but no one saw.	Vsi so vedeli, a nihče ni videl.
It wouldn't be easy.	Ne bi bilo lahko.
Why are you.	Zakaj si.

I said he was fine and he was	Rekel sem, da je v redu in je bil
I also spoke with him.	Z njim sem tudi govoril.
There is a way.	Obstaja način.

That was never a problem.	To nikoli ni bil problem.
And it’s not as hard as it used to be.	In to ni več tako težko, kot je bilo nekoč.
I think we should be here soon	Mislim, da bi morali biti kmalu tukaj
It's more like you said.	Bolj je tako, kot si ti rekel.
He's probably right.	Verjetno ima prav.
I mean the .	Mislim na .
In fact, it is.	Pravzaprav je tako.
It's always better to be prepared.	Vedno je bolje biti pripravljen.
You are absolutely right.	Imaš popolnoma prav.
I can't do that to her	Tega ji ne morem storiti
That's all.	Je vse.
I really can't say more about that	O tem res ne morem povedati več
He found none of this.	Nič od tega ni našel.
We have enough.	Imamo dovolj.
You like it.	Všeč ti je.
That's how we have to stay.	Tako moramo ostati.
I've never met him, but he must be	Nikoli ga nisem srečal, a mora biti on
I just didn’t know how he was going to do it	Samo nisem vedel, kako bo to naredil
It seemed simple enough.	Zdelo se je dovolj preprosto.
I didn't hear him come home.	Nisem ga slišal, da je prišel domov.
I didn’t want to say that much	Nisem hotel povedati toliko

I really liked them.	Zelo so mi bili všeč.
I couldn't be alone.	Nisem mogel biti sam.
And that's me.	In to sem jaz.
I was right, too.	Tudi jaz sem imel prav.
All he could ask was.	Vse, kar je lahko vprašal, je bilo.
But even that is common.	A tudi to je običajno.
I was behind it then.	Takrat sem bil za tem.
I am and always will be your friend	Jaz sem in vedno bom tvoj prijatelj
I will never say again.	Nikoli več ne bom rekel.
I am interested in	Zanima me
Lots and lots.	Veliko in malo.
I couldn't take it anymore.	Nisem je mogel več.
Either way you.	Tako ali tako ti.
I could also work at a.	Lahko bi tudi delal pri a.
It was there right away.	Takoj je bilo tam.
I understand what you mean.	Razumem, kaj misliš.
I asked what was wrong	Vprašal sem, kaj je narobe

I hope you are very happy	Upam, da boš zelo vesel
I need something more	Potrebujem nekaj več

I'm not afraid of you either	Tudi jaz se te ne bojim

Maybe, but not enough.	Morda, a ne dovolj.
He knows this, but he doesn’t know how he knows it.	To ve, vendar ne ve, kako to ve.

It's not right for you.	Ni pravi zate.
It seemed so simple.	Zdelo se je tako preprosto.
I didn't say anything more about it	Nič več nisem rekel o tem
I think you may be thinking something wrong, my friend	Mislim, da morda misliš nekaj narobe, prijatelj
Everything is gone now.	Vse zdaj ni več.
I think you know that	Mislim, da to veš
I have no one left.	nikogar nimam več.
In fact, it was.	Pravzaprav je bilo.
I can't go back there	Ne morem nazaj tja
You got the job.	Dobil si službo.
All right, fine.	V redu, dobro.
You really should leave.	Res bi morala oditi.
But I think we are doing well	Mislim pa, da nam gre dobro
I wasn’t really happy about that	Nisem bil res vesel tega
Which it certainly was.	Kar je to zagotovo bilo.
That was what he saw that day.	To je bilo tisto, kar je videl tisti dan.
I shouldn't have done that	Ne bi smel narediti tako
You brought him back.	Vrnil si ga.
I loved swimming there	Všeč mi je bilo plavati tam
I couldn't do that to him	Tega mu nisem mogel storiti
That seemed very wrong to me.	To se mi je zdelo zelo narobe.
We've been together ever since.	Od takrat sva skupaj.
I haven’t had anything to do with it since.	Od takrat nisem imel nič s tem.
I expected so much.	Toliko sem pričakoval.
I will come to help you.	Prišel ti bom po pomoč.
He hasn't been there in years.	Tam že leta ni bil.
Nobody said anything for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa nihče ni rekel ničesar.
I didn't want to go to school	Nisem hotel iti v šolo
And that's okay too.	In tudi to je v redu.
I mean really.	Mislim res.
I could sit down.	Lahko bi sedel.
I wish everyone could see it	Želim si, da bi ga lahko vsi videli
But you did what you had to do.	Vendar ste naredili to, kar ste morali storiti.
I'm actually scared of home	Pravzaprav se bojim domov
He probably won't come back either.	Verjetno se tudi ne bo vrnil.
He liked me.	Všeč sem mu bil.
I hope yours is as good as mine	Upam, da je tvoj tako dober kot moj
It's like nothing else.	Ni kot nič drugega.
I would know if I had	Vedel bi, če bi imel
!! 	!
I will tell you what happened to me.	Povedal vam bom, kaj se mi je zgodilo.
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni več.
We never saw him again.	Nikoli več ga nismo videli.
Now everything is someone else's problem.	Zdaj je vse problem nekoga drugega.
Sometimes I feel better.	Včasih se počutim bolje.
Something like.	Nekaj ​​kot.
I wasn’t sure what he was going to do	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj bo naredil
I couldn’t believe this was happening again	Nisem mogel verjeti, da se to spet dogaja
I am very happy.	Zelo sem vesel.
I think she would like that	Mislim, da bi ji bilo to všeč
I wouldn’t do anything else	Ne bi delal ničesar drugega
I haven't seen her here yet	Tukaj je še nisem videl
I knew we would never see him again.	Vedel sem, da ga ne bomo nikoli več videli.
I feel much better	Počutim se veliko bolje
I still am today	Še danes sem
They were and are.	Bili so in so.
Apparently I haven't found anything yet	Očitno še nisem nič našel
I know her better now	Zdaj jo bolje poznam
It seemed more people.	Zdelo se je več ljudi.
I hope so.	upam, da bo.
I hope it was more than that.	Upam, da je bilo več kot to.
You mean to do it.	Misliš to storiti.
I’ve never felt this way about anyone	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil do nikogar
I wish you luck in this	Želim ti srečo pri tem
I want to know all this	Vse to želim vedeti
I didn't need help	Nisem potreboval pomoči
Not so good.	Ne tako dobro.
And you too.	In tudi ti.
I don’t know how long it actually was.	Ne vem, koliko časa je bilo pravzaprav.
I shouldn't have done that.	Tega ne bi smel storiti.
I want to talk about it.	Rad bi govoril o tem.
I didn't get that for her	Tega ji nisem dobil
That was a lot of work.	To je bilo veliko dela.
This is not yet the case.	To pa še ni tako.
We have and will continue to do so.	Imamo in tako bomo še naprej.
It's not what it is.	Ni to kar je.
I was lucky with that.	Pri tem sem imel srečo.
I heard or saw nothing	Nič nisem slišal ali videl
As you know, I haven’t been here often	Kot veste, nisem bil pogosto tukaj
I should be gone by then.	Takrat bi moral že oditi.
He didn't need to see that.	Tega mu ni bilo treba videti.
I really don’t know why this happened	Res ne vem, zakaj se je to zgodilo
And there is no money for that.	In za to ni denarja.
It is something he will give his life for.	Je nekaj, za kar bo dal življenje.
It wasn't the first time.	Ni bilo prvič.
I really wanted to see you today	Danes sem te res želel videti
Because they haven't for years.	Ker že leta niso.
I heard you came last night	Slišal sem, da si prišel sinoči
There is nothing behind it.	Za tem ni ničesar.
I'm really afraid of that	Tega se res bojim
I really want you, but it wouldn't be right	Zelo si te želim, a ne bi bilo prav
I wasn’t sure about that	Nisem bil prepričan o tem
You should leave sooner	Moral bi oditi prej
We are lucky and fortunate.	Imamo srečo in srečo.
This is a well.	To je dobro.
Right now,.	Takoj zdaj,.
I know it won't be easy	Vem, da ne bo lahko
She did nothing.	Nič ni storila.
I don't know why	Ne vem pa zakaj
That's it.	To je to.
You never know.	Nikoli ne veš.
We have work to do.	Imamo dela.
He is my friend.	On je moj prijatelj.
All my life.	Vse svoje življenje.
I knew all about not being alone	Vedel sem vse o tem, da nisem sam
I didn't like that either	Tudi meni to ni bilo všeč
I still need more time	Še vedno potrebujem več časa
Does anyone know if this still exists ?.	Ali kdo ve, če to še obstaja?.
I know what he was trying to do	Vem, kaj je poskušal
I worked too hard	Preveč sem delal
If something were to happen to you.	Če bi se vam kaj zgodilo.
I see you felt right at home	Vidim, da si se počutil kot doma
I couldn't tell her either	Tudi jaz ji nisem mogel povedati
Mine too.	Moj tudi.
I like to know where you are.	Všeč mi je, da vem, kje si.
I mean, it really wasn’t enough, it wasn’t enough	Mislim, res ni bilo dovolj, ni bilo dovolj
Will buy more.	Bo kupil več.
If it weren't for her.	Če ne bi bila.
And that was all he tried to be.	In bilo je vse, kar je poskušal biti.
There is nothing more we can do.	Nič več ne moremo narediti.
I wish I was there	Želim si, da bi bil tam
In fact, no one does.	Pravzaprav tega ne počne nihče.
You really should see someone	Res bi moral nekoga videti
I wanted to talk to him.	Želel sem govoriti z njim.
So I hope so	Tako upam, da bo
She didn't know he was there.	Ni vedela, da je tam.
I didn't expect it	Nisem pričakoval
These should be easy to do.	Te je treba preprosto narediti.
That was hard for me to believe	To mi je bilo težko verjeti
I knew he knew more.	Vedel sem, da ve več.
Maybe I have a job for you	Morda imam za vas službo
I really believe in that.	Res verjamem v to.
She will want to know where he went.	Želela bo vedeti, kam je odšel.
I learned this early	To sem se naučil zgodaj
I don't know why that is.	Ne vem zakaj je tako.
I thought there was a lot more	Mislil sem, da je veliko več
I have to tell you this.	To ti moram povedati.
I haven’t lost anyone before	Prej nisem izgubil nikogar
I knew it, but I didn’t like it.	Vedel sem, a mi ni bilo všeč.
I never do that.	tega nikoli ne počnem.
I found you.	Našel sem te.
I didn't know anyone was here	Nisem vedel, da je kdo tukaj
I'm not afraid anymore.	ne bojim se več.
Not even that long.	Niti ne tako dolgo.
That would not happen.	To se ne bi zgodilo.
I just wanted someone else out there, not you, because	Želel sem samo nekoga drugega tam, ne tebe, ker
I can't help myself, really	Ne morem si pomagati, res
I've known him for years.	Poznam ga že leta.
Everyone wants something.	Vsak si nekaj želi.
The thing is, he said we don’t have to go.	Stvar je v tem, je rekel, da nam ni treba iti.
I just want to make sure it's okay	Želim se samo prepričati, ali je v redu
I left very quickly	Zelo hitro sem odšel
He also has nothing to do with what he did to us.	Prav tako nam ni nič, kar je naredil z nami.
I think she likes it	Mislim, da ji je to všeč
That’s actually a good thing.	To je pravzaprav dobra stvar.
Life is hard.	Življenje je težko.
It was so simple	Bilo je tako preprosto
I didn’t know what to think.	Nisem vedel, kaj naj si mislim.
I asked him if it was true	Vprašal sem ga, ali je res
I didn’t know what else we could do	Nisem vedel, kaj bi še lahko naredili
I can't go on like you	Ne morem naprej kot ti
I knew what needed to be done	Vedel sem, kaj je treba narediti
He is still like a child.	Še vedno je kot otrok.
what you did.	kar si naredil.
I had to make sure it was true	Moral sem se prepričati, da je res
Just like with me.	Tako kot pri meni.
He knows everything that has happened and will happen.	Ve vse, kar se je zgodilo in se bo zgodilo.
Someone said something.	Nekdo je nekaj rekel.
It's okay with us !.	Pri nas je v redu!.
We were there together.	Tam sva bila skupaj.
It's better.	Je bolje.
None of us knew what to do.	Nihče od nas ni vedel, kaj storiti.
I will do that.	To bom naredil.
i will really do anything for you	res bom naredil vse zate
I couldn’t believe it was all happening	Nisem mogel verjeti, da se vse to dogaja
He told me.	Mi je povedal.
It seemed simple.	Zdelo se je preprosto.
I waited, just like you said	Čakal sem, tako kot si rekel
I haven’t felt that way in a long time	Že dolgo se nisem tako počutil
I will find you and you will help me	Našel te bom in ti mi boš pomagal
I don’t think any of that was.	Mislim, da nič od tega ni bilo.
And she has been for a long time.	In že dolgo je bila.
I want to know about what's going on	Želim vedeti o tem, kar se dogaja
We will love it.	Všeč nam bo.
It wasn't true.	Ni bilo res.
He may not have children.	Morda ne bo imel otrok.
Not now.	Zdaj ne.
There are few of them, really.	Malo jih je, res.
They did what they had to.	Naredili so, kar so morali.
I'm not at home.	Nisem doma.
I mean, he's a really good guy	Mislim, res je dober fant
I completely understand	popolnoma razumem
I want to be something more for you	Želim biti nekaj več zate
I just wasn’t ready for it	Preprosto nisem bil pripravljen na to
And it can go either way.	In lahko gre tako ali tako.
He really thought he was going to die.	Res je mislil, da bo umrl.
I didn't like that either.	Tudi to mi ni bilo všeč.
I know it won't.	Vem, da ne bo.
It may not work.	Morda ne bo uspelo.
It's not what you think.	Ni to, kar misliš.
I know about everything	vem o vsem
That's not much.	To ni veliko.
I was there that day	Ta dan sem bil tam
This is not always true.	To ni vedno res.
I was so tired and needed some time alone	Bil sem tako utrujen in potreboval sem nekaj časa sam
Or just, you know, here.	Ali samo, saj veste, tukaj.
I just wanted to see him	Hotel sem ga samo videti
Don't tell anyone.	Nikomur ne povej.
That is to say, it is.	Se pravi, da je.
No one had.	Nihče ni imel.
I had to tell him.	Moral sem mu povedati.
I didn't even meet her	Sploh je nisem srečal
I could do something.	Lahko bi nekaj naredil.
They were simply gone.	Preprosto jih ni bilo več.
He was right about that.	V tem je imel prav.
I want to do it here	Želim to narediti tukaj
I don’t know what he’s doing either.	Tudi jaz ne vem, kaj dela.
I would do it myself.	Sam bi ga naredil.
After all this, I have to believe something	Po vsem tem moram nekaj verjeti
Or, if he did, he waited a long time.	Ali, če je, je dolgo čakal.
Not after what happened.	Ne po tem, kar se je zgodilo.
I knew right away what it was	Takoj sem vedel, kaj je
I don't know when that will be.	Ne vem kdaj bo to.
I wouldn't admit it	Jaz tega ne bi priznal
I don't know much.	ne vem veliko.
And we may never be.	In morda nikoli ne bomo.
Not everyone is like you.	Niso vsi kot ti.
Me and Dad.	Jaz in oče.
You never know.	Nikoli ne veš.
I couldn’t help but wonder why	Nisem mogel kaj, da se ne bi vprašal zakaj
My problem is to do it.	Moj problem je to narediti.
I've never had that before	Tega še nikoli nisem imel
I wish we could, but we can't	Želim si, da bi lahko, a ne moremo
I mean, nothing happened.	Mislim, nič se ni zgodilo.
I never wanted that for you	Tega ti nikoli nisem želel
I was waiting for that day	Čakal sem na ta dan
From tomorrow morning.	Od jutri zjutraj.
We loved that.	To nam je bilo všeč.
He's still not home.	Še vedno ni doma.
I love when more needs to be done	Všeč mi je, ko je treba narediti več
I've never seen him do that before	Še nikoli ga nisem videl, da bi to storil
There is nothing we can do for these people.	Za te ljudi ne moremo nič.
He came up with it.	Prišel je do tega.
It wasn't that.	Ni bilo to.
I thought that was good	Mislil sem, da je to dobro
Maybe I was good sometimes	Morda sem bil včasih dober
You should know.	Morala bi vedeti.
I forgot about time	Pozabil sem na čas
I love being here	Zelo rad sem tukaj
I understand why he did what he did	Razumem, zakaj je naredil to, kar je naredil
Looks like you had a few of them tonight.	Videti je bilo, da ste jih imeli nekaj nocoj.
So he went there.	Zato je šel tja.
And that just didn’t seem right.	In da se preprosto ni zdelo prav.
I shouldn’t have to do anything	Ne bi mi bilo treba storiti ničesar
I think it's me	Mislim, da sem jaz
That was a good thing.	To je bila dobra stvar.
And I still wouldn't.	In še vedno ne bi.
A lot of time.	Veliko časa.
Better than fine.	Bolje kot v redu.
We know where he lives.	Vemo, kje živi.
I have no doubt he will come alone	Ne dvomim, da bo prišel sam
There is nothing there for you.	Tam ni nič zate.
We have a lot of time.	Imamo veliko časa.
My work is not beautiful.	Moje delo ni lepo.
Maybe not.	Mogoče ne bi.
He doesn't say that at all	On tega sploh ne govori
I'm for.	sem za.
And nobody thinks there's anything wrong with that.	In nihče ne misli, da je s tem kaj narobe.
We have to do that.	To moramo storiti.
You can .	Ti lahko .
I've never felt this way before	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil
I knew something like this was going to happen	Vedel sem, da se bo zgodilo kaj takega
I have it and so can you	Jaz ga imam in lahko tudi ti
He didn't do that.	Tega ni storil.
I believe you all know that	Verjamem, da to vsi veste
I believe in so and so	Verjamem v tako in tako
It just isn't there right now.	Trenutno ga preprosto še ni.
He loved working here.	Rad je delal tukaj.
It could be neither right nor wrong	Ne bi mogel biti niti prav niti narobe
I forgot to tell him	Pozabil sem mu povedati
I was no longer sure if any of this was true	Nisem bil več prepričan, če je kaj od tega res
You should be home	Moral bi biti doma
But I wanted to go with him	Vendar sem hotel iti z njim
There's something wrong with him.	Nekaj ​​ni v redu z njim.
It’s hard to move on.	Težko je iti naprej.
They are gone.	Ni jih več.
Now I fully understand	Zdaj popolnoma razumem
That's right.	To imaš prav.
We have to move on.	Moramo iti naprej.
I know where we've been	Vem, kje smo bili
I will return home now.	Zdaj se bom vrnil domov.
The child was ready.	Otrok je bil pripravljen.
I never want to see you again	Nikoli več te ne želim videti
You're doing so well.	Tako dobro ti gre.
We have to do something.	Nekaj ​​moramo narediti.
He didn't go out.	Ni šel ven.
I hope that will be long enough	Upam, da bo to dovolj dolgo
Because it has to be.	Ker mora biti.
It's serious.	Resno je.
I love it, man.	Všeč mi je, človek.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisem mogel verjeti.
I think you would really like it	Mislim, da bi ti bilo res všeč
This reason is as follows.	Ta razlog je naslednji.
I don’t want it to be the first time.	Ne želim, da bi bil prvič.
I had to do better.	Moral sem biti boljši.
I just wanted to talk to you a little bit	Samo malo sem hotel govoriti s tabo
I did it for the first time	Prvič sem naredil
I thought this would be the right time to do it	Mislil sem, da bo to pravi čas za to
You will do that, he said.	To boš naredil, je rekel.
I lost him.	izgubil sem ga.
They were like us.	Bili so kot mi.
I'm a lot of things	sem veliko stvari
I really liked it	Res mi je bila zelo všeč
But I'll give you that	Vendar ti bom dal to
It looked like he was going to help.	Videti je bilo, kot da bo pomagal.
And it’s not just about the hotel.	In ne gre samo za hotel.
No one is after.	Nihče ne gre za.
Everything was wrong with me.	Z mano je bilo vse narobe.
He didn't come back.	Ni se vrnil.
I didn't work on it	Nisem delal na tem
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
He wasn't there either.	Tudi njega ni bilo.
I don't need you yet	ne potrebujem te še
I thought he might be right	Mislil sem, da ima morda prav
That's true.	To je res tako.
Probably because his father died.	Verjetno zato, ker mu je oče umrl.
I really was.	Res sem bil.
But it wasn't long.	Vendar ni bilo dolgo.
I didn't say that.	Tega nisem rekel.
I thought they would	Mislil sem, da bodo
And nobody wants that.	In tega si nihče ne želi.
I still don’t know how it happened.	Še vedno ne vem, kako se je zgodilo.
I didn't want to know	nisem hotel vedeti
He didn't want to go with me.	Ni hotel iti z mano.
It really happens.	Res pride do tega.
Maybe you could too.	Mogoče bi lahko tudi ti.
We had an easy life.	Imeli smo lahko življenje.
I know a lot of people.	Poznam veliko ljudi.
That's right.	Tako je prav.
They did everything right	Vse so naredili prav
I knew what it was	Vedel sem, kaj je to
He came to me.	Prišel je do mene.
If only I were here.	Ko bi le bil tukaj.
I thought they would	Mislil sem, da bodo
I'm sorry if it is	Žal mi je, če je
I couldn't help anyone.	Nikomur nisem mogel pomagati.
I'm pretty tired of it.	Precej sem utrujen od tega.
It's just there.	Samo tam je.
He was right.	Imel je prav.
I don't need to know.	Ni mi treba vedeti.
I didn't tell her anything.	Nič ji nisem povedal.
We'll see.	Bomo videli.
We've been together a long time.	Dolgo sva bila skupaj.
That's better.	Tako je bolje.
I got it.	Dobil sem ga.
Nothing seemed to help.	Zdelo se je, da nič ne pomaga.
I could sit there all day	Lahko bi sedel tam ves dan
My friend is here.	Moj prijatelj je tukaj.
Maybe we should.	Mogoče bi morali.
She didn't know where she lived.	Ni vedela, kje živi.
I worked here	Delal sem tukaj
He didn't say that.	Tako ni rekel.
That's all .	To je vse .
we will be there.	tam bomo.
He couldn't believe what he saw.	Ni mogel verjeti, kaj je videl.
I won't know until tomorrow	Ne bom vedel do jutri
And that.	In to.
He saw me.	Videl me je.
It's hard to think.	Težko bi si mislil.
I just didn’t want to be in this place.	Preprosto nisem hotel biti na tem mestu.
There are so many more.	Še toliko jih je.
I could do that all day	To bi lahko delal ves dan
I will never die	Nikoli ne bom umrl
I didn't hear what he said	Nisem slišal, kaj je rekel
I had a lot of them.	Veliko sem jih imel.
Maybe I have something here	Mogoče imam nekaj tukaj
I would give you something.	Dal bi ti nekaj.
You did nothing.	Nič niste storili.
It shouldn't even be there.	Sploh ne bi smel biti tam.
You are here and you are not here.	Tukaj si in te ni tukaj.
Does anyone know if there is a way to do this.	Ali kdo ve, če obstaja način za to.
I don't know how good you are from there.	Ne vem, kako si od tam dober.
I was glad to see him.	Vesel sem bil, da sem ga videl.
I don't like that.	To mi ne gre.
Obviously I didn't want to	Očitno nisem hotel
I want to see where he's going	Želim videti, kam gre
All day, every day.	Ves dan, vsak dan.
They will be together again.	Spet bodo skupaj.
I'm really glad you're all here	Res sem vesel, da ste vsi tukaj
I would definitely have one.	Zagotovo bi ga imel.
We all knew.	Vsi smo vedeli.
You didn't say anything.	Nič nisi rekel.
He didn't even have a home.	Ni imel niti doma.
But I haven't done that yet	Tega pa še nisem počel
I just can't tell you why yet	Samo še ne morem ti povedati zakaj
I've known him for a long time	Poznam ga že dolgo
Here's the problem.	Tukaj je problem.
That's how it was here.	Tako je bilo tukaj.
We didn't know where.	Nismo vedeli kam.
I didn't know he was coming here	Nisem vedel, da bo prišel sem
It has to be your own	To mora biti svoje
I only know what it is	Poznam samo tisto, kar je
I really didn't know	res nisem vedel
The game is played as follows.	Igra se igra na naslednji način.
You can be alone.	Lahko si sam.
That might be right.	To je morda prav.
I haven't seen you or talked to you	Nisem te videl ali govoril s tabo
I never said it would be easy	Nikoli nisem rekel, da bo lahko
A game that is life itself	Igra, ki je življenje samo
But he knew it couldn't be.	A vedel je, da to ne more biti.
That she liked it.	Da ji je bilo všeč.
I know that well enough	To vem dovolj dobro
I know what you mean.	Vem kaj misliš.
I heard it myself once	Enkrat sem jo tudi sam slišal
We know so much.	Toliko vemo.
So he likes it well.	Zato je dobro všeč.
I wasn’t good enough for that	Nisem bil dovolj dober za to
The more he does, the better.	Več ko naredi, bolje.
I really knew that	To sem res vedel
I don't think that's true.	Mislim, da to ni res.
It happened that way.	Zgodilo se je tako.
I wished that wouldn’t happen	Želel sem si, da se to ne bi zgodilo
They had too many to see.	Preveč so jih imeli za videti.
It's not easy.	Ni preprosto.
Because it is so.	Ker je tako.
He didn't have much time.	Ni imel veliko časa.
Something just happened.	Nekaj ​​se je pravkar zgodilo.
He was here, but he wasn't now.	Bil je tukaj, zdaj pa ni bil.
Things like that.	Stvari kot to.
There was nothing else I could do	Nisem mogel storiti ničesar drugega
I know too many things	Preveč stvari vem
I would love it.	Všeč bi mi bilo.
I knew that well enough	To sem dovolj dobro vedel
Not so.	Ni tako.
So be it.	Pa naj bo tako.
But I never knew that	Nikoli pa tega nisem vedel
He liked what he saw.	Všeč mu je bilo, kar je videl.
It's not doing you any good.	To ti ne dela dobro.
It's not you.	To nisi ti.
I just want to be here	Samo želim biti tukaj
I really want to go home	res si želim domov
I didn't know what he meant.	Nisem vedel, kaj je mislil.
That was a long time ago.	To je bilo že dolgo nazaj.
He can go home now.	Zdaj lahko gre domov.
I mean, it was like work, work, work	Mislim, bilo je kot delo, delo, delo
I've known them for years	Poznam jih že leta
Maybe it’s not even a question of money.	Morda to niti ni vprašanje denarja.
I left.	odšel sem.
My boyfriend left me last week.	Prejšnji teden me je moj fant pustil.
I wasn’t the only one, there were a lot of us	Nisem bil edini, veliko nas je bilo
I could see everything.	Lahko sem videl vse.
I never heard back.	Nikoli nisem slišal nazaj.
I need to know right away	Moram vedeti takoj
He couldn't help himself.	Ni si mogel pomagati.
Or something else.	Ali pa kaj drugega.
I'm not interested in anything else.	Za kaj drugega me prav nič ne zanima.
Maybe more than it would be if it weren’t so.	Morda več, kot bi bil, če ne bi bilo tako.
I wasn’t ready for that	Nisem bil pripravljen na to
Something needs to be done about this.	Glede tega je treba nekaj narediti.
He really lives.	Res živi.
It's just me now.	Zdaj sem samo jaz.
I gave him something.	Nekaj ​​sem mu dal.
I stayed for a while and helped her	Nekaj ​​časa sem ostal in ji pomagal
I want to see a little more	Želim si videti malo več
Very good indeed.	Res zelo dobro.
Not a problem now.	Zdaj ni problem.
I had a hard time finding them	Težko sem jih našel
That's until tonight.	To je do nocoj.
I still wasn't allowed to speak	Še vedno nisem smel govoriti
I have to tell him.	Moram mu povedati.
I am not going.	ne grem.
It won't be after that.	Po tem ne bo več.
He just wanted to go home.	Hotel je samo domov.
It never is and never will be.	Nikoli ni in nikoli ne bo.
I really like it	Zelo mi je všeč
They may not.	Morda ne bodo.
I think it might have been something else	Mislim, da je bilo morda kaj drugega
I waited a long time	Dolgo sem čakal
That's why we are.	Zato smo.
I really don’t know him well, at all	Res ga ne poznam dobro, sploh
I shouldn't leave like that	Ne bi smel tako oditi
And just be with me.	In samo biti z mano.
He didn't eat.	Ni jedel.
There are few of them today.	Danes jih je malo.
Not for sure.	Ne zagotovo.
I'll be here.	Tukaj bom.
I knew what she was going to say	Vedel sem, kaj bo rekla
Now I still get along well with him	Zdaj se še vedno dobro razumem z njim
I have you all the time	Te imam ves čas
He loved me too.	Tudi mene je imel rad.
I know it's not that simple	Vem, da ni tako preprosto
I'm not sure about that yet.	O tem še nisem prepričan.
He's a good boy.	On je dober fant.
I didn't see them around town	Nisem jih videl po mestu
I just want your money	Želim samo tvoj denar
He is there, here.	On je tam, tukaj.
But I didn't know he was the only one	Nisem pa vedel, da je edini
And he thinks that's a good thing.	In misli, da je to dobra stvar.
I succeeded quickly	Hitro mi je uspelo
It’s so hard to see.	To je tako težko videti.
I just was.	Pravkar sem bil.
How could they know? 	Kako so lahko vedeli?
I wonder how he feels about that	Sprašujem se, kako se počuti zaradi tega
I’m not sure anything can be done about it at all.	Nisem prepričan, da se glede tega sploh lahko kaj naredi.
I need to know that my baby will be fine	Moram vedeti, da bo moj otrok v redu
But we knew nothing.	Vendar nismo vedeli ničesar.
But we have to be sure.	Vendar moramo biti prepričani.
We are not your problem.	Mi nismo tvoj problem.
В.	V.
I will always find you	vedno te bom našel
I didn't do that.	tega nisem storil.
He was telling me something.	Nekaj ​​mi je govoril.
This is actually quite difficult.	To je pravzaprav precej težko.
He knows what to do.	On ve, kaj storiti.
But I know you a little better	Vendar te poznam malo bolje
I would too	Tudi jaz bi bil
You know it will.	Saj veš, da bo.
I have a question for you	imam vprašanje zate
Everything a child will need.	Vse, kar bo otrok potreboval.
I was probably lucky to get this	Verjetno sem imel srečo, da sem to dobil
I think we are alone	Mislim, da smo sami
I also heard what happened last night	Tudi jaz sem slišal, kaj se je zgodilo sinoči
I never thought we would	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da bomo
I told you that	To sem ti povedal
I know, it's a little early.	Vem, še malo je zgodaj.
I wanted the baby to live	Želela sem, da otrok živi
I have been for over a few years.	Sem že več kot nekaj let.
That if.	To če.
It would be better not to know.	Bolje bi bilo, da ne bi vedel.
I immediately told him what had happened	Takoj sem mu povedal, kaj se je zgodilo
I often wonder what he intends to do now	Pogosto se sprašujem, kaj namerava zdaj
I knew that all along	To sem vedel ves čas
My dad is too, for that matter.	Tudi moj oče je, glede tega.
I have little and I want a lot	Imam malo in želim veliko
You could say he didn't want to tell me.	Lahko bi rekel, da mi ni hotel povedati.
I can't tell him what to do	Ne morem mu povedati, kaj naj naredi
I hope someone can help me with this.	Upam, da mi lahko kdo pomaga pri tem.
The day has come.	Dan je prišel.
I've never been there before	še nikoli nisem bil tam
I really don't.	jaz res ne.
He could see it, but he couldn’t get to it.	Lahko ga je videl, vendar ni mogel priti do tega.
There was no more time.	Ni bilo več časa.
I will call them this afternoon.	Poklical jih bom danes popoldne.
I didn’t know what was going on with me	Nisem vedel, kaj se dogaja z mano
I wasn’t expecting anyone today	Danes nisem pričakoval nikogar
That's it.	Ta je.
I'm not afraid of you	ne bojim se te
If that were the case, I would be without him.	Če bi bilo tako, bi brez njega.
It's because of you.	To je zaradi tebe.
That seems to be the case.	Zdi se, da je tako.
Just for us.	Samo za nas.
I have to be alone for a while	Nekaj ​​časa moram biti sam
I'm going alone, which is fine.	Grem sam, kar je v redu.
Just what it is.	Samo tisto, kar je.
It will be better that way.	Bolje bo tako.
Let someone help.	Naj nekdo pomaga.
She knew, well enough.	Vedela je, dovolj dobro.
So they did what they did.	Zato so naredili, kar so.
I believe you know that.	Verjamem, da to veš.
I really couldn’t believe it.	Res nisem mogel verjeti.
They had more money, it's true.	Imeli so več denarja, res je.
It's easy.	Lahko je.
That still needs to be done.	To je še treba narediti.
It is possible and it will not say.	Mogoče je in ne bo rekla.
I was no longer sure how he felt about me	Nisem bil več prepričan, kako se počuti do mene
I think you will love this hotel	Mislim, da vam bo ta hotel všeč
I still haven't seen anything	Še vedno nisem videl ničesar
I didn’t know what was wrong	Nisem vedel, kaj je narobe
I don’t see why they didn’t do that.	Ne vidim, zakaj tega niso storili.
This cannot be helped.	Temu se ne da pomagati.
I am very good at this	V tem sem zelo dober
It wasn't nice.	Ni bilo lepo.
Very.	Zelo.
We have to go.	Moramo iti.
This is so true.	To pa je tako res.
I couldn’t believe he was really doing this	Nisem mogel verjeti, da res to počne
Nothing will happen here.	Tukaj se ne bo nič zgodilo.
Should not.	Ne bi smeli.
However, I was glad she was not here at the moment.	Vendar sem bil vesel, da je trenutno ni tukaj.
I wouldn't do that then	Tega takrat ne bi storil
I loved being a teacher	Rad sem bil učitelj
I can't believe he found this	Ne morem verjeti, da je našel to
You can never know.	Nikoli ne moreš vedeti.
However, this may not be the case with you.	Vendar pri vas morda ne bo tako.
I'm afraid of everything	vsega se bojim
I love everything about it.	Všeč mi je vse na tem.
It's hard for everyone.	Težko je za vse.
Tomorrow if you want.	Jutri, če želiš.
I'll be there soon	Kmalu bom tam
I learned a lot of things	Naučil sem se veliko stvari
You wanted to leave.	Hotel si oditi.
We're fine.	Nam gre v redu.
Maybe he moved on.	Mogoče je šel naprej.
He wanted it for me.	Želel ga je zame.
I haven't heard from you in a while	Že nekaj časa te nisem slišal
I didn’t see her out much	Nisem jo videl veliko ven
It was hard to believe what he told me.	Težko je bilo verjeti, kaj mi je rekel.
I just want you to know something	Samo želim, da nekaj veš
I have everything today.	Danes imam vse.
I know more than a few.	Vem več kot nekaj.
Just like she knew she would.	Tako kot je vedela, da bo.
I know you're not lost	Vem, da se nisi izgubil
I heard what you said.	Slišal sem, kaj si rekel.
However, I have never done that before	Vendar tega še nikoli nisem storil
He says he can do something for me.	Pravi, da mi lahko naredi nekaj.
You have a lot to do.	Veliko moraš narediti.
Nice to have you there.	Lepo, da ti je tam uspelo.
We were together.	Bila sva skupaj.
I was very surprised	Bil sem zelo presenečen
And so it has.	In tako ima.
I know you know that	Vem, da to veš
Or really not.	Ali pa res ne.
He ate them.	On jih je.
Nothing happened.	Nič se ni zgodilo.
I still wasn’t sure	Še vedno nisem bil prepričan
I couldn’t get there fast enough	Od tam nisem mogel dovolj hitro
Just once.	Samo enkrat.
We know this to be true.	To vemo, da je res.
He didn't talk much.	Ni veliko govoril.
Regardless of the way it's supposed to be.	Ne glede na način, ki naj bi bil.
But it didn't.	Vendar se ni.
It wasn't true that he could see.	Ni bilo res, da je lahko videl.
You should be there and you know it	Moral bi biti tam in ti to veš
I liked it too.	Tudi meni je bilo všeč.
I was amazed at how much better he was than the other.	Bil sem presenečen, koliko je boljši od drugega.
I didn't even have them.	Sploh jih nisem imel.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
The time was never right.	Čas ni bil nikoli pravi.
And a child.	In otrok.
I knew it really wasn’t my thing	Vedel sem, da to res ni moja stvar
I'm sure he will.	Prepričan sem, da bo.
You saw it too.	Tudi ti si videl.
Someone has to see them.	Nekdo jih mora videti.
I want to see you there	Želim te videti tam
I believe he still has it	Verjamem, da jo še ima
I told him a few things without telling him anything	Povedal sem mu nekaj stvari, ne da bi mu nekaj povedal
Must be.	Mora biti.
Maybe it's just the right time.	Morda samo še pravi čas.
But she certainly knew it was nothing more.	A zagotovo je vedela, da ni nič več.
I've never seen him before	Še nikoli ga nisem videl
I was angry at everything, at everything	Bil sem jezen na vse, na vse
It doesn't seem right.	Ne zdi se prav.
I used to really like that	Včasih mi je bilo to zelo všeč
I never went.	nikoli nisem šel.
I was there just for help	Tam sem bil samo po pomoč
I didn't ask for that	Tega nisem prosil
I didn’t know how to do it	Nisem vedel, kako to narediti
I had to see you one more time no matter what.	Še enkrat sem te moral videti, ne glede na vse.
Now I see you did it	Zdaj vidim, da ste to storili
I don't think you ever know	Mislim, da nikoli ne veš
I know he didn't recognize me	Vem, da me ni priznal
I succeeded without help	Uspelo mi je brez pomoči
I didn’t do much of that back then	Tega takrat nisem veliko naredil
Tell her it had to be done.	Povej ji, da je bilo to treba storiti.
Definitely.	Zagotovo.
I don't need to say much.	Ni mi treba veliko govoriti.
I will never succeed.	nikoli mi ne bo uspelo.
He was never there.	Nikoli ni bil tam.
I hope you won't either	Upam, da tudi ti ne boš
Please help here.	Tukaj prosim za pomoč.
I don't know if you know that.	Ne vem, če to veš.
Not the way you think.	Ne na način, kot misliš.
And it hasn't for a while.	In nekaj časa ni.
I know little about it	Malo vem o tem
The only way to do it was quickly.	Edini način za to je bil hitro.
I will do right	naredil bom prav
They knew why they were there.	Vedeli so, zakaj so tam.

I don't need money.	Ne potrebujem denarja.
I didn’t like any of that	Nič od tega mi ni bilo všeč
Not why, just how.	Ne zakaj, samo kako.
I'm tired of it.	Utrujen sem od tega.
He told me they were lucky.	Rekel mi je, da so imeli srečo.
I was an angry man myself.	Sam sem bil jezen človek.
I think we have something here	Mislim, da imamo nekaj tukaj
In fact, more and more people are saying just that.	Pravzaprav vse več ljudi govori prav to.
I want you to have this	Želim, da imaš to
I knew that right away.	To sem takoj vedel.
I didn’t do anything to make it so	Nisem naredil ničesar, da bi bil tako

I have it, it's all mine	To imam, to je vse moje
He's really sorry.	Res mu je žal.
I really don't feel well.	Res se ne počutim dobro.
The reason was because she wanted to go to school.	Razlog je bil, ker je želela v šolo.
I don't know, we'll just have to see.	Ne vem, samo videti bomo morali.
This one will be a little more.	Ta bo malo več.
It's still you.	Še vedno si ti.
And you didn't know.	In nisi vedel.

I wanted to do it myself.	Hotel sem to narediti sam.

I'm not good.	Nisem dober.
I never did.	Nikoli nisem.
He didn't stay long.	Ni ostal dolgo.
I had enough for both	Za oba sem imel dovolj
Like in a good way.	Kot na dober način.

I was glad he came	Vesel sem bil, da je prišel
And yet it is.	Pa vendar je.
I don't think he was like him	Mislim, da ni bil kot on
Then he refuses to know.	Takrat noče vedeti.

It still works.	To še vedno dela.
Come on, go.	Pride, gre.
Someone else is with him.	Z njim je še nekdo.
I started to get even angrier	Začel sem biti še bolj jezen

And if not, he will play more even then.	In če ne, bo tudi takrat igral več.

Here too.	Tudi pri nas.
I have everything.	imam vse.
I’m not doing this to make myself feel better.	Ne počnem tega, da bi se počutil bolje.
They were never when he needed them.	Nikoli niso bili, ko jih je potreboval.
A little about it, a little about it	Malo o tem, malo o tem
I just asked you for time	Samo vprašal sem te za čas
I can't even be your friend now	Zdaj ne morem biti niti tvoj prijatelj

He wants to see me.	Želi me videti.
I never do that.	Tega nikoli ne počnem.
It seems about right, boy.	Zdi se, da je prav, fant.
It was not as it is now.	Ni bilo tako, kot je zdaj.
I just wish you would stay and eat with me	Želim si samo, da bi ostal in jedel z mano

He spoke it like a child.	Govoril ga je kot otrok.

I didn't think so.	Nisem mislil tako.

I should have told you sooner	Moral bi ti povedati prej

I didn't want anyone to know	Nisem hotel, da bi kdo vedel
But I have to say that	Moram pa to povedati
You never know what you're going to get.	Nikoli ne veš, kaj boš dobil.

I think I should do it	Mislim, da bi moral to storiti

But it's not like anyone got it back.	Ni pa, da bi jo kdo dobil nazaj.
I don't think anyone expected that at the time	Mislim, da takrat tega nihče ni pričakoval
Just for tonight.	Samo za nocoj.
Who else knows how long I've been here	Še kdo ve koliko časa sem še tukaj
It seems to be the same here.	Zdi se, da je tako tudi tukaj.
I would ask for more children	Prosil bi za več otrok
I haven't seen you in a long time	Dolgo te nisem videl
I can not believe	Ne morem verjeti
He promised me he would.	Obljubil mi je, da bo to storil.
I decided to go home, alone	Odločil sem se, da grem domov, sam
I'm sure everything will be fine	Prepričan sem, da bo vse v redu
I think that should be a good thing	Mislim, da bi to morala biti dobra stvar
And everyone would know why.	In vsi bi vedeli zakaj.
I don't know anything before	Prej ne vem nič
I was just thinking, you know.	Samo mislil sem, veš.
Just do it now.	Samo naredi to zdaj.
I think it will.	Mislim, da bo.
I think we'll see how it goes	Mislim, da bomo videli kako bo
Is it going ?.	Ali gre?.
Life is hard here.	Življenje je težko tukaj.
Feel so good.	Počuti se tako dobro.
But they are not sure.	Niso pa prepričani.
We can't do that.	Tega ne moremo narediti.
Just tell me.	Samo povej.
I've never seen them before	Še nikoli jih nisem videl
I wasn’t sure how to proceed	Nisem bil prepričan, kako naprej
Everyone is a possibility.	Vsak je možnost.
I would do anything to be with you	Vse bi naredil, da bi bil s tabo
I shouldn't have seen him	Ne bi ga smel videti
It's money.	To je denar.
That will be good.	To bo dobro.
He doesn't come home very often.	Domov ne pride prav pogosto.
I wasn’t sure I wanted him to know	Nisem bil prepričan, da želim, da ve
So much seemed wrong with that.	Toliko se je zdelo narobe s tem.
It's like.	Je kot.
He heard tired because he was.	Slišal je utrujen, ker je bil.
I never thought you'd come back	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da se boš vrnil
Or he told me he was.	Ali pa mi je rekel, da je.
I was right about him	Prav sem imel glede njega
But it wasn't always like that.	Ni pa bilo vedno tako.
I know he would say that too.	Vem, da bi tudi on to rekel.
I will do everything for you	jaz ti bom vse
So he says it’s hard.	Zato pravi, da je težko.
I hope it helps you	Upam, da vam je v pomoč
I didn't see well enough	Nisem videl dovolj dobro
For a long time.	Že dolgo časa.
I have reason to believe this is really serious	Imam razlog, da verjamem, da je to res resno
She liked that.	To ji je bilo všeč.
It's probably right.	Verjetno je prav.
Maybe I would do it.	Morda bi to naredil.
it really isn't.	res ni.
Everyone is wrong.	Vsi so narobe.
I really don't need another one.	Drugega res ne potrebujem.
I wouldn’t do that for everyone	Tega ne bi naredil za vse
I wanted the party back.	Hotel sem nazaj zabavo.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žal.
However, much remains to be done	Vendar je treba še veliko narediti
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
I understand you were all together	Razumem, da ste bili vsi skupaj
It's fine now.	Zdaj je v redu.
Lots of them.	Veliko jih.
I will not do that again	Tega ne bom več počel
She was here.	Bila je tukaj.
But it was true what he said.	Vendar je bilo res, kar je rekel.
He felt a little better.	Počutil se je malo bolje.
Not a good day.	Ni dober dan.
I think you put them there	Mislim, da si jih dal tja
No one is surprised.	Nihče ni presenečen.
I wanted him to be afraid of me	Želel sem, da se me boji
There is something wrong here.	Tukaj je nekaj narobe.
I don't want to be here either.	Tudi jaz nočem biti tukaj.
And he's right.	In ima prav.
There or not.	Tam ali ne.
I really wanted to be with you	Res sem hotel biti s tabo
All she said was.	Vse kar je rekla je bilo.
I do not know how.	ne vem kako.
And on and on and on.	In še in še in naprej.
That must be enough.	Mora biti dovolj.
I wasn't so sure.	nisem bil tako prepričan.
I got a little of that too	Tudi jaz sem dobil malo tega
I doubt there will be anything out of this	Dvomim, če bo kaj iz tega
Nothing like that happened here.	Tukaj se ni zgodilo nič takega.
He should have been here earlier	Tukaj bi moral biti prej
I wanted to know who gave them	Želel sem vedeti, kdo jih je dal
He really liked that.	To mu je bilo zelo všeč.
I can't do that, not now	Tega ne morem, ne zdaj
We actually have three of them.	Pravzaprav jih imamo tri.
That's when I wanted to go home	Takrat sem hotel domov
I've been waiting for this for years.	Na to sem čakal leta.
Not so much anymore.	Ne več toliko.
I can't stay here anymore	Ne morem več ostati tukaj
He found her for me.	Našel jo je zame.
I know about that	Vem za to
I still don't see anything	Še vedno ne vidim ničesar
I don’t know how it can be wrong.	Ne vem, kako je lahko narobe.
you gave me everything.	dal si mi vse.
I wasn’t sure how much to tell him	Nisem bil prepričan, koliko bi mu povedal
I think that's a good question.	Mislim, da je to dobro vprašanje.
which is.	kar je.
What if that.	Kaj pa če to.
If not, we have a problem.	Če ne, imamo problem.
He was lucky.	Imel je srečo.
I'll just state the obvious.	Povedal bom le očitno.
And it will be difficult.	In težko bo.
I've never heard her speak for a long time	Še nikoli je nisem slišal dolgo govoriti
Yesterday again.	Včeraj spet.
I haven't heard from you in a while.	Že nekaj časa te nisem slišal.
The child was alone.	Otrok je bil sam.
Tell her to come out.	Povej ji, naj pride ven.
I think everyone has their own	Mislim, da ima vsak svoje
Which it was.	Kar je bilo.
It is very, very difficult.	Zelo, zelo težko je.
I wish it was, but no	Želim si, da bi bilo, vendar ne
He says you did it.	Pravi, da ti je uspelo.
It was him or us.	Bil je on ali mi.
I loved this thing.	Všeč mi je bila ta stvar.
I know what he's doing	Vem kaj počne
It takes time.	Potrebuje čas.
No, we didn't.	Ne, nismo.
They would.	Imeli bi.
Something seemed wrong.	Nekaj ​​se je zdelo narobe.
I don't want anything.	nočem nič.
Maybe more.	Mogoče še več.
You don’t have to do this yourself.	Tega vam ni treba storiti sami.
There was no time for that.	Za to ni bilo časa.
I don't know where to go	Ne vem, kam naj grem
This is happening now.	To se dogaja zdaj.
Illberightback.	Takoj bom nazaj.
That's what I want to do.	To želim narediti.
I really needed that money	Res sem potreboval ta denar
I will be able to meet	se bom lahko srečal
And it doesn't get any better.	In to ni nič bolje.
I want to know what you think	Želim vedeti, kaj mislite
Now I wonder about everything.	Zdaj se sprašujem o vsem.
I've never been so angry	Še nikoli nisem bil tako jezen
Maybe we are.	Mogoče smo.
That could be a problem.	To bi lahko bil problem.
I would buy it just to have it.	Kupil bi ga samo, da bi ga imel.
You don't know what you saw.	Ne veš, kaj si videl.
I just really like it	Samo zelo mi je všeč
But she had to help him.	Vendar mu je morala pomagati.
That would be a little nice.	To bi bilo malo lepo.
But there would be more.	Vendar bi bilo še več.
Tom wasn't sure what to do.	Tom ni bil prepričan, kaj naj stori.
It wouldn't be right.	Ne bi bilo prav.
I really didn’t have it all back then	Takrat res nisem imel vsega skupaj
He really did what he had to be.	Res je naredil, kar je moral biti.
Can anyone please help.	Ali lahko kdo prosim pomaga.
He told me that.	To mi je povedal.
No one else was seen.	Nikogar drugega ni bilo videti.
No more time.	Nič več časa.
I don't know when and how	Ne vem kdaj in kako
That's all he can do.	To je vse, kar lahko naredi.
You and your father.	Ti in tvoj oče.
He clearly failed to do so.	Tega mu očitno ni uspelo.
But I would never tell her that	Vendar ji tega ne bi nikoli povedal
I would be happy.	jaz bi bil vesel.
It will work.	To bo uspelo.
If anything is good.	Če je kaj dobro.
I hope you do what you want too.	Upam, da bo tudi ti naredil, kar si želiš.
I wish I could do that.	Rad bi to lahko storil.
That never happened	To se nikoli ni zgodilo
I knew what it looked like	Vedel sem, kako je videti
I saw him the day after he got it	Videl sem ga dan po tem, ko ga je dobil
It was time for work.	Čas je bil za delo.
I think I should go home now	Mislim, da bi morala zdaj iti domov
That was not what he needed at the moment.	To ni bilo tisto, kar je trenutno potreboval.
She wanted me here.	Želela me je tukaj.
I won't always be here	Ne bom vedno tukaj
What he wanted.	Kar je hotel.
He can't talk.	Ne more govoriti.
A lot of people talk about it	Veliko ljudi govori o tem
I will not say for sure.	Ne bom zagotovo rekel.
I was really angry now	Zdaj sem bil res jezen
I wouldn't want to know that.	Tega ne bi želel vedeti.
We have a few days.	Imamo nekaj dni.
My thoughts are mine.	Misli so moje.
That was really all.	To je bilo res vse.
I know this is hard for you to believe	Vem, da ti je to težko verjeti
It wasn't a good day.	Ni bil dober dan.
And therefore.	In zato.
I know you don't like it.	Vem, da ti ni všeč.
I don't like them myself	Sam jih ne maram
Because there aren't any.	Ker jih ni.
I could see.	Lahko sem videl.
Now, maybe they are.	Zdaj, morda so.
I think you're right too.	Mislim, da imaš tudi ti prav.
I hope you have some time	Upam, da imaš nekaj časa
i still have it.	še vedno ga imam.
I did everything wrong	Vse sem naredil narobe
I couldn’t see him, but he was there	Nisem ga mogel videti, vendar je bil tam
He can help you.	On ti lahko pomaga.
You, me, we can't do it alone.	Ti, jaz, tega ne moremo sami.
They weren’t that there could be more.	Niso bili, da bi lahko bilo več.
I let myself believe it	Pustil sem si verjeti v to
I won't, that's for sure	Ne bom, to je zagotovo
Maybe you meant someone else.	Mogoče si mislil nekoga drugega.
but I'll be fine	vendar bom v redu
You were like a boy.	Bil si kot fant.
We are here now and we will be gone soon.	Zdaj smo tukaj in kmalu nas ne bo več.
They are still there.	Še vedno so tam.
I wonder what he says.	Zanima me, kaj pravi.
I had to see him again	Moral sem ga spet videti
There is.	Ima.
I actually really like it.	Pravzaprav mi je zelo všeč.
Everything is so hard.	Vse je tako težko.
I worked for that money.	Delal sem za ta denar.
So it is here and so it is here.	Tako je tukaj in tako kot tukaj.
And no, you couldn't.	In ne, nisi mogel.
I can't go on without you	Ne morem naprej brez tebe
I'll help you here.	Tukaj ti bom pomagal.
I’m not sure what the reason is	Nisem prepričan, kaj je razlog za to
I just had to see	Moral sem le videti
I really like it here.	Zelo mi je všeč tukaj.
I was talking.	Govoril sem.
Make it look good.	Naj bo videti dobro.
I didn't want to talk anymore	Nisem hotel več govoriti
You have to come.	Moraš priti.
I have to tell you.	moram ti povedati.
What will happen?	Kaj se bo zgodilo?
And he was ready for that.	In na to je bil pripravljen.
I came yesterday	Sem prišel včeraj
Very almost time.	Zelo skoraj čas.
We can't see.	Ne moremo videti.
That's something.	To je nekaj.
I asked him what was going on	Vprašal sem ga, kaj se dogaja
In fact, this is wrong.	Pravzaprav je to narobe.
That's what it's about.	Za to gre.
She didn't like that.	To ji ni bilo všeč.
I just have never seen him make the wrong decision	Preprosto ga še nikoli nisem videl, da bi se odločil narobe
I decided not to tell him anything at the moment.	Odločil sem se, da mu trenutno ne bom ničesar rekel.
No one ever told us anything.	Nihče nam ni nikoli nič rekel.
He knows this, and he doesn't seem to care either.	On to ve in zdi se, da ga tudi to ne zanima.
Maybe I understand him better than you	Morda ga razumem bolje kot ti
I really didn't like it	Res mi ni bilo všeč
out of there.	ven od tam.
I was waiting for him	Čakal sem ga
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ne vem, kaj je narobe z mano.
I asked her what she was doing	Vprašal sem jo, kaj počne
There's someone there.	Tam je nekdo.
And that's all good.	In vse to je dobro.
So we did.	Tako smo tudi naredili.
It's very good for me.	Zame je zelo dobro.
I didn't think so.	Nisem mislil tako.
Whether it’s good or not.	Ne glede na to, ali je to dobro ali ne.
I came to help me	Prišel sem, da bi mi lahko pomagal
I know who you are now	Vem, kdo si zdaj
And he lives.	In živi.
Just tell me that.	Samo povej mi to.
I'm sure he'll be fine by now.	Prepričan sem, da bo zdaj že v redu.
No one would say anything.	Nihče ne bi rekel ničesar.
I didn't like that at all	To mi sploh ni bilo všeč
There is no work either.	Tudi dela ni.
She didn't even know where they were.	Sploh ni vedela, kje so.
I haven't been for so long	Tako dolgo nisem
I don’t know much about it.	Ne vem veliko o tem.
No one knew for sure.	Nihče ni vedel zagotovo.
I want you to be sure what will happen next	Želim, da ste prepričani, kaj se bo zgodilo naprej
Apparently he had been there before.	Očitno je bil tam že prej.
She has to do it herself.	To mora narediti sama.
Not a very good job.	Ni zelo dobro delo.
It really isn't.	Res ni.
I haven't had that in a while	Tega že nekaj časa nisem imel
There was no one there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar.
I think the sooner the better	Mislim, da prej, tem bolje
But I was never angry about that	Na to pa nisem bil nikoli jezen
Now that’s hard.	Zdaj je to težko.
I wonder how often this has happened.	Sprašujem se, kako pogosto se je to zgodilo.
Even better.	Tudi bolje.
I don't want him there.	Nočem ga tam.
I knew it would be that way	Vedel sem, da bo tako
This is not happening yet.	To se še ne dogaja.
I could have such a beautiful life.	Lahko bi imel tako lepo življenje.
He won.	Zmagal je.
I wanted to know why this happened	Hotel sem vedeti, zakaj se je to zgodilo
They shouldn't be.	Ne bi smeli biti.
That will be difficult.	To bo težko.
I would like to know.	Rad bi vedel.
I wouldn't expect that	Ne bi pričakoval
I'm glad you're fine.	Vesel sem, da ste dobro.
We will not do that.	Tega ne bomo storili.
And that really happened.	In to se je res zgodilo.
I don't know everything.	ne vem vsega.
Never again than now	Nikoli več kot zdaj
In fact, quite a bit.	Pravzaprav kar malo.
Not that she was.	Ne da je bila.
I was not a teacher	Nisem bil učitelj
I knew there was no one else here	Vedel sem, da tukaj ni nikogar drugega
I have too much work to do	Imam preveč dela
I wanted to move on, but I didn’t know how	Želel sem iti naprej, a nisem vedel, kako
That was work.	To je bilo delo.
Something is going on.	Nekaj ​​se dogaja.
I'm almost there.	Skoraj sem tam.
There were more of them.	Bilo jih je več.
I really expected you to	Res sem pričakoval, da boš
I think I should go	Mislim, da bi morala iti
That needs to be done.	To je treba storiti.
Today, I am much more convinced of that.	Danes sem v to še veliko bolj prepričan.

We know that now.	To vemo zdaj.
I will be your friend	jaz bom tvoj prijatelj

I also have a book about this.	O tem imam tudi knjigo.
I can go for it	Lahko grem za to
Everything would be better.	Vse bi bilo bolje.
It was good money back then.	Takrat je bil dober denar.
I wish I was still here	Želim si, da bi bil še vedno tukaj

I'll do it myself	Sam bom to naredil
I am not and I will not.	nisem in ne bom.
It was really like he knew.	Res je bilo, kot da bi vedel.
I think it's that simple.	Mislim, da je tako preprosto.
I wish I could meet them	Želim si, da bi jih spoznal
Nobody comes anymore.	Nihče več ne pride.
I completely understand	popolnoma razumem
They are always together.	Vedno sta skupaj.
I still couldn't believe it	Še vedno nisem mogel verjeti
I would know more.	Vedel bi več.
They were there for a while.	Tam so bili nekaj časa.
I am ready when my time comes	Pripravljen sem, ko pride moj čas

I didn't know where.	Nisem vedel kam.

I hope she's doing well	Upam, da ji gre v redu
He waited a little.	Malo je čakal.
I had to get out of there.	Moral sem oditi od tam.
Me too.	Tudi jaz.
I think we can be much better.	Mislim, da smo lahko veliko boljši.
If it's possible.	Če je to mogoče.

And yet he was not.	Pa vendar ni bil.
You wanted me.	Želel si me.
The time is always now.	Čas je vedno zdaj.
And so it must do.	In tako mora storiti.
I never admitted anything	Nikoli nisem ničesar priznal
It's not that simple.	Ni tako preprosto.
No one knew who was right.	Nihče ni vedel, kdo ima prav.
Actually, it's not.	Pravzaprav ni.
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
I did not know.	nisem vedel.
I wish we had him here	Želim si, da bi ga imeli tukaj
It can't be like that.	Ne more biti tako.
It cannot be said.	Ni mogoče povedati.
So we should go there.	Zato bi morali iti tja.
I will be back for you	vrnil se bom zate
I couldn't tell anyone about it	O tem nisem mogel nikomur povedati
I feel good again in the morning.	Zjutraj se spet dobro počutim.
To this day, he has never done so.	Do danes tega še nikoli ni storil.
I mean, you seriously can't	Mislim, resno ne moreš

I didn't want to be home	Nisem hotel biti doma
He died for us.	Umrl je za nas.
There is nothing without it.	Brez tega ni nič.
I am very good.	Jaz sem zelo dober.
And no one saw anything.	In nihče ni ničesar videl.

Not so.	Ni tako.
He didn’t want it to be easy.	Ni hotel, da bi bilo lahko.
And now you're here.	In zdaj si tukaj.
And here too.	In tudi tukaj.
He said for sure.	Rekel je zagotovo.
I told you everything would be fine	Rekel sem ti, da bo vse v redu
I'm angry because you never told me	Jezen sem, ker mi nikoli nisi povedal
Again, that's fine.	Še enkrat, to je v redu.
Let him live.	Naj živi.
So was my father.	Tako je bil tudi moj oče.
I'm glad for you if it worked out	Vesel sem zate, če je uspelo
He has nothing.	Nič nima.
It was good for everyone.	Vsem je bilo dobro.
I mean, obviously it needs to be done.	Mislim, očitno je treba to storiti.
I hope this helps you	Upam, da vam je to v pomoč
I mean, obviously it needs to be done	Mislim, očitno je treba to storiti

I am very happy about it.	Zelo sem vesel tega.
He is never tired.	Nikoli ni utrujen.
I would never be like him	Nikoli ne bi bil kot on
I hope this helps.	Upam, da to pomaga.

He looked surprised.	Videti je bil presenečen.
I need someone who knows what he's doing	Potrebujem nekoga, ki ve, kaj počne
I think she liked it more than I did	Mislim, da ji je bilo to bolj všeč kot meni
I have enough for both.	Za oba imam dovolj.

That's pretty fast.	To je precej hitro.
So I wanted to tell him everything	Tako sem mu želel vse povedati
I was very angry.	Bil sem zelo jezen.
We still are.	Še vedno smo.
I've been waiting for this	Čakal sem na to
We probably are.	Verjetno smo.
Probably not even that long.	Verjetno niti ne tako dolgo.
I knew that was not true	Vedel sem, da to ni res
I've never seen anyone do anything like that	Še nikoli nisem videl, da bi kdo naredil kaj takega
I'm sure he'll be fine	Prepričan sem, da bo v redu

I didn’t think he had said anything like that before.	Nisem si mislil, da je prej rekel kaj takega.
What to do when something goes wrong.	Kaj storiti, ko gre kaj narobe.
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
I know you want kids	Vem, da si želiš otroke
But I think you're good for it	Mislim pa, da si dober za to
I talked to him.	Govoril sem z njim.
I will call you.	Poklical te bom.
There’s not much I can do about it.	Glede tega ne morem veliko storiti.
But I didn't die	Nisem pa umrl
And there I found what I think is right.	In tam sem našel tisto, kar se mi zdi prav.
I don’t know what’s going on about that	Ne vem, kaj se dogaja glede tega
I'm not your teacher.	Nisem tvoj učitelj.
To die soon.	Da bi kmalu umrl.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Ne morem, ne morem, ne morem.
That's all.	Samo to je.
I’m not sure anyone really knows.	Nisem prepričan, da kdo res ve.
I know it's not you.	Vem, da nisi ti.
Everything that can exist will be.	Vse, kar lahko obstaja, bo.
I think that's why he called you	Mislim, da te je zato poklical
Now or ever.	Zdaj ali kdaj.
When he didn’t have it, we saw what happened.	Ko je nima, smo videli, kaj se je zgodilo.
It's going again.	Spet gre.
I didn’t know what was going on	Nisem vedel, kaj se dogaja
what would you do	kaj bi naredil
I wasn’t sure it would ever be complete.	Nisem bil prepričan, da bo kdaj popolnoma.
No, that would be yesterday.	Ne, to bi bilo včeraj.
I was nothing anymore	Nisem bil več nič

I'm not sure how much.	Nisem prepričan za koliko.
I never went home.	Nikoli nisem šel domov.
I thought it was pretty hard	Mislil sem, da je kar težko
I never really wanted that	Nikoli si tega res nisem želel
No more than him.	Ne več kot on.
Person.	Oseba.
And we did.	In to smo storili.
Not so now.	Zdaj ni tako.
That's earlier.	To je prej.
Now I had to get out of there	Zdaj sem moral oditi od tam
I know you did it	Vem, da si to naredil
I didn’t see that ever happen	Nisem videl, da bi se to kdaj zgodilo
It's happened to all of us.	Zgodilo se je vsem nam.
I don't like it at all	Sploh mi ni všeč
Very few people seem to do this.	Zdi se, da to počne zelo malo ljudi.
You have them, ”she said.	Imaš jih,« je rekla.
I'm sure he is.	Prepričan sem, da je.
It's not easy.	To ni preprosto.

He ate.	Jedel je.
No one was like him.	Nihče ni bil kot on.
I didn't expect it from you	Nisem pričakoval od tebe

I would say it was mine	Rekel bi, da je bil moj

He didn't know what else he could do.	Ni vedel, kaj bi še lahko naredil.
I want to help her.	Rad bi ji pomagal.
I could do that forever	To bi lahko delal za vedno
I asked him again and he said he didn’t know	Še enkrat sem ga vprašal in je rekel, da ne ve
But it was not necessary.	Vendar ni bilo treba.
Yes, they will.	Da, bodo.
I'm here, "he said.	Tukaj sem,« je rekel.
I'm going home.	Grem domov.
Probably that's what's wrong with me.	Verjetno je to tisto, kar je narobe z mano.
All normal.	Vse običajno.
I never liked this one enough to learn it	Ta mi ni bil nikoli tako všeč, da bi se ga naučil

I really didn’t know what to think	Res nisem vedel, kaj naj si mislim
They were there.	Tam so bili.
He really wasn't.	Res ni bil.
He was gone now.	Zdaj ga ni bilo.
Not even your father could do that.	Tega ni mogel niti tvoj oče.
What came before that.	Kaj je bilo pred tem.
I mean, it really wasn't much.	Mislim, res ni bilo veliko.
I haven't even gone home yet	Niti domov še nisem šel
He needs help.	Potrebuje pomoč.
He could have died anyway	Tako ali tako bi lahko umrl
And you would be too.	In tudi ti bi bil.
I would be really good at that.	V tem bi bil res dober.
There are a lot of people.	Veliko ljudi ima.
But I can't help you	Vendar ti ne morem pomagati
No, you can't go there.	Ne, ne moreš tja.
I was still surprised.	Še vedno sem bil presenečen.
Now, like, we’ve had this every day for over a week.	Zdaj, kot, več kot teden dni imamo to vsak dan.
This is not easy.	To ni lahko.
I wish I could see that	Želim si, da bi to videl

I can fully understand that	To lahko popolnoma razumem

I don't wish this on anyone.	Tega ne želim nikomur.
I expected that, but not so soon	To sem pričakoval, a ne tako kmalu
From now on.	Od zdaj naprej.
Here today is not tomorrow.	Tukaj danes ni jutri.
Someone out there might be able to help.	Nekdo tam bi lahko pomagal.
I could also do something.	Lahko bi tudi kaj naredil.
My reason for the question is this.	Moj razlog za vprašanje je ta.
Bits are not.	Biti niso.
we have it.	imamo ga.
It should, but maybe not.	Moral bi, a morda ne.
In a.	In a.
I know all about what you did	Vem vse o tem, kaj si naredil
We are nothing.	Mi smo nič.

Now I understand better, just a little.	Zdaj razumem bolje, samo malo.

I didn't even want to see you	Sploh te nisem hotel videti
I know it's going to happen	Vem, da se bo zgodilo
I believe that to be true	Verjamem, da je to res
I haven't come back since	Od takrat se nisem več vrnil
I'm almost as surprised as you	Sem skoraj tako presenečen kot ti
With all this, I feel so good	Ob vsem tem se počutim tako dobro
And now he's gone.	In zdaj ga ni več.
He heard something.	Nekaj ​​je slišal.
This was not difficult to do.	To ni bilo težko narediti.
I didn't ask for it.	Nisem prosil za to.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Vendar je videti, kot da temu ni tako.
It's still there.	Še vedno je tam.
As it was.	Kot je bilo.
They were there so fast.	Tako hitro so bili tam.
I thought you saw them	Mislil sem, da si jih videl
Just tell him.	Samo povej mu.
I didn't want to know.	Nisem hotel vedeti.
I like to see that.	To rad vidim.
This may be because they are.	To je lahko zato, ker so.
I know what's going on	vem kaj se dogaja

I was glad it wasn't	Vesel sem bil, da ni

It's just me.	Samo jaz sem.
It felt very good to me	Zdelo se mi je zelo dobro

Tell us.	Povej nam.

I just said I could	Rekel sem samo, da lahko
You should see her again	Moral bi jo videti še enkrat
I would love to sit for you.	Rad bi sedel zate.
And it wasn't.	In ni bilo.
He can't help himself.	Ne more si pomagati.
And it didn’t look like he had been there that long.	In ni bilo videti, kot da bi bil tam tako dolgo.
I have more than enough	Imam več kot dovolj
I already know what you wanted to say	Že vem, kaj si hotel povedati
I hope it goes well.	Upam, da gre dobro.
I didn’t even know that much about it	Niti nisem vedel toliko o tem
I will never do that again	Nikoli več tega ne bom storil
I didn't make it	Tega mi ni uspelo
I'm going to go out a little today	Danes bom šel malo ven
It is also true.	Prav tako je res.
I didn’t see her do that	Nisem je videl, da je to storila
I see her more than you	Vidim jo bolj kot ti
I gave you everything.	dal sem ti vse.
I would never let her know she was coming to me	Nikoli ji ne bi dal vedeti, da pride do mene
I can’t help but wonder what he’s thinking	Ne morem si pomagati, da se ne bi vprašal, kaj si misli
I didn’t want to talk about it.	Nisem hotel govoriti o tem.
I thought it was possible	Mislil sem, da je to mogoče
We did everything we could.	Naredili smo vse, kar smo lahko.
I shouldn't have told you that	Tega ti ne bi smel povedati
He said very little.	Povedal je zelo malo.
But that's what she said.	Ali tako je rekla.
I asked and she said it was okay	Vprašal sem in rekla je, da je v redu
I know you'll like it	Vem, da ti bo všeč
I wonder why he did it	Sprašujem se, zakaj je to storil
I didn't see or hear anything	Ničesar nisem videl ali slišal
I was just waiting for a reason	Čakal sem le na razlog
I didn't see anyone else.	Nikogar drugega nisem videl.
Nobody saw him.	Nihče ga ni videl.
It worked.	Uspelo je.
I'm not good for anything else.	Nisem dober za nič drugega.
I told you that's all we had	Rekel sem ti, da je to vse, kar smo imeli
There was something.	Nekaj ​​je bilo.
I can't say what he thinks	Ne morem povedati, kaj si misli

I shouldn't be here.	Ne bi smel biti tukaj.
I'm afraid to tell you	Bojim se ti povedati

I wanted you to know.	Hotel sem, da veš.
I expected so much	Toliko sem pričakoval
I could tell things were wrong.	Lahko bi rekel, da stvari niso v redu.
I wouldn't say yes, I wouldn't say no.	Ne bi rekla da, ne bi rekla ne.
Without money.	Brez denarja.
I want to be better for both of you	Želim biti boljši za oba
She just told me to do it.	Preprosto mi je rekla, da to počne.
About everything.	O vsem.
He doesn't really do anything.	Pravzaprav nič ne naredi.
We had nothing.	Nič nismo imeli.
I heard him talk about it	Slišal sem ga govoriti o tem
I will not do that.	tega ne bom storil.
Nothing happened without it.	Nič se ni zgodilo brez tega.
Maybe he didn't have it.	Mogoče ga ni imel.
You're not.	Nisi.
He did it.	On je to počel.
Maybe I don't even like it	Morda mi ni niti všeč
That was better.	To je bilo bolje.
You can do it that way, but not quickly.	Lahko tudi tako, a ne na hitro.
I didn't want to see them	Nisem jih hotel videti
I may not know tomorrow.	Jutri morda ne bom vedel.
And he doesn't have it.	In ga nima.
I wasn’t sure how to tell him that	Nisem bil prepričan, kako bi mu to povedal
So the man wondered what was going on.	Zato se je človek vprašal, kaj se dogaja.
I want to be that person too	Tudi jaz želim biti ta oseba
I've never seen her like that before.	Še nikoli je nisem videl tako.
I didn't do that for me	Tega nisem naredil zame
You've told me that often enough.	To si mi povedal dovolj pogosto.
Back to you.	Nazaj v vas.
They really are better.	Res so boljši.
That's not how it works.	Tako to ne gre.

He just didn’t know what to do about it.	Preprosto ni vedel, kaj bi glede tega.
For years.	Že leta.
I forgot he doesn't know about you	Pozabil sem, da ne ve zate
Not only that.	Ne samo to.
I wanted to buy everything there	Tam sem hotel vse kupiti
Right is right and wrong is wrong.	Prav je prav in narobe je narobe.
That wasn't for me.	To ni bilo zame.
I called her again	Spet sem jo poklical
The time ahead will only get better.	Čas, ki je pred nami, bo le še boljši.
It never was and never will be.	Nikoli ni bilo in nikoli ne bo.
I can't help you.	Ne morem ti pomagati.
That's all he needed.	To je vse, kar je potreboval.
No, it really isn't.	Ne, res ni.
I didn’t know why he felt that way about me	Nisem vedel, zakaj me je tako počutil
Work, he says.	Delo, pravi.
I was trying to do something like that	Poskušal sem narediti nekaj takega
He is ready instead.	Namesto tega je pripravljen.
No one was right.	Nihče ni imel prav.
I hadn’t learned that yet at the time	Takrat se tega še nisem naučil
I want to see him again.	Želim ga videti še enkrat.
You're really not interested in anything.	Te res nič ne zanima.
I let her.	Pustil sem ji.
I want to talk to him	Rad bi govoril z njim
It was something we knew.	To je bilo nekaj, kar smo vedeli.
You may find it helpful.	Mogoče se vam zdi v pomoč.
That may come.	To morda pride.
I would like to stay.	Rad bi ostal.
I didn't mean anything by that.	Nič nisem mislil s tem.
He's too good.	On je preveč dober.
I can’t believe it’s actually mine	Ne morem verjeti, da je pravzaprav moj
I know you didn't do that	Vem, da tega nisi storil
I doubt that.	Dvomim o tem.
I have never heard of this happening.	Še nikoli nisem slišal, da bi se to zgodilo.

I never made it.	Nikoli mi ni uspelo.
And there we were.	In tam smo bili.
I want everyone alive for a while	Želim, da so vsi živi za nekaj časa

As if that would happen.	Kot bi se to zgodilo.
I should be with you	Moral bi biti s tabo
And sometimes not.	In včasih ne.
I still wasn’t happy about it.	Še vedno nisem bil vesel tega.
No one knew who we were.	Nihče ni vedel, kdo smo.
I did the work myself	Delo sem opravil sam
I would always be angry	Vedno bi bil jezen

That’s when I knew we had to leave	Takrat sem vedel, da moramo oditi

I thought you couldn't be from here.	Mislil sem, da ne moreš biti od tukaj.
I'll see him again and so will you	Še enkrat ga bom videl in tudi ti
No no.	Ne, ne.
I didn’t think the time would come so soon	Nisem si mislil, da bo prišel čas tako hitro

So are we.	Tudi mi smo.
I just decided it couldn't be you	Preprosto sem se odločil, da ne moreš biti ti

I never got it back	Nikoli je nisem dobil nazaj
I came home and nothing seemed good without you	Vrnil sem se domov in nič se mi ni zdelo dobro brez tebe
I went to talk to you, but you weren't there	Šel sem govoriti s tabo, a te ni bilo
I didn't talk about it	Nisem govoril o tem
Actually it was.	Pravzaprav je bilo.
You could say they like each other	Lahko bi rekel, da sta si všeč

How is it there.	Kako je tam.
I would like to see you.	Rad bi te videl.
I want him to be his own man.	Želim, da je sam svoj človek.
It's not serious.	Ni resno.
I don't understand why this is so	Ne razumem, zakaj je temu tako
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
I mean, it's that simple.	Mislim, tako preprosto je.
But it was hard to work with.	A z njim je bilo težko delati.
You know.	Ti veš.
Also very nice.	Tudi zelo lepo.
I didn’t even want to say anything else	Niti nisem hotel, da bi rekel kaj drugega
I didn't hear.	Nisem slišal.
it's true to me.	res mi je.
I called him last night	Sinoči sem ga poklical
I lost too many people	Izgubil sem preveč ljudi
When it happened, it happened very quickly.	Ko se je zgodilo, se je zgodilo zelo hitro.
I asked when the next one was	Vprašal sem, kdaj je naslednji
Maybe there is.	Morda ima.
She always liked that.	To ji je bilo vedno všeč.
I was quite busy there for a while	Tam sem bil nekaj časa kar zaposlen
I played here in the city.	Igral sem tukaj v mestu.
I actually like that I don’t have it.	Pravzaprav mi je všeč, da ga nimam.
I really think so.	res tako mislim.
I hope this will not be difficult	Upam, da to ne bo težko
Very, very true.	Zelo, zelo res.
And for you.	In zate.
She didn't have to.	Ni ji bilo treba.
I need to know what's going on	Moram vedeti, kaj se dogaja
I think that's enough	Mislim, da je to dovolj
It feels.	To se počuti.
I'm glad I helped	Vesel sem, da sem pomagal
That's how you got me.	Tako si me dobil.
But I talked more	Sem pa več govoril
I would love to see that	To bi rad videl
I have not found another like it	Drugega takega nisem našel
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nič narobe s tem.
Now I have something to do	Zdaj imam nekaj za početi
And yet it is.	Pa vendar je.
It will always be that way.	Tako bo vedno.
I want so badly to be with you	Tako zelo si želim biti s tabo
I wanted to stay a little longer	Želel sem ostati še malo
I wouldn’t be surprised if they were together	Ne bi bil presenečen, če bi bila skupaj
I knew it was going to be hard	Vedel sem, da bo težko
Not even to get her back.	Niti da bi jo dobil nazaj.
I love all of you more than life	Vse vas imam rad bolj kot življenje
And yet !.	In vendar!.
I didn't do anything to you	Nič ti nisem storil
He knows it isn't.	On ve, da ni.
Maybe I could.	Mogoče bi le lahko.
I can't even believe what he did to me	Sploh ne morem verjeti, kaj mi je naredil
It really worked.	To je res delal.
You just have to do something.	Samo nekaj moraš narediti.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
I saw it there.	Tam sem videl.
I've had enough of this.	Dovolj imam tega.
I wanted him, everything	Želela sem ga, vsega
I used to and he didn’t come	Včasih sem in on ni prišel
You should talk to him.	Moral bi govoriti z njim.
He's not like us.	Ni kot mi.
And they did.	In to so naredili.
I'm just interested in who you are today	Zanima me samo to, kdo si danes
Maybe we could still.	Mogoče bi še lahko.
He will succeed.	Prav mu bo uspelo.
I didn't want to die yet	Nisem še hotel umrl
I'm ready for that	Na to sem pripravljen
I was surprised, though	Bil sem presenečen, vendar
I have to get there right away	Takoj moram priti tja
He couldn't help himself now.	Zdaj si ni mogel pomagati.
It is now or never.	Zdaj je ali nikoli.
However, this is not the only way.	Vendar to ni edini način.
I asked him what would have happened if he hadn’t	Vprašal sem ga, kaj bi se zgodilo, če ne bi
I thought you were the problem, not me	Mislil sem, da si ti problem, ne jaz
But that hasn't happened yet.	To pa se še ni zgodilo.
I always knew	Vedno sem vedel
I knew it was going to happen	Vedel sem, da se bo to zgodilo
He never knew who he was	Nikoli ni vedel, kdo je
Tell me it's not you.	Povej mi, da nisi ti.
There was nothing that I could do	Nisem mogel narediti ničesar
He liked it very much.	Zelo mu je bilo všeč.
It's simply not possible.	Preprosto ni mogoče.
None of us are.	Nihče od nas ne je.
I couldn't play that either.	Tudi tega nisem mogel igrati.
It was only a matter of time.	Bilo je samo vprašanje časa.
I'll leave it there.	Pustil ga bom tam.
He didn't know if he had time.	Ni vedel, če ima čas.
Maybe it's still about.	Morda še vedno gre za.
I feel for you, friend	Počutim se zate, prijatelj
He let her go, he told her that.	Pustil jo je, to ji je rekel.
Now I know it's a once, not an if.	Zdaj vem, da je enkrat, ne če.
It's too much for me.	Preveč je zame.
In fact, he was.	Pravzaprav je bil.
I just wish it was good	Želim samo, da bi bilo dobro
I wished I had it forever	Želel sem si, da bi imel za vedno
I actually have	Pravzaprav imam
It's not enough.	Ni dovolj.
It wasn't like that with us.	Pri nas ni bilo tako.
It's even better.	Še bolje je.
And everything will be simple.	In vse bo preprosto.
He just does.	On preprosto naredi.
I did it once and I was sorry	Enkrat sem to storil in mi je bilo žal
I’ve never felt this way about anyone else.	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil do nikogar drugega.
I didn’t and I was happy	Nisem in sem bil vesel
I can't for both	Ne morem za oba
I see no one has.	Vidim, da nihče nima.
We have to do it or we won't.	To moramo storiti ali pa ne bomo.
I will only say this once.	To bom rekel samo enkrat.
Do it for you.	Naredi to namesto tebe.
I can't tell you more than that	Več kot to vam ne morem povedati
I've been here before.	Tukaj sem že bil.
I just don't know enough.	Samo ne vem dovolj.
I didn't have time for that anymore	Nisem imel več časa za to
It just seems that way to us.	Samo nam se tako zdi.
I always have a problem with that	Vedno imam težave s tem
That's not it.	Ta ni to.
But he could have said he wanted to come.	Lahko pa je rekel, da želi priti.
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
I won't hear it.	Ne bom slišal.
I heard.	Slišal sem.
You know what you should do.	Veš kaj bi moral storiti.
Father never has time for us.	Oče nikoli nima časa za nas.
I wish there was more of that.	Želim si, da bi bilo tega več.
I wonder where he is	Sprašujem se, kje je
I would see it all again	Vse bi še enkrat videl
I expected to know right away.	Pričakoval sem, da bom takoj vedel.
I know you wanted that	Vem, da si to želel
I don't know anything about that	Nič ne vem o tem
I have everything tonight	Nocoj imam vse
I forgot everything.	Pozabil sem na vse.
That's not a problem.	To ni problem.
And that was not it.	In to ni bilo to.
I want to be me again	Spet želim biti jaz
But I knew it couldn't be that way	Vedel sem pa, da ne more biti tako
I don’t even know how I feel anymore.	Sploh ne vem več, kako se počutim.
That's right.	Tako je.
Time is simply not with us.	Čas preprosto ni z nami.
I believe you have something to tell me.	Verjamem, da mi imaš kaj povedati.
The kid had nothing to do with it.	Otrok ni imel nič s tem.
It was nothing more than talking.	Ni bilo drugega kot govoriti.
I need her to move on	Potrebujem jo, da gre naprej
I mean, that was it.	Mislim, to je bilo.
It doesn't seem to you.	Ne zdi se vam.
Maybe it was true.	Mogoče je bilo res.
Many people, including children.	Veliko ljudi, tudi otrok.
I'll make you something to eat	Naredil ti bom nekaj za jesti
I will not help.	ne bom v pomoč.
I would wait for her	jaz bi jo čakal
I still found myself and all that	Še vedno sem se našel in vse to
As you are now.	Kot si zdaj.
I used to help her with that	Včasih sem ji pomagal pri tem
I hope you really like it	Upam, da ti je res všeč
And here they are.	In tukaj so.
I know it was fast	Vem, da je bilo hitro
You're that man.	Ti si tisti človek.
Tell me more about it.	Povej mi več o tem.
I'm fine here.	tukaj mi je v redu.
They are not the only ones.	Niso edini.
He never talked to me.	Nikoli ni govoril z mano.
No, seriously, do it.	Ne, resno, naredi to.
I don't know anything about that.	Ne vem nič o tem.
He is yours.	On je tvoj.
You should go home	Moral bi iti domov
I want to be completely with you	Želim biti popolnoma s tabo
I wasn't there for you	Nisem bil tam zate
They had none of that.	Nič od tega niso imeli.
I would never allow it	Nikoli ne bi dovolil
I didn’t have to do it alone	Ni mi bilo treba tega narediti sam
I thought it was going to be a really quick job.	Mislil sem, da bo to res hitro delo.
I just never felt right.	Samo nikoli se nisem počutil prav.
And maybe he has.	In morda ima.
I just wasn’t entirely sure what it was	Samo nisem bil popolnoma prepričan, kaj je kaj
There are more.	Več jih je.
You should know you would forget	Moral bi vedeti, da bi pozabil
There will be no more.	Več jih ne bo.
He says he doesn't know.	Pravi, da ne ve.
I haven't seen her yet	Nisem je še videl
More than angry.	Več kot jezen.
I called and spoke quickly	Poklical sem in hitro govoril
I want to be a better person.	Želim biti boljši človek.
Certainly never	Zagotovo nikoli nisem
I mean, he helps me	Mislim, on mi pomaga
I don't care where.	Ne zanima me kje.

It was still there.	Še vedno je bilo tam.
That was hard too.	Tudi to je bilo težko.
I understand how it is	Razumem, kako je to
Not just good.	Ne samo dobro.
If anything, you thought nothing.	Če kaj, se ti je zdelo nič.
I really need to know how to do this	Res moram vedeti, kako to narediti
But even this time is too much.	A tudi ta čas je preveč.
I was sure he would call soon	Prepričan sem bil, da bo kmalu poklical
We didn't see anything wrong.	Nismo videli nič narobe.
None of this I thought so	Nič od tega nisem mislil tako
No, I wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
Tell me what you decided.	Povej mi, kaj si se odločil.
No, no, not us.	Ne, ne, ne mi.
There is a good reason for this.	Za to obstaja dober razlog.
I know this is hard for you right now	Vem, da ti je to trenutno težko
I want to be that person	Želim biti ta oseba
But he's not there now.	Vendar ga zdaj ni tam.
Just like it was.	Tako kot je bilo.
He liked the work.	Delo mu je bilo všeč.
I didn't ask him again	Spet ga nisem vprašal
What just happened.	Kaj se je pravkar zgodilo.
I wanted nothing more than to get out of there.	Nisem hotel nič drugega kot priti od tam.
I don’t seem to see anything at all	Zdi se mi, da sploh ne vidim ničesar
It seems to go to them too.	Zdi se, da gre tudi k njim.
I probably won’t see him anyway	Verjetno ga tako ali tako ne bom videl
I didn't need it.	Nisem ga potreboval.
I didn't know either	Tudi jaz nisem vedel
But he did not die.	Vendar ni umrl.
I wanted to buy them	Hotel sem jih kupiti
I had it made for you	Dal sem ga narediti zate
I think you needed an opportunity, now you have it	Mislim, da si potreboval priložnost, zdaj jo imaš
A question for you.	Vprašanje za vas.
I've never felt this way before	Še nikoli se nisem tako počutil
I would call everyone tomorrow	Jutri bi vse poklical
I knew you'd like it	Vedel sem, da ti bo všeč
I do not know you.	Ne poznam te.
It will be a good time.	Dober čas bo.
You should know that.	To bi moral vedeti.
I didn't see him leave	Nisem ga videl oditi
I worked for it.	Delal sem za to.
That it simply cannot be true.	Da preprosto ne more biti res.
I shouldn't have told him	Ne bi mu smel povedati

Nice to see you here.	Lepo vas je videti tukaj.
This has not happened yet.	To se še ni zgodilo.
I wished none of this would ever happen	Želel sem si, da se nič od tega ne bi nikoli zgodilo

I wouldn't talk to him	Ne bi govoril z njim

He was often seen there.	Tam so ga pogosto videli.
I did it.	Uspelo mi je.
I mean, he was fine	Mislim, bil je v redu
I didn't mean it.	nisem mislil resno.
I would tell you	jaz bi ti povedal
You have everything.	Vse imaš.
There was still something wrong.	Še vedno nekaj ni bilo v redu.
I didn't do anything wrong either	Niti nisem naredil nič narobe

I am very sorry.	Zelo mi je žal.
I wish I wasn't here	Sam si želim, da ne bom tukaj
I was with him.	Bil z njim.

I saw him last night.	Videl sem ga sinoči.

I really didn't want that	Tega si res nisem želel
I am this someone.	jaz sem ta nekdo.

I will continue to go	Še naprej bom šel
I didn't know what he was thinking	Nisem vedel, kaj si misli

He called instead.	Namesto tega je poklical.

Where was it now ?.	Kje je bilo zdaj?.
It seemed long, for sure.	Zdelo se je dolgo, zagotovo.
I would tell you everything.	Vse bi ti povedal.
I don't know what it is.	Ne vem kaj je.

Sometimes I have them	Včasih jih imam
I couldn’t say for sure	Nisem mogel zagotovo povedati
I don't understand yet	Sam še ne razumem
I never really liked it	Nikoli mi ni bil zelo všeč

I always had to do it myself	Vedno sem moral to narediti sam
Only if you're interested.	Samo, če te zanima.
I was ready for it	Bil sem pripravljen na to
He told her she could go back out.	Rekel ji je, da gre lahko nazaj ven.
Seeing that now, it’s very true, you know.	Ko sem to videl zdaj, je to zelo res, veš.
I really want it.	Zelo si ga želim.
I really should have done it last night	Res bi moral to narediti sinoči

Not anymore.	Nič več.
I want you to know everything	Želim, da veš vse
She had to make sure.	Morala se je prepričati.
He doesn't want to, he doesn't need to.	Noče, to mu ni treba.
Maybe I can do something for you.	Morda bom lahko kaj naredil zate.
He won't make it without you.	Brez tebe mu ne bo uspelo.
Tomorrow again.	Jutri spet tam.
I didn't have time for that	Nisem imel časa za to
I've never seen anyone like him	Nikoli nisem videl nikogar, kot je on

I didn't tell him anything else.	Nič drugega mu nisem rekel.
We have to do it now.	To moramo storiti zdaj.
You all are.	Vsi ste.
Not many people know that.	Tega ne ve prav veliko ljudi.
In fact, he never did.	Pravzaprav tega nikoli ni storil.

I saw her.	Videl sem jo.
Life seemed good.	Zdelo se je, da je življenje dobro.

I know you can and you will if you have to	Vem, da lahko in da boš, če boš moral

But that was not the case.	A temu ni bilo tako.
And it was pretty nice.	In bilo je precej lepo.
Maybe because it might be true.	Lahko, ker je morda res.
She had wanted to see him for years.	Že leta ga je želela videti.
I don't think you ever told me a few things	Mislim, da mi nekaj stvari nikoli nisi povedal

No, without knowing more about what was going on.	Ne, ne da bi vedel več o tem, kaj se dogaja.
I have a lot of money	Imam veliko denarja
I didn’t say it often	Nisem rekel pogosto

Much, much better.	Veliko, veliko bolje.
forward.	naprej.
I'm sure there are more.	Prepričan sem, da jih je več.

He has no one.	Nima nikogar.
I wasn't ready to see him yet	Nisem ga še bil pripravljen videti
That's all I have to keep saying	Samo to si moram še naprej govoriti
Working from home is still work.	Delo od doma je še vedno delo.
I had nothing	Nisem imel ničesar
I'll do it tonight	To bom storil nocoj
I want to see who he is	Želim videti, kdo je

And so does my boyfriend.	In moj fant tudi.
You'll know why when you see them.	Ko jih boste videli, boste vedeli zakaj.
I'm going to need some money	Potreboval bom nekaj denarja
I always wanted to see it, but never did.	Vedno sem si ga želel videti, a nikoli nisem.
I thought now was the right time	Mislil sem, da je zdaj pravi čas
I already lost her once.	Enkrat sem jo že izgubil.
We never saw her again.	Nikoli več je nismo videli.
I am interested in.	Zanima me.
I need you to be there with me	Potrebujem te, da si tam z mano
It's not hard enough.	Ni dovolj težko.
Or a problem, or what you have.	Ali problem, ali kaj imaš.
I will definitely do that.	To bom zagotovo naredil.
I think she could make it	Mislim, da bi ji lahko uspelo
I was ready to move on.	Bil sem pripravljen iti naprej.
But for you.	Ali zate.
Actually started doing it.	Pravzaprav začel to početi.
It would be for me.	Zame bi bilo.
I want to know how he feels about it	Želim vedeti, kako se počuti zaradi tega
I almost never go there.	Tja skoraj nikoli ne grem.
I didn't go now	Zdaj nisem šel
I know that for sure.	To zagotovo vem.
I went out.	Odšel sem ven.
I've never heard that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem slišal.
Actually it was.	Pravzaprav je bilo.
But he was not there.	Vendar ga ni bilo.
And so it will continue.	In tako bo še naprej.
We wouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi storili.
We never saw him.	Nikoli ga nismo videli.
I actually feel good	Pravzaprav se počutim dobro
It's okay, really.	V redu je, res.
To be yours.	Da bi bil tvoj.
I've known him my whole life	Poznam ga vse življenje
Nobody's told me that yet.	Tega mi še nihče ni rekel.
He just wondered again.	Samo še enkrat se je vprašal.
I never want to do that again	Tega nikoli več ne želim storiti
I knew who they were and what they were	Vedel sem, kdo so in kaj so
I just worked hard for him	Samo težko sem mu delal
To do this, we will have to do it ourselves.	Da bi to naredili, bomo morali to storiti sami.
I was a child.	Jaz sem bil otrok.
He just went for it.	Samo šel je za to.
I should have told him everything.	Vse bi mu moral povedati.
you can not?	ne moreš?

I like it simply.	Všeč mi je preprosto.
I always have someone who does it for me	Vedno imam nekoga, ki to naredi namesto mene

We will do something about it.	Nekaj ​​bomo storili glede tega.
I could work from home	Lahko bi delal od doma
But they are not the only ones.	Niso pa edini.
I have a lot to do for you	Veliko moram narediti zate
I really wanted to, but I couldn’t	Res sem si želel, a nisem mogel
I just needed the money	Potreboval sem samo denar
I will help you.	Pomagal ti bom.
It's for you.	Za vas je.
He wasn't here.	Ni bil tukaj.
I knew you would.	Vedel sem, da boš.
I really like this man	Ta človek mi je res všeč
I think it would be obvious	Mislim, da bi bilo očitno
Only when he has to get out.	Samo takrat, ko mora ven.
I couldn't tell him anything	Nič mu nisem mogel povedati
I want to stay.	Želim ostati.
If you want to.	Če želiš.
I would never ask anyone	Nikoli ne bi nikogar vprašal
I think he came from there	Mislim, da je od tam prišel
Sam.	Sam.

And then it happened.	In takrat se je zgodilo.
I will teach you everything you need to know	Naučil te bom vsega, kar moraš vedeti

I thought you knew that	Mislil sem, da to veš
I promised not to tell	Obljubil sem, da ne bom povedal
I wouldn’t want him to be sorry	Ne bi želel, da bi mu bilo žal
I have to leave now.	zdaj moram oditi.
no no no no	ne ne ne ne
I've done it all before	Vse sem naredil že prej
I was in place for a while	Nekaj ​​časa sem bil na mestu
She had to eat more.	Morala je jesti več.
You know too much.	Preveč veš.
You could do what you wanted.	Lahko bi delal, kar si hotel.
I can't do it for you.	Tega ne morem narediti namesto tebe.
There are a lot of them because everyone has them.	Veliko jih je, ker jih ima vsak.
I wish I was just a good person	Želim si, da bi bil le dobra oseba
I'm here and with you	Tukaj sem in s tabo

I've seen that before	To sem že videl
It will be like this from now on.	Od zdaj naprej bo tako.
It seems he did not.	Zdi se, da tega ni storil.
I'm ready for it.	Pripravljen sem na to.
I just wish it was better for everyone.	Želim samo, da bi bilo bolje za vse.
I would probably ask him what he knows	Verjetno bi ga vprašal, kaj ve

You should know he needs me	Moral bi vedeti, da me potrebuje
Because it's so right.	Ker je tako prav.
I want to know what happened and why	Želim vedeti, kaj se je zgodilo in zakaj
That's what a father can do.	To lahko naredi oče.
And don't talk.	In ne govori.
Because the time has come.	Ker je prišel čas.
I wasn’t prepared for what happened	Nisem bil pripravljen na to, kar se je zgodilo
He often went wrong, very wrong.	Pogosto je šel narobe, zelo narobe.
As a thing.	Kot stvar.
You are the only person who can help me.	Ti si edina oseba, ki mi lahko pomaga.
He came alone.	Prišel je sam.
I thought that was a good thing.	Mislil sem, da je to dobra stvar.
She knew right away that he wasn't human.	Takoj je vedela, da ni človek.
I think a lot of people would.	Mislim, da bi veliko ljudi.
I know they are.	Vem, da so.
I want to know if they are good	Želim vedeti, če so dobro
I'm there again.	Spet sem tam.
I saw an opportunity	Videl sem priložnost
I needed him as much as he needed me	Potreboval sem ga tako kot on mene
Please don't think too much of me.	Prosim, ne misli preveč o meni.
In fact, it is right.	Pravzaprav je to prav.
I'm glad it worked out for you.	Vesel sem, da ti je uspelo.
He knew how good he was.	Vedel je, kako dober je.
He might be right.	Morda ima prav.
You like that.	To ti je všeč.
I wouldn't have.	jaz ne bi imel.
In me, about me.	V meni, o meni.
He was gone now.	Zdaj ga ni bilo več.
I have for a long time	že dolgo imam
I wonder what you told her	Zanima me, kaj si ji govoril

I can't do anything else.	ne morem drugega.
I think it's too much.	Mislim, da je preveč.
I wish you knew where he is	Želim si, da bi vedeli, kje je
That's a good guy.	To je dober fant.
I've always wanted this life	Vedno sem si želel to življenje
You're lucky to have this.	Imaš srečo, da imaš to.
That wasn't it, he didn't need anything here.	To ni bilo to, tukaj ni potreboval ničesar.
I bought them.	Kupil sem jih.
I didn't start anything	Nič nisem začel
A lot of people want to see it.	Veliko ljudi ga želi videti.
I had nothing.	nisem imel nič.
I know how to do it	Vem, kako to storiti
I wouldn't have made it without him	Brez njega mi ne bi uspelo
It's almost ready.	Skoraj je pripravljen.
Or they are on it.	Ali pa so na tem.
I had to go from there and home	Moral sem iti od tam in domov
He didn't see anyone for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa ni videl nikogar.
I see you have a problem	Vidim, da imaš problem
I want to be in it.	Želim biti v tem.
He was not happy.	Ni bil vesel.
Again please.	Še enkrat prosim.

I got the job really fast	Delo sem dobil res hitro

You are no longer that person.	Nisi več ta oseba.
I knew nothing more than you.	Nisem vedel nič več kot ti.
You were very helpful.	Zelo ste bili v pomoč.
I didn't expect to see you again	Nisem pričakoval, da te bom spet videl
I can't stay in this place anymore	Ne morem več ostati na tem mestu
I thought you wanted that from me.	Mislil sem, da si to želiš od mene.
You just have to get out and do it.	Samo priti moraš ven in to narediti.
I know it was hard	Vem, da je bilo to težko
I just couldn’t believe it	Preprosto nisem mogel verjeti
Not a hotel.	Ni hotel.
I can't be here all the time	Ne morem biti ves čas tukaj
He was wrong.	Bil je narobe.
I'm not okay anymore	Nisem več v redu
I let her talk	Dovolil sem ji govoriti
I was also surprised.	Bil sem tudi presenečen.

You couldn't help it.	Nisi mogel pomagati.
Please don't think that.	Prosim, ne misli tega.
I knew why they were there	Vedel sem, zakaj so tam

I just wanted to see	Hotel sem samo videti
I shouldn't have come here at all	Sploh ne bi smel priti sem
I did what you wanted.	Naredil sem, kar si hotel.
I just thought he would always be there	Samo mislil sem, da bo vedno tam
There are more of you than us.	Več vas je kot nas.
This is hard.	To je težko.
I will stay here again	Spet bom ostal tukaj
I didn't want to tell her that	Tega ji nisem hotel povedati
Now is not the time for that.	Zdaj ni časa za to.
He never tried to see her again.	Nikoli več je ni poskušal videti.
It was good that I went.	Dobro je bilo, da sem šel.
That was no longer my father.	To ni bil več moj oče.
I was lucky to find him.	Imel sem srečo, da sem ga našel.
That was not the case.	To ni bilo tako.
How are you?	Kako si sploh.
I've never seen her	Nikoli je nisem videl
He knows nothing.	On nič ne ve.
Can anyone know anything ?.	Lahko kdo kaj ve?.
It's hard right now.	Trenutno je težko.

And mine too.	In moj tudi.
I wanted to do it myself	To sem želel narediti sam
It's everything to me.	Zame je vse.
It's not right.	Ni prav.
It's not me.	To nisem jaz.
As if that happened.	Kot da bi se to zgodilo.
I didn't think it would	Nisem si mislil, da bo
You should be there.	Moral bi biti tam.
And why? 	In zakaj?
I already told you that	To sem ti že povedal
I want to go tomorrow.	želim iti jutri.
That's what it does.	To je tisto, kar počne.
To be able to do.	Da bi lahko naredil.
He was sure of it then.	Takrat je bil prepričan o tem.

I would love to see you there !.	Rad bi te videl tam!.
I don't understand them.	Ne razumem jih.
You're not good enough.	Nisi dovolj dober.

And for sure.	In zagotovo.
I have to do this now	To moram storiti zdaj

We have to.	Moramo.
I didn't want him there.	Nisem hotel, da je tam.
Maybe I should do something about it	Morda bi moral nekaj storiti glede tega
I think we succeeded.	Mislim, da nam je uspelo.
I didn't ask her to come.	Nisem je prosil, naj pride.
Nobody wants to go there anymore.	Nihče noče več tja.
I often thought that was it	Pogosto sem mislil, da je to to
In fact, there are quite a few.	Pravzaprav jih je precej.
I have to make sure.	Moram se prepričati.
This has already happened.	To se je že zgodilo.
I told her she would be fine	Rekel sem ji, da bo v redu
He had a chance.	Imel je priložnost.
But you didn't help me.	Vendar mi nisi pomagal.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Očitno temu ni tako.
I think it's next.	Mislim, da je naslednji.
Let the work come to you.	Naj delo pride k vam.
I wanted him to talk.	Hotel sem, da govori.
And something is happening.	In nekaj se dogaja.
Dad came out.	Oče je prišel ven.
Someone other than me.	Nekdo, ki nisem jaz.
I told her she was fine	Rekel sem ji, da je v redu
I tried.	Poskušal sem.
I could say that this was a serious issue	Lahko bi rekel, da je bilo to resno vprašanje

I would like it now too.	Tudi zdaj bi ga rad.
He was able to do that.	To je lahko storil.
I think you have to move on.	Mislim, da moraš iti naprej.
Years if you want them.	Leta, če jih želite.
Hard for people.	Težko za ljudi.
I found him in town today	Danes sem ga našel v mestu
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
I never even get it.	Nikoli mi niti ne gre.
She wanted to see what the boy would do.	Želela je videti, kaj bo fant naredil.
Not even that.	Temu tudi ne.
He speaks little.	Malo govori.
Well, we were.	Pa smo bili.
Unfortunately, he has not yet succeeded.	Žal mu to še ni uspelo.
You may see something you like.	Morda boste videli nekaj, kar vam je všeč.
It's all together.	Vse to je skupaj.
But it was good.	Bilo pa je dobro.
Just for fun.	Samo za zabavo.
If they're not for you, that's okay.	Če niso zate, je v redu.
Still nothing happened.	Še vedno se ni nič zgodilo.
I never found the time for that.	Nikoli nisem našel časa za to.
How beautiful it is.	Kako lepo je.
It's just not you.	Samo nisi ti.
I very much doubt it.	Zelo dvomim.
And it's time.	In čas je.
Live with it for a bit.	Živi malo s tem.
And this thing is.	In ta stvar je.
Would.	Bi.
I've played it for you before.	Igral sem ti jo že prej.
And you have to tell him.	In moraš mu povedati.
It was very simple.	Bilo je zelo preprosto.
A lot of money and that's it.	Veliko denarja in to je.
I need someone.	Nekoga potrebujem.
It does none of these things.	Ne počne nič od tega.
I feel like myself, but there they are.	Počutim se kot sam, a tam so.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
I couldn’t help but like him	Nisem mogel pomagati, da mi je bil všeč
He wanted to leave me.	Želel me je oditi.
I didn't find any of that	Nič od tega nisem našel
I couldn't help her.	Nisem ji mogel pomagati.
That's when he had it made.	Takrat ga je dal narediti.
And there are many.	In veliko jih je.
He hasn't told me much yet.	Ni mi še veliko povedal.
Not so much, not so fast.	Ne tako veliko, ne tako hitro.
There was no such time before.	Prej tega časa ni bilo.
I hope you did	Upam, da si to naredil

I could help her.	Lahko bi ji pomagal.
She looked like always.	Videti je bila kot vedno.

They had a good reason for that.	Za to so imeli dober razlog.
I told you everything.	vse sem ti povedal.
I didn't want any of that	Nič od tega nisem hotel
In fact, it is.	Pravzaprav je tako.
With a little.	Z malo.
We can be better.	Lahko smo boljši.
They may not be in place.	Morda jih ni na mestu.
But maybe it wasn't always like that.	Morda pa ni bilo vedno tako.
I had to go, but where	Moral sem oditi, a kam
I know you'll be fine	Vem, da boš v redu
This does not seem to be the case.	Zdi se, da temu ni tako.
I just know those things	Samo poznam te stvari
But she wanted more.	Vendar je želela več.
I've never been here before	Še nikoli nisem bil tukaj
Unfortunately, this is not the case.	Žal temu ni tako.
I didn’t know how to get to him	Nisem vedel, kako priti do njega
There are very few people in the room.	V sobi je zelo malo ljudi.
A child he had never seen before.	Otrok, ki ga še nikoli ni videl.
I have nowhere to go	Imam kam iti
It won't be long.	Ne bo dolgo.
He didn't have to do that.	Tega mu ni bilo treba storiti.
It can be done.	Lahko se naredi.
What happened to him.	Kaj se je zgodilo z njim.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
And once you’re there, you can be completely human again.	In ko si enkrat tam, si lahko spet popolnoma človek.
Not for you.	Ne zate.
I want to do something.	Želim nekaj narediti.
How is this possible.	Kako je to mogoče.
I never had to say that.	Nikoli mi tega ni bilo treba povedati.
My father left.	Moj oče je šel.
This is also common.	To je tudi običajno.
Nobody expected that.	Tega nihče ni pričakoval.
Just to see him.	Samo da ga vidim.
It wasn't that hard.	Ni bilo tako težko.
I saw her do it.	Videl sem jo, kako to počne.
I shouldn't be here.	Ne bi smel biti tukaj.
I would do that.	Jaz bi to naredil.
Maybe it's true.	Mogoče je res.
I need more time.	Potrebujem več časa.
And he never came back.	In nikoli se ni vrnil.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
we are not sure.	nismo prepričani.
Just once.	Samo enkrat.
This is not the right time to do so much work.	Ni pravi čas, ko je toliko dela.
I was in	Bil-a sem v.
He is very tired.	Zelo je utrujen.
That's really true.	To je res tako.
He said it was okay.	Rekel je, da je v redu.
She should come home now.	Zdaj bi morala priti domov.
We should work together.	Morali bi delati skupaj.
It was not.	Ni bilo.
Something is definitely wrong.	Nekaj ​​zagotovo ni v redu.
And a lot will happen.	In zgodilo se bo veliko.
It seems we didn't.	Zdi se, da nismo.
You think a.	Misliš, da je a.
I am human.	jaz sem človek.
He wants to do.	Želi narediti.
Either that or he doesn’t know anything.	Ali to ali pa ne ve ničesar.
There's no one here either.	Tudi tukaj ni nikogar.
.	.
I didn't see him at all.	Sploh ga nisem videl.
I have to.	Moram.
He had to do something to be busy.	Moral je nekaj narediti, da bi bil zaposlen.
Or your father.	Ali pa tvoj oče.
There is something else.	Še nekaj je.
I'm not sure you will.	Nisem prepričan, da boš.
And he got it.	In dobil ga je.
I am absolutely convinced of that.	O tem sem popolnoma prepričan.
I think he must be a boy.	Mislim, da mora biti fant.
That's good to know.	To je dobro vedeti.
No, it's not nice.	Ne, ni lepo.
He never has time for me.	Nikoli nima časa zame.
I thought that was it.	Mislil sem, da je to to.
I hope you know that.	Upam, da to veš.
You need to go.	Treba je iti.
Yours.	Tvoj.
You can't keep doing this.	Ne moreš si tega še naprej delati.
I know what you did to me.	Vem, kaj si mi naredil.
Now he was here.	Zdaj je bil tukaj.
I can't do things.	Ne morem delati stvari.
I think there is something wrong with him.	Mislim, da je nekaj narobe z njim.
So I like it better.	Tako mi je bolj všeč.
This is so very wrong.	To je tako zelo narobe.
I've never seen him like this before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl tako.
And maybe better.	In morda bolje.
Maybe he's here.	Mogoče je tukaj.
He had to be sure of that.	O tem je moral biti prepričan.
I didn't even know where he lived.	Sploh nisem vedela, kje živi.
I am very sorry about that.	Zelo mi je žal zaradi tega.
He plays every day.	Vsak dan igra.
This is happening.	To se dogaja.
You said so well.	Tako dobro si povedal.
Good for you to find him.	Dobro zate, da si ga našel.
You asked to be here.	Prosil si, da si tukaj.
No.	Ne.
It wouldn’t be the first time either.	Tudi ne bi bilo prvič.
I ate.	Jedel sem.
But there is always a reason.	Vendar vedno obstaja razlog.
They are both good.	Oba sta dobra.
More of them.	Več jih.
it's true.	res je.
It happens to all of us and often.	Dogaja se nam vsem in pogosto.
It's probably true.	Verjetno je res.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
And that's obviously not good.	In to očitno ni dobro.
Here he was.	Tukaj je bil.
That's what we're supposed to do.	To naj bi storili.
I like this much better.	To mi je veliko bolj všeč.
And that was not so little.	In to ni bilo tako malo.
Often not.	Pogosto ne.
Which is really nice.	Kar je res lepo.
Live a little.	Živi malo.
I am very sorry that this happened.	Zelo mi je žal, da se je to zgodilo.
Obviously it doesn't exist.	Očitno ne obstaja.
I knew this had to go.	Vedel sem, da mora to iti.
You were absolutely right.	Imel si popolnoma prav.
This is common.	To je običajno.
Maybe because he is no more and will no longer work.	Lahko, ker ga ni več in ne bo več delal.
We did it.	Uspelo nam je.
You can't do this to me.	Ne moreš mi tega narediti.
It can't be.	Ne more biti.
I thought wrong.	narobe sem mislil.
I've never seen you so well.	Še nikoli te nisem videl tako dobro.
That's how it feels.	Tako se počuti.
Not like that anymore.	Ne več tako.
He let him go.	Pustil ga je.
He felt much better then.	Takrat se je počutil veliko bolje.
What did you do?	Kaj ste naredili.
He still didn't know what it was about.	Še vedno ni vedel, za kaj gre.
They seemed to be.	Zdelo se je, da so.
Yours and mine.	Tvoj in moj.
I will say that.	To bom rekel.
He never heard it.	Nikoli ga ni slišal.
There were many of them.	Veliko jih je bilo.
I don't need any help at all.	Sploh ne potrebujem pomoči.
I doubt that will ever happen now.	Dvomim, da se bo zdaj to kdaj zgodilo.
Someone has to do it.	Nekdo mora to narediti.
Know how and know it.	Vedeti kako in to vedeti.
for sure.	zagotovo.
That you are even interested.	Da te sploh zanima.
We know a lot more now.	Zdaj vemo veliko več.
That seems so wrong.	To se zdi tako narobe.
Nobody told me that.	Tega mi nihče ni rekel.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
But it felt pretty good.	Vendar se je zdelo precej dobro.
This also happened today.	Tudi to se je zgodilo danes.
They were there forever.	Tam so bili za vedno.
Not from anyone.	Ne od nikogar.
And when that's gone, nothing.	In ko tega ni več, nič.
She feels good.	Dobro se ji zdi.
V	V
There is no such thing.	Nič takega ni.
Maybe they were.	Mogoče so bili.
I don’t know I have nothing to say about it.	Ne vem, da nimam kaj povedati o tem.
He was gone the next day.	Naslednji dan ga ni bilo več.
Actually more than that.	Pravzaprav več kot to.
Fortunately for both of us, it did.	Na srečo za oba se je.
He looked like he had died.	Videti je bil, kot je umrl.
Quick.	Hitro.
I know now.	zdaj vem.
No one saw anything.	Nihče ni videl ničesar.
It seemed too.	Zdelo se je tudi.
All that stuff.	Vse te stvari.
I was just trying to get you.	Samo tebe sem poskušal.
This is not very difficult.	To ni zelo težko.
Everything beautiful is a problem.	Vse lepo je problem.
That was not the case.	To ni bilo tako.
But that has to be it.	Vendar to mora biti to.
This is something else.	To je nekaj drugega.
And she did.	In to je tudi storila.
They’re not sure what it is now.	Niso prepričani, kaj je zdaj.
She wanted me to know.	Želela je, da vem.
They didn’t know what they were.	Niso vedeli, kaj so.
Maybe, never.	Morda, nikoli.
He said too much.	Preveč je rekel.
It's never enough for me.	Nikoli mi ni dovolj.
Sometimes you don’t know for sure.	Včasih ne veš zagotovo.
That was a few years ago.	To je bilo nekaj let nazaj.
Tell me you're going to die tonight.	Povej mi, da boš umrl nocoj.
I certainly didn’t feel it and haven’t for quite some time.	Zagotovo se nisem počutil in že kar nekaj časa nisem.
I 'm so fast.	Tako hitro sem.
He didn't want to see it again.	Tega ni želel več videti.
This is hard work.	To je težko delo.
My father taught me everything, he gave me everything.	Oče me je vsega naučil, vse mi je dal.
Or maybe you could.	Ali pa bi morda lahko.
Maybe they aren't.	Mogoče niso.
It has been in the city for three years.	V mestu je to tri leta.
No one comes here if they don’t want something.	Nihče ne pride sem, če nekaj ne želi.
No work.	Brez dela.
I had to get out.	Moral sem ven.
So it was hard.	Zato je bilo težko.
None of it was mine anymore.	Nič od tega ni bilo več moje.
She wanted to know.	Želela je vedeti.
He preferred to do his own thing.	Raje je delal po svoje.
And next and next.	In naslednji in naslednji.
Everyday.	Vsak dan.
He doesn't work anymore.	Ne dela več.
He heard them too.	Tudi on jih je slišal.
He didn't even ask about it tonight.	Nocoj ni niti vprašal o tem.
I was the only person in the room.	Bila sem edina oseba v sobi.
Let him speak now.	Naj zdaj govori.
He always became something.	Vedno je nekaj postal.
No one seemed to be home.	Videti je bilo, da ni nikogar doma.
I don't see it myself.	Sam tega ne vidim.
It seemed so wrong, it all seemed so wrong.	Zdelo se je tako narobe, vse skupaj se je zdelo tako narobe.
He would die.	On bi umrl.
We managed to do that.	To nam je uspelo.
I wouldn't say anything to her.	Nič ji ne bi rekel.
I just wanted you to know that.	Samo želel sem, da to veš.
He needed something.	Potreboval je nekaj.
About what happened.	O tem, kar se je zgodilo.
There is enough for all of us.	Za vse nas je dovolj.
I have to go to work.	Na delo moram.
We know so much.	Toliko vemo.
If they still were, they still would be.	Če bi še bili, bi še vedno bili.
We have to play well.	Moramo igrati dobro.
.	.
And he was always one to get something for nothing.	In vedno je bil tisti, ki je dobil nekaj za nič.
You know who you are and what you are.	Veš kdo si in kaj si.
I just didn't know better.	Samo bolje nisem vedel.
He was glad she was gone.	Bil je vesel, da je šla.
That could be true.	To bi lahko bilo res.
It had to be said.	Treba je bilo povedati.
He sat as if tired.	Sedel je kot utrujen.
This is a big question.	To je veliko vprašanje.
You could ask him where he was then.	Lahko bi ga vprašal, kje je bil takrat.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
It's pretty early in the morning.	Precej zgodaj zjutraj je.
He decided not to.	Odločil se je, da ne bo.
I'm not asking anything.	nič ne sprašujem.
He spoke as if nothing had happened.	Govoril je, kot da se ni nič zgodilo.
I just had to.	Samo moral sem.
You knew nothing about it.	Nič nisi vedel o tem.
Nobody goes home.	Nihče ne gre domov.
This is a car.	To je avto.
I don’t understand why this is happening.	Ne razumem, zakaj se to dogaja.
She said nothing.	Nič ni rekla.
It's not because of you.	Ni zaradi tebe.
Things he had to see.	Stvari, ki jih je moral videti.
However, much more needs to be done.	Vendar je treba narediti še veliko več.
You can't do this alone.	Tega ne moreš narediti sam.
I often wonder.	Pogosto se sprašujem.
All right, here it is.	V redu, tukaj je.
We'll see what he does next.	Bomo videli, kaj bo naredil naprej.
ni.	ni.
That's when he made up his mind.	Takrat se je odločil.
Maybe we should.	Mogoče bi morali.
I didn’t know what to believe.	Nisem vedel, kaj naj verjamem.
You know you won't.	Veš, da ne boš.
I don't think so.	ne mislim.
Almost no one yet.	Skoraj nikogar še ni.
He comes to me.	Pride k meni.
I knew it would be so.	Vedel sem, da bo tako.
I'm going to do something else.	Grem še kaj drugega.
Please more, more.	Prosim več, več.
Sometimes we should.	Včasih bi morali.
Nice to have both of you back.	Lepo, da sta oba nazaj.
Not everyone is there.	Vsi niso tam.
I can do absolutely nothing.	Popolnoma nič ne morem.
I'm surprised you're here tonight.	Presenečen sem, da si nocoj tukaj.
It wasn't nice.	Ni bilo lepo.
This is not true.	To ni res.
Now no one will want her, he says.	Zdaj je nihče ne bo želel, pravi.
as one who.	kot tisti, ki.
And it's not right.	In ni prav.
I know you are.	Vem, da si.
He really wanted to.	Zelo si je želel.
No one called me back.	Nihče me ni poklical nazaj.
He called them.	Poklical jih je.
He said as if he knew me.	Povedal je, kot da me pozna.
I don't understand why this is.	Ne razumem, zakaj je to.
Maybe never again, after what happened.	Morda ne nikoli več, po tem, kar se je zgodilo.
Nothing more than you are.	Nič več kot si.
I think he's glad to have you in this place.	Mislim, da je vesel, da te ima na tem mestu.
They're from here.	Od tukaj so.
Speak.	Govori.
Nice to see you.	Lepo te je videti.
Nothing ever happened.	Nikoli se ni zgodilo nič.
He knew what was going on.	Vedel je, kaj se dogaja.
I have three.	imam tri.
He probably was.	Verjetno je bil.
Everyone is human.	Vsak je človek.
You're right.	Prav imaš.
We haven't seen him yet.	Nismo ga še videli.
I've known him for a long time.	Poznam ga že kar dolgo.
My father gave it to me.	Oče mi ga je dal.
She doesn't have to.	Ni ji treba.
He wouldn't have to.	Ne bi mu bilo treba.
You have to go and see someone.	Moraš iti in nekoga videti.
I could work.	Lahko bi delal.
I did that.	To sem naredil.
I don't even know.	niti ne vem.
That was not what he wanted.	To ni bilo tisto, kar je hotel.
She was well enough now.	Zdaj je bila dovolj dobro.
You sure can.	Zagotovo lahko.
And so they did.	In tako so tudi storili.
I'm really doing better now.	Zdaj mi gre res bolje.
He taught me everything.	On me je naučil vsega.
And much more.	In veliko več.
I'll call him this afternoon.	Danes popoldne ga bom poklical.
She was mine.	Bila je moja.
I've known them for a long time.	Poznam jih že dolgo.
These are good deeds.	To so dobra dela.
And my father knew that.	In moj oče je to vedel.
Either way, almost no one ate much.	Tako ali tako skoraj nihče ni veliko jedel.
I asked him what happened.	Vprašal sem ga, kaj se je zgodilo.
Not just to do something.	Ne samo, da bi nekaj naredil.
I don't need anything from you.	Ne potrebujem ničesar od tebe.
No one would buy it.	Nihče ga ne bi kupil.
It doesn't do anything.	Nič ne naredi.
That he wants to.	Da si želi.
It won't be long.	Ne bo dolgo.
I really don't believe it.	res ne verjamem.
It was just him and me.	Bila sva samo on in jaz.
I'll do it myself.	To bom naredil sam.
That was not right.	To ni bilo prav.
She wanted out.	Želela je ven.
They will be with us soon.	Kmalu bodo pri nas.
Without thinking it would.	Ne da bi si mislil, da bo.
He was with me last night.	Sinoči je bil z mano.
Nothing looks in place.	Nič ni videti na mestu.
I have to go home.	moram domov.
He knew there was a problem.	Vedel je, da je problem.
He has a school.	Ima šolo.
That could be true.	To bi lahko bilo res.
I could never tell you.	Nikoli ti ne bi mogel povedati.
Just like it !.	Samo všeč!.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Očitno temu ni tako.
Everything seemed to him.	Vse se mu je zdelo.
You have done a good job here.	Tukaj si dobro opravil delo.
You don't have to do that.	Tega ti ni treba narediti.
I can’t say enough about it.	Ne morem povedati dovolj o tem.
He liked that.	To mu je bilo všeč.
I mean, almost like that.	Mislim, skoraj tako.
Nothing will be the same without you.	Brez tebe nič ne bo tako, kot je bilo.
Just like us.	Tako kot mi.
It's too obvious.	Je preveč očitno.
He just left.	Pravkar je odšel.
And he was right about that.	In glede tega je imel prav.
This is not what you want.	To ni tisto, kar si želiš.
It was obvious what they were.	Bilo je očitno, kaj so.
She had to be.	Morala je biti.
Maybe he wants another one now.	Morda si zdaj želi drugega.
Why? 	Zakaj?
You should be there.	Moral bi biti tam.
It's not us.	To nismo mi.
It just worked.	Pravkar je uspelo.
It used to be so beautiful.	Včasih je bilo tako lepo.
I have enough money.	Imam dovolj denarja.
I would be very busy.	Bil bi zelo zaposlen.
Someone would hear.	Nekdo bi slišal.
I go to them.	grem k njim.
But he knew it wouldn't happen that way.	A vedel je, da se tako ne bo zgodilo.
There are a few more.	Nekaj ​​jih je še.
He works, he has a job.	Dela, ima službo.
I've never been there.	nikoli nisem bil tam.
You should do something.	Nekaj ​​bi moral narediti.
I knew it couldn't be that way.	Vedel sem, da ne more biti tako.
You can always be just what you are.	Vedno si lahko samo to, kar si.
I still don’t understand how this could have happened.	Še vedno ne razumem, kako se je to lahko zgodilo.
I'm happy.	Vesel sem.
No, it's not possible.	Ne, ni mogoče.
I'm not so happy about that.	Nisem tako vesel tega.
Maybe something in it.	Morda nekaj v tem.
No, no no no and no.	Ne, ne ne ne in ne.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
He looked surprised.	Videti je bil presenečen.
That's for us.	To je za nas.
Well, we are.	Pa smo.
What to do.	Kaj storiti.
He never wanted her.	Nikoli je ni hotel.
Not good enough.	Ne dovolj dobro.
Yes, you may be sure of that.	Da, morda ste prepričani v to.
Never before.	Še nikoli prej.
It was also not possible to leave.	Prav tako ni bilo mogoče oditi.
The man who asked me.	Človek, ki me je prosil.
Do something for.	Nekaj ​​naredi za.
Why? 	Zakaj?
he thought.	mislil je.
I would do that.	To bi storil.
I gave her everything.	Dal sem ji vse.
I don't think so.	ne mislim.
If it hasn't already.	Če še ni.
I believe him.	Jaz mu verjamem.
I need help from someone there.	Potrebujem pomoč nekoga od tam.
Whether this is true or not is not a question.	Ali je to res ali ne, ni vprašanje.
I could do so much more.	Lahko bi naredil veliko več.
And talk, obviously.	In govoriti, očitno.
And something to eat.	In nekaj za jesti.
I will not have it.	jaz ga ne bom imel.
So much work, with so little time.	Toliko dela, s tako malo časa.
He was a very good boy.	Bil je zelo dober fant.
Whatever it was, it was.	Kar je bilo, je bilo.
Who is he? 	Kdo je on?
And now he's back.	In zdaj se je vrnil.
I said it was going to happen.	Rekel sem, da se bo to zgodilo.
No, it's not possible.	Ne, ni mogoče.
I'm just.	samo sem.
I have a house.	Imam hišo.
He doesn't need it either.	Tudi on ne potrebuje.
Tell me it's not true.	Povej mi, da ni res.
Not so nice.	Ni tako lepo.
For life.	Za vse življenje.
All nice and right.	Vse lepo in prav.
Everyone knew that about me.	To so vsi vedeli o meni.
It's always been like that with me.	Pri meni je bilo vedno tako.
To ask for help.	Da prosim za pomoč.
Which you will do.	Kar boste storili.
There was something there.	Nekaj ​​je bilo tam.
But I don't know where he is now.	Ne vem pa, kje je zdaj.
And he still doesn't know.	In še vedno ne ve.
He didn't hear.	Ni slišal.
I don't even want to talk about it.	O tem pravzaprav niti ne želim govoriti.
There is nothing to talk about.	Ni kaj govoriti.
Maybe he didn't say it right.	Mogoče ni prav povedal.
Not the first time, not even.	Ne prvič, tudi ne.
And when will it be.	In kdaj bo.
It seemed pretty good.	Zdelo se je kar dobro.
We'll see what happens.	Bomo videli kaj se bo zgodilo.
Without him, none of this would have been possible.	Brez njega nič od tega ne bi bilo mogoče.
Nobody knows who he is.	Nihče ne ve, kdo je.
Happened.	Se je zgodilo.
The child had problems.	Otrok je imel težave.
He seemed quite surprised when he saw us.	Zdelo se je precej presenečen, ko nas je videl.
This is done that way.	To se naredi tako.
No one has heard of it yet.	Za to še nihče ni slišal.
He didn't go out like that.	Ni tako odšel ven.
There was never anything there.	Tam ni bilo nikoli ničesar.
We've seen them before.	Videli smo jih že prej.
And he succeeded.	In uspelo mu je.
You should do more.	Moral bi narediti več.
It was like coming home.	Bilo je, kot da bi prišel domov.
Just what he needed.	Samo tisto, kar je potreboval.
She didn't know what she was talking about.	Ni vedela, kaj govori.
She would do very well.	Zelo lepo bi ji uspelo.
This certainly seems to have happened.	Zdi se, da se je to zagotovo zgodilo.
He said that every week.	To je rekel vsak teden.
And tonight you came back with a lot of money.	In nocoj si se vrnil z veliko denarja.
I was just trying to be good.	Samo poskušal sem biti dober.
Nor is it.	Prav tako ni .
She didn't even know.	Sploh ni vedela.
This does not seem to be the case.	Zdi se, da temu ni tako.
I don't know what's going on there.	Ne vem, kaj se tam dogaja.
That's a good game !.	To je dobra igra!.
Here's the problem.	Tukaj je problem.
We need to know that.	To moramo vedeti.
More than nothing.	Več kot nič.
And so they had.	In tako so imeli.
It was there then and it is still here now.	Tam je bilo takrat in je še zdaj tukaj.
It's time to come home, she told him.	Čas je, da pride domov, mu je rekla.
But unfortunately this is happening today.	A žal se to dogaja danes.
All this is obvious.	Vse to je očitno.
You expected too much.	Preveč si pričakoval.
No, I should do things my own way.	Ne, stvari bi moral narediti po svoje.
It can't be easy for her.	Ne more ji biti lahko.
No, you already have it.	Ne, že ga imaš.
I had a reason.	Imel sem razlog.
He's back there.	Tam je nazaj.
Bo.	Bo.
There weren't many of us.	Ni nas bilo veliko.
No one was sure why.	Nihče ni bil prepričan, zakaj.
I do not.	Jaz ne.
And someone is.	In nekdo je.
We need to move on.	Treba je iti naprej.
You tell her that.	Ti ji to povej.
He had never been so long from home.	Še nikoli ni bil tako dolgo od doma.
They both are.	Oba sta.
I could do a little more now.	Zdaj bi lahko naredil malo več.
Me, he said.	Jaz, je rekel.
A lot actually.	Veliko pravzaprav.
This is not the case.	To ni tako.
He couldn't speak.	Ni mogel govoriti.
But they were together.	Vendar sta bila skupaj.
Nice to see you again.	Lepo vas je spet videti.
I had to see.	Moral sem videti.
I'll just go back.	Samo šel bom nazaj.
He may need it.	Morda ga bo potreboval.
It was time for work.	Čas je bil za delo.
Apparently it did.	Očitno se je.
She was on me.	Bila je na meni.
You were busy, you didn't have time to eat.	Bil si zaposlen, nisi imel časa jesti.
So it was now.	Tako je bilo tudi zdaj.
If it’s not money, it’s something else.	Če ni denar, je nekaj drugega.
I know that.	jaz to poznam.
Something like this has often happened.	Pogosto se je zgodilo kaj takega.
Must be.	Mora biti.
I really don't understand.	res ne razumem.
I wonder if anyone will find her.	Zanima me, če jo bo kdo našel.
I think it was a lot.	Mislim, da je bilo veliko.
You will find someone.	Nekoga boš našel.
That is to say, he did nothing.	Se pravi, da ni naredil nič.
There is nothing else to do.	Nič drugega ni za početi.
That was a long time ago.	To je bilo že dolgo nazaj.
I like that better.	To mi je bolj všeč.
They are together now.	Zdaj sta skupaj.
But she didn't go out much.	A ni šla veliko ven.
No, not just nice, more than that.	Ne, ne samo lepo, več kot to.
This will be difficult.	To pa bo težko.
This is also common.	Tudi to je pogosto.
He doesn't know us.	Ne pozna nas.
That never happened.	To se nikoli ni zgodilo.
Are you still there? 	Si še vedno tam?
But she didn't want to buy anything.	Vendar ni želela ničesar kupiti.
That doesn't exist here anymore.	To tukaj ne obstaja več.
I still don’t really understand.	Še vedno res ne razumem.
I don't like children.	Ne maram otrok.
Here we are.	Tukaj smo.
That should be an option.	To bi morala biti možnost.
I think almost everyone.	Mislim, da je skoraj vsem.
Has anyone heard of this.	Je kdo že slišal za to.
I don't even want to know.	Sploh nočem vedeti.
I just don't see it that way.	Samo ne vidim tega tako.
And so it was.	In tako je bilo.
I don't know what to do.	ne vem kaj naj.
He never won.	Nikoli ni zmagal.
If I could find her.	Če bi jo našel.
Just you and me.	Samo ti in jaz.
I don’t know if that’s true or not.	Ne vem, ali je to res ali ne.
That was me.	To sem bil jaz.
So my father taught me to play.	Tako me je oče naučil igrati.
He wanted to say.	Hotel je povedati.
That wasn't enough.	To ni bilo dovolj.
You're the one with the problem.	Ti si tisti, ki ima težave.
You knew too.	Tudi ti si vedel.
She liked him immediately.	Takoj ji je bil všeč.
I hope you like it here.	Upam, da vam je tukaj všeč.
No one can help.	Nihče ne more pomagati.
It was out of place.	Ni bilo na mestu.
you do not know.	ne veš.
He has done this before.	To je storil že prej.
I may not know today.	Danes morda ne vem.
I didn't have time to be a kid.	Nisem imel časa biti otrok.
Tell her what you told me, ”he said.	Povej ji, kar si mi povedal,« je rekel.
We will not do that.	Tega ne bomo storili.
I had to know.	Moral sem vedeti.
He doesn't do anything.	Ne naredi ničesar.
And so it happened.	In tako se je zgodilo.
That wasn't much.	To ni bilo veliko.
He won't be able to.	Ne bo mogel.
I could do that now.	To bi lahko storil zdaj.
You're with me now.	Zdaj si z mano.
I know he wants me to have this.	Vem, da želi, da imam to.
That's it.	To je to.
There is nothing else he can do.	Ničesar drugega ne more storiti.
Man, this thing is good.	Človek, ta stvar je dobra.
He wasn't surprised to hear that.	Ni bil presenečen, ko je to slišal.
They did the right thing.	Naredili so prav.
You can not.	Ne moreš.
He has it now.	Zdaj ga ima.
I never did that, so it was good.	Tega nisem nikoli počel, tako da je bilo dobro.
It was okay when it was just me.	Bilo je v redu, ko sem bil samo jaz.
I think he thought he won.	Mislim, da je mislil, da je zmagal.
Right there.	Takoj in tam.
I wish you didn't have to.	Želim si, da ti ne bi bilo treba.
Could be a problem.	Lahko bi bil problem.
I don't need to know anything else.	Ničesar drugega mi ni treba vedeti.
I can't tell what's going on.	Ne morem povedati, kaj se dogaja.
More than.	Bolj kot.
I didn't hear anything.	Nič nisem slišal.
I knew what was going to happen.	Vedel sem, kaj se bo zgodilo.
It helps me, it helps them.	Pomaga meni, pomaga njim.
I came for work.	Sem prišel zaradi dela.
We may know more.	Morda vemo več.
Not someone else's.	Ne nekoga drugega.
Man, this is tough.	Človek, to je težko.
That's obvious.	To je očitno.
I'm sure not.	Prepričan sem, da ne.
You should know that, but it's not.	To bi moral vedeti, pa ni.
Apparently he really was.	Očitno je res bil.
No one knows for sure.	Nihče ne ve zagotovo.
I'd like to hear something else.	Rad bi slišal še nekaj.
All for nothing.	Vse za nič.
I knew I wanted to hear about it.	Vedel sem, da bi rad slišal o tem.
He couldn't do it.	Ni mogel storiti.
I will speak.	Jaz bom govoril.
However, this would no longer be the case.	Vendar temu ne bi bilo več tako.
And that's a good thing.	In to je dobra stvar.
So we have to do it right.	Zato moramo to narediti prav.
It helps me do things.	Pomaga mi narediti stvari.
No one would want to remain human.	Nihče ne bi hotel ostati človek.
It really isn't.	Res ni.
We had to hurry.	Morali smo hitro.
A little of that, a little of that.	Malo tega, malo tega.
Better not.	Bolje je, da ne.
There was more here.	Tukaj je bilo več.
I would like to go again.	Rad bi šel še enkrat.
She should, she always has.	Morala bi, vedno je.
He won again.	Spet je zmagal.
I know it is.	Vem, da je.
There is nothing else you need to do.	Nič drugega vam ni treba storiti.
We should do it right.	Morali bi narediti prav.
It will be there for a few more years.	Tam bo še nekaj let.
I think you will be very happy.	Mislim, da boš zelo vesel.
I would do it.	Jaz bi naredil.
Not even tonight.	Niti nocoj ne.
I did not see.	nisem videl.
you are.	ti si.
I don't want that.	tega nočem.
It used to be much better.	Včasih je bilo veliko bolje.
I'm not with him.	nisem z njim.
He admitted what he did.	Priznal je, kar je storil.
It can actually help.	Pravzaprav lahko pomaga.
I wouldn't come back.	Ne bi se vrnil.
I couldn't do this without you.	Tega ne bi mogel storiti brez tebe.
There was no other.	Drugega ni bilo.
I did it.	To mi je uspelo.
He can live again.	Spet lahko živi.
If there were, they wouldn't be here.	Če bi bilo, jih ne bi bilo tukaj.
I have to go home.	Moram domov.
Someone help me.	Naj mi nekdo pomaga.
No, he was gone now.	Ne, zdaj ga ni bilo več.
In fact, I didn’t like them too much.	Pravzaprav mi niso bili preveč všeč.
I don’t understand how much happened.	Ne razumem, kako veliko se je zgodilo.
Now he has a chance at that.	Zdaj ima priložnost za to.
We make us so much better.	Zaradi tebe smo veliko boljši.
It's like it never happened.	Kot da se ni nikoli zgodilo.
We can't do without it.	Brez tega ne moremo.
We did it.	Uspelo nam je.
He just knew he needed it.	Samo vedel je, da ga potrebuje.
What they are.	Kar so.
Can anyone help me.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga.
Someone is doing it.	Nekdo to počne.
I'm sure it exists.	Prepričan sem, da obstaja.
I think that's the reason.	Mislim, da je to razlog.
That remains to be seen.	To je treba še videti.
you are so right.	tako prav imaš.
He didn't try to talk.	Ni poskušal govoriti.
We simply are not.	Preprosto nismo.
We are sorry.	Žal nam je.
He never goes out.	Nikoli ne gre ven.
It would be nice.	Lepo bi bilo.
And therein lies my problem.	In v tem je moj problem.
Which is not.	Kar pa ni.
I know I would be more than happy for you.	Vem, da bi te bil več kot vesel.
It is simply what it is.	Preprosto je, kar je.
It really can’t go wrong here.	Tukaj res ne more iti narobe.
About what we did.	O tem, kar smo naredili.
Maybe it really was.	Mogoče je bilo res tako.
No one goes alone.	Nihče ne gre sam.
Just like you.	Kot samo ti.
A few years.	Nekaj ​​let.
I'll have it here.	Tukaj ga bom imel.
He has to.	Mora.
Every day is a little more obvious.	Vsak dan je malo bolj očitno.
Okay, it can't be helped.	V redu, ni mogoče pomagati.
You can be sure he won't be here.	Lahko ste prepričani, da ga ne bo tukaj.
She usually did.	Običajno je to storila.
I think my father is here.	Mislim, da je moj oče tukaj.
You have done so much for us.	Toliko ste naredili za nas.
You would be good.	Ti bi bil dober.
If I only knew.	Ko bi le vedela.
Dan and that.	Dan in to.
Not so, obviously.	Ne tako, očitno.
Just to see what happened.	Samo da vidim, kaj se je zgodilo.
I had to.	Moral sem.
These days.	Te dni.
More likely to.	Bolj verjetno, da.
I'm really not okay.	res nisem v redu.
This would not happen at home.	Doma se to ne bi zgodilo.
Something was obviously wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo očitno narobe.
I would love to hear about it.	Rad bi slišal o tem.
It seems like nothing.	Zdi se kot nič.
This is quite common.	To je precej pogosto.
Do nothing.	Ne naredi nič.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ne bi bilo tako.
He didn't want me to go.	Ni hotel, da grem.
You know what's going to happen.	Saj veš kaj se bo zgodilo.
And you don't have to.	In ti ni treba.
Now here's the problem.	Tukaj je zdaj problem.
You would never have to work again.	Nikoli več vam ne bi bilo treba delati.
You tell me.	Ti mi povej.
I don't know why that is.	Ne vem zakaj je tako.
I tried out.	Poskušal sem ven.
I don’t care if any of you would do that.	Ne zanima me, ali bi kdo od vas to storil.
No, maybe you won't.	Ne, mogoče ne boš.
We have to be sure.	Moramo biti prepričani.
He's up to something.	Namerava nekaj.
I know it's me.	Vem, da sem jaz.
I know you're not.	Vem, da nisi.
I felt like she was mine.	Počutil sem se, kot da je moja.
We've seen that before.	To smo že videli.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Ni vedel, kaj počne.
That's how it's supposed to be.	Tako naj bi bilo.
Enough.	Dovolj.
This is not as it should be.	To ni tako, kot naj bi bilo.
I have to do better.	Moram narediti bolje.
He couldn't.	Ni mogel.
It is and it is not.	Je in ni.
He just had to convince her.	Samo prepričati jo je moral.
There is something very wrong with this, something very different.	S tem je nekaj zelo narobe, nekaj zelo drugega.
She was much more than I was.	Bila je veliko več kot jaz.
He was sure she would succeed.	Bil je prepričan, da ji bo uspelo.
That's the only way he'll learn.	Le tako se bo naučil.
Then you know it's time.	Takrat veš, da je čas.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
Just like us.	Tako kot mi.
He would like to know.	On bi rad vedel.
I needed some time.	Potreboval sem nekaj časa.
I'm asking her to go home with me.	Prosim jo, naj gre z mano domov.
I wasn't so sure.	Nisem bil tako prepričan.
It should be.	Moral bi biti.
Much better than me.	Veliko boljši od mene.
For several years actually.	Pravzaprav že nekaj let.
And the next, and the next.	In naslednji, in naslednji.
I'm not there.	nisem tam.
No time to go get help.	Ni časa, da bi šel po pomoč.
I tried and tried.	Poskušal sem in poskušal.
This is simply no longer true.	To preprosto ni več res.
I never knew what happened.	Nikoli nisem vedel, kaj se je zgodilo.
It's good for me !.	Zame je dobro!.
You can't help being alone.	Ne moreš si pomagati biti sam.
Not even what she was or could be alone.	Niti to, kar je bila ali bi lahko bila sama.
I used to be pretty good at it.	Včasih sem bil v tem precej dober.
It was not easy.	Ni bilo lahko.
And it’s not hard to do.	In to ni težko narediti.
We could do that.	Lahko bi to storili.
That's quite a bit of money.	To je kar nekaj denarja.
I'll keep working on it.	Še naprej bom delal na tem.
I have people.	imam ljudi.
That's why you're here.	Zato ste tukaj.
It feels like life is back.	Zdi se, kot da je bilo življenje nazaj.
Either I'll find a way or I'll make one.	Ali bom našel način ali pa ga bom naredil.
There is nothing good for people.	Nič ni v dobro ljudi.
I think I would call.	Mislim, da bi poklical.
He doesn't seem to be able to help himself.	Zdi se, da si ne more pomagati.
Much more than that is unlikely.	Veliko več od tega pa je malo verjetno.
I would be very happy.	Bil bi zelo vesel.
I was really happy with you when you wanted me.	Res sem bil vesel s tabo, ko si me želel.
Today was like a child again.	Danes je bilo spet kot otrok.
He really loves you.	Res te ima rad.
And he was.	In bil je.
I didn't want her.	Nisem je hotel.
I would forget this ever happened.	Pozabil bi, da se je to kdaj zgodilo.
I was never very good at it as a kid.	Nikoli nisem bil zelo dober v tem, kot otrok.
She never did that.	Tega nikoli ni storila.
You should see it too.	Tudi ti bi ga moral videti.
He knew very well.	Zelo dobro je vedel.
Sometimes he helps at home.	Včasih pomaga doma.
And for a while, that was the problem.	In nekaj časa je bil to problem.
There is nothing that can be done about it.	Nič se ne da narediti glede tega.
Now here is the reason.	Zdaj je tukaj razlog.
That's so true.	Toliko je res.
Just, not this one.	Samo, ne tega.
That would be difficult.	To bi bilo težko.
That's what he said.	To je rekel.
I wonder about that.	Sprašujem se o tem.
None of this here.	Nič od tega tukaj.
I am very happy to see this.	Zelo sem vesel tega videti.
I did wrong.	naredil sem narobe.
I didn't tell anyone what happened.	Nikomur nisem povedal, kaj se je zgodilo.
As he always was.	Kot je bil vedno.
So she never told him too much.	Zato mu ni nikoli rekla preveč.
I didn't go.	Jaz pa nisem šel.
He loved them all.	Vse jih je imel rad.
Not because we can't.	Ne zato, ker ne moremo.
I have my kids, you know.	Jaz imam svoje otroke, veš.
He's in trouble.	Ima težave.
You couldn't see anything.	Ničesar nisi mogel videti.
But it happened.	Vendar se je zgodilo.
It doesn't seem to help me.	Ne zdi se mi v pomoč.
He won't be back for a long time.	Dolgo se ne bo vrnil.
That's all fine.	Vse to je v redu.
You just.	Ti samo.
It has and.	Ima in.
Nothing really happened there.	Tam se res ni zgodilo nič.
This happened for the first time.	To se je zgodilo prvič.
I don't know if it's this one.	Ne vem, če je ta.
I hope so.	upam.
He told me no.	Rekel mi je ne.
It was very good for me.	Bilo mi je zelo dobro.
I do not like.	ni mi všeč.
I can't just get out.	Ne morem kar ven.
Could.	Lahko bi.
I knew he would never find it.	Vedel sem, da ga nikoli ne bo našel.
I will win for sure.	Zagotovo bom zmagal.
There's nothing there either.	Tudi tam ni ničesar.
Yes, he had.	Da, imel je.
He had a reason for it.	Imel je razlog za to.
I did it.	Naredil sem.
You know what it's about.	Saj veš za kaj gre.
It was better not to know.	Bolje je bilo ne vedeti.
He had nothing to say.	Ni imel ničesar povedati.
I would never forget him.	Nikoli ga ne bi pozabil.
Nothing for me.	Nič zame.
We knew that.	To smo vedeli.
And if she was there.	In če je bila tam.
But that is not enough.	A to še ni dovolj.
A long life is ahead of us.	Dolgo življenje je pred nami.
You are what you are.	Ti si to, kar si.
You're good at it.	Dober si v tem.
When he could, he helped.	Ko je lahko, je pomagal.
I will only tell her what she already knows.	Povedal ji bom le tisto, kar že ve.
You will come with us now.	Zdaj boš šel z nami.
What to do, what to do.	Kaj storiti, kaj storiti.
You will love these things.	Te stvari vam bodo všeč.
I could go to school if I wanted to.	Lahko bi šel v šolo, če bi hotel.
Again, no, it's not.	Še enkrat, ne, ni.
To help me.	Da bi mi pomagal.
I actually went to work.	Pravzaprav sem šel v službo.
And actually very difficult.	In pravzaprav zelo težko.
Don't talk so fast.	Ne govori tako hitro.
However, it is not obvious how to do better.	Ni pa očitno, kako narediti bolje.
For years, really.	Že leta, res.
Only he knew he was.	Le da je vedel, da je.
I am a man who has learned.	Jaz sem človek, ki se je naučil.
You have to help him.	Moraš mu pomagati.
But not here.	Vendar ne tukaj.
I'm here now.	Zdaj sem tukaj.
I won't talk about it anymore today.	Danes ne bom več govoril o tem.
You can't tell about it.	Ne moreš povedati o tem.
You've never seen him before.	Še nikoli ga niste videli.
I never saw myself having anything to do with it.	Nikoli se nisem videl, da bi imel kaj pri tem.
You will have to see.	Morali boste videti.
It could be us.	Lahko bi bili mi.
That possibility was there.	Ta možnost je bila tam.
And the next.	In naslednji.
I worked to get it back.	Delal sem, da bi mu vrnil.
It doesn't seem right to me.	Ne zdi se mi prav.
I mean, a lot.	Mislim, veliko.
I'll tell you what you think.	Povedal ti bom, kaj misliš.
I'm fine with that.	V redu sem s tem.
Now we have too many.	Zdaj imamo preveč.
He'll be here soon.	Kmalu bo tukaj.
He needs someone to do it for him.	Potrebuje nekoga, ki bo to naredil namesto njega.
That's enough time.	To je dovolj časa.
You don't know he's there anymore.	Ne veš, da je več tam.
I want to see you so badly.	Tako zelo te želim videti.
It's good for you.	Dober je zate.
Easy and hard.	Lahko in težko.
I'm sure that will be fine.	Prepričan sem, da bo to v redu.
There is something.	Nekaj ​​je.
What they care about is that money.	Kar jih zanima, je ta denar.
Don't tell him anything about me.	Ne povej mu ničesar o meni.
He was the one for me.	On je bil tisti zame.
Okay, maybe not.	Prav, morda ne.
But it probably won't.	Verjetno pa ne bo.
He doesn't want to go out.	Noče ven.
It's good, but not that good.	Dober je, a ne tako dober.
No one called me after that.	Po tem me ni nihče poklical.
Unfortunately, more and more people are doing just that.	Žal vse več ljudi počne prav to.
How to do that.	Kako do tega.
I know another one.	Poznam drugega.
It's early for me now.	Zdaj mi je zgodaj.
I shouldn't go yet.	Ne bi smel še iti.
There was still time to do something.	Še vedno je bil čas, da se nekaj naredi.
He couldn't help but see it.	Ni si mogel pomagati, da tega ne bi videl.
And maybe that's it.	In morda je to to.
That’s when I knew what was going on.	Takrat sem vedel, kaj se dogaja.
It was very hard, man.	Bilo je zelo težko, človek.
She went last night.	Sinoči je šla.
I should have known better.	Moral bi vedeti bolje.
It could never be.	Nikoli ne bi mogel biti.
Maybe he couldn't talk to you.	Mogoče ni mogel govoriti s tabo.
Only he left him.	Samo on ga je pustil.
Because he had to be ready for us.	Ker je moral biti pripravljen za nas.
Both are still here.	Oba sta še vedno tukaj.
However, it was not possible.	Vendar ni bilo mogoče.
I have nothing else to say.	Nimam drugega za povedati.
From now on, I will be your friend.	Od zdaj naprej bom tvoj prijatelj.
Nothing too much to say about it.	Nič preveč za povedati o tem.
That's not right.	To ni prav.
This is for you.	To je za vas.
Tell me.	Povej mi.
I have to make it look hard.	Moram narediti, da je videti težko.
The man is really there.	Človek je res tam.
He can't do that.	Tega ne more narediti.
He came back well.	Dobro se je vrnil.
That's why he's there.	Za to je tam.
You're the only one who would call me.	Ti si edini, ki bi me poklical.
You did everything.	Vse si naredil.
You did this to me.	To si mi naredil.
They knew this was it.	Vedeli so, da je to to.
That they were convinced.	Da so bili prepričani.
I knew that.	To sem vedel.
Now he really knows.	Zdaj res ve.
If ever.	Če je kdaj.
No, you didn't.	Ne, nisi.
I didn't talk about it.	Nisem govoril o tem.
I was in front of him.	Bil sem pred njim.
None of this is true.	Nič od tega ni res.
You are now.	Zdaj si.
She likes you.	Všeč si ji.
Much remains to be said.	Še veliko jih je treba povedati.
Maybe not tomorrow.	Mogoče ne jutri.
I need to see her.	Moram jo videti.
Sometimes it was very difficult.	Včasih je bilo zelo težko.
They had everything.	Imeli so vse.
What are they.	Kaj so.
My father died.	Moj oče je umrl.
She had to see him.	Morala ga je videti.
But it was fine.	Vendar je bilo v redu.
There are a lot of them.	Kar veliko jih je.
I can't be sure at all.	Sploh ne morem biti prepričan.
You could always.	Vedno bi se lahko.
She knew better than that.	Vedela je bolje kot to.
And she did.	In to je storila.
Neither does he.	Niti on ne.
He will never succeed.	Nikoli mu ne bo uspelo.
I heard about someone who could help.	Slišal sem za nekoga, ki bi lahko pomagal.
He has something you will love.	Ima nekaj, kar ti bo všeč.
But you could.	Lahko pa bi.
I've never seen him before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl.
This is not an issue here.	To pa tukaj ne gre za vprašanje.
When he said that.	Ko je to rekel.
I didn't hear myself talking.	Nisem se slišal govoriti.
We didn't do that.	Tega nismo storili.
He said nothing wrong.	Nič ni rekel narobe.
I hope it worked.	Upam, da je uspelo.
As if no one was home.	Kot da ne bi bilo nikogar doma.
If you know, you know.	Če veš, veš.
I liked them.	Všeč so mi bili.
Good.	Bom.
I would help you.	jaz bi ti pomagal.
You don't have to look good.	Ni treba videti dobro.
Maybe she was.	Mogoče je bila.
He bought me a lot of things.	Kupil mi je veliko stvari.
It was again.	Spet je bilo.
These are.	To so.
He had nowhere else to go.	Ni imel več kam iti.
It's not very nice.	Ni zelo lepo.
He seems to know things.	Zdi se, da ve za stvari.
And so it is.	In tako to.
Stop talking like that.	Ne govori več tako.
I really like it.	Res mi je všeč.
She wants to reach him.	Želi priti do njega.
I'm sorry about that this afternoon.	Žal mi je za to popoldne.
We have to do something.	Nekaj ​​moramo narediti.
Who knows how it got there.	Kdo ve, kako je prišel tam.
There were none.	Ni jih bilo.
It never is and it never will be.	Nikoli ni in nikoli ne bo.
Or early in the morning.	Ali zgodaj zjutraj.
We are here instead.	Namesto tega smo tukaj.
Just do it that way.	Samo naredi tako.
This man is so good at home.	Ta človek je tako dober doma.
It is what it is.	To je tisto, kar je.
I didn't really like it.	Ni mi bilo zelo všeč.
I saw for myself that it was so.	Sam sem videl, da je tako.
As you can.	Kot lahko.
None of us should ever.	Nihče od nas nikoli ne bi smel.
I wonder why this is so.	Sprašujem se, zakaj je temu tako.
It was the one he hadn’t seen before.	To je bil tisti, ki ga prej ni videl.
I asked you something else.	Še nekaj sem te vprašal.
I thought it was more than that.	Mislil sem, da je več kot to.
Not that we have much.	Ne da bi imeli veliko.
How nice that would be.	Kako lepo bi bilo to.
He wanted it too.	Tudi on je to želel.
Tell me now.	Povej mi zdaj.
He did not die quickly.	Ni hitro umrl.
He is a good child.	On je dober otrok.
I have time and money now.	Zdaj imam čas in denar.
We need to play better.	Moramo igrati bolje.
However, he refused to do so.	Vendar tega ni hotel storiti.
I do not know you.	ne poznam te.
Because something was wrong.	Ker je bilo nekaj narobe.
I don't want to help him.	Nočem mu pomagati.
I'll be fine	jaz bom v redu
I decided to do that.	Za to sem se odločil.
I will do my best not to sit down.	Naredil bom vse, da ne bom sedel.
Not even today.	Tudi danes ne.
You have to.	Moraš.
And, boy, do they ever.	In, fant, ali so sploh kdaj.
But maybe that wasn’t it.	Morda pa to ni bilo to.
Nobody wanted to do anything.	Nihče ni hotel narediti ničesar.
Money is time.	Denar je čas.
I know it has to be hard.	Vem, da mora biti težko.
Tired of people.	Utrujen od ljudi.
After that, who knows.	Po tem kdo ve.
Or maybe someday.	Ali pa morda kdaj.
And there is much more.	In še veliko je več.
What's more, he was alone again.	Še več, spet je bil sam.
And there is not much time.	In ni veliko časa.
Totally, completely and utterly wrong.	Popolnoma, popolnoma in popolnoma narobe.
I wouldn't leave.	Ne bi odšel.
Before that, actually.	Pred tem pravzaprav.
He still wasn't sure who it was.	Še vedno ni bil prepričan, kdo je to.
I could get my stuff.	Lahko bi dobil svoje stvari.
He's not coming back.	Ne pride več nazaj.
I don't know what to do.	Ne vem, kaj storiti.
I know where they are at home.	Vem, kje so doma.
here you are.	tukaj si.
This is really something.	To je res nekaj.
I hope tomorrow is a little better.	Upam, da bo jutri malo bolje.
There was also a child there.	Tam je bil tudi otrok.
I was just lucky.	Imel sem samo srečo.
Now we have to go.	Zdaj moramo iti.
In fact, he has to do it.	Pravzaprav mora to storiti.
We are not sure why this was the case.	Nismo prepričani, zakaj je bilo tako.
I know what.	vem kaj.
I'd rather die.	raje bi umrl.
It never would be.	Nikoli ne bi bilo.
It was fine here.	Tukaj je bilo v redu.
I would be home soon.	Kmalu bi bil doma.
It wasn't what he wanted.	Ni bilo tisto, kar je hotel.
You're gone.	Odšel si.
Yes and no.	Da in ne.
She said it wasn’t right because it happened so fast.	Rekla je, da to ni prav, ker se je zgodilo tako hitro.
I think there are a few things.	Mislim, da gre za nekaj stvari.
I'm glad you could come here.	Vesel sem, da si lahko prišel sem.
I want him to talk.	Želim, da govori.
Life isn't like that.	Življenje ni tako.
It can't be anything else.	Ne more biti nič drugega.
He will die here.	Tukaj bo umrl.
I think that's what makes life beautiful.	Mislim, da je to tisto, kar dela življenje lepo.
I'll start there.	Tam bom začel.
It was nice.	Lepo je bilo.
Maybe it was.	Mogoče je bilo.
I'm going with you.	grem s tabo.
Each of you.	Vsak od vas.
I mean seriously.	mislim resno.
This will happen to you.	To se ti bo zgodilo.
She never has to.	Nikoli ji ni treba.
I don't think anything else.	Nič drugega ne mislim.
What you are.	Kar si.
However, this does not need to be done.	Vendar tega ni treba storiti.
It's not true.	Ni res.
I do not understand you.	ne razumem te.
But it was.	Vendar je bilo.
We are back home now.	Zdaj smo nazaj domov.
Someone could do something, or they would.	Nekdo bi lahko nekaj naredil, ali bi.
If you do, you will have problems.	Če boste to storili, boste imeli težave.
I have nothing else to do.	Nimam kaj drugega za početi.
I have a lot of work.	Imam veliko dela.
That's right.	Tako prav ima.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
Nobody knows how.	Nihče ne ve, kako.
now.	zdaj.
The child knew that.	Otrok je to vedel.
That has them.	To jih ima.
This is not for you either.	Tudi to ni zate.
I would do that.	Jaz bi to naredil.
Which they did.	Kar so tudi storili.
He was sitting there.	Tam je sedel.
This is not possible in.	To ni mogoče v.
She says you asked her.	Pravi, ali si jo vprašal.
More than a lot.	Več kot veliko.
Nobody tonight.	Nocoj nikogar.
I want to see him now.	Zdaj ga želim videti.
That's how I sat.	Tako sem sedel.
Or not.	Ali pa ne.
I will not leave.	ne bom odšel.
And so enough for now.	In tako za zdaj dovolj.
But he didn't have to.	Vendar mu ni bilo treba.
There is no one because there was no one.	Nihče ni, ker ni bilo nikogar.
When you got it, you got it.	Ko si dobil, si dobil.
Money, money, money.	Denar, denar, denar.
Without anyone having time for something like that.	Ne da bi imel kdo čas za kaj takega.
This seems spot on.	Zdi se, da je to na mestu.
That's absolutely nice.	To je popolnoma lepo.
I just learned.	Pravkar sem se naučil.
I was better.	Bil sem boljši.
I never would.	Nikoli ne bi.
It may or may not be.	To je lahko ali pa ne.
He's more afraid of you than you are of him.	Bolj se boji tebe kot ti njega.
I won't get them.	Ne bom jih dobil.
He didn't want her.	Ni je hotel.
I'll be back soon.	Kmalu bom nazaj.
He didn't even ask.	Niti vprašal ni.
You know how it is.	Saj veš kako je.
I do not believe.	Ne verjamem.
Let it go on like this.	Naj gre tako naprej.
I am sure.	Prepričan sem.
That's what I want.	To je tisto, kar želim.
He knew what he needed.	Vedel je, kaj potrebuje.
And sometimes too.	In včasih tudi.
All too true.	Vse preveč res.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar.
It won't always be that way.	Ne bo vedno tako.
It was good to see him there.	Lepo ga je bilo videti tam.
I did this once.	To sem naredil enkrat.
I might be if it were me.	Morda bi bil, če bi bil jaz.
He sat down again.	Spet je sedel.
Maybe he's been here before.	Mogoče je že bil tukaj.
It would always be that way.	Vedno bi bilo tako.
This will be difficult.	To bo težko.
You're not even from here.	Sploh nisi od tukaj.
What do you think we should do.	Kaj mislite, da bi morali narediti.
He knew perfectly well.	Popolnoma je vedel.
But it's hard for me.	Vendar mi je težko.
I liked it because of it.	Všeč mi je bilo zaradi tega.
But I think it would be quite good.	Mislim pa, da bi bilo kar dobro.
I was really glad to see her.	Res sem bil vesel, da sem jo videl.
But no.	Vendar ne.
So much has happened.	Toliko se je zgodilo.
That's all.	To je vse.
And they were right.	In imeli so prav.
I can't help you.	ne morem ti pomagati.
I didn't see her at all.	Sploh je nisem videl.
For help.	Za pomoč.
I still can’t believe anyone would do that.	Še vedno ne morem verjeti, da bi kdo to storil.
However, timing was everything.	Vendar je bil čas vse.
He is surprised.	Je presenečen.
That may be good enough for me.	To je lahko dovolj dobro zame.
I see.	Vidim.
If	Če
It was no longer a game.	To ni bila več igra.
That is a lot.	To je veliko.
I was busy.	sem bil zaposlen.
They're just there.	Samo tam so.
He just has to play with me.	Mora se samo igrati z mano.
I have something.	Imam nekaj.
This only needs to be done once.	To je treba storiti samo enkrat.
We had a few of them ourselves.	Tudi sami smo jih imeli nekaj.
I didn't find anything.	Nič nisem našel.
And there he waited.	In tam je čakal.
Maybe that too.	Mogoče tudi to.
That's a good question.	To je dobro vprašanje.
i really believe in it.	res verjamem v to.
Tell me how you found him.	Povej mi, kako si ga našel.
Obviously so.	Očitno je tako.
They just did it and that was it.	To so preprosto naredili in to je bilo to.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da nima.
I believe we all are.	Verjamem, da smo vsi.
More of that, please.	Več tega, prosim.
He is the only one who has it.	On je edini, ki ga ima.
I haven't heard that yet.	Tega še nisem slišal.
You will know everything.	Vse boš vedel.
This is simply true.	To je preprosto res.
What's wrong with you, he seems to be saying.	Kaj je narobe s tabo, se zdi, da pravi.
I do this a lot.	To počnem veliko.
We all have them.	Vsi jih imamo.
I'll do it and you have to go.	Jaz bom to naredil in ti moraš iti.
It was very difficult.	Bilo je zelo težko.
They were once like us.	Nekoč so bili kot mi.
Without needing it.	Ne da bi ga potreboval.
He had everything.	Imel je vse.
And that may be true.	In to je morda res.
probably.	verjetno.
I said good.	rekel sem dobro.
It was all wrong.	Vse to je bilo narobe.
Now tell me.	Zdaj pa povej.
He said nothing about it.	O tem ni rekel nič.
I'm not so sure anymore.	Nisem več tako prepričan.
Here we are.	Tukaj smo.
I’m so glad she did.	Tako sem vesel, da je to storila.
Maybe he can't tell me how it is.	Morda mi ne zna povedati, kako je.
This was not usually the case.	To običajno ni bilo tako.
Make it hard to come if you have to.	Naj bo težko priti, če je treba.
I think that could be a problem.	Mislim, da bi to lahko bil problem.
Almost three years already.	Že skoraj tri leta.
No one had anything to say.	Nihče ni imel ničesar za povedati.
I'm going to a party.	grem na zabavo.
And it was.	In bilo je.
I really liked it.	Bilo mi je zelo všeč.
I think you're right.	Mislim, da imaš prav.
He might be right.	Morda ima prav.
Therefore, from	Zato od.
He has to do it.	To mora storiti.
As it should.	Kot mora.
I know you would.	Vem, da bi.
But there will be something.	Bo pa nekaj.
ven.	ven.
I'll give him the money.	Dal mu bom denar.
They simply do not exist.	Preprosto jih ni.
And we already are.	In že smo.
He was all that.	Bil je vse to.
He liked that.	To mu je bilo všeč.
He had a place to be.	Imel je kje biti.
This is not true.	To ni res.
We also don’t know which of these is.	Tudi mi ne vemo, kaj od tega je.
That's the question here.	To je tukaj vprašanje.
She was and they are.	Bila je in so se.
Here's the money.	Tukaj je denar.
He doesn't know about me.	On ne ve zame.
I do not understand that.	Tega ne razumem.
It happened to me.	Zgodilo se mi je.
Apparently there was something else she didn’t like.	Očitno je bilo še nekaj, kar ji ni bilo všeč.
This would be nice.	To bi bilo lepo.
That's how it should be.	Tako je treba.
.	.
That's what she said.	Tako je rekla.
How did this happen? 	Kako se je to zgodilo?
It has its own way of working.	Ima svoj način dela.
We have to play well.	Moramo igrati dobro.
Or you had one.	Ali pa ste ga imeli.
But nothing worked.	A nič ni uspelo.
I have a job.	Imam delo.
There was a child.	Tam je bil otrok.
I knew it was now or never.	Vedel sem, da je zdaj ali nikoli.
No one could.	Nihče ni mogel.
That was a good day.	To je bil dober dan.
But there are so few of them.	Vendar jih je tako malo.
We can't do that.	Tega ne moremo storiti.
It really is that simple.	Res je tako preprosto.
We didn't have that.	Pri nas tega ni bilo.
This is you.	To si ti.
I just was.	Samo bil sem.
He started.	Začel je.
If not today, then tomorrow.	Če ne danes, pa jutri.
This is not a game.	To ni igra.
There is nothing like that.	Nič drugega ni kot to.
That was me too.	To sem bil tudi jaz.
I wasn't the only one.	Nisem bil edini.
He still hadn't decided what to do.	Še vedno se ni odločil, kaj naj naredi.
You never have to do that.	Tega ni treba nikoli storiti.
You've done this to me before.	To si mi naredil že prej.
Again, he seemed to know what he needed.	Spet se je zdelo, da ve, kaj potrebuje.
She didn't know who the father was.	Ni vedela, kdo je oče.
Good thing he did.	Dobro je, da je to storil.
It worked.	Uspelo je.
We seem to have.	Zdi se, da imamo.
There is no money.	Ni denarja.
You were right.	Imel si prav.
He was sure of that.	O tem je bil prepričan.
In fact, she had been there for some time.	Pravzaprav je bila tam že nekaj časa.
By now, everyone knew why.	Do zdaj so vsi vedeli zakaj.
That's what I said to myself.	To sem si rekel.
I did my job.	Svoje delo sem opravil.
In fact, it's even more unlikely.	Pravzaprav je to še bolj malo verjetno.
I don't like what's going on here.	Ni mi všeč, kaj se tukaj dogaja.
You better know that.	Bolje, da to veš.
We don't know why.	Ne vemo zakaj.
But he never seems to have succeeded.	A zdi se, da mu to nikoli ni uspelo.
I had a very good time.	Imel sem se zelo dobro.
That happened.	To se je zgodilo.
I don't think so.	Mislim, da ne bo.
It's mine now.	Zdaj je moj.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
I am very sorry.	Zelo mi je žal.
This needs to be done for me.	To je treba narediti zame.
Now you are alone.	Zdaj si sam.
It took me a long time to find this car.	Dolgo sem potreboval, da sem našel ta avto.
Dad came home.	Oče je prišel domov.
No one knows how you got there.	Nihče ne ve, kako si prišel tja.
That seems like a lot.	To se zdi veliko.
He needs you.	Potrebuje te.
I can't help it.	Ne morem pomagati.
He says he needs to talk to me.	Pravi, da mora govoriti z mano.
That's much better.	To je veliko bolje.
I was the one who found her.	Jaz sem bil tisti, ki jo je našel.
It's still early.	Še vedno je zgodaj.
I just need a chance.	Potrebujem samo priložnost.
He was no longer human.	Ni bil več človek.
And seriously.	In resno.
If he stayed long enough.	Če bi ostal dovolj dolgo.
He told me that himself.	To mi je povedal sam.
It's all there.	Vse je tam.
And it seems not.	In zdi se, da ni.
He wanted to see her.	Želel jo je videti.
This is actually a bit of a first time for me.	To je zame pravzaprav malo prvič.
But we can and should do more.	Vendar lahko in bi morali storiti več.
I thought you realized that.	Mislil sem, da si to spoznal.
No, he's gone.	Ne, ni ga več.
You will not do that.	Tega ne boš storil.
He was my father.	Bil je moj oče.
They are not in town yet.	V mestu jih še ni.
I don’t know where he is and what he’s doing.	Ne vem, kje je in kaj počne.
No, it really isn't.	Ni, res ni.
That may be true.	To je morda res.
I'm all for it.	Jaz sem za to.
That was.	To je bilo.
No, it's not good.	Ne, ni dobro.
you are mine.	ti si moj.
This comes now.	To pride zdaj.
Only a few things could happen.	Samo nekaj stvari se je lahko zgodilo.
You just had to know.	Preprosto si moral vedeti.
I have never been so happy to see them.	Še nikoli nisem bil tako vesel, da sem jih videl.
I was there for that.	Bil sem tam zaradi tega.
None of us came back.	Nihče od nas se ni vrnil.
You don’t have to do that.	Tega vam ni treba storiti.
For me, it is what it is.	Zame je to, kar je.
This is not my father.	To ni moj oče.
You gave us home.	Dal si nam domov.
This is difficult to do.	To je težko narediti.
This way you are like me.	Na ta način si kot jaz.
I knew you would come.	Vedel sem, da boš prišel.
All that.	Vse to.
you mean it.	resno misliš.
You were sitting here.	Sedel si tukaj.
Maybe better than she knew herself.	Morda bolje, kot je vedela sama.
It simply isn't.	Preprosto ni.
He did a really nice job.	Opravil je res lepo delo.
You should still be, or someone will hear about it.	Še vedno bi moral biti, ali pa bo kdo slišal za to.
She'll never know he's gone.	Nikoli ne bo vedela, da ga ni več.
You did it, boy.	Naredil si, fant.
He simply failed to do so.	To mu preprosto ni uspelo.
I thought there were only a few.	Mislil sem, da jih je le nekaj.
And they did.	In to so storili.
When you saw him there and you knew.	Ko ste ga videli tam in ste vedeli.
Nobody wanted them.	Nihče jih ni hotel.
It was hard to know for sure.	Težko je bilo vedeti zagotovo.
And more.	In več.
I can't talk to him.	Ne morem govoriti z njim.
If not.	Če pa ni tako.
I went for it.	Šla sem na to.
Now she is gone.	Zdaj je ni več.
He just knows.	Samo ve.
But I think it was more than that.	Mislim pa, da je bilo več kot to.
He did a good job.	Opravil je dobro delo.
Not that there would be a problem with that.	Saj ne, da bi bil s tem problem.
You're here with me.	Tukaj si z mano.
I'm not interested in anything.	Nič me ne zanima.
You, if necessary.	Ti, če bo treba.
I want to know what happened.	Želim vedeti, kaj se je zgodilo.
He had never been there before.	Nikoli prej ni bil tam.
He did not return soon.	Kmalu se ni vrnil.
I want that soon.	Želim si to kmalu.
No, he didn't even ask.	Ne, niti vprašal.
What he does.	Kar počne.
It seemed to be.	Zdelo se je, da je.
No one asked me to see her today.	Nihče me ni prosil, da bi jo danes videl.
No one asked him.	Nihče ga ni vprašal.
And you should too.	In tudi ti bi moral.
You couldn't see them.	Nisi jih mogel videti.
What else can.	Kaj drugega lahko.
I wonder if he ever got it.	Zanima me, če ga je kdaj dobil.
I just know that.	Samo to vem.
That he will succeed.	Da mu bo uspelo.
I can't tell you what.	Ne morem ti povedati kaj.
Even life itself.	Tudi življenje samo.
He doesn't do anything.	On ne dela ničesar.
Just as a thing.	Samo kot stvar.
I'm sure of that.	V to sem prepričan.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
You should be here.	Moral bi biti tukaj.
Nobody says that.	Tega nihče ne pravi.
And decided not to do anything.	In se odločil, da ne bo naredil ničesar.
Here are some thoughts.	Tukaj je nekaj misli.
It's not enough.	Ni dovolj.
He asked what had happened.	Vprašal je, kaj se je zgodilo.
Just to let him do it.	Samo da bi mu to pustil.
It doesn't work that way.	Tako ne gre.
Do it for me, please, she said.	Naredi to zame, prosim, je rekla.
It's back.	Pa je nazaj.
You want him so badly.	Tako zelo si ga želiš.
That was hard.	To je bilo težko.
It's really very good.	Res je zelo dobro.
None of this was good.	Nič od tega ni bilo dobro.
He knew that too.	To je tudi vedel.
I thought that was nice.	Mislil sem, da je to lepo.
This is a really good thing.	To je res dobra stvar.
A lot.	Veliko.
He said he liked it.	Rekel je, da mu je to všeč.
He doesn't know who you are yet.	On še ne ve, kdo si.
Now that's not the case.	Zdaj temu ni tako.
That would be it.	To bi bilo vse.
That was a good thing.	To je bila dobra stvar.
I just had to eat.	Samo jesti sem moral.
If so, it can't be helped.	Če je tako, se ne da pomagati.
I don't care what.	Ne zanima me kaj.
They had a.	Imeli so a.
I think you should come home.	Mislim, da moraš priti domov.
We have to go.	Moramo iti.
He didn't want to get there.	Ni hotel priti tja.
We never knew why.	Nikoli nismo vedeli zakaj.
We have to move on.	Moramo iti naprej.
He was there for a few days.	Tam je bil nekaj dni.
That would be tomorrow.	To bi bilo jutri.
There's a lot going on.	Veliko se dogaja.
Yes, she wanted more.	Da, želela je več.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
Without thinking it was wrong.	Ne da bi mislil, da je narobe.
I had to.	Moral sem.
I needed him to know.	Potreboval sem, da ve.
We did it on our own.	Naredili smo po svoje.
So that might not be the real reason for it.	Zato to morda ni pravi razlog za to.
Maybe I more than liked it.	Mogoče mi je bila več kot všeč.
Maybe it was him.	Mogoče je bil on.
This is not an option for us.	Za nas to ni možnost.
We did very well with what we had.	Naredili smo zelo dobro glede na to, kar smo imeli.
We know you are.	Vemo, da si.
None of us are going home tomorrow.	Jutri ne gre nihče od nas domov.
Years, years, years.	Leta, leta, leta.
I'm a little tired of it.	Malo sem že utrujen od tega.
That's what my father used to say.	Tako je govoril moj oče.
I myself see nothing wrong with that.	Sam ne vidim nič narobe s tem.
No one ever came back.	Nihče se ni nikoli vrnil.
So we had a really good time.	Tako da nam je bilo res dobro.
Few looked really good.	Malo jih je bilo videti res dobro.
I have to go home.	Moram domov.
The sooner he knew the better.	Prej ko je vedel, bolje je.
What is it? 	Kaj je to?
Right after he talked to you.	Takoj po tem, ko je govoril s tabo.
I just don't know where they are.	Ne vem samo kje so.
No, that's not right.	Ne, to ni prav.
Maybe that's why.	Mogoče zato.
, is alone.	, sam je.
You had to leave and so it was.	Moral si oditi in tako je bilo.
I don't know what will happen.	Ne vem, kaj se bo zgodilo.
He never said what it was.	Nikoli ni rekel, kaj je bilo.
It wasn't that long ago.	Ni bilo tako dolgo nazaj.
I was there.	Bil sem tam.
You should know that.	To bi moral vedeti.
We like what we like.	Všeč nam je, kar nam je všeč.
Just like things are.	Tako kot so stvari.
Do it quickly.	Naredi to hitro.
He didn't want to know yet.	Ni hotel, da še ve.
I am not sure.	Nisem prepričan.
No one wanted to buy this thing.	Nihče ni hotel kupiti te stvari.
It is not the way it is with us.	Pri nas ni tako, kot je.
He's probably had them for a while.	Verjetno jih ima že nekaj časa.
I think we now know why.	Mislim, da zdaj vemo zakaj.
That wouldn't be true.	To ne bi bilo res.
He actually found them.	Pravzaprav jih je našel.
It already happened.	Zgodilo se je že.
It seemed easy to him.	Zdelo se mu je lahko.
I thought so fast.	Tako hitro sem mislil.
I could go to school.	Lahko bi šel v šolo.
It goes with us.	To gre z nami.
I'll start.	Začel bom.
I was for.	Bil sem za.
It's hard to leave.	Težko je oditi.
No, it's true.	Ne, res je.
As he was, he was not.	Kot je bil, ni bil.
It's not hard or nothing.	Ni težko ali nič.
Or he thinks he knows.	Ali pa misli, da ve.
He's not here.	Ni ga tukaj.
I really had nothing to do with it.	Res nisem imel nič s tem.
Probably not.	Verjetno ga ni.
You're back.	Vrnil si se.
I think so.	mislim da.
I used to.	Včasih sem.
You will die and so will everyone you love.	Umrl boš in tudi vsi, ki jih imaš rad.
Has anyone else seen this.	Je še kdo videl to.
You're welcome.	Ni za kaj.
He simply cannot believe that such a thing exists.	Preprosto ne more verjeti, da kaj takega obstaja.
And it worked.	In to je uspelo.
I wasn't so sure.	Nisem bil tako prepričan.
He was my father.	Bil je moj oče.
He returned the next day and the next day.	Vrnil se je naslednji dan in naslednji dan.
There were many more.	Bilo jih je veliko več.
But they are nowhere to be seen.	Vendar jih ni videti.
None of us wanted that.	Tega si nihče od nas ni želel.
Nobody won.	Nihče ni zmagal.
I told him we weren't going to do that.	Rekel sem mu, da tega ne bomo storili.
You did everything right.	Vse si naredil prav.
He wasn't happy about it.	Ni bil vesel tega.
You didn't do that.	Tega nisi storil.
And that day will be better than today.	In ta dan bo boljši kot danes.
You were very helpful.	Zelo ste bili v pomoč.
No one knows where to go.	Nihče ne ve, kam naj gre.
You can tonight.	Lahko nocoj.
I said no, just a little.	Rekel sem ne, samo malo.
He knew that.	To je vedel.
If he comes back, we'll know it.	Če se bo vrnil, bomo to vedeli.
You won't regret it.	Ne bo vam žal.
you are better.	ti si boljši.
What is it?	Kaj je gre.
This is actually a good thing.	To je pravzaprav dobra stvar.
Not him, not now.	Ne on, ne zdaj.
Everything goes well for him.	Vse mu gre.
But I can't say anything from that.	Iz tega pa ne morem povedati ničesar.
I would never allow that.	Tega nikoli ne bi dovolil.
He also sings all the time.	Ves čas tudi poje.
You saw it then.	Takrat ste videli.
He also knew when.	Vedel je tudi, kdaj.
If necessary, it cannot be helped.	Če je treba, ni mogoče pomagati.
When is the right time.	Ko je pravi čas.
Every day now.	Vsak dan zdaj.
That's what it does.	To je tisto, kar počne.
That was not it.	To ni bilo to.
You have to go.	Moraš iti.
He wasn't really all there.	Ni bil res ves tam.
I think it will.	Mislim, da bo.
I hope all is well with you.	Upam, da je pri vas vse v redu.
He didn't really know why.	Pravzaprav ni vedel zakaj.
There is no time today.	Danes ni časa.
He kept talking.	Še naprej je govoril.
He was such a good father.	Bil je tako dober oče.
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
You're fine.	V redu si.
I will not forget.	ne bom pozabil.
Maybe I'll make it.	Morda mi bo to uspelo.
You really helped me.	Res si mi pomagal.
I had enough.	Imel sem dovolj.
My car isn't going.	Moj avto ne gre.
He didn't see anyone.	Nikogar ni videl.
Maybe he didn't want to talk about it.	Morda o tem ni želel govoriti.
I continued to work with him.	Še naprej sem delal z njim.
I have to do this.	To moram storiti.
She would be there soon.	Kmalu bi bila tam.
With .	Z .
He knew when he would be home.	Vedel je, kdaj bo doma.
I don’t know how to do anything else.	Ne vem, kako narediti kaj drugega.
Everyone does something for the first time.	Vsak naredi nekaj prvič.
No one knows what it is.	Nihče ne ve, kaj je.
All this we.	Vse to mi.
It has its own way of working.	Ima svoj način dela.
And that's fine.	In to je v redu.
It was a game, if it was a game.	To je bila igra, če je bila igra.
My question was simple.	Moje vprašanje je bilo preprosto.
He had never asked before.	Nikoli prej ni vprašal.
It was hard.	Bilo je težko.
Don't talk to me at all.	Sploh ne govori z mano.
You will definitely like it.	Zagotovo vam bo všeč.
And he likes that.	In to mu je všeč.
You don't know what they will do.	Ne veš, kaj bodo naredili.
When anyone knew.	Ko je kdo vedel.
They still weren't there.	Še vedno jih ni bilo.
Even if I could, I wouldn't.	Tudi če bi lahko, ne bi.
Just like that.	Kar tako.
It can't be.	To ne more biti.
I don’t have kids, but I would love to have them.	Nimam otrok, a bi jih rad imel.
That had to be done.	To je bilo treba storiti.
It's that simple.	To je tisto preprosto.
I'm doing well.	Dobro mi gre.
.	.
Simple as that.	Tako preprosto.
They're almost there.	Skoraj so tam.
Maybe not for the money.	Morda ni za denar.
She wanted to go.	Želela je iti.
How will it feel to me.	Kako se mi bo zdelo.
I'd like to come back.	Rad bi se vrnil.
there you are.	tam ste.
He's by my side now.	Zdaj je ob meni.
But he failed.	Vendar mu ni uspelo.
I tried to do it and I failed.	Poskušal sem to narediti in mi ni uspelo.
Maybe not.	Mogoče pa ne.
That you had something to say.	Da si imel kaj povedati.
I still am.	še vedno sem.
If you have a job.	Če imaš službo.
I have to work.	Moram delati.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
He is glad to have them back.	Vesel je, da jih ima nazaj.
You probably should.	Verjetno bi moral.
You were there then.	Takrat si bil tam.
I think the car did its thing.	Mislim, da je avto opravil svoje.
It still is.	Še vedno je.
Too many years.	Preveč let.
No time.	Ni časa.
He didn't ask what happened to him.	Ni vprašal, kaj se mu je zgodilo.
But she said nothing more.	Vendar ni rekla nič več.
he thought.	mislil je.
I wanted to say a few things about that.	Želel sem povedati nekaj stvari o tem.
Something was good.	Nekaj ​​je bilo dobro.
It probably couldn't have been any better.	Verjetno ni bilo nič bolje.
I'm sure you know that.	Prepričan sem, da to veš.
Because you should.	Ker bi moral.
It could be a problem.	Lahko bi bil problem.
This is wrong, so wrong.	To je narobe, tako narobe.
You were right too.	Tudi ti si imel prav.
That's how he came here.	Tako je prišel sem.
i feel at home.	počutim se kot doma.
Not after.	Ne po.
It's okay.	V redu gre.
I made it myself.	Naredil sem ga sam.
He didn't teach us that.	Tega nas ni naučil.
None of this will be easy.	Nič od tega ne bo lahko.
I still have it too.	Tudi jaz ga imam še vedno.
She has it.	Ima jo.
It was like that with us.	Pri nas je bilo tako.
No one is sure what to do with it.	Nihče ni prepričan, kaj naj naredi s tem.
Yes, it happened.	Da, zgodilo se je.
He knew what was what.	Vedel, kaj je kaj.
What else could he have done.	Kaj drugega je lahko storil.
I never did.	nikoli nisem.
I got it today.	Danes sem ga dobil.
I believe in these things.	Verjamem v te stvari.
I have a reason for that.	imam razlog za to.
And it’s really hard.	In to je res težko.
Sometimes that helps.	Včasih to pomaga.
She had to know for sure.	Morala je vedeti zagotovo.
He's been there for a while.	Tam je že nekaj časa.
You can't go yet.	Ne moreš še iti.
I just want to be alone.	Samo želim biti sam.
Until then, he had failed.	Do takrat mu ni uspelo.
We don't know what happened.	Ne vemo, kaj se je zgodilo.
But no one seemed happy about it.	A zdelo se je, da nihče ni bil vesel tega.
This is a difficult question.	To je težko vprašanje.
Because that's what I do.	Ker to počnem.
You don't know what it is.	Ne veš, kaj je.
It's too much here.	Tukaj je preveč.
I called them.	Poklical sem jih.
Too much is happening to you.	Preveč se vam dogaja.
That's him.	To je on.
If only he had.	Ko bi le imel.
He knows you don't like it, and he's made up his mind.	Ve, da ti to ni všeč, in se je odločil.
I want to be that.	Rad bi bil to.
I loved her so much.	Tako sem jo imel rad.
I'm still asking for help.	Še vedno prosim za pomoč.
It's just hard.	To je samo težko.
I'll call him.	Poklical ga bom.
She does it herself.	To dela sama.
No one will tell me.	Nihče mi ne bo povedal.
You were there.	Bili ste tam.
Hotel.	Hotel.
Everything is fine.	Vse je v redu.
He went to school.	Šel v šolo.
It will probably be early tonight.	Verjetno bo nocoj zgodaj.
I don't know what they are for.	Ne vem za kaj so.
It used to not be like that.	Včasih ni bilo tako.
We know that for sure.	To zagotovo vemo.
A lot of people said it was.	Veliko ljudi je rekel, da je.
I believe we will succeed.	Verjamem, da nam bo to uspelo.
I don't want that for anyone.	Tega ne želim nikomur.
No one told him anything.	Nihče mu ni povedal ničesar.
We are not.	Nismo.
Everyone saw what happened.	Vsi so videli, kaj se je zgodilo.
I wasn’t sure there for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa nisem bil prepričan tam.
But often not.	Vendar pogosto ne.
But he knew he wasn't.	Vendar je vedel, da ni.
It's not my job.	To ni moje delo.
All day, three days.	Ves dan, tri dni.
It was good to be prepared.	Bilo je dobro biti pripravljen.
I can't work.	Ne morem delati.
I go out and see what happens.	Grem ven in vidim kaj se bo zgodilo.
Let it work for you.	Naj dela za vas.
I think there is more to it.	Mislim, da je na tem še več.
Everyone will help.	Vsak bo pomagal.
I would have died if I had never seen her again.	Umrl bi, če je ne bi nikoli več videl.
So it seems.	Tako se zdi.
I knew we would.	Vedel sem, da bomo.
I just wanted you to know.	Hotel sem samo, da veš.
I would be back the next day.	Naslednji dan bi se vrnil.
I hope this one might help.	Upam, da bo ta morda pomagal.
In fact, let.	Pravzaprav, naj.
He heard me.	Slišal me je.
He was there.	Tam je bil.
There's no time for that.	Ni časa za to.
Or we are.	Ali pa smo.
No one saw him.	Nihče ga ni videl.
He won't be ready.	Ne bo pripravljen.
That can't be true.	To ne more biti res.
But it could be even better than it is.	Lahko pa bi bilo še bolje, kot je.
Or not.	Ali pa ne.
In a way, yes.	Na način, da.
Something just seemed.	Nekaj ​​se je samo zdelo.
Now there is something.	Zdaj je nekaj.
It must be soon.	Kmalu mora biti.
Maybe it is now.	Morda je zdaj.
He can never know that.	Tega ne more nikoli vedeti.
Now I know none of that is true.	Zdaj vem, da nič od tega ni res.
Sometimes more a day.	Včasih več na dan.
This has already happened.	To se je že zgodilo.
He decided.	Odločil se je.
You came home.	Prišel si domov.
All the time actually.	Pravzaprav ves čas.
I said.	sem rekel.
I'm just surprised.	Samo presenečen sem.
Because it's not true.	Ker ni res.
And it wasn't good.	In ni bilo dobro.
He plays well.	Dobro igra.
I understand each other very well.	Zelo dobro se razumem.
I think we did it.	Mislim, da smo to storili.
I waited long enough.	Čakal sem dovolj dolgo.
Now and always.	Zdaj in vedno.
Maybe it's better that way.	Mogoče je tako bolje.
No, that can't be, she told herself.	Ne, to ne more biti, si je rekla.
It's nothing.	Ni nič.
That may have been helpful.	To je bilo morda v pomoč.
I'm almost there.	Skoraj sem tam.
I loved this car.	Všeč mi je bil ta avto.
I know where he is.	Vem kje je.
The more, the better.	Več kot je, bolje je.
He gave it to me.	Dal mi ga je.
He is not.	On ni.
But I understand why.	Razumem pa zakaj.
I'm here to have a nice time.	Tukaj sem, da se imam lepo.
We were right there.	Tam smo imeli prav.
The time has come.	Prišel je čas.
I didn't know he'd be here.	Nisem vedel, da bo tukaj.
He was good to me.	Bil je dober do mene.
He has lived there ever since.	Od takrat živi tam.
That could be better.	To je lahko bolje.
You did it as a father.	To si storil kot oče.
Really, too.	Tudi res.
Now he had her.	Zdaj jo je imel.
But he was not the only one.	Vendar ni bil edini.
And it's not time yet.	In še ni čas.
I didn't tell him anything.	Nič mu nisem rekel.
To do something.	Za nekaj narediti.
Someone in that room did it.	Nekdo v tisti sobi je to storil.
Im asking for help.	Prosim za pomoč.
I needed something else.	Potreboval sem nekaj drugega.
Do not speak.	Ne govori.
But he failed.	Vendar mu ni uspelo.
That's all I wanted to tell you.	Samo to sem ti hotel povedati.
Well, not that it will be either way.	Pa ne, da bo tako ali tako.
Maybe that's why he did so well.	Mogoče mu je zato tako dobro uspelo.
It's just.	To je samo.
He did not know where he was and what he was.	Ni vedel, kje je in kaj je.
I won't tell you anything like that.	Ne bom ti rekel nič takega.
He had to say something.	Nekaj ​​je moral povedati.
I liked him.	Všeč mi je bil.
Don't talk about it anymore.	Ne govori več o tem.
I was waiting for someone.	Čakal sem nekoga.
That's the only way.	To je edini način.
I gave you some things.	Dal sem ti nekaj stvari.
I really wish I would, you know.	Res si želim, da bi, veš.
I hadn't done that before.	Prej tega nisem storil.
You could be it.	Lahko bi bili to.
Until then, you will sit there and not talk.	Do takrat boš sedel tam in ne boš govoril.
There was no one here.	Tukaj ni bilo nikogar.
Home again now.	Zdaj spet doma.
That's my father.	To je moj oče.
If only he could see me now.	Ko bi me le zdaj videl.
He has a lot of them.	Ima jih veliko.
If I wanted to.	Če bi hotel.
Did he hear my question? 	Je slišal moje vprašanje?
I never came back.	Nikoli se nisem vrnil.
He lives well.	Dobro živi.
But it didn't take long.	A ni potreboval veliko časa.
It doesn't seem possible.	Ne zdi se mogoče.
Maybe it will happen and maybe it will happen soon.	Morda se bo zgodilo in morda se bo zgodilo kmalu.
And then he meant it.	In takrat je resno mislil.
That's how he has to play.	Tako mora igrati.
I didn't try to do that.	Tega nisem poskušal narediti.
I'm going to get to that now.	Zdaj bom prišel do tega.
And there are many.	In veliko jih je.
I knew you would find me.	Vedel sem, da me boš našel.
We will do what we will do.	Naredili bomo, kar bomo storili.
It has to be here, it has to be there.	To mora biti tukaj, to mora biti tam.
And here is the reason.	In tukaj je razlog.
He did what he had to do to win.	Naredil je, kar je moral, da je zmagal.
Just as you are now.	Tako, kot si pravkar.
A lot has happened since then.	Od takrat se je zgodilo veliko.
But they had money.	Vendar so imeli denar.
Because it doesn't exist.	Ker ne obstaja.
Man.	Človek.
I'm going out tonight.	Nocoj grem ven.
And that was enough.	A dovolj je bilo.
Whether you like it or not is not the question.	Ali vam je všeč ali ne, ni vprašanje.
We have years.	Imamo že leta.
Now you know why.	Zdaj veš zakaj.
So he left.	Zato je pustil.
I'd rather have them here.	Raje bi jih imel tukaj.
That could really be so.	To bi lahko bilo res tako.
From there.	Od tam.
How can they be.	Kako so lahko.
I'll have them, please.	Imel jih bom, prosim.
They were gone now.	Zdaj jih ni bilo več.
That's a lot too.	Tudi to je veliko.
I'm not afraid.	Ne bojim se.
I could tell.	Lahko bi rekel.
You will love this one.	Ta ti bo všeč.
If only it were.	Samo da je bilo.
I think he likes it.	Mislim, da mu je všeč.
Boy did that work.	Fant, to je uspelo.
Today was me.	Danes sem bil jaz.
Something wasn't right.	Nekaj ​​ni bilo res.
That was not true either.	Tudi to ni bilo res.
Tell me where she went.	Povej mi, kam je šla.
It was not as it is now.	Ni bilo tako, kot je zdaj.
That was a big help.	To je bilo v veliko pomoč.
He could see her.	Lahko jo je videl.
So we'll be fine.	Tako da bomo v redu.
I had to know.	Moral sem vedeti.
However, nothing more needed to be done.	Vendar ni bilo treba storiti ničesar več.
I want to die, but I can't.	Rad bi umrl, a ne gre.
He still feels good.	Še vedno se počuti dobro.
I don’t ask why she did it.	Ne sprašujem, zakaj je to storila.
This is currently not the case.	To trenutno ni tako.
If I did, I could talk.	Če bi, bi lahko govoril.
Now we know why.	Zdaj vemo zakaj.
It was simple.	Bilo je preprosto.
That is what we can and must do today.	To je tisto, kar lahko in moramo storiti danes.
Obviously something was wrong.	Očitno je bilo nekaj narobe.
He didn't say that.	Tega ni rekel.
Now it has happened.	Zdaj se je zgodilo.
He wasn't there himself.	Sam ga ni bilo tam.
That seems like.	To se zdi kot.
I just wanted you to think that.	Hotel sem samo, da to misliš.
Maybe until tomorrow or more.	Mogoče do jutri ali več.
I do not understand why.	Ne razumem zakaj.
It's just there.	Samo tam je.
He was like.	Bil je kot.
Apparently that's no longer the case.	Očitno ni več tako.
I can't do anything on my own.	Sam ne morem nič.
There is nothing else.	Nič drugega ni.
He will be fine.	On bo v redu.
He won and lost.	Zmagal je in izgubil.
I couldn't see anyone.	Nikogar nisem mogel videti.
Because it could just be.	Ker bi lahko bilo samo.
You will be well enough.	Dovolj boš dobro.
I could stay home.	Lahko bi ostal doma.
He loved her very much.	Zelo jo je imel rad.
That's a long time.	To je dolgo časa.
I haven't been back for quite some time.	Kar nekaj časa se nisem vrnil.
Nobody.	Nihče.
I bought three.	Kupil sem tri.
I didn’t know what he was doing there.	Nisem vedel, kaj počne tam.
Sometimes he wants that.	Včasih si to želi.
I can't take long.	Ne morem več dolgo.
I saw that right away.	To sem takoj videl.
I understand what you mean.	Razumem, kaj misliš.
And she knew.	In vedela je.
And thoughts.	In misli.
Thus, one is not ready to help.	Tako človek ni pripravljen pomagati.
I had a lot of work to do.	Imel sem veliko dela.
That's it for you.	To je tisto za vas.
I left him there.	Tam sem ga pustil.
He just went with it.	Samo šel je z njim.
I wouldn't want to ask him for anything.	Ne bi ga rad nič prosil.
That's it.	To je tisto.
There was no telling what they would do to him.	Ni bilo vedeti, kaj mu bodo storili.
It looked very good.	Videti je bilo zelo dobro.
Maybe so.	Morda je tako.
We have it here.	Tukaj ga imamo.
There's a lot going on this week.	Ta teden je veliko.
And yet.	Pa vendar.
But she knew the time had come.	A vedela je, da je prišel čas.
That's really not true.	To res ni res.
She was always in me.	Vedno je bila v meni.
I really like this job.	To delo mi je zelo všeč.
I hope tomorrow will be a better day.	Upam, da bo jutri boljši dan.
I don’t know why this happened.	Ne vem, zakaj se je to zgodilo.
I found him quickly.	Hitro sem ga našel.
A lot, maybe.	Veliko, morda.
But he won't be able to stay here for long.	A tukaj ne bo mogel ostati dolgo.
And it was so beautiful.	In bilo je tako lepo.
And there she was.	In tam je bila.
He didn't find it.	Ni ga našel.
I'm just a man, you know.	Jaz sem samo človek, veš.
In fact, it’s just that you’re a good person.	Pravzaprav je samo to, da si dober človek.
Like he said.	Tako kot je rekel.
Unfortunately, that wasn’t fast enough.	Žal to ni bilo dovolj hitro.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.	Včasih da, včasih ne.
We know now.	Zdaj vemo.
I don't even know what to do with it.	Sploh ne vem, kaj naj s tem.
Now this one.	Zdaj pa ta.
He will be there, but they will not see him.	Tam bo, vendar ga ne bodo videli.
But it really wasn't possible.	Res pa ni bilo mogoče.
I am your friend, forever.	Jaz sem tvoj prijatelj, za vedno.
They are not at home.	Ni jih doma.
Right away, actually.	Pravzaprav takoj.
I'll call for help.	Poklical bom na pomoč.
We still have some work to do here.	Tukaj imamo še nekaj dela.
That didn't happen here.	To se tukaj ni zgodilo.
I need to know if he's right.	Moram vedeti, če ima prav.
Once we know this, we will know what to do.	Ko bomo to vedeli, bomo vedeli, kaj storiti.
I am him.	Jaz sem on.
That happened to me.	To se mi je zgodilo.
She's sorry about that.	Žal ji je za to.
It wasn't there.	Ni je bilo tam.
This is going to happen.	To se bo zgodilo.
And that soon.	In to kmalu.
So I'm not doing well.	Tako da mi ne gre dobro.
I don't want to stay.	Nočem ostati.
I really want to.	zelo si želim.
Until this afternoon.	Do danes popoldne.
It's true.	Res je.
That's none of my business.	To ni moja stvar.
And he will need it a lot.	In potreboval ga bo veliko.
Good to see that.	Dobro je to videti.
And he continues to do so.	In to počne še naprej.
They did that.	To so storili.
Are you.	Ali si.
I just got here.	Pravkar sem prišel.
We are more than that.	Mi smo več kot to.
They knew where they were.	Vedeli so, kje so.
It really happened.	Res se je zgodilo.
Maybe they were right, maybe not.	Mogoče so imeli prav, morda ne.
I shouldn't have come.	Ne bi smel priti.
Many people.	Veliko ljudi.
I could make them pretty fast now.	Zdaj bi jih lahko naredil precej hitro.
I don't understand what the problem is here.	Ne razumem, kaj je tukaj problem.
I said that's not it.	Rekel sem, da to ni to.
Maybe you're right, he said.	Morda imaš prav, je rekel.
Maybe it's yours too.	Morda je tudi tvoj.
I could hardly help myself.	Težko bi si lahko pomagal.
No one is just what you are to me.	Nihče ni samo to, kar si zame.
It doesn’t even have to be a thing.	Niti ni treba, da je stvar.
Because.	Zaradi.
However, this is not the case here.	Vendar tukaj ni tako.
I could call her.	Lahko bi jo poklical.
I knew this was not what he wanted.	Vedel sem, da to ni tisto, kar si želi.
Day from.	Dan od.
It's hard for you to see that.	Težko ti je to videti.
He found her once.	Enkrat jo je našel.
And that's good.	In to je dobro.
That and only that.	To in samo to.
Time that not many people have.	Časa, ki ga veliko ljudi nima.
You really had it now.	Zdaj ste ga res imeli.
I asked what was wrong.	Vprašal sem, kaj je narobe.
I wouldn't tell anyone that.	Tega ne bi rekel nikomur.
He will too.	Tudi on bo.
And it was true.	In bilo je res.
I hope it won't.	Upam, da ne bo.
He has done this before.	To je storil že prej.
He couldn't stay to hear it.	Ni mogel ostati, da bi to slišal.
It wasn't pretty to see.	Ni bilo lepo videti.
That's right.	Tako je takoj.
Or not.	Ali pa ne.
Based on what he learned.	Glede na to, kar se je naučil.
I might be able to help.	Morda bom lahko pomagal.
You did it my friend.	Uspelo ti je, prijatelj.
That's the reason.	To je razlog.
That's what you'd think, wouldn't it.	To bi si mislil, kajne.
Maybe he got a lot of money.	Mogoče je dobil veliko denarja.
And there are many.	In veliko jih je.
I said the sooner the better.	Rekel sem prej, tem bolje.
He wasn't sure he wanted to.	Ni bil prepričan, da želi.
If it's possible.	Če je to mogoče.
You're probably right.	Verjetno imaš prav.
There was nothing else wrong.	Nič drugega ni bilo narobe.
I will see him again.	Še enkrat ga bom videl.
Where is he at all.	Kje je sploh.
We have to help.	Moramo pomagati.
He did it to me.	On mi je to naredil.
i am the reason why.	jaz sem razlog zakaj.
I don't want to buy another home anymore.	Nočem več kupiti drugega doma.
But that didn't happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
Things like that.	Stvari kot to.
We are not interested in that.	To nas ne zanima.
No, he's not either.	Ne, tudi on ni.
I'll just go.	Samo šel bom.
It's hard to really say.	Težko je res povedati.
Because it is not.	Ker ni.
And they will.	In bodo.
Tell me more.	Povej mi več.
You think you want to see him.	Misliš, da ga želiš videti.
This is nothing like that.	To ni nič takega.
Now this may be wrong.	Zdaj je to lahko narobe.
Someone will do it, but it doesn’t look like it will be us.	Nekdo bo to storil, vendar ni videti, da bomo to mi.
I'm glad it is.	Vesel sem, da je.
It's not just about you.	Ne gre samo za vas.
And if I could do that to you.	In če bi ti lahko to storil.
Life is hard.	Življenje je težko.
It's me and you.	Jaz in ti sva.
That's it.	To je to.
That he was still waiting for me.	Da me je še čakal.
You probably will.	Verjetno boš.
What it was, I wouldn’t say.	Kaj je bilo, ne bi rekel.
I was glad to be there.	Vesel sem bil, da sem bil tam.
Or maybe you could.	Ali pa bi morda lahko.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Očitno temu ni tako.
It's not just for me.	To ni samo zame.
You didn't do it for him.	Nisi tega naredil zaradi njega.
I could die right here.	Lahko bi umrl prav tukaj.
Talk about.	Govoriti o.
I did it.	Uspelo mi je.
I found nothing wrong with that.	S tem nisem našel nič narobe.
Don’t even think it’s good.	Sploh ne mislite, da je dober.
Probably wouldn't.	Verjetno ne bi.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
Nice of him.	Lepo od njega.
It's so good.	Tako dobro je.
You don't know anything.	Ničesar ne veš.
We have to go home.	Moramo domov.
But with us.	Ali pri nas.
That was all she managed.	To je bilo vse, kar ji je uspelo.
I have three children.	Imam tri otroke.
So he was lucky.	Tako je imel srečo.
Everything is going well.	Vse gre dobro.
So now he waited.	Tako je zdaj čakal.
A lot of people do that.	Veliko ljudi to počne.
That's what he said.	Tako je rekel.
And there he went.	In tja je šel.
Not tomorrow either.	Tudi jutri ne.
You've been here your whole life.	Tukaj si vse življenje.
Definitely.	Zagotovo.
No, it wasn't right.	Ne, ni bilo v redu.
I knew he was right.	Vedel sem, da ima prav.
No, for something.	Ne, za nekaj.
I needed him.	potreboval sem ga.
And yet very difficult.	Pa vendar zelo težko.
I haven't heard that either.	Tudi jaz tega nisem slišal.
She just didn't know what it could be.	Preprosto ni vedela, kaj bi to lahko bilo.
He obviously doesn't want to see us.	Očitno nas noče videti.
How happy the man is.	Kako vesel je človek.
I feel much better.	Počutim se veliko bolje.
I like how it works.	Všeč mi je, kako dela.
It could have been like nothing.	Bilo je lahko kot nič.
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
Or he may not have it.	Ali pa ga morda nima.
I don't know where to go.	Ne vem, kam naj grem.
But she didn't go.	Vendar ni šla.
He died so we wouldn't have to.	Umrl je, da nam ne bi bilo treba.
There was always, always someone else there.	Vedno, vedno je bil tam še nekdo.
I couldn't help myself.	Nisem si mogel pomagati.
It really helps.	Res pomaga.
That may not be the case today.	Danes morda ni tako.
She went from there.	Od tam je šla.
They did it in front of me.	To so storili pred mano.
That's right now.	Zdaj je tako.
They really are.	Res so.
He was sure he had done it.	Bil je prepričan, da je to storil.
I went for something.	Šla sem po nekaj.
There was nothing he could do right now.	Zdaj ni mogel storiti ničesar prav.
Yes, the only one.	Ta, edini.
And for a while he is too.	In za nekaj časa je tudi on.
The thing is, it can be.	Stvar je v tem, da je lahko.
He will never forget tonight.	Nocoj ne bo nikoli pozabil.
They should never be made.	Nikoli jih ne bi smeli narediti.
Not now, he said.	Ne zdaj, je rekel.
There is nothing else you need to do.	Nič drugega vam ni treba storiti.
All this time.	Ves ta čas.
Yes, you know.	Da bi, veš.
I saw it now.	Zdaj sem videl.
And he didn't like to tell.	In ni mu bilo všeč povedati.
It still goes its own way.	Še vedno gre po svoje.
I’m not sure why he’s doing this.	Nisem prepričan, zakaj to počne.
I've wanted to go ever since.	Od takrat sem hotel iti.
I would like to	rad bi
This is a difficult question.	To je težko vprašanje.
Everything just keeps happening that way.	Vse se samo še naprej dogaja na ta način.
Someone is talking to me.	Nekdo mi govori.
But today was not the day for that.	Vendar danes ni bil dan za to.
It was nothing.	To ni bilo nič.
He has a hard job.	Ima težko delo.
I'll go alone.	Sam bom šel.
Is it money? 	Je to denar?
And maybe they were.	In morda so bili.
You know that.	To veš.
That is a lot.	To je veliko.
He only comes here sometimes.	Samo včasih pride sem.
He did it.	On je to storil.
It's good, man.	Dobro je, človek.
He has nothing to know about it.	Nima kaj vedeti za to.
You just know.	Samo veš.
That way they would know what they saw.	Tako bi vedeli, kaj so videli.
That's how it's done.	Tako se to naredi.
Again, that might just be me.	Še enkrat, to sem morda samo jaz.
But I have been for a long time.	Sem pa dolgo časa.
I don't understand what happened.	Ne razumem, kaj se je zgodilo.
We all have our things.	Vsi imamo svoje stvari.
As it should.	Kot mora.
I think we have too much work to do.	Mislim, da imamo preveč dela.
Not that he says that.	Ne, da to pravi.
After that it's fine.	Po tem je v redu.
He has more.	Ima jih več.
That would not be easy.	To ne bi bilo lahko.
Nothing happened.	Nič se ni zgodilo.
The next day.	Naslednji dan.
It's just wrong.	Samo narobe je.
He probably won't even tell me.	Verjetno mi niti ne bo povedal.
It doesn't work.	Ne gre.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
Someone gave it to me.	Nekdo mi ga je dal.
They did nothing for us.	Za nas niso naredili nič.
I think we will succeed.	Mislim, da nam bo uspelo.
And he'll probably never see her at home again.	In verjetno je ne bo nikoli več videl doma.
He wasn't the only one either.	Tudi ni bil edini.
She liked that.	To ji je bilo všeč.
Maybe so.	Morda je tako.
This is now possible.	To je zdaj mogoče.
It will work.	To bo uspelo.
He knew in front of us that he was right for us.	Pred nami je vedel, da je pravi za nas.
I haven't seen that before.	Tega še nisem videl.
And no one to help her.	In nikogar, ki bi ji pomagal.
That's what I did.	To sem storil jaz.
I feel much better now.	Zdaj se počutim veliko bolje.
It wasn't work.	Ni bilo delo.
It will never happen.	Nikoli se ne bo zgodilo.
I believe it is possible.	Verjamem, da je to mogoče.
Life is very simple for me again.	Življenje je zame spet zelo preprosto.
I still see him.	Še vedno ga vidim.
I didn't ask for a job.	Nisem prosil za službo.
Who knows what could happen so far.	Kdo ve, kaj bi se lahko zgodilo do zdaj.
He really didn't like this man.	Ta človek mu res ni bil všeč.
Not yet.	Za zdaj še ni.
This is going to happen.	To se bo zgodilo.
And here you are.	In tukaj ste.
Now it seems they are.	Zdaj se zdi, da so.
It is now.	Zdaj je.
I know it's not enough.	Vem, da ni dovolj.
She didn't know.	Ni vedela.
And no one ever does.	In tega nihče nikoli ne naredi.
Nobody helped us with that.	Pri tem nam nihče ni pomagal.
You just have to tell me now.	Samo zdaj mi moraš povedati.
She really knew what he meant.	Res je vedela, kaj misli.
Just you and me.	Samo ti in jaz.
I thought everything was fine.	Mislil sem, da je vse v redu.
He works there too.	Tudi tam dela.
He has been doing this all his life, to this day.	To je počel vse življenje, do danes.
She is good at everything she does.	Dobra je v vsem, kar počne.
He is doing better now than before.	Zdaj mu gre bolje kot prej.
I haven't seen you and.	Nisem te videl in.
He didn't have enough work.	Ni imel dovolj dela.
It's so obviously wrong.	Tako očitno je narobe.
I didn't know you were in town.	Nisem vedel, da si v mestu.
We have to go.	Moramo iti.
I told him what had happened to me.	Povedal sem mu, kaj se mi je zgodilo.
I had very little money.	Imel sem zelo malo denarja.
Now you've confessed.	Zdaj si priznal.
Who knows.	Kdo pa ve.
He didn't want to eat.	Ni hotel jesti.
There is still no help.	Še vedno ni pomoči.
We will do that.	To bomo storili.
And there are problems with that.	In s tem so težave.
It's that you don't have to be.	To je, da ti ni treba biti.
That didn't happen.	To se ni zgodilo.
Something like this has never happened before.	Kaj takega se še ni zgodilo.
You don’t have to talk about it now.	Zdaj vam ni treba govoriti o tem.
Then someone spoke.	Takrat je nekdo govoril.
Which is actually a good thing.	Kar je pravzaprav dobra stvar.
Which is obviously happening now.	Kar se očitno dogaja zdaj.
It's right for me.	Meni je prav.
That way you would always know where they are.	Tako bi vedno vedela, kje sta.
I never said that.	Nikoli tega nisem rekel.
We liked it so much.	Tako nam je bilo všeč.
I would never learn.	Nikoli se ne bi naučil.
He is a good father.	Je dober oče.
Or sometimes it is.	Ali pa je včasih.
He said you know about it.	Rekel je, da veš za to.
Not too much.	Ne preveč.
It's not right what's going on.	Ni prav, kar se dogaja.
That's not much.	To ni veliko.
Or maybe he wasn't.	Ali pa morda ni bil.
I was with him every day.	Z njim sem bil vsak dan.
That we have something.	Da imamo nekaj.
How.	Kako.
I don't know him well enough.	Ne poznam ga dovolj dobro.
He has to go.	Mora iti.
It's much better.	Je precej bolje.
Really very.	Res zelo.
This is the only one.	Ta je edina.
So much time.	Toliko časa.
He said nothing.	Nič ni rekel.
There were too many people.	Bilo je preveč ljudi.
I don't think it's possible.	Mislim, da ni mogoče.
I wonder why.	Zanima me zakaj.
That wasn't it.	To ni bilo to.
Not so with me.	Pri meni ni tako.
They've been there before.	Tam so bili že prej.
I did it.	uspelo mi je.
Just not yet.	Samo še ne.
He called me.	Poklical me je.
Someone should help him.	Nekdo bi mu moral pomagati.
She would be fine on her own.	Sama bi bila v redu.
He couldn't help but wonder what would happen to him.	Ni si mogel kaj, da se ne bi vprašal, kaj bo z njim.
Let it go.	Naj gre.
He didn’t decide what would be better.	Ni se odločil, kaj bi bilo bolje.
I didn't know you were sitting here.	Nisem vedel, da si ti sedel tukaj.
If he doesn't find it, he'll come back to me.	Če ga ne bo našel, se bo vrnil k meni.
It wouldn't be the first time.	Ne bi bilo prvič.
And that's my problem.	In to je moj problem.
Nice, that's nice.	Lepo, to je lepo.
I never thought you would.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da boš.
I'm interested right now.	Trenutno me zanima.
Why why why why.	Zakaj zakaj zakaj zakaj.
Everything would be fine.	Vse bi bilo v redu.
He's moving on.	On gre naprej.
You never know when you might need it.	Nikoli ne veš, kdaj ga boš morda potreboval.
I feel much better now.	Zdaj se počutim veliko bolje.
There will be no time like that.	Tako ne bo časa.
He saw her.	Videl jo je.
I know he'll like it.	Vem, da mu bo všeč.
He knew he had them.	Vedel je, da jih ima.
I would be.	Bil bi.
Who would rather not.	Ko bi raje, da ne.
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
Nobody ever gave me anything.	Nihče mi nikoli ni ničesar dal.
What? 	Kaj?
Again, not true.	Še enkrat, ni res.
And it's true.	In to je res.
It's not something you have.	To ni nekaj, kar imaš.
I know he's just a person.	Vem, da je samo oseba.
Even better for us.	Še toliko bolje za nas.
I wanted to be liked.	Hotel sem biti všeč.
Maybe that's the problem.	Mogoče je v tem problem.
I could leave now if I wanted to.	Zdaj bi lahko odšel, če bi hotel.
I want to be of help.	Želim biti v pomoč.
That's why.	To je razlog, zakaj.
He knows how to really make a party fun.	Ve, kako zabavo res narediti zabavo.
Just as it happened.	Tako kot se je zgodilo.
It will be a long time.	To bo dolgo.
What about this.	Kaj pa to.
I want to do better.	Želim narediti bolje.
She told me to move on.	Rekla mi je, naj grem naprej.
There's nowhere to go in the afternoon.	Popoldne ni kaj iti.
It doesn't really exist.	Pravzaprav ne obstaja.
It was hard for her.	Bilo ji je težko.
As if last week wasn’t enough.	Kot da prejšnji teden ni bil dovolj.
I would like to work again.	Rad bi spet delal.
I understand why you're angry.	Razumem, zakaj si jezen.
You can only do it once.	Lahko samo enkrat.
You never know what you might need.	Nikoli ne veš, kaj bi morda potreboval.
They did it themselves.	To so storili sami.
That was never my way.	To nikoli ni bil moj način.
Not after what he just saw.	Ne po tem, kar je pravkar videl.
She loved this question so much.	To vprašanje ji je bilo tako všeč.
That this will not happen.	Da se to ne bo zgodilo.
That's what they did to me.	To so mi naredili.
Say it again.	Povedati še enkrat.
But no one really knows everything.	Nihče pa res ne ve vsega.
And he didn't leave.	In ni odšel.
It's all me.	Vse sem jaz.
And there is certainly nothing wrong with that.	In s tem zagotovo ni nič narobe.
But a.	Ali a.
He probably came with the house.	Verjetno je prišel s hišo.
And sometimes very hard work.	In včasih zelo težko delo.
That's not the reason he lost.	To ni razlog, da je izgubil.
Everyday.	Vsak dan.
If you don't know, say so.	Če ne veš, povej.
That's really good.	To je res dobro.
I think they are still there.	Mislim, da so še vedno tam.
Here, no one.	Tukaj, nihče.
He was the one.	On je bil tisti.
That's it.	To je to.
He expected that.	To je pričakoval.
Worked more, did something.	Več delal, nekaj naredil.
I can not believe.	ne morem verjeti.
And he meant it.	In resno mislil.
I hope this was helpful.	Upam, da je bilo to v pomoč.
I heard that.	To sem slišal.
He lives here.	Živi tukaj.
I would never do any of that.	Nikoli ne bi storila ničesar od tega.
It's just a matter of me.	To je samo stvar z mano.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
But even that did not happen.	A tudi to se ni zgodilo.
No matter what, he will win.	Ne glede na vse, on bo zmagal.
I understand you immediately.	Takoj te razumem.
He comes and goes.	Pride in gre.
It just comes out.	Samo pride ven.
Not much good for anything else.	Za kaj drugega ni veliko dobro.
You saw it.	Videl si.
Yes, he said.	Je, je rekel.
I liked it.	Meni je bilo všeč.
I wanted to see more.	Hotel sem videti več.
I soon knew what that was.	Zelo kmalu sem vedel, kaj je to nekaj.
I mean, really.	Mislim, res.
I really don't want to.	res nočem.
He works well.	Dobro dela.
All that stuff.	Vse te stvari.
And he has.	In ima.
He never told me not to go out.	Nikoli mi ni rekel, naj ne grem ven.
Maybe it would be better.	Mogoče bi bilo bolje.
But he never did anything about it.	Vendar glede tega ni nikoli naredil ničesar.
It may not exist at all.	Morda sploh ne obstaja.
I want to do it.	želim to narediti.
Maybe nothing.	Mogoče nič.
And maybe not.	In morda tudi ne.
No one will ever find me.	Nihče me ne bo nikoli našel.
Not even for you.	Niti zate.
Well, we did it.	Pa nam je uspelo.
There seemed to be no help.	Zdelo se je, da ni bilo pomoči.
She never did.	Nikoli tega ni storila.
She was back.	Bila je nazaj.
Or that he ever ate.	Ali da je kdaj jedel.
If only we knew.	Ko bi le vedeli.
Like yes.	Kot da.
He said they were.	Rekel je, da so.
What was, is no more.	Kar je bilo, ni več.
She didn’t know why and she didn’t have to know.	Ni vedela zakaj in ji ni bilo treba vedeti.
I think he would come home soon.	Mislim, da bi kmalu prišel domov.
I hope he feels better.	Upam, da se počuti bolje.
We will have more soon.	Kmalu jih bomo imeli več.
Often much more.	Pogosto veliko več.
He only plays for money.	Igra samo za denar.
That's quite a few.	To je kar nekaj.
That was good too.	Tudi to je bilo dobro.
I've been doing this for years.	To sem delal leta.
He helped me.	Pomagal mi je.
I'm going with you.	grem s tabo.
But I wouldn't be happy about that.	A tega ne bi bil vesel.
It's not true.	Ni res.
I've seen enough.	Dovolj sem videl.
Not yet and maybe not ever.	Ne še in morda ne nikoli.
That was good to know.	To je bilo dobro vedeti.
Nothing like this has ever happened.	Nič takega se ni nikoli zgodilo.
you are	ti si
I just made up my mind.	Pravkar sem se odločil.
I like the game.	Všeč mi je igra.
I'm not interested in anything anymore.	Nič me več ne zanima.
And that's the problem.	In to je problem.
And I hope she gets better.	In upam, da ji bo bolje.
They had little.	Imeli so malo.
And you know nothing better.	In ti ne veš nič bolje.
It never is and never will be.	Nikoli ni in nikoli ne bo.
He worked on it.	Delal je na tem.
Nobody ever goes there.	Nihče nikoli ne gre tja.
There is right and wrong.	Obstaja prav in narobe.
Okay, not really.	V redu, res ne.
Not that he would admit to such a thing.	Saj ne, da bi kaj takega priznal.
That's the way things will be.	Tako bodo stvari.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žal.
I've known her for a long time.	Poznam jo že dolgo.
He's just not home.	Samo ni ga doma.
And what else did they know.	In kaj so še vedeli.
It didn’t happen that way, it’s wrong.	To se ni zgodilo tako, to je narobe.
Boy, he liked her.	Fant, všeč mu je bila.
you are with me.	z mano si.
They wanted to stay together.	Želela sta ostati skupaj.
I really have nothing else to do.	Res nimam kaj drugega za početi.
Something will happen soon.	Nekaj ​​se bo kmalu zgodilo.
That's why you did it.	Zato si to naredil.
Or, more likely, not.	Ali, bolj verjetno, ne.
Not much.	Ne veliko.
No one was sure what was going on.	Nihče ni bil prepričan, kaj se dogaja.
No one is coming for you.	Nihče ne pride po vas.
I made these a while back.	Te sem naredil nekaj časa nazaj.
That's good to see.	To je dobro videti.
He wished he could.	Želel je, da bi lahko.
Everything is very.	Vse je zelo.
Just this and here and now.	Samo to in tukaj in zdaj.
Not here, not there.	Ne tukaj, ne tam.
You may find it a lot.	Morda se vam bo zdelo veliko.
They knew.	Vedeli so.
I saw it happening.	Videl sem, da se dogaja.
I had enough.	Imel sem dovolj.
I felt good.	Počutil sem se dobro.
They had no children.	Niso imeli otrok.
He seemed perhaps right.	Zdelo se je, da ima morda prav.
It wasn't just me.	Nisem bil samo jaz.
Those who did, and those who did not.	Tisti, ki so to storili, in tisti, ki niso.
It was like that today too.	Tudi danes je bilo tako.
I prefer to doubt that this is likely.	Raje dvomim, da je to verjetno.
You could just let me go.	Lahko bi me samo pustil.
We'll see how it goes.	Bomo videli kako bo.
You could have her there, but no.	Lahko bi jo imel tam, a ne.
It was just work.	Samo delati je bilo.
He didn't want any more children anyway.	Tako ali tako si ni želel več otrok.
Now they are together again.	Zdaj sta spet skupaj.
I didn't say anything to anyone.	Nikomur nisem nič rekel.
I just told you.	pravkar sem ti povedal.
Everyone knows what to do.	Vsak ve, kaj naj počne.
Little by little.	Malo po malo.
He loved them enough for that.	Za to jih je imel dovolj rad.
Say what you think.	Povej kar misliš.
He learned everything there.	Tam se naučil vsega.
I really can't help you.	Res ti ne morem pomagati.
Nice, he thought.	Lepo, si je mislil.
He'll stay there a little longer.	Tam bo ostal še malo.
He waited and waited.	Čakal je in čakal.
Just the way it is.	Tako kot je.
? 	?
We didn't have much time.	Nismo imeli veliko časa.
However, this is often not the case.	Vendar pogosto ni tako.
I needed money to get help.	Potreboval sem denar, da sem dobil pomoč.
You don't know who you're going to meet.	Ne veš, koga boš srečal.
It was a good game.	Bila je dobra igra.
I'll tell you about it.	Povedal vam bom o tem.
They knew what he could do.	Vedeli so, kaj lahko naredi.
That would be something.	To bi bilo nekaj.
They had no money.	Niso imeli denarja.
I have to be bought.	Kupiti me je treba.
I like it too.	Tudi meni je všeč.
I don't think you're good.	Mislim, da nisi dober.
And that was what it was.	In to je bila tisto, kar je bila.
It seemed like it needed to be done.	Zdelo se je, da je treba narediti.
What is this ?.	Kaj pa to?.
I don't know anything.	Ničesar ne vem.
And there is something else.	Pa še nekaj je.
That's for me.	To je zame.
Fortunately, it does.	Na srečo se.
It was as if I didn’t know.	Bilo je, kot da ne bi vedela.
Can anyone help me.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga.
We always know we are somebody.	Vedno vemo, da smo nekdo.
I certainly wouldn't.	Zagotovo ne bi.
Everything is as good as it is.	Vse je dobro, kot je.
Maybe not so good.	Mogoče ne tako dobro.
Now I can see again.	Zdaj lahko spet vidim.
I'm sure he's right.	Prepričan sem, da ima prav.
We have anyway.	Tako ali tako imamo.
She was what she was.	Bila je to, kar je bila.
And he's not interested in going with me.	In ne zanima ga iti z mano.
These are mine.	To so moje.
It needs to be done, it needs to be done.	To je treba storiti, to je treba storiti.
That's how it was for me.	Tako je bilo zame.
I don't think you can do that.	Mislim, da tega ne moreš storiti.
The baby just arrived.	Otrok je pravkar prišel.
And that's hard to be.	In v tem je težko biti.
It really was then and it is still true today.	Res je bilo takrat in je res še danes.
I don’t know why, but it was fast.	Ne vem zakaj, vendar je bilo hitro.
Both are not good.	Oba nista dobra.
And she was there.	In bila je tam.
i don't understand either.	jaz tudi ne razumem.
There is no help for that.	Za to ni pomoči.
I can fully understand that.	To lahko popolnoma razumem.
A man would be fine.	Človek bi bil v redu.
He's here too.	Tudi on je tukaj.
It is true that they are.	Res je, da so.
Just like he said he would.	Tako kot je rekel, da bo.
You want it for you.	Želite, da je za vas.
He's moving on.	On gre naprej.
He was not happy about it.	Ni bil vesel tega.
And that's a little time.	In to je malo časa.
And he was right.	In imel je prav.
I learned from that.	Iz tega sem se naučil.
Why would this happen.	Zakaj bi se to zgodilo.
That you were here.	Da si bil tukaj.
We just don't know yet what they will be.	Samo še ne vemo, kaj bodo.
We know that.	Mi to vemo.
Maybe then it would happen.	Mogoče bi se takrat zgodilo.
I have you.	Imam te.
He will see that you are with me.	Videl bo, da si z mano.
Because he thinks well, he really thinks.	Ker misli dobro, res misli.
Just to see how it is.	Samo da vidim kako je.
They were just.	Bili so samo.
What you said.	Kar si rekel.
Went for.	Odšel za.
I know he loves me and he will be right for me.	Vem, da me ima rad in me bo prav.
I know things are there.	Vem, da so stvari tam.
Everyone had them.	Vsi so jih imeli.
Everyone likes it.	Vsem je všeč.
Soon the car arrived.	Kmalu je prišel avto.
I wish you would come too.	Želim si, da bi tudi ti prišel.
He said something, but not to me.	Nekaj ​​je govoril, vendar ne z mano.
I didn't see anything.	Nič nisem videl.
If only it were that simple.	Ko bi bilo tako preprosto.
And so are we.	In tudi mi smo.
now.	zdaj .
She was at a party.	Bila je na zabavi.
He didn't make it either.	Tudi to mu ni uspelo.
Maybe not.	Mogoče ni.
I did it again.	To sem naredil še enkrat.
This is nice.	To je lepo.
No one, he said.	Nihče, je rekel.
You have them.	Imaš jih.
I made the right decision.	Prav sem se odločil.
It's just, there's no time.	Samo, ni časa.
And they are not.	In niso.
It happened to him.	Zgodilo se mu je.
I wanted my life.	Hotel sem svoje življenje.
It was never mine.	Nikoli ni bil moj.
I just couldn't do it that day.	Tisti dan preprosto nisem mogel.
I hadn't heard of it before.	Prej nisem slišal za to.
If so, he failed.	Če je tako, mu ni uspelo.
So it gives me even more time to go.	Tako mi da še več časa, da grem.
I loved it, I loved working with him.	Všeč mi je bilo, rad sem delal z njim.
It will never happen.	Nikoli se ne bo zgodilo.
Next week is coming soon enough.	Naslednji teden je dovolj kmalu.
I do not know why.	Ne vem zakaj.
Like this one and this one.	Tako kot ta in ta.
It's actually very, very good to see.	Pravzaprav ga je zelo, zelo dobro videti.
Now he was next.	Zdaj je bil naslednji.
What is it now? 	Kaj je bilo zdaj?
That seemed to me to be something else.	To se mi je zdelo nekaj drugega.
He was surprised to see me.	Bil je presenečen, ko me je videl.
I won't be long.	ne bom dolgo.
If you have enough.	Če vas je dovolj.
I am home.	Jaz sem doma.
A lot of people do that.	Veliko ljudi to počne.
He's been here before, but only once.	Bil je že tukaj, a samo enkrat.
They had to play them.	Morali so jih igrati.
I was quite surprised.	Bil sem precej presenečen.
It will be difficult.	Težko bo.
So this was really an opportunity for us.	Tako da je bila to res priložnost za nas.
I think he had.	Mislim, da je imel.
I never heard her again.	Nikoli več je nisem slišal.
It happened to me that it was more than that.	Zgodilo se mi je, da je bilo več kot to.
Here.	Na tukaj.
I need him more than you.	Potrebujem ga bolj kot ti.
I would do anything to get it.	Naredil bi vse, da bi ga dobil.
You have to see him.	Moraš ga videti.
You don't have to.	Ni vam treba.
I will never forget you.	Nikoli te ne bom pozabil.
I have to see him.	Moram ga videti.
Never again.	Nikoli več ni.
You may never know when you might need it.	Morda nikoli ne veš, kdaj ga boš morda potreboval.
You had it all.	Imel si vse.
None of us would want that.	Nihče od nas tega ne bi hotel.
For my people.	Za moje ljudi.
You did what you did for you.	Naredil si, kar si naredil zate.
I'll go and tell him.	Šel bom in mu povedal.
She was someone.	Bila je nekdo.
It was hard not to tell you.	Težko ti je bilo ne povedati.
He came.	Prišel je.
That's all I have.	Samo to imam.
We had to eat.	Morali smo jesti.
They saw him do it.	Videli so ga, da je to storil.
I was.	Bilo je.
It would be really good to see her.	Res bi jo bilo dobro videti.
I'm not angry.	Nisem jezen.
You will see this very soon.	To boste videli zelo kmalu.
What is this all the time.	Kaj je to ves čas.
Not a man again.	Ne spet človek.
It's my business to know.	To je moja stvar, da vem.
Something to do.	Nekaj, kar je treba narediti.
And also not in a good way.	In tudi ne na dober način.
At the time, you didn’t think you were going to make it.	Takrat si nisi mislil, da ti bo uspelo.
Where is he?	Kje ima.
Maybe she could do it now.	Mogoče bi ji to uspelo zdaj.
She says nothing happened to her.	Pravi, da se ji ni nič zgodilo.
We are alone now.	Zdaj sva sama.
Nothing to do.	Nič za početi.
Must be.	Mora biti.
It could be me.	Lahko sem jaz.
And I wouldn't be alone anymore.	In ne bi bila več sama.
I don't know how seriously.	Ne vem, kako resno.
you really are.	res si.
He said too much.	Preveč je rekel.
Probably true.	Verjetno tudi res.
Even to this day.	Tudi do danes.
And it happened.	In to se je zgodilo.
He wanted to go.	Hotel je iti.
They were there.	Tam so bili.
It happened here.	To se je zgodilo tukaj.
We have too many things.	Imamo preveč stvari.
But now it's something like that.	Zdaj pa je to nekaj takega.
You will speak.	Govoril boš.
It's not about the money.	Ne gre za denar.
I knew there were problems.	Vedel sem, da so težave.
Things she has never said before.	Stvari, ki jih še nikoli ni rekla.
But he knew it would be enough.	A vedel je, da bo dovolj.
It's not about that.	Ne gre za to.
And went out again.	In spet odšel ven.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ni hotel govoriti z mano.
It just never happened.	Samo nikoli se ni zgodilo.
I am very sorry.	Zelo mi je žal.
Maybe they are.	Mogoče so.
That's what it's after.	Za tem je.
John wasn't there.	Johna ni bilo tam.
There are probably more, but maybe not many more.	Verjetno jih je več, morda pa ne veliko več.
I need to talk to him.	Moram govoriti z njim.
I don't even know her.	Sploh je ne poznam.
But it seemed like a long time.	A zdelo se mi je dolgo.
And it was good that he did.	In bilo je dobro, da je.
We are not what we are.	Nismo to, kar smo.
In fact, it's already happening.	Pravzaprav se že dogaja.
I never go there.	nikoli ne grem tja.
He was there every day.	Tam je bil vsak dan.
He didn't actually do anything like that.	Pravzaprav ni storil nič takega.
Don’t think they won’t.	Ne mislite, da ne bodo.
It was good to get him back.	Bilo je dobro, da sem ga dobil nazaj.
He didn't go fast either.	Tudi on ni šel hitro.
I should see that it's you.	Moral bi videti, da si ti.
You know it and I know it.	Ti to veš in jaz vem.
You will see her now.	Zdaj jo boš videl.
If so, good and good.	Če je tako, dobro in dobro.
I want to see you.	Želim te videti.
I have my own children.	Imam svoje otroke.
He was the man his father wanted him to be.	Bil je človek, ki ga je oče želel, da bi bil.
You should stay.	Moral bi ostati.
Unfortunately not.	Žal ni.
You did your job.	Opravil si svoje delo.
I have to be ready for tonight.	Moram biti pripravljen na nocoj.
There seemed to be a little bit of everything.	Zdelo se je, da je vsega po malo.
She was, you know.	Bila je, veš.
Sometimes just for fun.	Včasih samo za zabavo.
They might still do it, but he didn’t think they would.	Morda bodo to še storili, a si ni mislil, da bodo.
I had to get there.	Moral sem priti tja.
That day has come.	Ta dan je prišel.
I'm the one who's supposed to die.	Jaz sem tisti, ki naj bi umrl.
It's just me now.	Zdaj sem samo jaz.
He is better than us.	On je boljši od nas.
How is it.	Kako je .
He always had something to do.	Vedno je imel kaj početi.
I really don't need you.	res te ne potrebujem.
That's what I told him.	To sem mu tudi povedal.
I believe you think this is what happened.	Verjamem, da mislite, da se je to zgodilo.
She didn't know what was wrong.	Ni vedela, kaj je narobe.
I am sure of it now.	Zdaj sem prepričan o tem.
As if they knew something.	Kot da bi kaj vedeli.
Maybe I'm fine with that.	Mogoče sem v redu s tem.
do it do it	naredi, naredi.
If you haven't seen it yet, you will.	Če ga še nisi videl, ga boš.
And there you were.	In tam si bil.
Apparently he wasn't.	Očitno ni bil.
That seems to be true.	Zdi se, da je to res.
And maybe we will soon.	In morda bomo kmalu.
There will be someone very soon.	Zelo kmalu bo nekdo.
Now there is something to that.	Zdaj je nekaj na tem.
I think so.	Mislim, da bo tako.
I hope someone can help.	Upam, da bo kdo pomagal.
He's not alone.	On ni sam.
This may be difficult to do.	To je morda težko narediti.
And that’s what he meant forever.	In to je mislil za vedno.
Yes, it might be.	Da, morda bi bilo.
He's probably coming home tomorrow afternoon.	Verjetno pride domov jutri popoldne.
In fact, maybe not.	Pravzaprav morda ne.
Not even a little.	Tudi malo ne.
Probably if.	Verjetno če.
Not so long.	Ne tako dolgo.
This is the first time I've seen him.	To je prvič, da sem ga videl.
I'm happy for you.	Vesel sem zate.
I didn't want to tell her that.	Tega ji nisem hotel povedati.
Wrong is wrong, for everyone.	Narobe je narobe, za vse.
Actually she was.	Pravzaprav je bila.
It's not that hard.	Ni tako težko.
Now he felt a little like that.	Zdaj se je počutil malo tako.
That would be hard enough.	To bi bilo dovolj težko.
What is happening seems very simple.	Kar se dogaja se zdi zelo preprosto.
It wasn't you.	Nisi bil ti.
He can't see you today.	Danes te ne more videti.
That was my father.	To je bil moj oče.
This was not the case at all.	Temu sploh ni bilo tako.
But he did more than that.	Vendar je naredil več kot to.
This time is not now.	Ta čas ni zdaj.
But he obviously thought he could do it himself.	A očitno je mislil, da lahko tudi sam.
That's what it's about.	Za to gre.
I think we are doing very well.	Mislim, da nam gre zelo dobro.
You just said.	Pravkar si rekel.
And so we saw some of that.	In tako smo videli nekaj od tega.
He never wanted to do that again.	Tega ni hotel nikoli več storiti.
There was no one there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar.
Neither you nor he.	Niti ti niti on.
I've been waiting for this.	To sem čakal.
I never wanted to be.	Nikoli si nisem želel biti.
I don't have a home.	nimam doma.
He didn't like what he saw.	Kar je videl, mu ni bilo všeč.
I did it for you, for us.	Naredil sem to za vas, za nas.
It would be good if.	Dobro bi bilo, če bi.
This is normal for me.	To je zame običajno.
I would if I could.	Bi, če bi lahko.
he thought.	mislil je.
I think we succeeded.	Mislim, da nam je uspelo.
There is nowhere else.	Ni več kam.
It can do much better than that.	Lahko naredi veliko bolje od tega.
There is no one else who can do it.	Ni več nikogar drugega, ki bi to lahko storil.
I needed my life back.	Potreboval sem svoje življenje nazaj.
That is, if all goes well.	Se pravi, če bo vse v redu.
You had your chance.	Imel si priložnost.
We should know better.	Morali bi vedeti bolje.
It's just not good enough for enough people.	Preprosto ni dovolj dobro za dovolj ljudi.
That was my problem.	To je bil moj problem.
For all three of us.	Za vse nas tri.
It's a good game.	To je dobra igra.
She told me to go ahead.	Rekla mi je, naj grem naprej.
There are also many people.	Tudi ljudi je veliko.
I have something with that.	Imam nekaj s tem.
We cannot say why.	Ne moremo povedati, zakaj.
That's not happening right now.	To se trenutno ne dogaja.
There was nothing.	Nič ni bilo.
Maybe true, but not fast enough for me.	Mogoče res, a zame ne dovolj hitro.
He wanted out.	Hotel je ven.
They are with me.	Z mano so.
You probably have to go to work.	Verjetno moraš na delo.
I will die from this.	Umrl bom od tega.
I can not believe.	Ne morem verjeti.
And why it goes wrong so often.	In zakaj gre tako pogosto narobe.
He was this man.	Bil je ta človek.
I am very serious about this.	Glede tega mislim zelo resno.
I saw him yesterday.	Včeraj sem ga videl.
It happened out of nowhere.	Zgodilo se je iz nič.
As if it already happened.	Kot da se je že zgodilo.
I didn't want to do this alone.	Tega nisem hotel narediti sam.
I thought he would get better.	Mislil sem, da mu bo bolje.
It seems quite common.	Zdi se precej pogosto.
I hope so.	Upam, da res.
He found it difficult here.	Tukaj se mu je zdelo težko.
Everything is going well.	Vse gre dobro.
You did something wrong.	Naredil si nekaj narobe.
I hope you are all well.	Upam, da ste vsi dobro.
Which was absolutely true.	Kar je bilo popolnoma res.
I'm sorry it just isn't.	Žal mi je, da preprosto ni.
I asked her about it.	Vprašal sem jo o tem.
You wanted me.	Hotel si me.
He thinks it's a good thing.	Misli, da je to dobra stvar.
A really long time.	Res dolgo časa.
Maybe not since last night.	Morda ne nikoli od sinoči.
I will be out of town for a few days.	Nekaj ​​dni me ne bo v mestu.
All without seeing them.	Vse, ne da bi jih videli.
Quick and simple.	Hitro in preprosto.
I knew that very well.	To sem dobro vedel.
He said it himself.	Sam je rekel.
I said maybe.	Rekel sem mogoče.
It wasn't me, but it almost was.	To nisem bil jaz, a skoraj sem bil.
Everyone knew that.	Vsi so to vedeli.
We had to tell you.	Morali smo vam povedati.
They might, but it's unlikely.	Morda bodo, vendar je malo verjetno.
I will say yes!.	Rekel bom da!.
He never was.	Nikoli ni bil.
I'll know it's you.	Vedel bom, da si ti.
She would never have made it without him.	Brez njega ji nikoli ne bi uspelo.
Especially not when it comes to money.	Sploh ne, ko gre za denar.
It was very, very good.	Bilo je zelo, zelo dobro.
The only question was who it would be.	Vprašanje je bilo le, kdo bo.
A long time ago.	Dolgo časa nazaj.
He is a good man who knows his job.	Je dober človek, ki pozna svoje delo.
Everything we need to know.	Vse, kar moramo vedeti.
We can be sure that it is.	Lahko smo prepričani, da je tako.
From then on.	Od takrat naprej.
It's none of my business.	Ni moja stvar.
She wanted to help him see ahead.	Želela mu je pomagati videti naprej.
But now it won't be anymore.	Zdaj pa ne bo več.
This is for all of us.	To je za vse nas.
To each his own.	Vsak po svoje.
Is that you?	Si to ti?
I didn't think it was that good.	Ni se mi zdelo tako dobro.
And he knew he had to do it quickly.	In vedel je, da mora to storiti hitro.
He plays well.	Igra dobro.
Probably not.	Verjetno ni.
I have a lot of work to do.	Veliko dela imam.
I still saw him.	Še vedno sem ga videl.
He's doing better.	Vse bolje mu gre.
More than there would be.	Več, kot bi tam.
I don't even know why.	Sploh ne vem zakaj.
I knew nothing about it.	Nič nisem vedel o tem.
Nothing for you right now.	Za vas trenutno nič.
If only for a while.	Če le za nekaj časa.
When, when, when.	Kdaj, kdaj, kdaj.
Keep going, keep going.	Samo tako naprej, samo tako naprej.
I will again.	Bom še enkrat.
You're a good boy, okay.	Ti si dober fant, v redu.
It's nice to be together.	Lepo je biti skupaj.
Something just happened.	Samo nekaj se je zgodilo.
And so it goes here.	In tako gre tudi tukaj.
You can't stay here alone.	Ne moreš ostati tukaj sam.
That may be until now.	To je morda do zdaj.
Maybe it wasn't so little time.	Mogoče ni bilo tako malo časa.
But not too much.	Vendar ne preveč.
This can only be a good thing.	To je lahko samo dobra stvar.
And she didn't know why.	In ni vedela zakaj.
If we really have.	Če res imamo.
I'm unlikely to forget.	Malo verjetno je, da bom pozabil.
I would if I wanted to.	Bi že, če bi hotel.
I know he would say that too.	Vem, da bi tudi on to rekel.
He didn't let her know.	Ni ji dal vedeti.
This has definitely happened to me.	To se mi je zagotovo zgodilo.
And he continues to do so.	In to počne še naprej.
Who we are.	Kdo smo.
Nothing is wrong.	Nič ni narobe.
I've known her for quite some time.	Poznam jo že kar nekaj časa.
Maybe not.	Mogoče pa ne.
I almost did.	Skoraj sem.
No, I wouldn't let her come, not yet.	Ne, ne bi ji dovolil priti, ne še.
This is not difficult.	To ni težko.
There have been quite a few threads about this.	O tem je bilo že kar nekaj tem.
That seems likely.	To se zdi verjetno.
I want to do more than just look.	Želim narediti več kot le videti.
They really were.	Res so bili.
He loved the good life.	Rad je imel dobro življenje.
My father could have a car.	Moj oče bi lahko imel avto.
Quick, please.	Hitro, če prosim.
This is wrong.	To je narobe.
I didn't expect to see them.	Nisem pričakoval, da jih bom videl.
That was me now.	To sem bil zdaj jaz.
He likes that.	To mu je všeč.
I didn't tell him.	Nisem mu povedal.
I really doubt it.	res dvomim.
We have to leave the next day.	Oditi moramo naslednji dan.
I hope we never have to again.	Upam, da nam nikoli več ne bo treba.
And you will succeed.	In uspelo vam bo.
That's how it's done.	Tako se dela.
No one would ever know.	Nihče ne bi nikoli vedel.
No one will do it for you.	Nihče tega ne bo naredil namesto vas.
Nobody's friend.	Nihče prijatelj.
That was quite a long time.	To je bilo kar dolgo.
So much has happened.	Toliko se je zgodilo.
I don't know if it's this one.	Ne vem, če je ta.
That's all it was.	Samo to je bilo.
You should go too.	Tudi ti bi moral iti.
That's what she said.	Tako je rekla.
I would say not at all.	Rekel bi, da sploh ne.
Even better than usual.	Še bolje kot običajno.
It really was there.	Tam je res bilo.
That's where he wanted to be now.	Tam je želel biti zdaj.
But it just doesn't work.	Pa vendar preprosto ne gre.
I was ready.	Bil sem pripravljen.
But it was never enough.	Vendar nikoli ni bilo dovolj.
I don't know him.	Jaz ga ne poznam.
You can't just go.	Ne moreš kar iti.
It was big, it was big.	Bilo je veliko, bilo je veliko.
We should go.	Morali bi iti.
There's nothing we can do.	Nič ne moremo.
Actually, it's not.	Pravzaprav ni.
I did mine.	Svoje sem naredil.
I don't understand money.	Ne razumem denarja.
I never told you that.	Tega ti nisem nikoli povedal.
Good father.	Dober oče.
Not much here.	Tukaj ni veliko.
I don't do that anymore.	Tega ne počnem več.
There was someone like him.	Bil je nekdo kot on.
No, no, that's fine.	Ne, ne, to je v redu.
It will be fine again.	Spet bo v redu.
Here's an opportunity.	Tukaj je priložnost.
One cannot know something that is not so.	Človek ne more vedeti nekaj, kar ni tako.
It was quick.	Bilo je hitro.
I certainly don't.	Jaz zagotovo ne.
I heard about it almost every day.	O tem sem slišal skoraj vsak dan.
I would do that.	Jaz bi naredil to.
Now we know it's not.	Zdaj vemo, da ni.
I know that much.	Toliko vem.
I can see that myself.	To vidim tudi sam.
I got almost nothing.	Dobil sem skoraj nič.
It just didn't work.	Samo nič ni uspelo.
But that was it.	Vendar je bilo to to.
It didn't feel right to me at the time.	Takrat se mi ni zdelo prav.
She didn't like it.	Ni ji bilo všeč.
I would do it again.	Še enkrat bi to naredil.
He will never know.	Nikoli ne bo vedel.
And me too.	In jaz tudi.
So he had to move on.	Zato je moral naprej.
That would really be too much.	To bi bilo res preveč.
He's in town.	V mestu je.
However, he failed to do so.	Vendar mu to ni uspelo.
It's fast.	Hitro je.
But that seems to have happened.	A zdi se, da se je to zgodilo.
This is life.	To je življenje.
Actually, it does exist.	Pravzaprav res obstaja.
As they all had.	Kot so imeli vsi.
I want to do what is right.	Želim narediti, kar je prav.
You couldn't see.	Nisi mogel videti.
And it really will.	In res bo.
This is very very wrong!!!.	To je zelo zelo narobe!!!.
You did everything right.	Vse si naredil prav.
That doesn't seem right.	To se ne zdi prav.
I just didn't think it would happen.	Nisem samo mislil, da se bo to zgodilo.
I really don't know what to do anymore.	Res ne vem več kaj naj.
He lost it and now he wants it back.	Izgubil ga je in zdaj ga želi nazaj.
Sometimes you get lucky.	Včasih imaš srečo.
That's right.	Tako je.
Like almost everything in me.	Tako kot skoraj vse v meni.
Not a very nice thing to do.	Ni zelo lepo narediti.
I don't understand anything anymore.	nič več ne razumem.
He liked to eat.	Rad je jedel.
I've never heard of it.	Še nikoli nisem slišal za to.
Unfortunately, she knew.	Žal je vedela.
He knew all along that he wasn't that man.	Ves čas je vedel, da ni ta človek.
My father is not.	Moj oče ni.
Maybe he would know.	Mogoče bi vedel.
I didn't have that.	Tega nisem imel.
Maybe he can do something.	Mogoče lahko kaj naredi.
Both are with us now.	Oba sta zdaj z nami.
As always, we'll see.	Kot vedno, bomo videli.
You've probably seen it before.	Zagotovo ste ga kdaj videli.
This one is the right one.	Ta je pravi.
And I wouldn't stay in the city.	In ne bi ostal v mestu.
And she went out.	In je šla ven.
In fact, it happened quite quickly.	Pravzaprav se je to zgodilo precej hitro.
I just wanted to get out of there.	Samo hotel sem oditi od tam.
It can't be right.	Ne more biti prav.
Just being here.	Samo biti tukaj.
There aren't many of them.	Ni jih veliko.
I have them all here.	Vse jih imam tukaj.
It's happened before.	Zgodilo se je že prej.
To know them.	Da jih poznam.
He was lucky.	Imel je srečo.
It's still you.	Še vedno si ti.
I was gone for a long time.	Dolgo me ni bilo.
He wanted to believe her so badly.	Tako zelo ji je želel verjeti.
And so on every day.	In tako naprej vsak dan.
And he's not doing so well.	In ne gre mu tako dobro.
Because, because, because.	Ker, ker, ker.
He wants her.	On si jo želi.
No one to help me.	Nihče, ki bi mi pomagal.
If there is a following.	Če obstaja naslednji.
Someone will hear you.	Nekdo vas bo slišal.
We have to play well.	Igrati moramo dobro.
I can see that.	To lahko vidim.
But it is much more than that.	Vendar je veliko več kot to.
He thought everything would be fine.	Mislil je, da bo vse v redu.
Some work.	Nekaj ​​dela.
They made us human.	Naredili so nas ljudi.
Nothing wrong with that.	Nič narobe s tem.
I will never get it again.	Nikoli več ne bom dobil.
You know, you don't even have to do that.	Veš, tega ti sploh ni treba narediti.
I'm sure it would.	Prepričan sem, da bi.
Maybe this one is too.	Mogoče je tudi ta.
I stayed put.	Ostal sem na mestu.
You want to do him good.	Želiš mu delati dobro.
It's better if not.	Bolje je, če ne.
It wasn't difficult.	Ni bilo težko.
It's not the first time.	Ni prvič.
This thing doesn't have that problem.	Ta stvar nima te težave.
But you didn't do that.	Vendar tega niste storili.
He couldn't see her.	Ni je mogel videti.
That would be it now.	Tako bi bilo zdaj.
Just a friend, that's all.	Samo prijatelj, to je vse.
I think it does what you want.	Mislim, da naredi, kar želite.
I don't know what's going on or what to do.	Ne vem, kaj se dogaja ali kaj storiti.
I'll put that out there.	To bom dal ven.
I have it now.	Zdaj ga imam.
I'm afraid you're right.	Bojim se, da imaš prav.
It seemed like there was no time.	Zdelo se je, kot da ni časa.
I was so happy to see both of them.	Bil sem tako vesel, da sem videl oba.
You never came back.	Nikoli se nisi vrnil.
And maybe he's right.	In morda je prav.
That's not okay.	To ni v redu.
She needed to know where he was.	Morala je vedeti, kje je.
He was the only one who could.	Bil je edini, ki je lahko.
Not to know.	Da ne bi vedeli.
And maybe.	In morda.
Tell him everything.	Povej mu vse.
It made me feel so much better.	Zaradi tega sem se počutil veliko bolje.
I've heard it once before, a long time ago.	Slišal sem že enkrat, dolgo nazaj.
This is what you always wanted.	To si vedno želel.
But now he will stay.	A zdaj bo ostal.
He returned to work yesterday morning.	Včeraj zjutraj se je vrnil v službo.
Like he doesn't have it.	Kot da tega nima.
So many of us live here.	Toliko nas živi tukaj.
He actually likes school.	Pravzaprav ima rad šolo.
Now and no.	Zdaj in ne.
If only it would work.	Če bi le uspelo.
He doesn't know who he is and he doesn't care.	Kdo je, ne ve in ga ne zanima.
I hope he loses his job.	Upam, da bo izgubil službo.
I hope we can do it again sometime.	Upam, da nam bo uspelo še kdaj.
But it won't be enough.	Vendar ne bo dovolj.
Maybe we were.	Mogoče smo bili.
I can't go to work either.	Tudi jaz ne morem v službo.
There's one more thing you have to do.	Še nekaj moraš narediti.
I always loved being home, all the time.	Vedno sem bil rad doma, ves čas.
I still said no.	Še vedno sem rekel ne.
I think that's really something.	Mislim, da je to res nekaj.
He didn't want to do that.	Tega ni hotel storiti.
When would .	Ko bi .
No one would help me.	Nihče mi ne bi pomagal.
Me neither.	Tudi jaz ne.
Yes, we have to do that.	Da, to moramo storiti.
It wasn't difficult.	Ni bilo težko.
But now there was no time.	Zdaj pa ni bilo časa.
He's not doing well.	Ne gre mu dobro.
They didn't know what.	Niso vedeli, kaj.
He will stay with us forever.	Za vedno bo ostal z nami.
Man feels good.	Človek se dobro počuti.
I really like it.	Res mi je všeč.
Which they did.	Kar so tudi storili.
It's a little hard to work with.	Malo težko je delati.
I expected much more.	Pričakoval sem veliko več.
I think that was it.	Mislim, da je bilo to to.
I need them all.	Vse jih potrebujem.
Almost, I'm afraid.	Bojim se, skoraj.
I will make them tomorrow.	Naredil jih bom jutri.
Even at home all day.	Ves dan tudi doma.
He is what he is.	On je, kar je.
I think he told me.	Mislim, da mi je rekel.
He quickly did so.	Hitro je to storil.
I would speak today.	Danes bi govoril.
I was ready for it.	Bil sem pripravljen na to.
Just as it is.	Tako kot je.
But they knew very little.	Vedeli pa so zelo malo.
When you gotta work, you gotta work.	Ko moraš delati, moraš delati.
And the work he really did!.	In delo, ki ga je res opravil!.
But it wasn't always like that.	Vendar ni bilo vedno tako.
I don't see that.	Tega ne vidim.
Worked with him.	Delal z njim.
Every one of us.	Vsak od nas.
I only needed it once.	Samo enkrat sem ga potreboval.
It seems wrong to me.	Zdi se mi narobe.
Man, was that good.	Človek, ali je bilo to dobro.
If it doesn't happen now, it will.	Če se ne bo zgodilo zdaj, se bo.
And it's true, they were.	In res je, bili so.
Now that's good money.	Zdaj je to dober denar.
I have to move on.	Moram naprej.
We still don't know what happened.	Še vedno ne vemo, kaj je bilo.
Which is right.	Kar je prav.
You didn't do anything.	Ničesar nisi delal.
They did nothing wrong.	Nič niso naredili narobe.
That's what I decided to do.	Za to sem se odločil.
What he had to do.	Kaj je moral narediti.
No one needs to know.	Nikomur ni treba vedeti.
He won't be back.	Ne bo se vrnil.
I expected that.	To sem pričakoval.
You could do that now, you know.	To bi lahko storil zdaj, veš.
There could be many.	Lahko bi jih bilo veliko.
I would be a good man if something happened.	Bil bi dober človek, če bi se kaj zgodilo.
Because it didn't work.	Ker ni uspelo.
Which isn't.	Kar pa ne.
You have to play with what you have.	Igrati moraš s tem, kar imaš.
I hope you are.	Upam, da si.
It sure would be nice to have some help.	Zagotovo bi bilo lepo, če bi imeli pomoč.
And he's obviously going to get a lot of time.	In očitno bo dobil veliko časa.
She was at home here.	Tukaj je bila doma.
He couldn't help himself for life.	Za življenje si ni mogel pomagati.
You gave it.	Dal si ga.
Something else was wrong.	Nekaj ​​drugega je bilo narobe.
We really didn't.	Res nismo.
Tell him that.	Povej mu to.
No one asked me to do this.	Nihče me ni prosil, naj to storim.
You probably do too.	Verjetno tudi ti.
I am very happy.	Zelo sem vesel.
He had to go now.	Zdaj je moral iti.
Once at home too.	Enkrat tudi doma.
Now he did all he could.	Zdaj je naredil vse, kar je lahko.
And so it has always been.	In tako je bilo vedno.
All we have today.	Vse, kar imamo danes.
The boy bought it.	Fant ga je kupil.
It wasn't like that today.	Danes ni bilo tako.
I'm sure many people, but not all.	Prepričan sem, da veliko ljudi, vendar ne vsi.
And he was angry.	In bil je jezen.
And yet, that's what you should do.	Pa vendar je to tisto, kar bi moral storiti.
I want so many things.	Toliko stvari si želim.
I didn't see anything else.	Nič drugega nisem videl.
They are here.	Tukaj so.
I want to do everything.	Želim narediti vse.
No, not tomorrow.	Ne, ne jutri.
She said she wasn't feeling well.	Rekla je, da se ne počuti dobro.
You should see that for yourself.	To bi moral sam videti.
he thought.	mislil je.
He knows everything there is to know.	Ve vse, kar je treba vedeti.
This will happen quickly.	To se bo zgodilo hitro.
But you don't have to do that.	Vendar vam tega ni treba storiti.
As if it was only a matter of time.	Kot bi bilo samo vprašanje časa.
But he won again.	A spet je zmagal.
And did something about it.	In naredil nekaj glede tega.
And no one will either.	Pa tudi nihče ne bo.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
Someone already said that.	To je že nekdo rekel.
He immediately left.	Takoj je odšel.
You will be sorry.	Žal ti bo.
I do not understand that.	Tega ne razumem.
It will take a little more time.	Potreboval bo malo več časa.
This is where you want to be.	Tukaj želite biti.
That's what my man did here.	To je moj človek naredil tukaj.
That or or, yes or or.	To ali ali, da ali ali.
You never saw me.	Nikoli me nisi videl.
If you still want it, fine.	Če ga še vedno želiš, v redu.
Keep it simple, simple, simple.	Naj bo preprosto, preprosto, preprosto.
I liked to think so.	Rad sem tako mislil.
At the time, this seemed unlikely.	Takrat se je to zdelo malo verjetno.
It didn't look like it today.	Danes ni bilo videti tako.
He does so now and always will.	Stori tako tudi zdaj in vedno bo.
Could.	Lahko bi.
More than that, we don't know.	Več kot to, ne vemo.
Just a little bit for now.	Samo malo za zdaj.
I felt more like a boy.	Počutil sem se bolj kot fant.
I probably need a few more days, as always.	Verjetno potrebujem še nekaj dni, kot vedno.
He usually wasn't around long enough to need it.	Običajno ga ni bilo dovolj dolgo, da bi ga potreboval.
She never said she was afraid of him.	Nikoli ni rekla, da se ga boji.
This is what you have to do.	To je tisto, kar moraš storiti.
He didn't even have one.	Sploh ga ni imel.
It is much more than that.	To je veliko več kot to.
They might be from someone else.	Morda so od koga drugega.
I'll just stay home.	Samo ostal bom doma.
He didn't see me.	Ta me ni videl.
I have that.	To imam.
But there is still much work to be done.	Še vedno pa je še veliko dela.
I bought a book there.	Tam sem kupil knjigo.
I hope that is not the case.	Upam, da temu ni tako.
He may very well have seen what happened.	Morda je zelo dobro videl, kaj se je zgodilo.
It was never like that.	Nikoli ni bilo tako.
You should do that.	To bi morali storiti.
Maybe he just needed some time too.	Mogoče je tudi on samo potreboval nekaj časa.
It's just you and me.	Samo ti in jaz sva.
I want you too much.	Preveč si te želim.
When you called the other day.	Ko si poklical prejšnji dan.
Sometimes sure.	Včasih zagotovo.
He plays a lot.	Igra veliko.
And yet we are.	Pa vendar smo.
i will find	bom našel.
He was not sorry.	Ni mu bilo žal.
It's too much at home.	Preveč je doma.
He was waiting for her to come and talk to him.	Čakal je, da pride in govori z njim.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
I never was anyway.	Tako ali tako nisem bil nikoli.
Nobody found it.	Nihče ga ni našel.
I would ask her to come with him.	Prosil bi jo, naj gre z njim.
It was always difficult.	Vedno je bilo težko.
However, much remains to be done.	Vendar je treba še veliko narediti.
I really am.	Res sem.
He was ready.	Bil je pripravljen.
I think you know how to do it.	Mislim, da veste, kako to narediti.
He didn't tell us who we were.	Ni nam povedal, kdo smo.
I think that could be nice.	Mislim, da bi to lahko bilo lepo.
Probably not.	Verjetno ni.
He just had.	Pravkar je imel.
But if that's not you, that's okay.	Če pa to nisi ti, je v redu.
I felt better almost immediately.	Skoraj takoj sem se počutil bolje.
All this life.	Vse to življenje.
For what? 	Za kaj?
But no children.	Vendar brez otrok.
We have it.	Imamo ga.
And it really was.	In res je bilo.
We all have them.	Vsi jih imamo.
It's really very nice.	Res je zelo lepo.
Gone, just like that.	Odšel, kar tako.
I've never heard of anything like that.	Še nikoli nisem slišal za kaj takega.
We have already done everything!.	Vse smo že naredili!.
It didn't happen.	Pa se ni.
It has to be good.	Dobro mora biti.
We know for sure that you.	Zagotovo vemo, da te.
I understand why you did it.	Razumem, zakaj si to naredil.
It will be nice.	Lepo bo.
But still.	Še vedno pa.
He stayed like that for several days.	Tako je ostal več dni.
Things, not so much.	Stvari, ne toliko.
Just live with it.	Samo živi s tem.
That's how it seemed to me.	Tako se mi je zdelo.
And that's not all.	In to še ni vse.
I knew nothing about all this myself.	Sam o vsem tem nisem vedel nič.
I was good enough.	Bil sem dovolj dober.
These are very	To so zelo.
It's not just.	Ni samo.
He was nowhere to be seen.	Ni ga bilo za videti.
Maybe something else.	Mogoče pa kaj drugega.
It's immediate.	Takoj je.
Who said very little and did much.	Ki je povedal zelo malo in naredil veliko.
It's probably gone now.	Zdaj verjetno ni več.
I will be the father.	Jaz bom oče.
I hope to be back in town by then.	Upam, da bom do takrat spet v mestu.
You are all here.	Vsi ste tukaj.
I know someone who would be surprised by that.	Poznam nekoga, ki bi bil nad tem presenečen.
It just keeps going.	Kar naprej je.
That will never happen.	To se ne bo nikoli zgodilo.
Now you know everything about me.	Zdaj veš vse o meni.
She could be alone.	Lahko bi bila tudi sama.
He came early.	Prišel je zgodaj.
And they knew all along that something was wrong.	In ves čas so vedeli, da nekaj ni v redu.
I got everything.	Vse sem dobil.
Mine is too.	Tudi moj je.
I didn't see him right away.	Nisem ga takoj videl.
It's okay, you know.	V redu je, veš.
It can only do so much.	Toliko lahko naredi.
And that's hard.	In to je težko.
I think that is clearly the case.	Mislim, da je očitno tako.
Nothing more than that.	Nič več kot to.
I want to know.	Želim vedeti.
You know, not me, we.	Veš, ne jaz, mi.
I would sit there and it was him.	Sedel bi tam in to je bil on.
Just me, really.	Jaz samo, res.
I've always said so.	Vedno sem tako govoril.
We all have to believe her.	Vsi ji moramo verjeti.
I heard them.	Slišal sem jih.
That seems to be the case.	Zdi se, da je res tako.
We didn't do it alone.	Tega nismo storili sami.
Someone probably forgot.	Verjetno je nekdo pozabil.
And he waited.	In je čakal.
He wasn't surprised at all.	Sploh ni bil presenečen.
But again nothing happened.	A spet se ni zgodilo nič.
No, not that.	Ne, tega ne.
We have to play fast.	Igrati moramo hitro.
And yet it was enough.	Pa vendar je bilo dovolj.
There was no one else.	Nikogar drugega ni bilo.
Not much to see.	Ni veliko za videti.
However, we know better.	Vendar pa vemo bolje.
No, you heard me.	Ne, slišal si me.
You have to believe it.	To moraš verjeti.
I'm sure you would too.	Prepričan sem, da bi tudi ti.
A lot of people don't.	Veliko ljudi ne.
And that was the problem.	In to je bil problem.
I'm still angry.	Še vedno sem jezen.
Okay, now is the time.	V redu, zdaj je pravi čas.
I thought there was something wrong with it.	Mislil sem, da je s tem nekaj narobe.
It wasn't always like that.	Ni bilo vedno tako.
And the time is right.	In čas je pravi.
There is much to be done.	Veliko je treba narediti.
I have to work on that.	Na tem moram delati.
We've all been there.	Vsi smo bili tam.
It's really simple.	Res je preprosto.
All these things.	Vse te stvari.
No, there won't be any today.	Ne, danes jih ne bo.
I wanted to do something to help.	Želel sem nekaj narediti, da bi pomagal.
I still don't know today.	Še danes ne vem.
I was right not to.	Imel sem prav, da tega nisem storil.
I would just call them early in the morning.	Samo poklical bi jih zgodaj zjutraj.
That's just what he does.	Samo to počne.
I won both.	Zmagal sem oba.
We don't know where we are.	Ne vemo kje smo.
That seems right.	Tako se zdi prav.
I think he's right.	Mislim, da ima prav.
This one is the right one.	Ta je pravi.
But it used to be there.	Vendar je bilo včasih tam.
He thought of everything.	Mislil je na vse.
But even that wasn't much.	A tudi to ni bilo veliko.
I mean that.	Mislim to.
He couldn't do anything more than he was already doing.	Ni mogel storiti nič več, kot je že počel.
Perhaps more than enough.	Morda več kot dovolj.
Quite a long time ago.	Precej dolgo nazaj.
This was not what she wanted.	To ni bilo tisto, kar je želela.
That could be good.	To bi lahko bilo dobro.
If only it could be that simple.	Če bi lahko bilo tako preprosto.
I had to tell him.	Moral sem mu povedati.
We did that today.	To smo storili danes.
But he couldn't do anything.	Vendar ni mogel storiti ničesar.
That seems like a long time.	To se zdi dolgo časa.
Better him than us.	Bolje on kot mi.
I should never have left alone.	Nikoli ne bi smel oditi sam.
You taught them.	Ti si jih naučil.
It was probably a good thing she wasn't here.	Verjetno je bilo dobro, da je ni bilo tukaj.
I asked for something.	Prosil sem za nekaj.
He was also very helpful to me at times.	Včasih mi je bil tudi v veliko pomoč.
I may not be considered beautiful or pretty by everyone.	Morda me ne bodo imeli vsi za lepo ali lepo.
He obviously didn't do that.	Tega očitno ni storil.
This happened once.	To se je zgodilo enkrat.
It may or may not exist.	Lahko obstaja ali pa ne obstaja.
I wanted it too.	Tudi jaz sem si ga želela.
Not like that at all.	Sploh ne tako.
I would sit.	Jaz bi sedel.
If only I could.	Samo da bi lahko.
And there she was.	In bila je tam.
She said sure.	Rekla je zagotovo.
I'm here.	Tukaj sem.
Or maybe he doesn't speak at all.	Ali pa morda sploh ne govori.
Even if you wanted to.	Pa tudi če bi hotel.
They will have to go.	Morali bodo iti.
I don't need help with this.	Pri tem ne potrebujem pomoči.
And all for nothing.	In vse za nič.
He was so good to me.	Tako dober je bil do mene.
I wouldn't say anything.	Nič ne bi rekel.
We have people.	Imamo ljudi.
She didn't do that.	Tega ni storila.
It didn't happen right.	Ni se zgodilo prav.
I know you're right.	Vem, da imaš prav.
Keep it up boy.	Kar naprej, fant.
It's not about you.	Ne gre za vas.
I did that too.	To sem tudi naredil.
Everything is instant.	Vse je takoj.
Nothing would happen.	Nič se ne bi zgodilo.
Just what every guy needs.	Kar potrebuje vsak fant.
The man goes out.	Človek gre ven.
Almost anything you want.	Skoraj vse, kar želite.
There's a lot of them.	Veliko jih je.
I saw that.	To sem videl.
We have to get out.	Ven moramo.
You wanted us all together.	Hotel si nas vse skupaj.
There was no time to tell him.	Ni bilo časa, da bi mu povedal.
This is not obvious.	To ni očitno.
It happened to her.	Zgodilo se ji je.
He said he couldn't get out of there fast enough.	Rekel je, da ne more dovolj hitro od tam.
I know they will.	Vem, da bodo.
You shouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi smeli početi.
It is good to know.	Dobro je vedeti.
Every one of us.	Vsak od nas.
You came back for it.	Vrnil si se po to.
However, this is not enough.	Vendar to ni dovolj.
But maybe he was better now.	A morda mu je bilo zdaj bolje.
I didn't expect it to be this good.	Nisem pričakoval, da bo tako dobro.
That's what they're for.	Za to so.
Maybe just like that.	Morda prav tako.
No one spoke to me.	Nihče ni govoril z mano.
We will do that.	To bomo storili.
I've never had one.	Nikoli ga nisem imel.
It wouldn't be difficult.	Ne bi bilo težko.
No one did that either.	Tudi tega nihče ni storil.
You are what you are.	Ti si, kar si.
I knew he knew it too.	Vedel sem, da tudi on to ve.
There they are again.	Spet so tam.
He had to come out of it.	Moral je priti iz tega.
You can be sure of that.	O tem ste lahko prepričani.
It's really nothing.	Res ni nič.
He was so good to me.	Tako je bil dober do mene.
I couldn't do it without him.	Ne bi mogel brez njega.
You could still get money from us.	Še vedno bi lahko dobil denar pri nas.
Onward, always onward.	Naprej, vedno naprej.
I didn't do anything my way.	Ničesar nisem naredil po svoje.
That's how it should be done.	Tako je treba narediti.
And yet there is much more.	In vendar je veliko več.
I have that too.	Tudi jaz imam to.
Everything was as it should be.	Vse je bilo tako kot mora biti.
What you want to be.	Kar želite biti.
It's just too much more.	Samo preveč je več.
Boy, not much.	Fant, ni veliko.
I will stay there tomorrow.	Bom ostal tam jutri.
Why not? 	Zakaj ne?
I have already done a lot of work for you.	Zate sem že opravil veliko dela.
I've had enough.	Imel sem dovolj.
Something needs to be done quickly.	Hitro je treba nekaj narediti.
That's right.	Tako je.
I wish I hadn't.	Želim si, da ne bi.
I know what.	Vem kaj.
That's pretty fast.	To je precej hitro.
This is wrong.	To je narobe.
Today, that is no longer the case.	Danes temu ni več tako.
Not this, please not this! 	Ne tega, prosim ne tega!
.	.
I know you have.	Vem, da imaš.
That helps a bit.	To malo pomaga.
No one saw him again.	Nihče ga več ni videl.
And you would know.	In vedeli bi.
I couldn't go because of time.	Ni mi uspelo iti zaradi časa.
This should be done forever.	To je treba storiti za vedno.
For very.	Za zelo.
It's still wrong.	Še vedno je narobe.
Right behind you.	Takoj za tabo.
Tell me where it's going.	Povej mi, kam gre.
I'm surprised you're here.	Presenečen sem, da si tukaj.
To see them.	Da jih vidim.
Everything was very nice.	Vse je bilo zelo lepo.
Probably no one will.	Verjetno ne bo nihče.
I'm not happy this happened.	Nisem vesel, da se je to zgodilo.
I had time.	Imel sem čas.
But she wished she hadn't been.	A si je želela, da ne bi bila.
If you don't want to be yourself.	Če tudi sam ne želiš biti.
All right, with you this afternoon.	V redu, s tabo danes popoldne.
Maybe for quite some time.	Mogoče kar nekaj časa.
I can't do that, not yet.	Tega ne morem, še ne.
It could be right for you.	Lahko bi bilo prav za vas.
Tell us what you would play.	Povej nam, kaj bi igral.
And you have been a great help to me.	In bil si mi v veliko pomoč.
We should be there.	Morali bi biti tam.
He made up his mind.	Odločil se je.
I mean, it's not.	Mislim, ni.
What to do now?.	Kaj zdaj narediti?.
Or maybe it wasn't him.	Ali pa morda ni bil on.
He's never done that before.	Nikoli prej tega ni naredil.
It seemed a long time.	Zdelo se je dolgo.
That's good to know.	To je dobro vedeti.
I'm sorry she was even here.	Žal mi je, da je sploh bila tukaj.
I like him as a person.	Všeč mi je kot oseba.
I'm next.	Jaz sem naslednji.
I don't know anything more about it.	O tem ne vem nič več.
I didn't, you know.	Nisem, veš.
He didn't come back.	Ni se vrnil.
I didn't help.	Nisem pomagal.
Tomorrow will be a better day.	Jutri bo boljši dan.
Certainly nothing happened.	Zagotovo se ni nič zgodilo.
We have all that and more.	Vse to in še več imamo.
It's everything and almost nothing.	To je vse in skoraj nič.
Or maybe not at all.	Ali pa morda sploh ne.
But I want more than that.	Vendar si želim več kot to.
He is sure of it.	Prepričan je o tem.
This game was really good.	Ta igra je bila res dobra.
That's what he does.	To počne.
That wasn't right.	To ni bilo prav.
It has to be there.	Tam mora biti.
But I did it.	Vendar mi je uspelo.
No one knew who they were.	Nihče ni vedel, kdo so.
She needs to be convinced.	Treba jo je prepričati.
Tell me.	Povej mi.
By that I mean,	S tem mislim,.
I would always be alone.	Vedno bi bil sam.
I never got it back.	Nikoli ga nisem dobil nazaj.
Really, I really am.	Res, res sem.
He was gone.	Ni ga bilo več.
I decided not to say anything to him right now.	Odločil sem se, da mu trenutno ne bom rekel ničesar.
This is life.	To je življenje.
You have to do something about it.	Nekaj ​​moraš narediti glede tega.
I can't do anything.	Ničesar ne morem storiti.
You will all be together.	Vsi boste skupaj.
But he still had too much time.	A še vedno je imel preveč časa.
I saw them today.	Danes sem jih videl.
I saw that.	To sem videl.
I still don't know if we'll make it.	Še vedno ne vem, če nam bo uspelo.
You will see for yourself.	Videli boste sami.
You won't die.	Ne boš umrl.
It could be something, it could be nothing.	Lahko je nekaj, lahko pa nič.
He can help us.	Lahko nam pomaga.
So he has time.	Tako ima čas.
However, this is simply not true.	Vendar to preprosto ni res.
I didn't do anything more than that.	Nič več kot to nisem naredil.
I thought you liked it.	Mislil sem, da ti je všeč.
I'm just me.	Samo jaz sem jaz.
I think.	Se mi zdi.
You can't anymore.	Ne moreš več.
Maybe he still was.	Mogoče je še bil.
I forgot them.	Pozabil sem jih.
More than ready.	Več kot pripravljen.
Everything has already happened.	Vse se je že zgodilo.
You should never have done that.	Nikoli ne bi smel narediti tega.
In fact, we always will.	Pravzaprav vedno bomo.
All this no longer exists for me.	Vse to zame ne obstaja več.
She said she did.	Rekla je, da je.
I only need you.	Samo tebe potrebujem.
She doesn't like it.	Ni ji všeč.
I didn't know who.	Nisem vedel kdo.
Life keeps happening.	Življenje se kar naprej dogaja.
You know that.	Veš to.
There will be no other.	Drugega ne bo.
Dad always said that time is money.	Oče je vedno govoril, da je čas denar.
From there we know what to do.	Od tam vemo, kaj storiti.
It was really, really hard.	Bilo je res, res težko.
And you also know too much.	In tudi veš preveč.
More can and should be done.	Več je mogoče storiti in je treba storiti.
I can't speak.	Ne morem govoriti.
Which is three.	Kar je tri.
He does so much for us.	Toliko naredi za nas.
You know that better than I do.	Ti to veš bolje od mene.
We wouldn't do anything about it anyway.	Tako ali tako ne bi naredili ničesar glede tega.
He liked her, a lot.	Všeč mu je bila, zelo.
More than happy.	Več kot vesel.
Just not mine.	Samo ne moj.
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
That just wasn't the case.	Temu preprosto ni bilo tako.
My car too.	Tudi moj avto.
He was a good man.	Bil je dober človek.
No, he didn't need it, he said.	Ne, ni ga potreboval, je rekel.
That's what happened.	To se je zgodilo.
None of us knew what to do.	Nihče od nas ni vedel, kaj storiti.
You know why you're here.	Veš zakaj si tukaj.
I never asked.	Nikoli nisem vprašal.
We know that.	To vemo.
But that was all behind him now.	A to je bilo zdaj vse za njim.
You're not even there.	Sploh nisi tam.
I wouldn't eat.	Ne bi jedel.
What is it, she said.	Kaj je, je rekla.
It's not like that.	Ni tako.
I mean, no better.	Mislim, ne bolje.
But that wasn't all.	A to še ni bilo vse.
I had a hard time this morning.	Zjutraj mi je bilo težko.
Maybe they saw him.	Morda so ga videli.
It would be difficult.	Bilo bi težko.
I had several children.	Imel sem nekaj otrok.
I probably never would.	Verjetno nikoli ne bi.
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
She was so sorry.	Tako ji je bilo žal.
I was working.	Delal sem.
I haven't seen him much.	Nisem ga veliko videl.
And that will be it.	In to bo to.
Well, he was.	Pa je bil.
I should go to the hotel.	Morala bi iti v hotel.
The car seems to have a life of its own.	Zdi se, da ima avto svoje življenje.
Now is the time.	Zdaj je pravi čas.
I do not like.	Ni mi všeč.
Never told anyone.	Nikoli nikomur povedal.
We can't help you anymore.	Ne moremo ti več pomagati.
I am angry.	Jezen sem.
I love being able to do that.	Všeč mi je, da lahko to počnem.
Why not? 	Zakaj ne?
he thought.	mislil je.
We can't stay here now.	Zdaj ne moremo ostati tukaj.
He has a life.	Ima življenje.
This is very obvious.	To je zelo očitno.
But I don't understand that.	Ne razumem pa tega.
He had it.	Imel ga je.
It wasn't even possible.	Sploh ni bilo mogoče.
This is how we are at home.	Tako smo doma.
You sure know your stuff my friend.	Zagotovo veš svoje stvari, prijatelj moj.
I am none of those things.	Jaz nisem nič od tega.
This is obviously not true.	To očitno ni res.
Did he call you.	Ali te poklical.
We know that for sure.	To vemo zagotovo.
And you know that.	In to veš.
He probably doesn't think it's time for that.	Verjetno ne misli, da je čas za to.
I'm never good enough.	Nikoli nisem dovolj dober.
But if it is.	Če pa je.
He didn't ask why then.	Takrat se ni vprašal, zakaj.
He wasn't human, not completely.	Ni bil človek, sploh ne popolnoma.
I liked that too.	Tudi to mi je bilo všeč.
Like just now.	Kot pravkar.
It doesn't go any further.	Ne gre več naprej.
But we were very lucky.	Imeli pa smo veliko srečo.
I feel good, really.	Počutim se dobro, res.
He won't let it go.	Tega ne bo pustil.
There was always more money ahead of us.	Vedno je bilo več denarja pred nami.
By being a thing.	S tem, da je stvar.
I don't like them either.	Tudi jaz jih ne maram.
He didn't ask about me.	Ni vprašal o meni.
He just didn't win.	Samo zmagal ni.
I know everything you want to say.	Vem vse, kar želiš povedati.
And there was no one else left.	In nikogar drugega ni bilo več.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
I just wish there were more of them.	Želim si le, da bi jih bilo več.
He knows it's that easy.	Ve, da je tako lahko.
That must be likely.	To mora biti verjetno.
As we should.	Tako kot bi morali.
She really was.	Res je bila.
And there we were.	In tam smo bili.
And very little else.	In zelo malo drugega.
And you never know when it will come in handy.	In nikoli ne veš, kdaj ti pride prav.
I promised.	Obljubil sem.
But I don't have time.	Nimam pa časa.
I moved on.	Šel sem naprej.
I am a teacher.	Jaz sem učitelj.
This is absolutely true.	To je popolnoma res.
As good as it was back then.	Tako dobro, kot je bilo takrat.
She was not sorry.	Ni ji bilo žal.
Not much, but some.	Ne veliko, nekaj pa.
That was life.	To je bilo življenje.
I just had to know.	Samo vedeti sem moral.
He was just tired.	Samo utrujen je bil.
Here it was.	Tukaj je bilo.
I'm sure it will.	Prepričan sem, da bo.
People are so interested.	Ljudi tako zanima.
But that didn't happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
No one came after three.	Po tri ni nihče prišel.
And that was nice.	In to je bilo lepo.
Will it happen or not.	Ali se bo zgodilo ali ne.
I'm always happy to see him.	Vedno sem vesel, da ga vidim.
I don't need anymore.	Ne potrebujem več.
She had to go to work.	Morala je v službo.
You are here again.	Spet ste tukaj.
But apparently that is not the case.	A očitno temu ni tako.
I don't like them.	Ne maram jih.
He would be right, as always.	Imel bi prav, kot vedno.
I have to be ready.	Moram biti pripravljen.
We all have.	Vsi imamo.
And he may have done it more than once.	In morda je to storil več kot enkrat.
He looked like a man who was not feeling well.	Videti je bil kot človek, ki se ne počuti dobro.
Which is enough.	Kar je dovolj.
And that's what it does.	In to je tisto, kar počne.
He said it would probably be this week.	Rekel je, da bo verjetno ta teden.
Nice to have you here.	Lepo, da si tukaj.
Just do it.	Samo naredi to.
He didn't see anyone.	Nikogar ni videl.
Not true for me.	Zame ni res.
Which is a very good thing.	Kar je zelo dobra stvar.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
I have to do this.	To moram storiti.
Not before, not since.	Ne prej, ne od takrat.
Let me do it.	Naj to storim.
You are alone.	Sam si.
He had no one.	Ni imel nikogar.
Or maybe they were.	Ali pa so morda bili.
He said nothing and waited.	Nič ni rekel in čakal.
This is happening now.	To se zdaj dogaja.
And that's not all.	In to še ni vse.
He didn't have time.	Ni imel časa.
All was well now.	Zdaj je bilo vse dobro.
He will come.	Prišel bo.
I just need some time.	Samo malo časa potrebujem.
The question is whether it will.	Vprašanje je, ali bo.
About what happened.	O tem, kaj se je zgodilo.
Not yet, he told himself.	Ne še, si je rekel.
That seems obvious enough.	To se zdi dovolj očitno.
Her father brought her back to life.	Oče jo je vrnil v življenje.
They were lucky.	Imeli so srečo.
It was all just too much.	Vsega je bilo preprosto preveč.
I'd love to hear them.	Rad bi jih slišal.
He just can't do that to me.	Tega mi preprosto ne more narediti.
You still can.	Še vedno lahko.
I want to be surprised by what comes out.	Želim biti presenečen nad tem, kar pride ven.
Now he is with us again.	Zdaj je spet z nami.
I just wouldn't.	Samo ne bi.
That was more likely.	To je bilo bolj verjetno.
He gave her that.	To ji je dal.
That's all there is now.	To je vse, kar je zdaj.
It's here and it's been here before.	Tukaj je in že je bilo tukaj.
He is more than that.	On je več kot to.
Sometimes it was good, sometimes not.	Včasih je bilo dobro, včasih ne.
And they are not the only ones.	In niso edini.
Surely someone must know something.	Zagotovo mora nekdo nekaj vedeti.
Once it's gone, it's gone.	Ko ga enkrat ni več, ga ni več.
Better than it was.	Bolje kot je bilo.
This is my way.	To je moj način.
There is so much going on in this one.	Toliko se dogaja v tem.
Now I'll see what happens.	Zdaj bom videl, kaj se bo zgodilo.
He lives here.	Živi tukaj.
There was no help for him now.	Zdaj mu ni bilo pomoči.
Nothing was ever easy for me.	Nikoli mi nič ni bilo lahko.
I won't always be there.	Ne bom vedno tam.
He won't die from it.	Ne bo umrl zaradi tega.
This is simply not true.	To preprosto ni res.
Everything was wrong.	Vse je bilo narobe.
He did a great job.	Opravil je veliko delo.
I don't know everything.	Ne poznam vsega.
I think you are a good man.	Mislim, da si dober človek.
But all this is still not enough.	A vse to še vedno ni dovolj.
We're all fine.	Vsi smo v redu.
It's been there for a while.	Tam je že nekaj časa.
I have to.	Moram.
Very good, very happy.	Zelo dobro, zelo vesel.
No, you're probably right.	Ne, verjetno imaš prav.
No more for me, ever.	Nič več zame, nikoli.
He wanted it for so long.	Tako dolgo si je želel.
I think there will be more.	Mislim, da bo še več.
But it's not that simple.	Vendar ni tako preprosto.
Something felt really, really wrong.	Nekaj ​​se mi je zdelo res zelo narobe.
A few things.	Nekaj ​​stvari.
That's what she wanted.	To si je želela.
He loved seeing her there.	Rad jo je videl tam.
But he wasn't ready to tell her just yet.	Vendar ji še ni bil pripravljen povedati.
It may be a matter of time.	To je lahko stvar časa.
But they didn't do that.	Vendar tega niso storili.
I have to tell you about it.	Moram ti povedati o tem.
Like he knew he would.	Kot da je vedel, da bo.
It always has been and always will be.	Vedno je bilo in vedno bo.
I can't be mad at anyone.	Ne morem biti jezen na nikogar.
Which we all were.	Kar smo vsi bili.
He never told me how he knew.	Nikoli mi ni povedal, kako je vedel.
And for not much money.	In za ne veliko denarja.
Now you said it.	Zdaj si povedal.
That was gone now.	Tega zdaj ni bilo več.
That will be enough.	To bo dovolj.
I've never been there.	Nikoli nisem bil tam.
This is a possibility.	To je možnost.
Maybe there was always time.	Mogoče je bil vedno čas.
But it didn't happen.	Pa se ni zgodilo.
I was actually very good to me.	Pravzaprav sem bil zelo dober zame.
It's hard for him.	Težko mu je.
He's the only one who could tell.	On je edini, ki bi lahko povedal.
There wasn't enough time.	Ni bilo dovolj časa.
How can you.	Kako lahko.
I much prefer good.	Veliko raje imam dobro.
I don't think she ever will.	Mislim, da je nikoli ne bo.
He seems to like children.	Zdi se, da ima rad otroke.
You have to leave now.	Zdaj moraš oditi.
I don't think so.	Jaz ne mislim.
Like time itself.	Kot čas sam.
It was an obvious question.	Bilo je očitno vprašanje.
Why are you here?	Zakaj si tukaj.
Does not exist.	Ne obstaja.
The work is good.	Delo je dobro.
She will love this.	To ji bo všeč.
However, this is not the case at all.	Vendar temu sploh ni tako.
Very, very nice work.	Zelo, zelo lepo delo.
Tomorrow too.	Tudi jutri.
He had to do it himself.	To je moral narediti sam.
I didn't promise you it would happen.	Nisem ti obljubil, da se bo to zgodilo.
You did it.	Ti si naredil.
No one could see.	Nihče ni mogel videti.
And he didn't have to.	In ni mu bilo treba.
Did you think you were.	Ali mislil, da si.
It was more than meets the eye.	Bilo je več, kot se je zdelo.
No one knows about it.	Nihče ne ve za to.
He is here to help.	Tukaj je, da pomaga.
I meant nothing.	Nič nisem mislil.
Maybe something like that happened now.	Mogoče se je kaj takega zgodilo zdaj.
I hope one of you can help me.	Upam, da mi bo kdo od vas lahko pomagal.
I didn't want anything from him.	Nič nisem hotel od njega.
He never came out.	Nikoli ni prišel ven.
He just won and you know, we had a really good time.	Pravkar je zmagal in veste, imeli smo se zelo dobro.
Not for us.	Ne za nas.
He wasn't.	On ni bil.
And for now, that seems to be true.	In za zdaj se zdi, da je to res.
It was just come, play and go home.	Bilo je le priti, igrati in iti domov.
She knew that.	To je vedela.
I never have, never will.	Nikoli nisem, nikoli ne bom.
A very tired man.	Zelo utrujen človek.
I did that and more.	Naredil sem to in še več.
I made such a good decision.	Tako dobro sem se odločil.
And maybe he told me.	In morda mi je rekel.
Or maybe he expected too much.	Ali pa je morda pričakoval preveč.
I don't like that too much.	To mi ni preveč všeč.
I forgot before.	Prej sem pozabil.
You used to be.	Včasih si bil.
Nothing seems simpler.	Nič se ne zdi bolj preprosto.
I heard about it.	Slišal sem o tem.
The man said nothing.	Človek ni rekel ničesar.
He didn't mean it.	Ni to mislil.
I hope mine does too.	Upam, da tudi moj.
We live.	Mi, živi.
I lost everything that day.	Tisti dan sem izgubil vse.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
There was something else.	Pa še nekaj je bilo.
There is nothing in me.	V meni ni ničesar.
I'll probably play it again sometime.	Verjetno ga bom še kdaj igral.
I already told you.	Povedal sem ti že.
And yet they didn't.	Pa vendar niso.
For a long time.	Že dolgo časa.
It's not always like that.	Ni vedno tako.
Seriously, it's true.	Resno, res je.
He hopes we can make it.	Upa, da nam bo uspelo.
We already knew that.	To smo že vedeli.
But he's still interested.	Vendar ga še vedno zanima.
The man died.	Človek je umrl.
He can't speak.	Ne more govoriti.
He would know what to do.	On bi vedel, kaj storiti.
We almost know.	Skoraj vemo.
I would love to have them.	Rad bi jih imel.
I forgot.	Pozabil sem.
She liked everything.	Vse ji je bilo všeč.
He said nothing.	Nič rekel.
He wasn't even mad.	Niti ni bil jezen.
It seemed like it didn't happen.	Zdelo se je, kot da se to ni zgodilo.
I'm going to my room.	Grem v svojo sobo.
I wouldn't find it.	Ne bi ga našel.
He will be with us soon.	Kmalu bo z nami.
We had nothing then.	Takrat nismo imeli nič.
And we will all have it.	In vsi ga bomo imeli.
This is normal for me.	To je zame običajno.
You were too.	Tudi ti si bil.
You shouldn't talk to me about it.	Ne bi smel o tem govoriti z mano.
Something happened to me.	Nekaj ​​se mi je zgodilo.
It had to be you.	Moral si biti ti.
This is something we have to do together.	To je nekaj, kar moramo narediti skupaj.
He went out there and just did his job.	Šel je tja in samo opravil svoje delo.
And found you.	In našel te.
Nothing seems the same since then anyway.	Od takrat se tako ali tako nič ne zdi tako, kot je bilo.
I'm sorry .	Žal mi je .
I allowed you everything.	Dovolil sem vam vse.
He certainly didn't have one himself.	Sam ga zagotovo ni imel.
You shouldn't be doing that at all.	Tega sploh ne bi smel početi.
He doesn't have to.	Ni mu treba.
Dal will not play next week either.	Dal tudi naslednji teden ne bo igral.
I had no one else.	Nisem imel nikogar drugega.
And that's really it.	In to je res to.
I'll always know where it is.	Vedno bom vedel, kje je.
He decided that last night.	To se je odločil sinoči.
It can be quite difficult.	Lahko je kar težko.
You could do it too.	Tudi ti bi lahko to naredil.
He has not been seen since.	Od takrat ga niso več videli.
I don't know, maybe you do.	Ne vem, morda pa ti.
That's when he came to me.	Takrat je prišel k meni.
This is work.	To je delo.
I would know if you had.	Vedel bi, če bi imeli.
But I have a problem.	Vendar imam problem.
I wish you were here.	Želim si, da bi bil tukaj.
I don't understand what you mean.	Ne razumem, kaj misliš.
I believe that.	to verjamem.
Knowing is much better than not knowing.	Vedeti je veliko bolje kot ne vedeti.
He had no children.	Ni imel otrok.
I'll come get you.	Prišel bom po vas.
Everything will be fine now.	Zdaj bo vse v redu.
It would be good to learn that.	Dobro bi bilo, če bi se tega naučil.
She wanted everything to be okay.	Želela je, da bi bilo vse v redu.
You could, you know.	Lahko bi, veš.
There's too much going on.	Preveč se dogaja.
I was glad to be there.	Bil sem vesel, da sem tam.
And maybe they had.	In morda so jih imeli.
They had their own lives.	Imeli so svoje življenje.
What we did and so on.	Kaj smo naredili in tako naprej.
It seemed to him.	Zdelo se mu je.
Yes, you could.	Da, lahko bi.
I will do anything.	Naredil bom vse.
I don't feel alone anymore.	Ne počutim se več sama.
No one will like this.	To nikomur ne bo všeč.
I lost it too.	Tudi jaz sem ga izgubil.
Again, he was very much a teacher.	Spet je bil zelo učitelj.
He became a good friend.	Postal je dober prijatelj.
It's about time too.	Tudi čas je že.
I've never heard that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem slišal.
She liked that he called them.	Bilo ji je všeč, da jih je poklical.
I shouldn't have left at all.	Sploh ne bi smel oditi.
The day has begun.	Dan se je začel.
It's all happening again.	Vse se spet dogaja.
This is hard.	To je težko.
And rightly so.	In prav je tako.
Nothing like that.	Nič takega.
We have to go.	Moramo iti.
What are they, he asked.	Kaj so, je vprašal.
I actually just got home.	Pravzaprav sem pravkar prišel domov.
Which they are.	Kar so.
Some time.	Nekaj ​​časa.
It usually isn't.	Običajno ni.
They are still together.	Še vedno sta skupaj.
That's when he decided to go home.	Takrat se je odločil, da gre domov.
Here, there it is.	Tukaj, tam je.
I'll be fine.	Bom v redu.
I probably would.	Verjetno bi.
You just told me that.	Pravkar si mi to povedal.
I never said anything like that to him.	Nikoli mu nisem rekel kaj takega.
It's good too.	Dobro je tudi.
We both still are.	Oba sva še vedno.
Don't tell me about it.	Ne govori mi o tem.
Someone knows something.	Nekdo nekaj ve.
You'll never know who you might have been.	Nikoli ne boste vedeli, kdo ste morda bili.
And someone died.	In nekdo je umrl.
It's not like it might not happen.	Ni tako, da se morda ne bi zgodilo.
How not.	Kako ni.
It's not me.	Nisem jaz.
I like you so much.	Tako si mi všeč.
But it was more than that, she said.	Vendar je bilo več kot to, je rekla.
He still is and he likes it.	Še vedno je in to mu je všeč.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mogoče je to dobro.
Back home.	Nazaj domov.
Sometimes not.	Včasih ne.
But it could be.	Lahko pa bi bilo.
He meant it to everyone.	To je mislil za vse.
Someone had to see it.	Nekdo je to moral videti.
He called for something to eat.	Poklical je nekaj za jesti.
You do not know.	Ne veš.
When he works.	Ko dela.
Many people.	Veliko ljudi.
And he never played again.	In nikoli več ni igral.
He never got lost.	Nikoli se ni izgubil.
Anything can be good enough.	Vse je lahko dovolj dobro.
But he had to work on it.	Vendar je moral delati na tem.
It is possible, but not easy to do.	To je mogoče, vendar ni lahko narediti.
You talk to me.	Ti govori z mano.
When you want.	Ko si želiš.
Nothing is ever right.	Nikoli ni nič prav.
You know what to do, just do it.	Veš, kaj moraš storiti, samo naredi to.
And that's if you're very lucky.	In to, če imaš veliko srečo.
Here, she said.	Tukaj, je rekla.
But he wouldn't tell or couldn't tell.	Vendar ni hotel povedati ali ni mogel povedati.
There's no one here yet.	Tukaj še ni nikogar.
I don't believe in these things.	Ne verjamem v te stvari.
He had had enough today.	Danes je imel dovolj.
It's not like home.	Ni kot doma.
Do that and nothing more.	Naredi to in nič več.
Good job on that!.	Dobro delo na tem!.
That was enough for both of us.	To je bilo dovolj za oba.
But now it isn't.	Zdaj pa ni.
Maybe you wouldn't.	Mogoče ne bi.
That's what's happening here.	To se dogaja tukaj.
Not always a good reason.	Ni vedno dober razlog.
Everyone seemed to like me.	Videti je bilo, da sem vsem všeč.
And it was good.	In bilo je dobro.
Or maybe they are.	Ali pa morda so.
I won't see you, I won't call again.	Ne bom se videl, ne bom več poklical.
He didn't appear to be waiting.	Ni bilo videti, da bi čakal.
No, neither do you.	Ne, niti ti ne.
I was just talking to him about it.	Pravkar sem govoril z njim o tem.
And even if they were.	Pa tudi če bi bili.
He did well in that too.	Tudi to mu je dobro uspelo.
To be in place.	Biti na mestu.
And he said he didn't know why.	In rekel je, da ne ve zakaj.
But maybe not much.	Morda pa ne veliko.
it is not.	ni.
But we can know that it will happen.	Lahko pa vemo, da se bo to zgodilo.
Do you have .	Ali imaš .
I can't reach him.	Ne morem do njega.
I didn't want to.	Nisem hotel.
I mean, really, very simple.	Mislim, res, zelo preprosto.
None of us needed or wanted the money.	Nihče od nas ni potreboval ali hotel denarja.
I have a book about it.	Imam knjigo o tem.
I'm fine now.	Zdaj mi je vse v redu.
Right is right and wrong is wrong.	Prav je prav in narobe je narobe.
No one knows where she went or why.	Nihče ne ve, kam je šla in zakaj.
But it doesn't work.	Vendar ne gre.
Perhaps he would know better.	Morda bi vedel bolje.
From .	Iz .
But he was so quick to admit it.	Vendar je to tako hitro priznal.
And good looking.	In dobro videti.
I've never seen him.	Nikoli ga nisem videl.
I could be right.	Lahko bi imel prav.
I don't want you here either.	Tudi jaz te ne želim tukaj.
I think it would be better that way.	Mislim, da bi bilo bolje tako.
To see something else.	Videti nekaj drugega.
He was obviously able to work.	Očitno je lahko delal.
No, that can't be right.	Ne, to ne more biti prav.
It wasn't possible.	Ni bilo mogoče.
It's never long.	Nikoli ni dolgo.
Or do this.	Ali pa naredi to.
I must have heard her wrong.	Verjetno sem jo narobe slišal.
Actually, there are more.	Pravzaprav jih je več.
Maybe it does, but sometimes it doesn't.	Mogoče se, včasih pa tudi ne.
He still wanted it.	Še vedno si je želel.
But she knew something.	Nekaj ​​pa je vedela.
That seems pretty wrong to me.	To se mi zdi precej narobe.
Which she could be.	Kar bi lahko bila.
Or maybe she doesn't want to be seen.	Ali pa morda ne želi, da bi jo videli.
Okay, there are more.	V redu, več jih je.
I managed to convince him not to go.	Uspelo mi ga je prepričati, da ne gre.
I think that happened to me last night.	Mislim, da se mi je to zgodilo sinoči.
But not too much.	Vendar ne preveč.
No, no, no and no.	Ne, ne, ne in ne.
It would be difficult.	Bilo bi težko.
I always ate.	Vedno sem jedel.
Maybe he didn't hear me well.	Morda me ni dobro slišal.
He didn't come to me.	Ni prišel k meni.
I really wish you were here.	Res si želim, da bi bil tukaj.
We have several.	Imamo jih več.
He doesn't do that often.	Tega ne počne pogosto.
No, he himself.	Ne, on sam.
So tired of it.	Tako utrujen od tega.
And seriously.	In resno.
Can someone help me.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga.
It felt so, so wrong.	Zdelo se je tako, tako narobe.
It was nothing.	To ni bilo nič.
Maybe more things.	Mogoče več stvari.
I learned this very early.	To sem se naučil zelo zgodaj.
he asked.	je vprašal.
I wasn't sorry.	Ni mi bilo žal.
I have none of that.	Tega nimam nič.
I wanted to know everything about it.	Želel sem vedeti vse o tem.
But you don't know that.	Tega pa ne veš.
Mine certainly does.	Moj zagotovo ima.
It wasn't any of us.	Ni bil nihče od nas.
She wasn't there then.	Takrat je ni bilo.
You don't know what it's like here.	Ne veš, kako je tukaj.
I asked how.	Vprašal sem, kako.
We really do.	Mi res.
He always says that.	Vedno to govori.
Maybe he's at home, you know.	Mogoče je doma, kajne veš.
I'm glad you came.	Vesel sem, da si prišel.
He wanted out, everything.	Hotel je ven, vsega.
If so, go ahead.	Če že, kar naprej.
We just need to see more.	Preprosto moramo videti več.
If you are human.	Če si človek.
He must know.	Vedeti mora.
I will tell you this once and only once.	To ti bom povedal enkrat in samo enkrat.
She didn't know what to do.	Ni vedela, kaj naj naredi.
And he wanted her forever.	In hotel si jo je za vedno.
I would know what to say to him.	Vedel bi, kaj bi mu rekel.
He said he would call me.	Rekel je, da me bo poklical.
I would say that is wrong.	Rekel bi, da je to narobe.
I didn't like it too much.	Ni mi bilo preveč všeč.
He loved me too.	Tudi mene je imel rad.
He's working on it.	Dela na tem.
I'm glad to know him.	Vesel sem, da ga poznam.
Okay to move on.	V redu, da grem naprej.
It was as she knew it would be.	Bilo je tako, kot je vedela, da bo.
He was waiting.	Čakal je.
You are fine for all of us.	Za vse nas ste v redu.
We were it.	Bili smo to.
He's your man.	On je tvoj človek.
Nobody knows anything about it.	Nihče ne ve nič o tem.
I just know it happened.	Samo vem, da se je zgodilo.
It seems so.	Zdi se, da.
But we'll see.	Vendar bomo videli.
More of that.	Več tega.
Early afternoon.	Zgodaj popoldne.
I haven't seen you here before.	Nisem te še videl tukaj.
He saw something in me.	Nekaj ​​je videl v meni.
What was true is.	Kar je bilo res, je.
She liked everything.	Vse ji je bilo všeč.
And that seems to be the case right now.	In zdi se, da je trenutno tako.
I know you want to help.	Vem, da želiš pomagati.
I wonder who that was.	Sprašujem se, kdo je to bil.
.	.
You needed me.	Potreboval si me.
I hope we will.	Upam, da bomo.
It wasn't good at all.	Sploh ni bilo dobro.
I did not know.	Nisem vedel.
Everything is fine!.	Vse je v redu!.
I don't want to do too much of it.	Nočem delati preveč tega.
They always are.	Vedno so.
I saw something.	Nekaj ​​sem videl.
It makes everything so simple.	Zaradi tega je vse tako preprosto.
Let me do it.	Naj mi to naredi.
Yes, for now.	Da, za zdaj.
We did that.	To smo storili.
I'm going with him, father.	Jaz grem z njim, oče.
Not everyone always likes everything.	Vsem ni vedno vse všeč.
Probably the only thing he cares about.	Verjetno edina stvar, ki ga zanima.
As always, there was no one there.	Tam, kot vedno, ni bilo nikogar.
You knew that.	Vedel si to.
None of this might have happened.	Nič od tega se morda ne bi zgodilo.
No one seems to know what it could be.	Zdi se, da nihče ne ve, kaj bi to lahko bilo.
I think I could do that.	Mislim, da bi lahko to storil.
That was all there, for sure.	To je bilo vse tam, zagotovo.
In fact, even better.	Pravzaprav še toliko bolje.
We are very.	Zelo smo.
There is still so much to do.	Še toliko je treba storiti.
But he didn't do that.	Vendar tega ni storil.
You still have a life.	Še vedno imaš življenje.
It still is.	Še vedno je.
What you worked for.	Za kar si delal.
And maybe we could.	In morda bi lahko.
It's not hard to make.	Ni ga težko narediti.
Unfortunately, that was not the case.	Žal ni bilo tako.
He loved her so much.	Tako zelo jo je imel rad.
But it isn't.	Vendar ni.
He couldn't believe it.	Ni mogel verjeti.
After that, that was it.	Po tem je bilo to to.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
Now what? 	Kaj pa zdaj?
he thought.	mislil je.
And here we are again.	In spet smo tukaj.
He had heard them before.	Slišal jih je že prej.
I could die here.	Lahko bi umrl tukaj.
Someone will come.	Nekdo bo prišel.
Alone as always.	Kot vedno sam.
She knew what it was about.	Vedela je, za kaj gre.
This is not good for anyone.	To ni dobro za nikogar.
Don't tell me anything.	Ne govori mi nič.
I was no longer alone.	Nisem bil več sam.
Like yes.	Kot da .
I don't have to be me all the time.	Ni treba, da sem ves čas jaz.
It was just him.	Bil je samo on.
Except it doesn't feel right at all.	Le da se sploh ne zdi v redu.
She was at home.	Bila je doma.
This is always true.	To je vedno res.
We never were.	Nikoli nismo bili.
I wasn't alone.	Nisem bil sam.
He acknowledged them.	Priznal jih je.
I didn't see you.	Nisem te videl.
Apparently it did.	Očitno se je.
I need to see what's what.	Moram videti, kaj je kaj.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Glede tega ne moremo storiti ničesar.
It's just that thing.	To je samo ta stvar.
Let it be very.	Naj bo to zelo.
He didn't find it.	Ni ga našel.
This happened to me.	To se mi je zgodilo.
Maybe that was true.	Mogoče je bilo to res.
But he wasn't very good at it.	Vendar v tem ni bil zelo dober.
Not everyone is convinced.	Vsi niso prepričani.
I never knew about it.	Nikoli nisem vedel za to.
He wanted out.	Hotel je ven.
It might be.	Morda je.
He has a good job.	Ima dobro službo.
Just like me, he thinks.	Tako kot jaz, misli.
I never liked it.	Nikoli mi ni bilo všeč.
Not like it used to be.	Ne tako kot nekoč.
You have me there.	Imaš me tam.
We had a great time doing it.	Pri tem smo se imeli lepo.
He had a very good week.	Imel je zelo dober teden.
But it wasn't very good either.	A tudi ni bilo preveč dobro.
Who was he.	Kdo je bil.
You never know when something will come in handy.	Nikoli se ne ve, kdaj mu kaj pride prav.
It would be very nice.	Bilo bi zelo lepo.
That's what he told himself.	Tako si je rekel.
If only, but I seriously doubt it.	Če le, a resno dvomim.
I want to be there for everyone.	Želim biti tam za vse.
It won't happen again.	Ne bo se več zgodilo.
How nice to say that.	Kako lepo je to povedati.
You should do whatever you want.	Moral bi narediti vse, kar želite.
They will do something about it.	Nekaj ​​bodo naredili glede tega.
I don't understand this part.	Tega dela ne razumem.
Maybe he really likes me.	Mogoče me ima res rad.
I would do almost anything to keep it that way.	Naredil bi skoraj vse, da bi tako ostal.
And that's true.	In to je res.
I was always there for you.	Vedno sem bil tam zate.
I can't help him, just like you.	Jaz mu ne morem pomagati, tako kot ti.
He didn't have much to say about it.	O tem ni imel veliko povedati.
The kid was spot on tonight.	Otrok je bil nocoj na mestu.
We know they were there.	Vemo, da so bili tam.
Man is because of .	Človek je zaradi .
I hope it works out for you.	Upam, da ti bo uspelo.
You might be fine with all of that.	Morda vam bo vse to v redu.
Now you are there.	Zdaj si tam.
In fact, there was nothing, nothing for anyone.	Pravzaprav ni bilo ničesar, za nikogar nič.
That's how it comes.	Tako pride.
He went there, but quickly returned.	Šel je tja, a se je hitro vrnil.
That we can still be together.	Da sva lahko še skupaj.
There must be something else we could do.	Mora biti nekaj drugega, kar bi lahko storili.
We'll do something about it tomorrow.	Jutri bomo nekaj naredili glede tega.
I'm ready to move on.	Pripravljen sem iti naprej.
Like you last night.	Kot ti sinoči.
He taught them to work.	Naučil jih je delati.
That would be wrong.	To bi bilo narobe.
I am not sure.	Nisem prepričan.
They had enough of this.	Imeli so dovolj tega.
I will never forget it.	Nikoli tega ne bom pozabil.
We would do that.	To bi storili.
Right, you can't.	Prav, ne moreš.
Just on and on and on.	Samo naprej in naprej in naprej.
It makes it look good.	Zaradi tega je videti dobro.
He said too much.	Povedal je preveč.
There was nothing to be seen there.	Tam ni bilo videti ničesar.
It didn't happen that way at all.	Sploh se ni zgodilo tako.
We're here right now.	Trenutno smo tukaj.
Where to go, what to do.	Kam iti, kaj narediti.
Now.	Zdaj pa .
Or something like that.	Ali nekaj takega.
I'll start.	Jaz bom začel.
Maybe a little.	Mogoče malo.
I met her yesterday.	Spoznal sem jo včeraj.
Which was fine with me.	Kar mi je bilo prav.
We won't make it.	Ne bo nam uspelo.
Maybe still.	Mogoče še vedno.
All we know is that there will be a lot of them.	Vemo le, da jih bo veliko.
Maybe they will.	Morda bodo.
Yes, it does.	Da, ima.
But it looked like he was very happy.	A videti je bilo, da je zelo vesel.
I can definitely see that.	To zagotovo vidim.
You did it yourself.	To si naredil sam.
It wasn't always like that.	Ni bilo vedno tako.
I think that's right.	Mislim, da je to prav.
Money wouldn't do it.	Denar tega ne bi naredil.
That's right.	Da je tako.
It's good to play.	Dobro je igrati.
He was employed in the city.	V mestu je bil zaposlen.
I'm glad it is.	Vesel sem, da je.
He was right about that.	Pri tem je imel prav.
I shouldn't be here.	Ne bi smel biti tukaj.
And so we did it.	In tako smo to storili.
He didn't want to know either.	Tudi on ni hotel vedeti.
I'm home now.	Zdaj sem doma.
That's how it's supposed to happen.	Tako naj bi se zgodilo.
I could eat them all day, every day.	Lahko bi jih jedel ves dan, vsak dan.
It's a good thing he already knows so much.	Še dobro, da že toliko ve.
Because he was there with me.	Ker je bil tam z mano.
That they are.	Da so.
It's good there.	Tam je dobro.
So he sat there.	Tako je sedel tam.
And he's definitely not just a kid anymore.	In zagotovo ni več le otrok.
I'm surprised.	Presenečen sem.
You did this to me, she said.	Ti si mi to naredil, je rekla.
Perhaps he had had enough of her.	Morda jo je imel dovolj.
They haven't been since.	Od takrat jih ni bilo.
But they didn't do it alone.	Vendar tega niso storili sami.
I don't know how to do it.	Ne vem, kako to narediti.
He was anything but.	Bil je vse prej kot.
You should buy what you should do.	Moral bi kupiti tisto, kar bi moral narediti.
I'll say that again.	To bom še enkrat povedal.
It could be this week.	Lahko bi bilo ta teden.
It would be .	Bilo bi .
Life seemed to be good.	Zdelo se je, da je življenje dobro.
What happened?' 	Kaj se je zgodilo?'
Things to see.	Stvari, ki jih je treba videti.
Who knows why it isn't.	Kdo ve, zakaj ni.
I can still see him.	Še vedno ga vidim.
He knew what he would have to do that day.	Vedel je, kaj bo moral storiti ta dan.
She knew it wasn't.	Vedela je, da ni.
I'm the problem.	Problem sem jaz.
They weren't with me.	Niso bili z mano.
I was that kid.	Jaz sem bil ta otrok.
I think he bought it.	Mislim, da je to kupil.
He seems to be good.	Zdi se, da je dober.
So very serious.	Tako zelo resno.
You are alone.	Sami ste.
We'll only be here for a week.	Tukaj bomo le teden dni.
I work alone.	Dela sam.
Can someone help me please.	Mi lahko prosim kdo pomaga.
I am absolutely sure of that.	Popolnoma sem prepričan o tem.
He can help you.	On vam lahko pomaga.
Nothing happened all day.	Ves dan se ni zgodilo nič.
I wanted to be better than you.	Hotel sem biti boljši od tebe.
If only she knew.	Ko bi le vedela.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
Or what he would think.	Ali kaj bi si on mislil.
He's right today.	Danes ima prav.
She didn't have to be.	Ni ji bilo treba biti.
Which isn't.	Kar ni.
Probably not soon enough for me.	Zame verjetno ne dovolj kmalu.
He is a very busy man.	Je zelo zaposlen človek.
He did nothing again today.	Danes spet ni naredil nič.
He said they were together.	Rekel je, da sta skupaj.
We know there are a few, but not many.	Vemo, da jih je nekaj, a ne veliko.
He saw something more.	Videl je nekaj več.
I am really very happy about it.	Res sem zelo vesel tega.
And he played.	In igral je.
Time no longer exists.	Čas ne obstaja več.
He will be back next week.	Vrnil se bo naslednji teden.
The reason for this.	Razlog za to.
He was right about that.	V tem je imel prav.
Actually, it was more.	Pravzaprav je bilo več.
I still believe in it.	Še vedno verjamem v to.
I'll get her.	Dobil jo bom.
That's probably a good thing.	To je verjetno dobra stvar.
It doesn't seem right to me.	Ne zdi se mi prav.
There is not much time left.	Časa ni več veliko.
And don't tell him.	In ne povej mu.
You can have it the way you want it.	Lahko ga imaš tako, kot želiš.
To actually come back to me.	Da bi se pravzaprav vrnil k meni.
He was the one in line.	Bil je tisti v redu.
It's good for us.	To je dobro za nas.
They did a lot.	Veliko so naredili.
He never talked much about it.	Nikoli ni veliko govoril o tem.
Maybe he's just going to work.	Mogoče gre le v službo.
Or it was something more.	Ali pa je bilo nekaj več.
I never really did.	Nikoli res nisem.
We were at home.	Bili smo doma.
I didn't think so.	Nisem mislil, da je tako.
Now he wanted to see each other.	Zdaj se je hotel videl.
I see no one is.	Vidim, da nihče ni.
I thought it would.	Mislil sem, da bo.
It can be done.	To se lahko naredi.
I want to leave now.	Takoj želim oditi.
There's nothing you can do now.	Zdaj ne moreš storiti ničesar.
What we did wasn't even enough.	Kar smo naredili, niti ni bilo dovolj.
I don't want that for you.	Tega ti ne želim.
We had our problems.	Imeli smo svoje težave.
It's still mine.	Še vedno je moj.
He does it.	On to počne.
Now I see.	Zdaj vidim.
To be the thing of the year.	Biti stvar leta.
However, that doesn't seem to be the case.	Vendar se zdi, da ni tako.
He is alone.	On je sam.
Dan was sure of that.	Dan je bil prepričan o tem.
No one seemed to be there.	Zdelo se je, da ni nikogar.
They always have been and always will be.	Vedno so bili in vedno bodo.
He was sure of that now.	O tem je bil zdaj prepričan.
Not so anymore.	Ne več tako.
He's still doing it.	Še vedno to počne.
She could be right.	Prav lahko bi bila.
I may never see them again.	Morda jih nikoli več ne bom videl.
That it is very fast.	Da je zelo hitro.
She didn't know what she was thinking.	Ni vedela, kaj si misli.
But it's definitely hard for me.	Vendar je to zagotovo težko zame.
There is a lot of time.	Veliko časa je.
We did it.	Naredili smo jo.
You are a good boy.	Ti si dober fant.
I could do more if I wanted to.	Lahko bi naredil več, če bi hotel.
He had plenty of time.	Imel je dovolj časa.
Yes, she did.	Je, uspelo ji je.
There was nothing there at all.	Tam sploh ni bilo ničesar.
But so far, no one has spoken.	Vendar do zdaj nihče ni govoril.
I never wanted to be there.	Nikoli nisem hotel biti tam.
It's just wrong to do that.	Preprosto narobe je to narediti.
It was hard for you with us.	Težko vam je bilo pri nas.
For once it would be just him and me.	Enkrat bi bila samo on in jaz.
He knew that for sure.	To je zagotovo vedel.
It could wait.	Lahko bi čakal.
Maybe that was a good thing.	Mogoče pa je bilo to dobro.
That's fine with us.	To je v redu z nami.
You worked too much.	Preveč si delal.
And how much he wants to know.	In koliko želi vedeti.
He was obviously waiting.	Očitno je čakal.
A few years ago.	Že nekaj let nazaj.
This may be the first time.	To je morda prvič.
That's a lot of money.	To je veliko denarja.
And that's a good question.	In to je dobro vprašanje.
This would be nice.	To bi bilo lepo.
That was right for her.	Tako ji je bilo prav.
Im asking for help.	Prosim za pomoč.
He never called me back.	Nikoli me ni poklical nazaj.
She wanted her life back.	Želela je svoje življenje nazaj.
I'm sorry about that.	Žal mi je za to.
Everything is possible now that was never possible.	Zdaj je vse mogoče, kar nikoli ni bilo mogoče.
It's not just you.	Nisi samo ti.
It would be nice to see you.	Lepo bi te bilo videti.
He didn't expect that at all.	Tega sploh ni pričakoval.
Why did this happen.	Zakaj se je to zgodilo.
No, not really.	Ne, res ne.
I hope it works out for you.	Upam, da ti bo uspelo.
However, there is more to it than that.	Vendar pa je več kot to.
He was often in town.	Pogosto je bil v mestu.
I can't eat much right now.	Trenutno ne morem veliko jesti.
And he's right.	In prav ima.
No need to go together.	Ni treba iti skupaj.
Back to the hotel for dinner.	Nazaj v hotel na večerjo.
He had to make sure.	Moral se je prepričati.
And that's not good for any of us.	In to ni dobro za nikogar od nas.
I think it happened the next day.	Mislim, da se je to zgodilo naslednji dan.
I can't tell you more than that right now.	Več kot to vam zdaj ne morem povedati.
He probably knew everything.	Verjetno je vedel vse.
It was really simple.	Res je bilo preprosto.
I haven't even met her.	Sploh je nisem srečal.
It was good again.	Spet je bilo dobro.
I've never had this problem before.	Nikoli prej nisem imel te težave.
There is also more.	Tudi več je.
I will never tell anyone about this.	Nikoli ne bom nikomur povedal za to.
But that's not the case.	Vendar ni tako.
If only it were true.	Ko bi bilo res.
I am not sure.	Nisem prepričan.
That would be me.	To bi bil jaz.
Your father would never let me.	Tvoj oče mi ne bi nikoli dovolil.
Looks like this is it.	Videti je, da je to to.
He will come for us.	Prišel bo po nas.
Neither does he.	Tudi on ne.
And we have a lot of them.	In imamo jih veliko.
He really was a boy.	Res je bil fant.
This is not who we are.	To ni tisto, kar smo.
She was .	Bila je .
I think that's true.	Mislim, da je to res.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
I think you already know that.	Mislim, da to že veš.
We have very little time.	Imamo zelo malo časa.
Which must be the one who made it.	Kar mora biti tisti, ki ga je naredil.
In fact, they already are.	Pravzaprav so že.
He played something.	Nekaj ​​je igral.
I didn't want to do anything else.	Nisem si želel narediti nič drugega.
I only see him when he comes here.	Vidim ga le, ko pride sem.
Let and .	Naj in .
Sometimes very long.	Včasih zelo dolgo.
I have a lot of work.	Imam veliko dela.
But she knew it wasn't like that.	A vedela je, da ni tako.
It was very difficult for us.	Bilo nam je zelo težko.
And talk about it.	In govoriti o tem.
It's not nice.	Ni lepo.
I actually like me now.	Pravzaprav sem si zdaj všeč.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nič nisem storil narobe.
Even more so today.	Danes še toliko bolj.
You have to do it.	Moraš to storiti.
I never have time.	Nikoli nimam časa.
Time is money, and a lot of it.	Čas je denar, in to veliko.
He wasn't sure if he would make it.	Ni bil prepričan, ali mu bo uspelo.
There aren't enough of them.	Ni jih dovolj.
Maybe that's what he meant.	Mogoče je to mislil.
I have something.	Imam nekaj.
There comes a time when enough is enough.	Pride čas, ko je dovolj.
It's probably an opportunity.	Verjetno gre za priložnost.
I have to work on everything.	Delati moram na vsem.
He did everything she told him.	Naredil je vse, kar mu je rekla.
Now I found them.	Zdaj sem jih našel.
Probably not ever.	Verjetno ne nikoli.
I can't go back.	Ne morem nazaj.
You are very good to me.	Zelo si dober do mene.
Maybe it would, maybe it wouldn't.	Mogoče bi, morda ne.
That he wanted her.	Da si jo je želel.
We will have it now.	Zdaj ga bomo imeli.
And he didn't want to.	In ni hotel.
I don't know enough.	Ne vem dovolj.
They had to know.	Morali so vedeti.
No please no	Ne prosim ne
He spoke.	Govoril je.
Think, think, think.	Misli, misli, misli.
Or maybe it's not wrong.	Ali pa morda ni narobe.
Do you like it?	Ti je všeč?.
It could be.	Prav lahko bi.
She was already home.	Bila je že doma.
I told him we wouldn't do that.	Rekel sem mu, da tega ne bomo storili.
It will happen to you no matter who you are.	Zgodilo se vam bo ne glede na to, kdo ste.
He knew very little.	Vedel je zelo malo.
And he didn't forget what to do.	In ni pozabil, kaj storiti.
Maybe there isn't one at all.	Morda ga sploh ni.
This may be too obvious.	To je morda preveč očitno.
I was also a little tired.	Bil sem tudi malo utrujen.
Nobody called.	Nihče ni poklical.
I will leave.	odšel bom.
I will do that.	To bom naredil.
That just wasn't good.	To preprosto ni bilo dobro.
Nothing would come of it.	Nič ne bi bilo iz tega.
It is also played for fun.	Igra se tudi za zabavo.
I like them too.	Tudi meni so všeč.
I don't think so.	Jaz ne mislim .
I would almost die today.	Danes bi skoraj umrl.
What a man could do, we did.	Kar bi človek lahko, to smo storili.
This makes me angry.	Zaradi tega sem jezen.
This is a must see.	To je treba videti.
Just say where.	Samo povej kje.
How is this possible? 	Kako je to mogoče?
My father always told me that.	Oče mi je to vedno govoril.
Or also.	Ali tudi.
I would never lose her.	Nikoli je ne bi izgubil.
Pretty simple, really.	Precej preprosto, res.
I didn't hear anyone.	Nikogar nisem slišal.
Boy was that a long time ago.	Fant je bil to že dolgo nazaj.
I told you.	Sem ti rekel.
About everything, really.	O vsem, res.
Maybe because he was busy.	Morda zato, ker je bil zaposlen.
They probably are.	Verjetno so.
I never knew there was anything wrong with it.	Nikoli nisem vedel, da je s tem kaj narobe.
You will either fail or succeed.	Ne bo vam uspelo ali pa vam bo uspelo.
Something is wrong, not right at all.	Nekaj ​​ni v redu, sploh ni v redu.
That's how it should be.	Tako naj bi bilo.
Someone would still see them.	Še vedno bi jih kdo videl.
I didn't hear anything.	Nič nisem slišal.
He seems much better, but he wants to see you again.	Zdi se veliko bolje, vendar te želi spet videti.
It's still early here.	Tukaj je še zgodaj.
Now obviously.	Zdaj pa očitno.
I wouldn't say why or where.	Ne bi rekel zakaj ali kam.
You know, we weren't that often before.	Veste, prej nismo bili tako pogosto.
I would soon move on.	Kmalu bi šel naprej.
This was even more true now than it was then.	To je bilo zdaj še bolj res kot takrat.
It's a game.	To je igra.
He wasn't the man he used to be.	Ni bil človek, kot je bil.
He came to tell us yesterday.	Včeraj nam je prišel povedati.
I saw right away.	Takoj sem videl.
Maybe it's just me.	Mogoče sem to samo jaz.
I didn't walk away from you.	Nisem odšel od tebe.
I am interested in.	Zanima me.
It's good.	Dobro je.
None of us were happy about it.	Nihče od nas ni bil vesel tega.
I just forgot who you are.	Samo pozabil sem, kdo si.
He managed to do all this by himself.	Vse to mu je uspelo narediti sam.
Not at all, really.	Sploh ne, res.
A real guy too.	Tudi pravi fant.
What was, was.	Kar je bilo, je bilo.
I could be of help with that.	Pri tem bi lahko bila v pomoč.
He decided not to.	Odločil se je, da tega ne stori.
I haven't heard yet.	Še nisem slišal.
Not there now.	Zdaj ne tam.
You will do it for me.	Ti boš to naredil zame.
It's also not okay.	Prav tako ni v redu.
He's more afraid of you than you are of him.	Bolj se te boji kot ti njega.
I'm really begging you.	res te lepo prosim.
There was no more time.	Ni bilo več časa.
That was a really good question.	To je bilo res dobro vprašanje.
She wasn't completely alone.	Ni bila popolnoma sama.
Usually, but not always.	Običajno, vendar ne vedno.
There is nothing like us.	Nič ni kot mi.
He liked the hotel.	Hotel mu je bil všeč.
Maybe there's more to it.	Mogoče je še kaj več.
He liked to be sure.	Rad je bil prepričan.
Your father was a good man.	Tvoj oče je bil dober človek.
I can never do that.	Tega nikoli ne morem storiti.
We must do what is right.	Narediti moramo, kar je prav.
You should know.	Morali bi vedeti.
I left feeling good.	Odšel sem, počutil sem se dobro.
I know you are the one.	Vem, da si ti tisti.
She was no longer a child.	Ni bila več otrok.
I was so tired and all.	Bil sem tako utrujen in vse.
No, really, it does that to you.	Ne, res, ti to naredi.
I shouldn't talk to him.	Ne bi smel govoriti z njim.
We always do.	Vedno se.
I don't even need it.	Sploh ga ne potrebujem.
Is to be fully prepared.	Je biti popolnoma pripravljen.
He needed dinner.	Potreboval je večerjo.
This is actually not difficult to do.	To pravzaprav ni težko narediti.
We are no longer at home.	Ni nas več doma.
Both are fine.	Oba sta v redu.
But he knows.	Vendar ve.
I think it was more.	Mislim, da je bilo več.
That was all she knew.	To je bilo vse, kar je vedela.
And neither do we.	In tudi mi ne.
They had to get out.	Morali so ven.
Right there, right then.	Takoj tam, prav takrat.
You know it has to be that way.	Saj veš, da tako mora biti.
I think it's likely.	Mislim, da je verjetno.
We always had a great time.	Vedno smo se imeli zelo dobro.
It does so much.	To počne tako veliko.
This is a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
I've known for years.	Vem že leta.
Not much, but enough.	Ne veliko, a dovolj.
I couldn't do anything.	Ničesar nisem mogel narediti.
I didn't know he died until today.	Do danes nisem vedel, da je umrl.
He said ok tell me what you know.	Rekel je v redu, povej mi, kar veš.
And that's something.	In to je nekaj.
I had to believe.	Moral sem verjeti.
He didn't know why, but he did.	Ni vedel, zakaj, a je.
I've never seen him do that before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl, da bi to naredil.
Like you.	Tako kot ti.
You should just do it.	To bi morali storiti samo.
I like everything in place.	Všeč mi je vse na mestu.
I'm not so sure it will.	Nisem tako prepričan, da bo.
It's for everyone.	Za vse je.
I forgot so much.	Toliko sem pozabil.
I stayed there last night.	Sinoči sem ostal tam.
We don't have to.	Ni nam treba.
Today they are gone.	Danes jih ni več.
They may not see us, but we are there.	Morda nas ne bodo videli, a smo tam.
It can be a.	Lahko je a.
I have nothing.	Jaz nimam ničesar.
You can't stay.	Ne moreš ostati.
He knew too.	Tudi on je vedel.
How hard is that?.	Kako težko je to?.
I should have known then.	Takrat bi moral vedeti.
I never heard from him.	Nikoli nisem slišal od njega.
I could eat it all day.	Lahko bi ga jedel ves dan.
You should be home.	Moral bi biti doma.
Because that's not a problem.	Ker to ni problem.
That's something.	To je kaj .
How does he know so much.	Kako ve toliko.
I don't know if this is possible.	Ne vem, če je to mogoče.
There is nothing wrong with that.	S tem ni nič narobe.
I don't have to stay here.	Ni mi treba ostati tukaj.
Or maybe it is.	Ali pa morda je.
You'll just talk.	Samo govoril boš.
There is nothing here.	Tukaj ni ničesar.
He returned to school.	Vrnil se je v šolo.
Even one who never had much to say.	Tudi tisti, ki nikoli ni imel veliko povedati.
I'm not surprised about that.	Nisem presenečen glede tega.
Regardless, there is much more that can be done.	Ne glede na to je še veliko več, kar je mogoče storiti.
And so it really happened.	In tako se je res zgodilo.
You must go now.	Takoj moraš iti.
You shouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi smel storiti.
Doing it is something else.	Narediti to je nekaj drugega.
First, he may be right.	Prvič, lahko ima prav.
He didn't like that.	To mu ni bilo všeč.
Trust her.	Verjeti ji.
Now to that.	Zdaj pa k temu.
He did more.	Naredil je več.
I have nothing to do with it.	Jaz nimam nič s tem.
I did a little bit of everything.	Vsega sem naredil po malo.
There is so much of it.	Toliko tega je.
No one will see you.	Nihče vas ne bo videl.
He definitely has one now.	Zdaj ga zagotovo ima.
I'll be there for you, for you.	Tam bom zate, zaradi tebe.
You don't need to know what it is.	Ni vam treba vedeti, kaj je to.
I needed it.	Potreboval sem ga.
You think so.	Misliš, da da.
How are you.	Kako ste.
This is forever.	To je za vedno.
No one said it, but he was sure of it.	Nihče tega ni rekel, vendar je bil prepričan o tem.
You don't have to do much about it.	Ni vam treba veliko delati glede tega.
But it wasn't all a game.	Vendar ni bilo vse igra.
He's really good at almost everything.	Res je dober v skoraj vsem.
After that none of us could go to the party.	Po tem nihče od nas ni mogel iti na zabavo.
And just as well.	In prav tako dobro.
So and why.	Tako in zakaj.
We're almost home.	Skoraj smo doma.
We don't know that.	Tega ne vemo.
Everything seems to be there.	Videti je, da je vse tam.
But we have to go.	Vendar moramo oditi.
No one else was here.	Nikogar drugega ni bilo tukaj.
I almost did.	Skoraj sem.
And you know, it wasn't even that.	In veste, niti ni bilo to.
Not tonight, maybe never.	Ne nocoj, morda nikoli.
It was a while back.	Bilo je nekaj časa nazaj.
I don't actually do that much anymore.	Pravzaprav tega ne počnem več veliko.
We like things the way they are.	Všeč nam je tako, kot so stvari.
I wasn't there.	Nisem bil tam.
Everyone had to go.	Vsak je moral iti.
I probably should have known better.	Verjetno bi moral vedeti bolje.
Or he thought he was.	Ali pa je mislil, da je.
No one could be better.	Nihče ne bi mogel biti boljši.
We all have a lot of work to do now.	Zdaj imamo vsi veliko dela.
He didn't want to be there.	Ni hotel biti tam.
He just wanted out.	Hotel je samo ven.
They both were.	Oba sta bila.
He must have seen something.	Verjetno je nekaj videl.
I want to be there.	Želim si biti tam.
I don't really believe it myself, but maybe it's true.	Sam ne verjamem preveč, a morda je res.
Something was back.	Nekaj ​​je bilo nazaj.
That's pretty much it.	To je skoraj vse.
I met quite a few.	Srečal pa kar nekaj.
Now it's just me and him.	Zdaj sva samo jaz in on.
I know it will.	Vem, da bo.
They won't do it for me.	Tega ne bodo storili namesto mene.
It will never happen.	Nikoli se ne bo zgodilo.
I haven't seen her since.	Od takrat je nisem več videl.
I have no doubt about that.	O tem ne dvomim.
He was my boyfriend.	Bil je moj fant.
I want you to know this.	Želim, da to veš.
You should know that.	To bi moral vedeti.
He sat down again.	Spet je sedel.
He wasn't much better himself, and he knew it.	Tudi sam ni bil veliko boljši in to je vedel.
I think that's something.	Mislim, da je to nekaj.
It was quite a job.	To je bilo kar delo.
Maybe it was that good.	Morda je bilo tako dobro.
But he did nothing.	Vendar ni naredil ničesar.
I think you're spot on.	Mislim, da si na mestu.
I told you why not.	Povedal sem ti, zakaj ne.
He had a reason to be there.	Imel je razlog, da je bil tam.
I hope you like it.	Upam, da vam je všeč.
And you know, it probably was.	In veš, verjetno je bilo.
But now they never will.	Zdaj pa nikoli ne bodo.
Sometimes I think no one can.	Včasih mislim, da nihče ne more.
But now there was no one at all.	Zdaj pa sploh ni bilo nikogar.
And that's that.	In to je to.
It's so good to see you.	Tako lepo te je videti.
It's obvious.	Očitno je.
Not to them.	Njim ne.
No really, no.	Ne res, ne.
We did a good thing here.	Tukaj smo naredili dobro stvar.
Something just didn't feel right.	Samo nekaj se mi ni zdelo v redu.
He already knows me.	On me že pozna.
There is a way.	Obstaja način.
I know you want children.	Vem, da si želiš otroke.
He had never heard of it.	Nikoli tega ni slišal.
But she knew.	Vendar je vedela.
But he didn't have to do that.	Vendar mu tega ni bilo treba storiti.
You really should do that.	To bi res morali storiti.
Actually the only one.	Pravzaprav edina.
You failed.	Ni vam uspelo.
We have everything!.	Imamo vse!.
Busy, you know.	Zaposlen, saj veš.
You probably haven't seen it.	Verjetno ga še niste videli.
That's the problem with him.	To je problem z njim.
It wasn't very nice.	Ni bilo preveč lepo.
He was angry with him.	Bil je jezen do njega.
I'm moving on.	Grem naprej.
This is a real father.	To je pravi oče.
It has to be done.	To je treba narediti.
Sometimes he was angry about it.	Včasih je bil zaradi tega jezen.
We're fine there.	Tam smo v redu.
As I would expect him to come back.	Kot bi pričakoval, da se bo vrnil.
I know very well.	Zelo dobro vem.
And it was very, very difficult.	In bilo je zelo, zelo težko.
I heard him too.	Tudi njega sem slišal.
Was that .	Je bilo to .
This is something that will not happen again.	To je nekaj, kar se ne bo več zgodilo.
I'll get it.	Dobil ga bom.
He died.	Umrl je.
You won't find me here anymore.	Tukaj me ne boš več našel.
Nobody died.	Nihče ni umrl.
I would like to.	rad bi.
It's happened before.	Zgodilo se je že prej.
Here's what to do instead.	Tukaj je, kaj storiti namesto tega.
It was early in the morning.	Bilo je zgodaj zjutraj.
The problem still exists.	Problem še vedno obstaja.
I heard about it.	Slišal sem o tem.
I did not find.	Nisem našel.
However, this is not always the case.	Vendar ni vedno tako.
I really don't like it myself.	Sam tega res ne maram.
How it's still happening.	Kako se še vedno dogaja.
They always have been and always will be.	Vedno so bili in vedno bodo.
He must come to us.	Mora priti k nam.
If only we knew, if only we knew.	Ko bi le vedeli, ko bi le vedeli.
I will buy more.	Kupil bom več.
I didn't before.	Prej nisem.
There was not a lot of money.	Denarja ni bilo malo.
He had to know what happened.	Moral je vedeti, kaj se je zgodilo.
You're not very tired at all.	Sploh nisi zelo utrujen.
Sometimes for a long time.	Včasih dolgo časa.
And it just doesn't work.	In preprosto ne gre.
He was thinking of little else.	Mislil je na malo drugega.
He just hasn't gotten around to it yet.	Samo še ni prišel do tega.
I work alone.	Dela sam.
We have to be here.	Tukaj moramo biti.
Would you .	Ali bi .
Nothing before.	Ničesar prej.
More and more these days.	Te dni vse več.
And that was all.	In to je bilo vse.
I haven't seen that before.	Tega še nisem videl.
I'd love to hear how you're doing.	Rad bi slišal, kako je s tabo.
I'm ready to move on.	Pripravljen sem iti naprej.
All good.	Vse v dobro.
And she won't like it one bit.	In niti malo ji ne bo všeč.
But it was hard to do.	Vendar je bilo težko narediti.
It's a thing.	Je stvar.
There was very little time.	Časa je bilo zelo malo.
And he wasn't the only one.	In ni bil edini.
But that really happened this week.	A to se je res zgodilo ta teden.
Not that she needed to.	Saj ne, da ji je bilo treba.
I don't care anymore.	Ne zanima me več.
And maybe we had.	In morda smo imeli.
If you're good, you're good.	Če si dober, si dober.
I'm fine that way.	Dobro mi je tako.
He didn't tell her what it was.	Ni ji povedal, kaj je to.
Sometimes it just doesn't work out.	Včasih preprosto ne gre.
She knew what she had to do next.	Vedela je, kaj mora storiti naprej.
He will have to go.	Moral bo iti.
You surely will.	Zagotovo boš.
I thought you would know about it.	Mislil sem, da bi vedel za to.
All the best.	Vse dobro.
I've never done that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem naredil.
That will never happen.	To se ne bo nikoli zgodilo.
When she goes to work alone, for someone else.	Ko gre sama v službo, za drugega.
I'd like to think that's true.	Rad bi mislil, da je to res.
He didn't actually do anything.	Pravzaprav ni naredil ničesar.
I think that's fine.	Mislim, da je to v redu.
It's money again.	Spet je denar.
Because you could see.	Ker si lahko videl.
So what, he thought.	Pa kaj, si je mislil.
She was what she was.	Bila je, kar je bila.
Yes, it's hard work.	Da, to je težko delo.
Only he could not leave.	Samo on ni mogel oditi.
I hope he likes them.	Upam, da mu bodo všeč.
It used to be work.	Včasih je bilo to delo.
I mean well.	Mislim dobro.
They will know what to do with it.	Vedeli bodo, kaj storiti s tem.
I mean, me.	Mislim, meni.
But this will not always be the case.	A temu ne bo vedno tako.
it's not you.	to nisi ti.
What more could you want.	Kaj več si lahko želiš.
She didn't have to.	Ni ji bilo treba.
He didn't feel right when he wasn't home.	Ko ga ni bilo doma, se ni počutil prav.
I didn't know it would be you.	Nisem vedel, da boš to ti.
She didn't like this one.	Ta ji ni bila všeč.
I did a pretty good job.	Delo sem opravil kar dobro.
Perhaps that was the case here.	Morda je bilo tukaj tako.
He actually said so.	Pravzaprav je tako rekel.
And it probably is.	In verjetno je.
She is completely alone.	Popolnoma je sama.
So I did and I would do it again.	Tako sem naredil in bi še enkrat.
You won't regret it.	Ne bo vam žal.
Now the time has come.	Zdaj je prišel čas.
.	.
But that didn't happen either.	A tudi to se ni zgodilo.
But it wasn't like that.	Vendar ni bilo tako.
No matter what, it was going to happen.	Ne glede na vse, to bi se zgodilo.
I was here for the first time.	Tukaj sem bil prvič.
Even when he was a child.	Tudi ko je bil otrok.
That didn't happen either.	Tudi tega ni bilo.
And my father.	In moj oče.
He's not serious.	Ne misli resno.
I heard him speak too.	Slišal sem ga tudi govoriti.
I doubt it really.	Dvomim, da res.
Or very little.	Ali zelo malo.
He didn't see anyone.	Nikogar ni videl.
I made a decision myself.	Tudi sam sem se odločil.
Maybe you weren't.	Mogoče nisi bil.
For so much.	Za toliko.
You're almost never here and it just can't go on.	Skoraj nikoli si tukaj in preprosto ne more iti naprej.
No, there's no time for any of that.	Ne, ni časa za nič od tega.
That's all we got.	To je vse, kar imamo.
I wish you well in this.	V tem ti želim vse dobro.
Play together.	Igrati skupaj.
To see.	Videti .
And that was very nice.	In to je bilo zelo lepo.
I just got it.	Samo dobil sem ga.
And now it will happen.	In zdaj se bo zgodilo.
No, it doesn't help much at all.	Ne, sploh ne pomaga veliko.
Obviously you don't want that.	Očitno tega ne želite.
i will	bom.
That you knew.	Da si vedel.
I mean, we can't go now.	Mislim, zdaj ne moremo iti.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim, da je to dobra stvar.
Or no one at all.	Ali pa sploh nihče.
.	.
I know there is more.	Vem, da je še več.
There was no knowing.	Ni bilo vedeti.
On me.	Na mene.
He always needed you.	Vedno te je potreboval.
We would be together even more.	Še več bi bili skupaj.
Either he likes you or he doesn't.	Ali mu boš všeč ali pa ne.
We don't need to talk about it.	Ni nam treba govoriti o tem.
It's just so much better.	Preprosto je veliko bolje.
It wasn't better.	Ni bilo bolje.
You'd think they'd already know that.	Človek bi mislil, da so to že vedeli.
I'm having such a good time.	Tako lepo se imam.
Now tell everyone about it.	Zdaj pa vsem povej o tem.
Someone loved you.	Nekdo te je imel rad.
And this is the reason why.	In to je razlog zakaj.
Nobody wanted to know anything.	Nihče ni hotel ničesar vedeti.
We all know that now.	To zdaj vsi vemo.
And it was enough.	In bilo je dovolj.
To stay or not to stay.	Ostati ali ne ostati.
Must be.	Mora biti.
You are too alone here.	Tukaj si preveč sam.
I knew that very well.	To sem dobro vedel.
He definitely needed it.	Zagotovo ga je potreboval.
But it wasn't enough.	Vendar ni bilo dovolj.
Fortunately, you never have to.	Na srečo vam nikoli ni treba.
We can't help it.	Ne moremo si pomagati.
I had it with him.	Imel sem to z njim.
This does not appear to be the case.	Zdi se, da temu ni tako.
I have to go.	Moram iti.
He knows it too.	Tudi on to ve.
And that's that.	In to je to.
I thought that was a good thing.	Mislil sem, da je to dobra stvar.
If you really want to know.	Če res želite vedeti.
What you saw was just that.	Kar si videl, je bilo prav to.
There is so much more to say.	Toliko več je za povedati.
But it was okay.	Vendar je bilo v redu.
Your car or mine.	Tvoj avto ali moj.
Not so fast .	Ne tako hitro .
No one can do it for him.	Nihče tega ne more narediti namesto njega.
That's what you came here for.	Za to si prišel sem.
No one said much.	Nihče ni veliko govoril.
Maybe someday you'll tell me all about it.	Mogoče mi boš kdaj povedal vse o tem.
And you didn't tell me.	In nisi mi povedal.
Maybe I don't even want to know.	Tega morda niti nočem vedeti.
He left them there.	Pustil jih je tam.
And never again.	In nikoli nič več.
I forgot something.	Pozabil sem kaj.
She needed to talk to him.	Morala je govoriti z njim.
That's someone else's problem.	To je problem nekoga drugega.
Some money maybe.	Nekaj ​​denarja morda.
I hope it wasn't too bad.	Upam, da ni bilo zelo narobe.
I hope it will be of help to you.	Upam, da vam bo v pomoč.
A better man, how about this.	Boljši človek, kaj pa to.
It will be better.	Bolje bo.
He wasn't surprised.	Ni bil presenečen.
And the hotel too.	In tudi hotel.
Not what you thought.	Ne tisto, kar si mislil.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikomur ni povedal.
As soon as he wanted something, he got it.	Takoj ko je nekaj hotel, je to tudi dobil.
No one ever forgot.	Nihče ni nikoli pozabil.
He never found the time.	Nikoli ni našel časa.
Do something with it.	Naredi nekaj s tem.
You shouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi smel storiti.
It never really is.	Res nikoli ni.
You never know when you might need it.	Nikoli ne veš, kdaj ga boš morda potreboval.
You might be fine.	Morda vam bo vse v redu.
I'm not feeling well.	Ne počutim se dobro.
We don't know why not.	Ne vemo, zakaj ne.
I'm asking you.	Sprašujem te.
He thought it had to be.	Mislil je, da mora biti.
Or maybe it was more than that.	Ali pa je bilo morda več kot to.
It won't be difficult.	Ne bo težko.
She was still there.	Še vedno je bila tam.
I should have done this earlier.	To bi moral narediti prej.
She was alone and no one knew where she was.	Bila je sama in nihče ni vedel, kje je.
You can know without even knowing.	Lahko veš, ne da bi sploh vedel.
I had a life here.	Tukaj sem imel življenje.
She would be mine.	Bila bi moja.
You will win.	Ti boš zmagal.
Nothing more happened.	Nič več se ni zgodilo.
I wouldn't expect it right away.	Ne bi pričakoval takoj.
It is much more than that.	Je precej več kot to.
I'm not there yet.	Nisem še tam.
I wish I could see.	Želim si, da bi videl.
The opportunity is here.	Priložnost je tukaj.
I don't think you ever will.	Mislim, da ne boš nikoli.
No one seems to know why.	Zdi se, da nihče ne ve zakaj.
He heard them.	Slišal jih je.
He didn't want to tell me.	Ni mi hotel povedati.
He didn't have a hotel.	Hotel ni imel.
He doesn't want you.	Noče te.
You saw it.	Videli ste.
It still is, considering.	Še vedno je, glede na to.
We didn't do that.	Tega nismo storili.
He said once.	Enkrat je rekel.
Any time will be fine with me.	Vsak čas mi bo prav.
Not just a man.	Ne le človek.
I shouldn't even be here.	Sploh ne bi smel biti tukaj.
He's obviously playing well.	Očitno igra dobro.
Too much for me.	Preveč zame.
That's all there is.	To je vse, kar obstaja.
It's a yes or no question.	To je vprašanje da ali ne.
He wasn't sure yet.	Ni še bil prepričan.
i see you	vidim te.
This is not help.	To ni pomoč.
There is something else behind it.	Za tem je nekaj drugega.
I don't think it would be very nice.	Mislim, da ne bi bilo zelo lepo.
Not in more.	Ne v več.
I hope it can come quickly.	Upam, da lahko hitro pride.
That's what he does.	To počne.
I will be very happy to see you.	Zelo bom vesel, da te vidim.
He did what he could.	Naredil je, kar je lahko.
I don't like doing anything.	Ne maram delati ničesar.
There was too much else.	Bilo je preveč drugega.
I'm doing better.	Bolje mi gre.
He came right away.	Takoj je prišel.
I will tell you more in a moment.	Nekaj ​​časa vam bom povedal več.
I think he's good.	Mislim, da je dober.
And it helps me.	In meni pomaga.
It seemed right to me too.	Tudi zdelo se mi je prav.
It's not wrong.	Ni narobe.
Maybe he knows something.	Mogoče ve kaj.
I was sure of that.	Prepričan sem bil o tem.
It actually helps.	Pravzaprav pomaga.
It will probably never happen.	Verjetno se ne bo nikoli zgodilo.
You are always there.	Vedno si tam.
No one has ever seen me do that.	Nihče me še nikoli ni videl, da bi to naredil.
I didn't like that.	To mi ni bilo všeč.
I never asked for your life.	Nikoli te nisem prosil za življenje.
He wanted to.	Hotel je .
Even then.	Tudi takrat.
Here is!.	Tukaj je!.
But there are very few of them.	Vendar jih je zelo malo.
There's really nothing else to do.	Nič drugega se res ne da narediti.
Just no, that's all.	Samo ne, to je vse.
It's not that simple.	Ni tako preprosto.
And that's totally fine.	In to je popolnoma v redu.
I didn't want to be here like that.	Tako nisem hotel biti tukaj.
This is never good.	To ni nikoli dobro.
He went on.	Odšel je naprej.
I never asked.	Nikoli nisem vprašal.
I forgot everything.	Na vse sem pozabil.
I didn't see you.	Nisem te videl.
I will learn a little more.	Naučil se bom še malo več.
That was all fine.	Vse to je bilo v redu.
You just told me.	Pravkar si mi povedal.
However, he couldn't say much.	Vendar pa ni mogel veliko povedati.
You've seen what he does.	Videli ste, kaj počne.
Just a little bit more.	Samo še malo.
Or maybe not.	Lahko pa tudi ne.
We know everything, and yet we know nothing.	Vemo vse, pa vendar ne vemo ničesar.
This is clearly not the case here.	Tukaj očitno ni tako.
I didn't hear anyone.	Nikogar nisem slišal.
I don't want him to know.	Nočem, da ve.
They were ahead.	Naprej so bili.
And no, you weren't.	In ne, nisi bil.
I put the book back.	Knjigo sem dal nazaj.
We would be at it for a long time.	Pri tem bi bili še dolgo časa.
I didn't tell him anything else.	Nič drugega mu nisem rekel.
I need to know why you're here.	Vedeti moram, zakaj si tukaj.
It's hard enough for her.	Dovolj ji je težko s tem.
There seemed to be nothing here.	Videti je bilo, da tukaj ni ničesar.
Just for me.	Samo zame.
I knew and saw nothing wrong.	Vedel sem in nisem videl nič narobe.
We have enough money.	Imamo dovolj denarja.
I don't do that.	Jaz tega ne počnem.
I.e .	Se pravi .
I haven't had anything to eat since.	Od takrat nisem imel nič jesti.
That won't be a problem.	To ne bo problem.
We still have enough money.	Še vedno imamo dovolj denarja.
I have it from here.	Imam ga od tukaj.
Everyone has their job.	Vsak ima svoje delo.
We knew where we were.	Vedeli smo, kje smo.
It's not going as well as yesterday.	Ne gre tako dobro kot včeraj.
Baby, no.	Otrok, ne.
Or something was.	Ali pa je nekaj bilo.
Anyone could do it.	Lahko bi kdo to naredil.
That seems like a lot.	To se zdi veliko.
It's hard to get into these things.	Težko je priti v te stvari.
Okay, okay.	V redu, v redu.
I thought I'd tell him.	Mislil sem, da bi mu povedal.
Maybe because something like this has never happened before.	Morda zato, ker se kaj takega še ni zgodilo.
That's what he did.	To je naredil.
We've done it all.	Vse to smo naredili.
I met him here.	Tukaj sem ga srečal.
It sure was.	Zagotovo je bilo.
He never wanted anything like this to happen.	Nikoli si ni želel, da bi se kaj takega zgodilo.
You can't because it doesn't exist.	Ne moreš, ker ne obstaja.
Very much.	Tako zelo.
He was still tired.	Še vedno je bil utrujen.
It's just not me.	Samo nisem jaz.
So we'll all be there together.	Tako bomo vsi skupaj tam.
Here's my problem with this.	Tukaj je moj problem s tem.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
It doesn't do anything.	Nič ne dela.
I have them all.	Vse jih imam.
And she knew it was true.	In vedela je, da je res.
I think you will be happy.	Mislim, da boš vesel.
My life is not mine.	Moje življenje ni moje.
That was all he said.	To je bilo vse, kar je rekel.
This is true and it is not true.	To je res in ni res.
I know why you thought you were.	Vem, zakaj si mislil, da si.
It doesn't have.	Nima .
Maybe there wasn't much to say.	Morda ni bilo veliko za povedati.
Just .	Samo .
That seems likely.	To se zdi verjetno.
Now here we are again.	Zdaj pa smo spet tukaj.
There are many things.	Veliko stvari je.
He's fine now, thankfully.	Zdaj je v redu, na srečo.
There was nothing more to do.	Nič več ni bilo za narediti.
I have something to tell you.	Nekaj ​​ti moram povedati.
He was sorry for everything.	Vse mu je bilo žal.
A lot of it felt that way to me.	Veliko tega se mi je zdelo tako.
It didn't happen.	Ni se zgodilo.
She had to know.	Morala je vedeti.
You tell him where.	Ti mu povej kje.
It was likely.	Bilo je verjetno.
You might like it.	Morda vam bo všeč.
We got you back.	Imamo te nazaj.
Or her own, but she had to do it.	Ali svoje, a to je morala storiti.
I want to be a good boy.	Želim biti dober fant.
Good for me.	Dobro zame.
I've heard enough.	dovolj sem slišal.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
He does it all.	Vse to počne.
However, this has never been the case.	Vendar temu še nikoli ni bilo tako.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Glede tega ni mogel storiti ničesar.
It's not enough.	Ni dovolj.
But he was not the only one.	A ni bil edini.
Dad has his own life.	Oče ima svoje življenje.
We are not the problem.	Mi nismo problem.
That will be tomorrow.	To bo jutri.
Nobody asked him.	Nihče ga ni vprašal.
Much more than any of us can know.	Veliko več, kot lahko kdo od nas ve.
It's a game.	To je igra.
Why? 	Zakaj?
It could be you.	To bi lahko bil ti.
You will come with us.	Šla boš z nami.
It was a simple question.	Bilo je preprosto vprašanje.
Okay, maybe not so much.	V redu, morda ne toliko.
I wouldn't know how to do it.	Ne bi vedel, kako to narediti.
It's not like that.	Ni tako.
And he says, sure.	In pravi, zagotovo.
I've seen it all before.	Vse to sem že videl.
Who never had them, never would.	Ki jih nikoli ni imel, nikoli ne bi.
A lot of people don't.	Veliko ljudi ne.
I've never seen so many people.	Še nikoli nisem videl toliko ljudi.
What was the job.	Kaj je bilo delo.
Talk to him.	Govori z njim.
He felt better after that.	Po tem se je počutil bolje.
I was glad he was there.	Bil sem vesel, da je tam.
.	.
Except they don't care.	Le da jih ne zanima.
There are more of them.	Več jih je.
It's not much, but it's more than it used to be.	Ni veliko, je pa več kot je bilo.
I didn't want to know anymore.	Nisem hotel vedeti več.
The boy got lost.	Fant se je izgubil.
I better not tell anyone.	Bolje, da ne bi povedal nikomur.
I'd rather talk about it now.	Raje bi govoril o tem zdaj.
It's not the first time it's happened.	Ni se zgodilo prvič.
I felt at home.	Počutil sem se kot doma.
It's a lot.	Veliko je.
Mary was right behind him.	Mary je bila takoj za njim.
I've always wanted you.	Vedno sem si te želel.
They are here.	Tukaj so.
We can't do that.	Ne moremo narediti tega.
And sometimes he knew it would.	In včasih je vedel, da bo.
It's a really good thing.	Res je dobra stvar.
He did a lot.	Veliko je naredil.
It's already him.	To je že on.
He spoke really fast.	Res je hitro govoril.
All sooner than usual.	Vse prej kot običajno.
There was a lot of that.	Tega je bilo veliko.
I'm never going there again.	Nikoli več ne grem tja.
I came up with this.	Prišel sem do tega.
And you have to too.	In tudi ti moraš.
I didn't help here.	Tukaj nisem pomagal.
Like .	Kot .
That's really something.	To je res nekaj.
I said no.	Rekel sem ne.
I'm sorry.	Žal mi je.
Just like your father.	Tako kot tvoj oče.
We didn't do that, man.	Tega nismo storili, človek.
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
I know him a little.	malo ga poznam.
So big, so good.	Tako veliko, tako dobro.
It wasn't easy, but he succeeded.	Ni bilo lahko, a uspelo mu je.
That was likely enough.	To je bilo dovolj verjetno.
That's why they won't do it.	Zato tega ne bodo storili.
I can't eat them.	Ne morem jih jesti.
Some thoughts.	Nekaj ​​misli.
Do something else.	Naredi nekaj drugega.
But never.	Nikoli pa ne.
Maybe a book.	Mogoče knjigo.
I've been there a long time.	Dolgo sem tam.
And there it is.	In tam je.
This is your time.	To je tvoj čas.
I really didn't know what to make of it.	Res nisem vedel, kaj naj s tem.
They would know who they are.	Vedeli bi, kdo so.
Everything was like that.	Vse je bilo tako.
Maybe we should.	Mogoče bi morali.
She almost said something else.	Skoraj je rekla nekaj drugega.
It might not be.	Morda ne bi bilo.
He had somewhere to go.	Imel je kam iti.
I just arrived.	Pravkar sem prišel.
He also saw right now with his, perhaps.	Tudi on je zdaj prav videl s svojo, morda.
I think he means it.	Mislim, da to misli.
He should have known better than that.	Moral je vedeti bolje od tega.
I don't like them at all.	Sploh jih ne maram.
That's not okay.	To ni v redu.
They didn't have it before.	Prej ga niso imeli.
I'll leave that for now.	To bom za zdaj pustil.
He needed us.	Potreboval nas je.
I talked to him, right.	Govoril sem z njim, prav.
Everyone has their own thoughts.	Vsak ima svoje misli.
I loved everything.	Vse sem imel rad.
You didn't feel so well this morning.	Zjutraj se ti ni zdelo tako dobro.
It was the first time for me.	Zame je bilo prvič.
And he wasn't alone.	In ni bil sam.
And again, and again, and again.	In še, in še, in še.
I called her right away.	Takoj sem jo poklical.
He wondered what he was supposed to see.	Vprašal se je, kaj bi sploh moral videti.
You can't leave home without it.	Brez tega ne moreš od doma.
I don't think he's a good person.	Mislim, da ni dobra oseba.
You will learn.	Naučil se boš.
What I know, no one can know.	Kar vem, nihče ne more vedeti.
Nothing or nobody.	Nič ali nihče.
He was not very well at the time.	Takrat mu ni bilo prav dobro.
Does anyone know if there is a way to do this.	Ali kdo ve, če obstaja način za to.
He needs luck.	Potrebuje srečo.
He did everything to give himself a chance.	Naredil je vse, da bi si dal priložnost.
It just keeps going.	Samo gre naprej.
I have my own children.	Imam svoje otroke.
You will too.	Tudi ti boš.
Please, please, please.	Prosim, prosim, prosim.
I needed this car.	Potreboval sem ta avto.
He came home.	Prišel je domov.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar temu ni tako.
My life was good.	Moje življenje je bilo dobro.
My job, you know.	Moje delo, veš.
She was good at it when she had to be.	Bila je dobra v tem, ko je bilo treba.
They did as he said.	Storili so, kot je rekel.
I sure regret that.	Zagotovo mi je žal za to.
We had that yesterday.	To smo imeli včeraj.
I didn't want to be.	Nisem hotel biti.
Something must be working right.	Nekaj ​​mora delati prav.
Not even in front of us.	Sploh ne pred nami.
Life as it could be.	Življenje, kot bi lahko bilo.
It must have been hard to get out, too.	Verjetno je bilo tudi težko priti ven.
You couldn't see much.	Nisi mogel videti veliko.
I haven't told you everything.	Nisem vam povedal vsega.
It was very, very wrong.	Bilo je zelo, zelo narobe.
Maybe she has kids.	Mogoče ima otroke.
He has plenty of time until then.	Do takrat ima dovolj časa.
I'd like to see more.	Rad bi videl več.
Here, above us.	Tukaj, nad nami.
Really, it's nice.	Res, lepo je.
Or quite a bit.	Ali kar malo.
I didn't see it happen.	Nisem videl, da se je zgodilo.
I won't be here tonight.	Nocoj me ne bo več.
I'm not interested.	Me ne zanima.
I wanted to tell you myself.	Sam sem ti hotel povedati.
This has to be it.	To mora biti to.
I hope not tonight.	Upam, da ne nocoj.
But they're not sure yet.	Vendar še niso prepričani.
But so far it hasn't.	Vendar do zdaj še ni.
I feel like we should be together.	Zdi se mi, kot bi morala biti skupaj.
Do what? 	Narediti kaj?
And if you didn't.	In če ne bi.
I know almost as little about it as you do.	O tem vem skoraj tako malo kot ti.
He really tried to help.	Res je poskušal pomagati.
I will tell.	Povedal bom.
And life here is pretty good.	In življenje tukaj je kar dobro.
I feel okay about that.	Glede tega se počutim v redu.
There is nothing to do.	Ničesar ni za narediti.
We have three.	Imamo tri.
He had to leave.	Moral je oditi.
It's about people, life and life.	Gre za ljudi, življenje in življenje.
I really don't want to be alone right now.	Trenutno res nočem biti sam.
And not just you.	In ne samo ti.
You will see them both.	Videli jih boste oba.
He won't win.	Ne bo zmagal.
They're not there just for the sake of it.	Niso tam samo zaradi tega.
I probably should.	Verjetno bi moral.
I think very likely.	Mislim, da zelo verjetno.
I got so much from him.	Toliko sem dobil od njega.
That's what I'm wondering.	To se sprašujem.
And it's not always simple.	In ni vedno preprosto.
I got my money.	Dobil sem svoj denar.
I should have known better.	Moral bi vedeti bolje.
Apparently he's right.	Očitno ima prav.
I'll tell you why.	Povedal ti bom zakaj.
That's how it happened.	Tako se je zgodilo.
For what you did tonight.	Za to, kar si naredil nocoj.
No one had to.	Nikomur ni bilo treba.
That's life.	Tako je življenje.
It could be several things.	Lahko bi bilo več stvari.
And so it was.	In tako je bilo.
I'll tell you this.	To ti bom povedal.
It's not for everyone.	Ni za vse.
I didn't want to do anything.	Ničesar nisem hotel narediti.
That's really not long.	To res ni dolgo.
What will I do? 	Kaj bom naredil?
Why is that so???.	Zakaj je tako???.
That doesn't seem like much.	To se ne zdi veliko.
I am very sorry .	Zelo mi je žal .
She was fine.	Bila je v redu.
I hope you are well.	Upam, da si dobro.
And she wasn't alone.	In ni bila sama.
He played and he didn't play.	Igral je in ni igral.
I'm not about that.	Nisem o tem.
It was pretty good before.	Prej je bilo kar dobro.
I am that.	Jaz sem to.
I just want to see you.	Samo rad bi te videl.
She just wasn't much.	Samo ni bila veliko.
I hope you know what that is.	Upam, da veš kaj je to.
I'll tell you why.	Povedal ti bom zakaj.
He knew you would come back.	Vedel je, da se boš vrnil.
Nothing happened for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa se ni zgodilo nič.
I just don't see it.	Samo ne vidim tega.
I do not have time.	Nimam časa.
I can't reach him.	Ne morem do njega.
I just didn't think it would be so soon.	Samo nisem si mislil, da bo tako kmalu.
All for more money.	Vse tudi za več denarja.
She knew they weren't.	Vedela je, da niso.
That would be hard to do.	To bi bilo težko narediti.
I wanted to play more.	Želel sem igrati več.
He must have known for quite some time.	Moral je vedeti že kar nekaj časa.
Something like this has happened to all of us.	Vsem se nam je že zgodilo kaj takega.
He was willing to do that today.	To je bil pripravljen storiti danes.
I believe it is.	Verjamem, da je.
And you know, you might be right.	In veš, morda imaš prav.
But it will be a while.	Bo pa še nekaj časa.
I'm just me.	Jaz sem samo jaz.
I've always had trouble with that.	S tem sem imel vedno težave.
I hope you get it.	Upam, da boš to dobil.
I wish I was there to see it.	Rad bi bil tam, da bi to videl.
You should stay there.	Moral bi ostati tam.
But it wasn't easy.	Vendar ni bilo lahko.
A lot of work.	Veliko dela.
I'm a guy like you.	Jaz sem fant kot ti.
But there was still time.	Vendar je bil še čas.
He only had three.	Imel je samo tri.
It makes us no better than we were before.	Zaradi tega nismo nič boljši, kot smo bili prej.
I was a child.	Bil sem otrok.
If he ever called.	Če je kdaj poklical.
This is very difficult to do alone.	To je zelo težko narediti sam.
Not like us at all.	Sploh ne tako kot mi.
He couldn't stay here.	Ni mogel ostati tukaj.
I waited quite some time.	Čakal sem kar nekaj časa.
We will have to do that.	To bomo morali storiti.
But he thought he knew.	Vendar je mislil, da ve.
That's all we know for sure.	To je vse, kar zagotovo vemo.
That doesn't seem right.	To se ne zdi prav.
That's a really long time ago.	To je res dolgo nazaj.
I know what happened, happened.	Vem, kar se je zgodilo, se je.
None of this seems possible.	Nič od tega se ne zdi mogoče.
You'll give me that.	To mi boš dal.
The man before him had none.	Človek pred njim ni imel.
Here you will have the opportunity to be helpful.	Tukaj boste imeli priložnost biti v pomoč.
Do what you're going to do.	Naredi, kar boš naredil.
You don't have to do anything.	Ničesar ti ni treba narediti.
It's time to work.	Čas je za delo.
You liked her.	Všeč ti je bila.
Not that she didn't know.	Saj ne, da ne bi vedela.
I need help, dad.	Potrebujem pomoč, oče.
Just like always.	Tako kot vedno.
But we all know that's not the case.	A vsi vemo, da ni tako.
He was angry.	Bil je jezen.
Yes, all of them.	Da, vse skupaj.
Keep talking.	Kar naprej govori.
It just occurred to me.	Pravkar se mi je zdelo.
This is simply not true.	To preprosto ni res.
I've seen him play a lot.	Veliko sem ga videl igrati.
They are often all of these things.	Pogosto so vse te stvari.
But there was still some time.	Vendar je bilo še nekaj časa.
He might not make it.	Morda mu ne bo uspelo.
I mean, angry too.	Mislim, tudi jezen.
I won't say more than that.	Ne bom rekel več kot to.
Here's the problem.	Tukaj je problem.
That's why he was here, he told himself.	Zato je bil tukaj, si je rekel.
You can't leave now.	Zdaj ne moreš oditi.
I didn't actually see anything.	Pravzaprav nisem videl ničesar.
We were not alone in this.	V tem nismo bili sami.
I'm so glad you called.	Zelo sem vesel, da si poklical.
And a little happy.	In malo vesel.
I told some people.	Rekel sem nekaj ljudi.
It was like that a lot.	Bilo je veliko tako.
We have to work together.	Delati moramo skupaj.
Someone had to help.	Nekdo je moral pomagati.
Not only that.	Ne samo to.
I don't want to make too much of it.	Nočem preveč delati iz tega.
I don't have to tell you anything else.	Nič drugega ti ne moram povedati.
He was and she loved it.	Bil je in všeč ji je bilo.
But I won't.	Vendar ne bom.
I could lose my life now.	Zdaj bi lahko izgubil življenje.
What, who knows.	Kaj, kdo ve.
But that never happened.	Vendar se to nikoli ni zgodilo.
It's just me.	To sem samo jaz.
Even more.	Še bolj.
I asked why.	Vprašal sem zakaj.
They are, a lot.	So, veliko.
Now I was busy.	Zdaj sem bil zaposlen.
I want to believe that he can help her.	Želim verjeti, da ji lahko pomaga.
He didn't say anything to him.	Nič mu ni rekel.
And so it still is.	In tako je še vedno.
I'm not feeling well.	Ne počutim se dobro.
I was happy then.	Takrat sem bil vesel.
There aren't many of us.	Ni nas veliko.
He gave you back.	Te je dal nazaj.
But there is more.	Vendar je še več.
We would have children.	Imeli bi otroke.
I was there to eat.	Bil sem tam, da bi jedel.
But that didn't happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
He still has a few.	Nekaj ​​jih še ima.
We saw few people.	Videli smo malo ljudi.
Everyone will see.	Vsi bodo videli.
We've seen enough.	Dovolj smo videli.
No children yet.	Še brez otrok.
You should be good.	Moral bi biti dober.
But it doesn't work that way.	Vendar ne gre tako.
None of that.	Nič od tega.
He has a job.	Ima službo.
And it was possible.	In bilo je mogoče.
And yet here she was.	In vendar je bila tukaj.
Things she can't tell him.	Stvari, ki mu jih ne more povedati.
Do it again.	Naredi še enkrat.
I lost money.	Izgubil sem denar.
I just lost my job.	Pravkar sem izgubil službo.
I still think that's true.	Še vedno mislim, da je to res.
Why are you still here?	Zakaj si še vedno tukaj?
You won't lose me.	Ne boš me izgubil.
No one he knows has ever done that.	Nihče, ki ga pozna, tega ni nikoli naredil.
I was already convinced.	Bil sem že prepričan.
Now he knew for sure.	Zdaj je zagotovo vedel.
I can't tell you more.	Več ti ne morem povedati.
It was like that then and it is like that now.	Tako je bilo takrat in je tudi zdaj.
i will you	te bom.
That didn't happen now.	To se zdaj ni zgodilo.
I've been before.	Bil sem prej.
Okay, that's not true at all.	V redu, to sploh ni res.
He always knew what he meant.	Vedno je vedel, kaj misli.
Just like a boy.	Tako kot fant.
And it's okay.	In je v redu.
Very, very soon.	Zelo, zelo kmalu.
What, she didn't know.	Kaj, ni vedela.
I didn't want anything at all.	Prav nič si nisem želela.
However, this was not always the case.	Vendar pa ni bilo vedno tako.
My father loved him.	Moj oče ga je imel rad.
You don't have to talk about me.	Ni ti treba govoriti o meni.
That's how he felt.	Tako se je počutil.
I will definitely be back.	Zagotovo se bom vrnil.
He just waited.	Samo čakal je.
It is not as simple as it seems.	Ni tako preprosto, kot se zdi.
This can't be good.	To ne more biti dobro.
Fortunately, we were right.	Na srečo smo imeli prav.
Here's your problem.	Tukaj je tvoj problem.
There's something going on here.	Tukaj se nekaj dogaja.
But it didn't look like it.	Vendar ni bilo videti tako.
I wanted her to be mine.	Hotel sem, da je moja.
It just happened, that's all.	Samo zgodilo se je, to je vse.
One can hope, right?	Človek lahko upa, kajne?
I certainly wouldn't have thought that.	Tega si zagotovo ne bi mislil.
You know what you have to do.	Veš kaj moraš narediti.
You have done enough for now.	Za zdaj ste naredili dovolj.
If he did, he would almost certainly win.	Če bi to storil, bi skoraj zagotovo zmagal.
We have, we have.	Imamo, imamo.
You won't be able to.	Ne boš mogel.
I never thought anything would happen.	Nikoli si ne bi mislil, da se bo kaj zgodilo.
He was with him when he died.	Bil je z njim, ko je umrl.
Too much happened here.	Tukaj se je zgodilo preveč.
No one was to be seen.	Nikogar ni bilo videti.
I doubt it ever will.	Dvomim, da bo kdaj.
That was then, this is now.	To je bilo takrat, to zdaj.
But it's not what you think.	Vendar ni to, kar mislite.
But it didn't happen.	Vendar se ni.
I know it was good.	Vem, da je bilo dobro.
IM just .	Jaz sem samo .
She didn't know what she was thinking.	Ni vedela, kaj misli.
It was usually true.	Običajno je bilo res.
He is only what he seems.	On je samo to, kar se zdi.
We need to know what happened there.	Vedeti moramo, kaj se je tam zgodilo.
I was busy.	Bil sem zaposlen.
I think it would be.	Mislim, da bi bilo.
She doesn't have to.	Ni ji treba.
It was all so long ago.	Vse je bilo tako dolgo nazaj.
Maybe he thinks he can live with it.	Mogoče misli, da lahko živi s tem.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Lahko je naredil vse, kar je hotel.
Even if not all.	Pa tudi če ne vse.
It's not always right for everyone either.	Tudi ni vedno prav za vse.
That should be me.	To bi moral biti jaz.
I really like the hotel.	Hotel mi je zelo všeč.
no one would know.	ne kdo bi vedel.
Maybe I still would.	Mogoče bi še vedno.
That she should ever do that.	Da bi morala to kdaj narediti.
That way you can know what to do.	Tako lahko veste, kaj storiti.
If I had, I would have told her.	Če bi, bi ji povedal.
That was one time too many.	To je bilo enkrat preveč.
Maybe buy something.	Mogoče kaj kupiti.
But I learned a lot.	Vendar sem se veliko naučil.
And for me too.	In zame tudi.
I liked him immediately.	Takoj mi je bil všeč.
I don't know any more than that.	Ne vem nič več kot to.
You know he meant what he said.	Veste, da je resno mislil, kar je rekel.
Pretty good actually.	Pravzaprav kar dobro.
There is no if.	Ni če.
I got them.	Dobil sem jih.
I need someone here.	Potrebujem nekoga tukaj.
I still don't really understand how.	Še vedno res ne razumem, kako.
You didn't tell us you were coming.	Nisi nam povedal, da boš prišel.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Vendar se zdi, da temu ni tako.
Because it was me, just me.	Ker sem bil jaz, samo jaz.
It was really nice.	Bilo je res lepo.
Soon he won't need any of that anymore.	Kmalu ne bo več potreboval ničesar od tega.
It was then.	Takrat je bilo.
In fact, they still are.	Pravzaprav še vedno so.
I've never met him before.	Še nikoli ga nisem srečal.
You should have seen me earlier.	Moral bi me videti že prej.
Long enough for both of us.	Dovolj dolgo za oba.
Everyone had a good time.	Vsi so se imeli lepo.
She just didn't know.	Samo ni vedela.
There would be nothing.	Nič ne bi bilo.
Are you like .	Ali ste kot .
It could be him.	Lahko bi bil on.
The question is how much of that happened.	Vprašanje je, koliko se je tega zgodilo.
So we did.	Tako smo naredili.
That was fast.	To je bilo hitro.
John, that was me.	John, to sem bil jaz.
If for no other reason than that I have them.	Če ne zaradi drugega, pa zato, da jih imam.
That was all she said.	To je bilo vse, kar je rekla.
They are not here.	Ni jih tukaj.
He is simply good.	Preprosto je dober.
Nobody wants that to happen.	Nihče si ne želi, da bi se to zgodilo.
Apparently that didn't happen.	Očitno se to ni zgodilo.
We've never been here.	Nikoli nismo bili tukaj.
Where are you?.	Kje si?.
He knew we knew.	Vedel je, da vemo.
If it wasn't, it would be a problem.	Če ne bi bil, bi bil problem.
I don't care about anything else.	Nič drugega me ne zanima.
He more than did his part.	Več kot je naredil svoje.
Maybe that was the problem.	Morda je bil to problem.
They had too much.	Imeli so preveč.
Never never will.	Nikoli nikoli ne bo.
It's like he doesn't even know me.	Kot da me sploh ne pozna.
She's not good.	Ni dobra.
It doesn't do anything else at all.	Sploh ne počne ničesar drugega.
I'm sure he's right.	Prepričan sem, da ima prav.
You have to be like that.	Moraš biti tako.
You were there.	Bil si tam.
Make it look good.	Naj bo videti dobro.
I didn't do it that way.	Nisem naredil tako.
We were into it.	Bili smo v to.
You are absolutely right.	Imaš popolnoma prav.
No one can help anyone.	Nihče nikomur ne more pomagati.
She didn't know why.	Ni vedela zakaj.
He has known her for some time.	Pozna se že nekaj časa.
Maybe it was the money.	Mogoče je bil denar.
It seems to me that this is the only option.	Zdi se mi, da je to edina možnost.
No one here knows how to do it.	Nihče tukaj ne ve, kako to narediti.
And what is it about.	In za kaj gre.
I wonder why not just once.	Sprašujem se, zakaj ne samo enkrat.
This is what we know.	To je tisto, kar vemo.
I have work in the morning.	Zjutraj imam delo.
And why didn't this happen earlier.	In zakaj se to ni zgodilo že prej.
Like you.	Tako kot ti.
She knew she needed help.	Vedela je, da potrebuje pomoč.
We just were.	Samo bili smo.
You should do that.	To bi moral storiti.
He didn't feel like seeing him again.	Ni mu bilo do tega, da bi ga spet videl.
My life was mine.	Moje življenje je bilo moje.
Should not.	Ne bi smeli.
They saw me.	Videli so me.
He said yes.	Rekel je da.
She wanted me to go.	Želela je, da grem.
It's so beautiful.	Tako je lepo.
She only wanted hers.	Želela je samo svoje.
Now you're sorry.	Zdaj ti je žal.
He was everything to me.	Bil mi je vse.
You didn't call me back.	Nisi me poklical nazaj.
I'm sure we won't.	Prepričan sem, da ne bomo.
I'm not sure what it is.	Nisem prepričan, kaj je.
I feel sorry for you.	Žal mi je za vas.
Just what we should be.	Prav to, kar bi morali biti.
I've been very busy, but not like you.	Bil sem zelo zaposlen, a ne tako kot ti.
It was a little hard, but good.	Bilo je malo težko, a dobro.
Even as a child.	Tudi kot otrok.
I understand.	Razumem.
You have to stay on it.	Na tem moraš ostati.
And it worked.	In uspelo je.
You have done so much for me.	Toliko si naredil zame.
And he succeeded.	In to mu je uspelo.
I would expect that from him.	To bi pričakoval od njega.
Sometimes I feel like you, as you know sometimes.	Včasih se počutim kot ti, kot včasih veš.
He wasn't sure how he felt about that.	Ni bil prepričan, kako se ob tem počuti.
We have to be better.	Moramo biti boljši.
I have to do it right.	Moram narediti prav.
Nothing is too much.	Ničesar ni preveč.
All he wanted was a child.	Vse, kar si je želel, je bil otrok.
He might still get it.	Morda ga bo še dobil.
I just don't know how to do it.	Samo ne vem, kako to storiti.
I think it must be true.	Mislim, da mora biti res.
He meant it.	Resno je mislil.
There's just nothing there.	Tam preprosto ni ničesar.
He really didn't like it.	Res mu ni bilo všeč.
They didn't know about it.	Za to niso vedeli.
I'd like to know what it is.	Rad bi vedel, kaj je to.
No morals.	Morala ne.
He will soon realize this for his own good.	To bo kmalu spoznal v svoje dobro.
Something about the city.	Nekaj ​​o mestu.
You were lucky before.	Prej si imel srečo.
Don't talk like that.	Ne govori tako.
That's good enough.	To je dovolj dobro.
I mean, like.	Mislim, kot.
That's really why.	To je res zakaj.
You were the problem.	Ti si bil problem.
It was nice to see you.	Lepo te je bilo videti.
I've already done that.	To sem že naredil.
It does this in the following way.	To naredi na naslednji način.
And no one can believe it's true.	In nihče ne more verjeti, da je res.
I was sure it wasn't going to be good.	Prepričan sem bil, da ne bo dobro.
That's the only way it would happen.	Le tako bi se to zgodilo.
I always wanted to act.	Vedno sem želel igrati.
There were many things.	Bilo je veliko stvari.
I'm sure I'd like to meet you.	Prepričan sem, da bi te rad spoznal.
You, with me.	Ti, z mano.
She had to stay here.	Morala je ostati tukaj.
Live life as it is.	Živi življenje kot tako.
He didn't look surprised to see me.	Ni bil videti presenečen, ko me je videl.
Nothing is ever simple with me.	Pri meni ni nikoli nič preprosto.
I did it myself.	Naredil sem sam.
He spoke angrily.	Govoril je jezen.
He is afraid that he is not enough on his own.	Boji se, da sam ni dovolj.
All alone, without my help.	Vse sam, brez moje pomoči.
Again, so much work and so little time.	Spet toliko dela in tako malo časa.
And apparently he didn't hear anything.	In očitno ni slišal ničesar.
Just like that.	Kar tako.
It was all they could do.	To je bilo vse, kar so lahko naredili.
None of this would feel right anymore.	Nič od tega se ne bi več zdelo v redu.
I hope she succeeds.	Upam, da ji bo uspelo.
You should be better with him.	Z njim bi moral biti boljši.
You should go out.	Moral bi oditi ven.
I need it.	Potrebujem ga.
One could die and die.	Človek bi lahko umrl in umrl.
I still have it today.	Še danes ga imam.
Or it eats you.	Ali pa te poje.
In this to.	V tem do.
It wasn't yesterday.	Včeraj še ni bilo.
Not sure what he meant by that.	Nisem prepričan, kaj je s tem mislil.
You already lost.	Si že izgubil.
I wanted to like her.	Želela mi je biti všeč.
Because of the things he has.	Zaradi stvari, ki jih ima.
But she wasn't.	Vendar ni bila.
Maybe it was too much.	Mogoče je bilo preveč.
Will you do good?.	Ali boš naredil dobro?.
I think she liked them.	Mislim, da so ji bili všeč.
He never has and probably never will.	Nikoli ni imel in verjetno tudi nikoli ne bo.
We all did this together.	To smo naredili vsi skupaj.
He decided not to say anything.	Odločil se je, da ne bo rekel ničesar.
If so, it might still be there.	Če je tako, je morda še tam.
I will never let this go.	Tega ne bom nikoli pustil.
I still don't understand.	Še vedno ne razumem.
So tired of it.	Tako utrujen od tega.
They were lucky in that too.	Tudi pri tem so imeli srečo.
He is not alone.	Ni sam.
At the time, he thought he had won.	Takrat je mislil, da je zmagal.
He had seen far too much of her.	Veliko preveč jo je videl.
He was also a bit surprised.	Bil je tudi nekoliko presenečen.
It's like they didn't even see it coming.	Kot da tega sploh niso videli.
Nobody seems to care.	Zdi se, da nihče ne zanima.
Normally this wasn't a problem.	Običajno to ni bil problem.
They are all together all the time.	Vsi so ves čas skupaj.
He'll be back soon.	Kmalu se bo vrnil.
It's not like that for everyone.	Ni za vse tako.
Now I'm here again.	Zdaj sem spet tukaj.
I would go right back out.	Šel bi takoj nazaj ven.
I think that's spot on.	Mislim, da je to na mestu.
Just like it is with us.	Tako kot je pri nas.
The money came back.	Denar je prišel nazaj.
I learned a lot.	Veliko sem se naučil.
Let me see, he said.	Naj vidim, je rekel.
There were a few.	Nekaj ​​jih je bilo.
What happened wasn't because of you.	Kar se je zgodilo, ni bilo zaradi tebe.
Maybe it's not that.	Morda ni to.
He will find everything.	Vse bo našel.
It's really very simple.	Res je zelo preprosto.
I don't like her at all.	Sploh je ne maram.
But we're still here.	Vendar smo še vedno tukaj.
There was no one else to do it.	Ni bilo nikogar drugega, ki bi to naredil.
Probably soon for all of us.	Verjetno kmalu za vse nas.
That seems to be all.	Zdi se, da je to vse.
I just think it will.	Samo mislim, da bo.
He would never admit it, but he is afraid of them.	Nikoli ne bi priznal, a se jih boji.
He just needs a chance.	Samo priložnost potrebuje.
I know it wasn't easy.	Vem, da ni bilo lahko.
Maybe, but probably not.	Morda, a verjetno ne.
Let us know how we're doing.	Povej nam, kako nam gre.
He will be able to hear me.	Lahko me bo slišal.
Nobody called him.	Nihče ga ni poklical.
They are nothing.	Niso nič.
Well, he really didn't have to.	Pa mu res ni bilo treba.
He moved on quickly.	Hitro je šel naprej.
But there was nothing else to do.	A drugega ni bilo za storiti.
It should be really nice.	Naj bi bilo res lepo.
She knew where he was.	Vedela je, kje je.
I liked her very much.	Bila mi je zelo všeč.
It was nice to see her again.	Lepo jo je bilo spet videti.
He found me earlier.	Prej me je našel.
Quite early actually.	Pravzaprav precej zgodaj.
It's not you.	Nisi ti.
I probably never would.	Verjetno nikoli ne bi.
It doesn't help much.	Ne pomaga veliko.
Except no.	Le da ne.
You did it all.	Vse si naredil.
This one too.	Tudi ta.
I know he loves me and he will be right.	Vem, da me ima rad in me bo imel prav.
Not so much here.	Pri nas pa ne toliko.
That person is you.	Ta oseba si ti.
There was little to see.	Malo je bilo videti.
It's not difficult.	Ni težko.
It still wasn't enough.	Še vedno ni bilo dovolj.
I wish I was here to see it.	Želim si, da bi bil tukaj, da bi to videl.
It's very nice.	Zelo je lepo.
He was glad to find it.	Bil je vesel, da ga je našel.
There won't be many more anyway.	Tako ali tako jih ne bo veliko več.
She never said anything.	Nikoli ni rekla ničesar.
It's not that hard.	To ni tako težko.
I actually have to.	Pravzaprav moram.
He had a reason to tell her.	Imel je razlog, da ji je povedal.
No, they definitely saw them.	Ne, zagotovo so jih videli.
There would be no more.	Ne bi bilo več.
There is no right and wrong.	Ni prav in narobe.
He said there was nothing wrong.	Rekel je, da ni nič narobe.
It's just like him.	To je tako kot on.
For all my life.	Za vse moje življenje.
I don't want that.	Tega si ne želim.
I will do this again.	To bom naredil še enkrat.
He wasn't really doing anything right now.	Trenutno res ni delal ničesar.
It didn't look like much.	Ni bilo videti veliko.
They all knew why they were here.	Vsi so vedeli, zakaj so tukaj.
I have never met anyone like him.	Nikoli nisem srečal nikogar, kot je on.
Instead, it goes on and on.	Namesto tega gre naprej in tako.
And it's not okay.	In ni v redu.
We did a lot.	Veliko smo naredili.
But there's more going on.	Vendar se dogaja še več.
It would be hard to forget.	Težko bi pozabil.
If I wanted out, I would.	Če bi hotel ven, bi.
It just has to be all or nothing there.	Samo tam mora biti vse ali nič.
Little better.	Malo bolje.
We may never be.	Morda ne bomo nikoli.
You will see it.	Videli ga boste.
And he's not the only one who said that.	In ni edini, ki je to rekel.
He's done enough.	Naredil je dovolj.
But that was not the only problem.	A to ni bil edini problem.
I have a job for you.	Zate imam delo.
There is enough for all of us.	Za vse nas je dovolj.
Also has.	Ima tudi.
Sometimes it does.	Včasih se.
That's why I'm just a little behind.	Zaradi tega sem samo malo nazaj.
But that's not all.	Vendar to še ni vse.
I don't fully understand what he is doing.	Ne razumem popolnoma, kaj počne.
He will come.	Prišel bo.
They were all there.	Vsi so bili tam.
This happened to me.	To se mi je zgodilo.
And my week.	In moj teden.
However, it does something much more than that.	Vendar pa naredi nekaj veliko več kot to.
This really happened.	To se je res zgodilo.
He knew a lot.	Vedel je veliko.
i have enough	imam dovolj.
And it happened.	In zgodilo se je.
They had money.	Imeli so denar.
Maybe he could be too.	Morda bi lahko bil tudi on.
And that's really all there is to it.	In pravzaprav je to tudi vse.
Not like the last one.	Ne tako kot prejšnji.
He said he had.	Rekel je, da ima.
That's not nice.	To ni lepo.
He was nobody then.	Takrat je bil nihče.
He got help.	Dobil je pomoč.
We don't know what they are.	Ne vemo, kaj so.
More about us here.	Več o nas tukaj.
You are not alive.	Niste živi.
It is that, but it is also much more.	Je to, a je tudi veliko več.
They will see us too.	Tudi nas bodo videli.
It seems like yesterday.	Zdi se mi kot včeraj.
It's still there today.	Tam je še danes.
That would make me feel better.	Tako bi se počutil bolje.
But I got it.	Vendar sem ga dobil.
And it wasn't that hard either.	Pa tudi ni bilo tako težko.
I will definitely be back.	Zagotovo se bom vrnil.
Dad was there.	Oče je bil tam.
Time is time.	Čas je čas.
They are all very well.	Vsi so zelo dobro.
I never saw anything.	Nikoli nisem videl ničesar.
Nobody knows what it is.	Nihče ne ve, kaj je to.
Are you ready?	Si pripravljen?.
We all knew that.	Vsi smo to vedeli.
Not so here.	Tukaj ni tako.
We know where we are.	Vemo, kje smo.
No, he couldn't.	Ne, ni mogel.
You know very well what that was.	Dobro veš, kaj je to bilo.
It was actually fine.	Pravzaprav je bilo v redu.
This really happened.	To se je res zgodilo.
Which was fine.	Kar je bilo v redu.
As fast as you can.	Tako hitro, kot lahko.
We'll see what happens.	Bomo videli, kaj bo.
Life actually has very few of them.	Življenje jih ima pravzaprav zelo malo.
Did you think so?	Si tako mislil?
They both did.	Oba sta se.
First, there is no need to know it.	Prvič, tega ni treba vedeti.
I didn't do that today.	Danes tega nisem naredil.
It happened yesterday.	Zgodilo se je včeraj.
You certainly are.	Zagotovo ste.
Here, my life is mine.	Tukaj je moje življenje moje.
He'll be good.	Dober bo.
It was what was there.	Bilo je, kar je bilo tam.
And it was and is.	In je bilo in je.
That's what he was here for.	Za to je bil tukaj.
You won't feel this way by tomorrow.	Do jutri se ne boš več tako počutil.
I've never seen him.	Nikoli ga nisem videl.
You are the only one for me.	Zame si edina.
He became something else.	Postal je nekaj drugega.
Apparently not.	Očitno ne tako.
He's never met me before.	Še nikoli me ni srečal.
I've been there long enough to see.	Dovolj dolgo sem bil tam, da sem videl.
He'll just do it.	Samo naredil bo to.
Now it's every week.	Zdaj je vsak teden.
Maybe you were right.	Mogoče si imel prav.
Even that is not enough.	Tudi to ni dovolj.
That's why we were there.	Zato smo bili tam.
Fortunately, this has never happened to me.	Na srečo se mi to nikoli ni zgodilo.
How nice of him.	Kako lepo od njega.
Everyone moved on.	Vsak je šel naprej.
We're going to be a problem.	Bili bomo problem.
I don't have anything like that.	Nimam nič takega.
I know, and so do you.	Vem, ti pa tudi.
I do not believe.	Ne verjamem.
Been there, done that, well I know.	Bil sem tam, naredil to, dobro vem.
He likes it, everything.	Všeč mu je, vse.
You haven't been there for so long.	Tako dolgo te ni bilo tam.
I just wanted to do the right thing.	Hotel sem samo narediti prav.
He just has to do it.	To preprosto mora narediti.
He's doing his thing.	On dela svoje.
I see this all the time.	To vidim ves čas.
Nobody saw anything.	Nihče ni videl ničesar.
If not, then no.	Če ne, pa ne.
But, as we have seen, this is not the case.	A temu, kot smo videli, ni tako.
He heard that too.	To je tudi slišal.
There were many of them.	Bilo jih je veliko.
I also want you to know that everything is okay.	Prav tako želim, da veš, da je vse v redu.
But it was difficult to get to him.	A težko je bilo priti do njega.
I said no such thing.	Nisem rekel nič takega.
But that's not what happened here.	Vendar se tukaj ni zgodilo to.
I would be that man.	Jaz bi bil ta človek.
No, he wasn't here.	Ne, ni bil tukaj.
Me, very much.	Jaz, zelo.
It doesn't seem that long ago.	Ne zdi se mi tako dolgo nazaj.
Everything seemed wrong to me.	Vse se mi je zdelo narobe.
I won't forget.	Ne bom pozabil.
And you never found them.	In nikoli jih nisi našel.
I would be angry.	Bil bi jezen.
Apparently they have been there for several years.	Očitno so tam že nekaj let.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
I've already succeeded once.	Enkrat mi je že uspelo.
It's nice to see that too.	Tudi to ji je lepo videti.
I had them all.	Imel sem jih vse.
I could do more.	Lahko bi naredil več.
I never know what to think about it.	Nikoli ne vem, kaj naj si mislim o tem.
We know what it is.	Vemo, kaj je to.
It seems they didn't.	Zdi se, da tega niso storili.
I just don't know what.	Samo ne vem, kaj.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
We know what's good for you.	Vemo, kaj je dobro za vas.
She told herself it wasn't true.	Rekla si je, da ni res.
I will continue to do this.	To bom delal še naprej.
No, he wasn't.	Ne, ni bil.
I don't think you should be with me.	Mislim, da ne bi smel biti z mano.
Not even a little.	Niti malo.
You loved your children.	Imel si rad svoje otroke.
Actually, I wouldn't.	Pravzaprav ne bi.
The car will be here by tomorrow.	Avto bo tukaj do jutri.
Because they are.	Ker so.
He probably expected that.	Verjetno je to pričakoval.
I see him so often.	Tako pogosto ga vidim.
Unfortunately, we were there too.	Žal smo bili tudi mi tam.
It's really not a problem.	Res ni problem.
That's how she was.	Tako je bila.
I bought it for you.	Kupil sem ga zate.
Here they are here.	Tukaj so tukaj.
He knew what it was about.	Vedel je, za kaj gre.
You almost died this morning.	Zjutraj si skoraj umrl.
She just needs someone to give her a chance.	Samo nekoga potrebuje, da ji da priložnost.
He didn't wait for his father to say anything else.	Ni čakal, da bi oče rekel še kaj.
I've never felt that way.	Nikoli se nisem tako počutil.
There is nothing wrong here.	Tukaj ni nič narobe.
I've never heard of it.	Nikoli nisem slišal za to.
Sometimes it's something else.	Včasih je nekaj drugega.
Never.	Nikoli ne.
I have to work.	Moram delati.
He was angry.	Bil je jezen.
We've all had to at some point.	Vsi smo kdaj morali.
I don't want that either.	Tudi tega nočem.
I didn't see that.	Tega nisem videl.
If you can, that is.	Če lahko, to je.
There are more of us and we are better.	Več nas je in boljši smo.
But it's more than just that.	Vendar je več kot preprosto to.
He's right that it won't be easy.	Ima prav, da ne bo lahko.
Someone is still there.	Nekdo je še vedno tam.
This was not the case here.	Tukaj pa ni bilo tako.
He heard again.	Spet je slišal.
They were not alone.	Niso bili sami.
A good reason.	Dober razlog.
He always did that.	Vedno je to počel.
That's what she wanted.	To si je želela.
He would do anything and everything for me.	Zame bi naredil vse in vse.
This is the right time.	To je pravi čas.
So we had him in town.	Tako smo ga imeli v mestu.
And who has it.	In kdo jo ima.
There are so many thoughts.	Toliko misli je.
Nothing seemed wrong.	Nič se ni zdelo narobe.
In fact, he has already started.	Pravzaprav je že začel.
I've heard all about it.	Slišal sem vse o tem.
I needed to know a lot more.	Moral sem vedeti veliko več.
There is a very good reason for this.	Za to obstaja zelo dober razlog.
He had a good reason for that.	Za to je imel dober razlog.
I know they are there.	Vem, da so tam.
Maybe you'll get lucky.	Mogoče boš imel srečo.
Sorry, it isn't.	Žal, ni.
I wasn't alone for long.	Nisem bil dolgo sam.
As a person.	Kot oseba.
They were right.	Imeli so prav.
Except that can't be right.	Le da to ne more biti prav.
There has to be something.	Nekaj ​​mora biti.
It was as he wanted.	Bilo je tako, kot je hotel.
You should believe that.	To bi morali verjeti.
I suspect probably.	Sumim, da verjetno.
It was true last night.	Sinoči je bilo res.
Too many things.	Preveč stvari.
And probably more than once.	In verjetno več kot enkrat.
No, we don't know that.	Ne, tega ne vemo.
If you had the money for it.	Če bi imeli denar za to.
I have never met anyone like him either.	Tudi jaz še nisem srečal nikogar, kot je on.
We had to go all the time.	Ves čas smo morali iti.
He knows where he lives.	Ve, kje živi.
It's like .	Je kot .
Everything would be fine there.	Tam bi bilo vse v redu.
Which is really just as well.	Kar je res prav tako dobro.
If you want to talk, you can.	Če želite govoriti, lahko.
I'm not sure it is.	Nisem prepričan, da je.
I waited a long time.	Dolgo sem čakal.
This is what happened here.	To se je zgodilo tukaj.
He never returned home.	Nikoli se ni vrnil domov.
You really can.	Res lahko.
He seems to know too much.	Zdi se, da ve preveč.
I would know where to go from here.	Vedel bi, kam naj gre od tukaj.
I never forgot you.	Nikoli te nisem pozabil.
It was nice there.	Tam je bilo lepo.
Perhaps he did.	Morda je to tudi storil.
If he succeeded, well and good.	Če mu je uspelo, prav in prav.
You always stayed above everything.	Vedno si ostal nad vsem.
He had to say.	Moral je povedati.
Not everyone can work here.	Ne more vsak delati tukaj.
Is this a game.	Ali je to igra.
You have to play better.	Igrati moraš bolje.
I would be happy.	Bil bi vesel.
Do it, please.	Naredi to, prosim.
We will do just that.	Naredili bomo prav to.
And that's all.	In to je vse.
Not now.	Zdaj pa ne.
He doesn't want to talk.	Noče govoriti.
And she did.	In to je storila.
And yet they are each alone.	Pa vendar sta vsak sam.
However, it can also.	Vendar pa lahko tudi.
A good teacher.	Dober učitelj.
We haven't done that yet.	Tega še nismo storili.
He talked too much.	Preveč je govoril.
All together now.	Zdaj vsi skupaj.
He knew all along.	Ves čas je vedel.
He didn't tell me who he was.	Ni mi povedal, kdo je.
No matter how hard and wrong it is.	Ne glede na to, kako težko in narobe je to.
You are me.	Ti si jaz.
He was.	Bil je.
Maybe three, but no more than that.	Mogoče tri, a ne več kot to.
He will play well.	Dobro bo igral.
It was very fast.	Bilo je zelo hitro.
Which could be a good thing.	Kar bi lahko bilo dobro.
He could die soon.	Lahko bi kmalu umrl.
If we're lucky.	Če bomo imeli srečo.
It won't be me.	To ne bom jaz.
We'll see if that's true.	Bomo videli, ali je to res.
Much remains to be done.	Še veliko je treba narediti.
I've seen her before.	Videl sem jo že prej.
But that never happened.	Vendar se to nikoli ni zgodilo.
You shouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi smel storiti.
It seems to be going well.	Zdi se, da gre v redu.
He said yes.	Rekel je, da.
We have to go now.	Zdaj moramo iti.
I hope it's better now.	Upam, da je zdaj bolje.
Also work.	Tudi delo.
Or had my three children.	Ali imel moje tri otroke.
I was everything.	Bil sem vse.
You or someone like you.	Ti ali nekdo, kot si ti.
And right or wrong, he needed her.	In prav ali narobe, potreboval jo je.
There don't seem to be any.	Zdi se, da jih ni.
That's what it's good for.	Za to je dobro.
Life was hard for me.	Življenje je bilo zame težko.
He will be happy with me.	Vesel bo z mano.
But it wasn't always like that.	Vendar ni bilo vedno tako.
We wouldn't even be here.	Sploh nas ne bi bilo tukaj.
I don't know where to go.	Ne vem, kam naj grem.
I came here, yes.	Sem sem prišel, da.
That's not a good reason.	To ni dober razlog.
I a good man.	Jaz dober človek.
I always want to do something different.	Vedno si želim početi nekaj drugega.
I never thought it could be this good.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da je lahko tako dobro.
Gone, gone, gone.	Odšel, odšel, odšel.
It was very simple and very quick.	Bilo je zelo preprosto in zelo hitro.
He can be worked with.	Z njim se da delati.
He was at home here.	Tukaj je bil doma.
I tried to tell him.	Poskušal sem mu povedati.
We already knew that.	To smo že vedeli.
It happened very quickly.	Zgodilo se je zelo hitro.
It's still here.	Še vedno je tukaj.
Do not speak.	Ne govori.
Tell me they're here.	Povej mi, da so tukaj.
Why didn't he move on.	Zakaj ni šel naprej.
I'd really rather not go out at all.	Res bi raje, da sploh ne bi šel ven.
I thought she was afraid of him.	Zdelo se mi je, da se ga boji.
He would never come out.	Nikoli ne bi prišel ven.
But he was not alone.	Vendar ni ostal sam.
You did very well.	Zelo dobro si opravil.
It's hard to do that.	Težko je to narediti.
He also said that he has more work to do.	Povedal je tudi, da ima več dela.
I can't believe it.	Ne morem verjeti v to.
Nobody ever does.	Nihče nikoli ne.
Not too sure what to do next.	Nisem preveč prepričan, kaj storiti naprej.
He didn't have much.	Ni imel veliko.
He didn't tell me what happened.	Ni mi povedal, kaj se je zgodilo.
I still have some time.	Imam še nekaj časa.
There is so much going on this day.	Ta dan se toliko dogaja.
You did your thing.	Naredil si svoje.
I have to get back to work.	Moram nazaj v službo.
That wasn't a question.	To ni bilo vprašanje.
I think it will be fine.	Mislim, da bo v redu.
It was probably him.	Verjetno je bil on.
It was so obvious.	To je bilo tako očitno.
I actually did that.	Pravzaprav sem to naredil.
I said I could.	Rekel sem, da lahko.
I hope he stays.	Upam, da bo ostal.
Like everyone.	Kot vsi.
That's what his father taught him.	To ga je naučil oče.
If and when it will.	Če in ko bo.
I've seen too much.	Preveč sem videl.
You should do more.	Moral bi narediti več.
But it was wrong.	Vendar je bilo narobe.
Or maybe it's me.	Ali pa sem morda jaz.
Not for anything or anyone.	Ne za nič ali nikogar.
She just had to come.	Samo priti je morala.
He was angry.	Bil je jezen.
You have to get there fast.	Do tega moraš priti hitro.
Being alone is not a problem for me.	Biti sam zame ni problem.
And so for so beautiful.	In tako za tako lepo.
Because one can never be too sure.	Ker človek nikoli ne more biti preveč prepričan.
A good thing too.	Tudi dobra stvar.
We would be better off without him.	Brez njega bi nam bilo bolje.
I will try to be better.	Poskušal bom biti boljši.
I would ask you to be.	Prosil bi vas, da ste.
I know what you're thinking.	Vem, kaj si misliš.
It was my whole life.	To je bilo vse moje življenje.
And you know, it worked.	In veš, uspelo je.
He didn't want to be here.	Ni hotel biti tukaj.
I still haven't heard anything.	Še vedno nisem slišal ničesar.
It will be like that with everything.	Z vsem bo tako.
I'm fine with that.	V redu sem s tem.
You helped a lot.	Veliko si pomagal.
Not enough to eat.	Ni dovolj za jesti.
It was more.	Bilo je več.
I could teach you so much.	Toliko bi te lahko naučil.
They were there yesterday.	Včeraj so bili tam.
Here's the thing.	Tukaj je stvar.
It was a good day.	To je bil dober dan.
He couldn't come.	Ni mogel priti.
They had to go!.	Morali so iti!.
And nobody really knows that.	In tega res nihče ne ve.
Tell him you're there.	Povej mu, da si tam.
Now you're going to tell me something.	Zdaj mi boš nekaj povedal.
Not after what they did to me.	Ne po tem, kar so mi naredili.
This can't be it.	To ne more biti to.
It's easy.	Lahko je.
Everything was fine there.	Tam je bilo vse v redu.
Just about who started it.	Prav o tem, kdo je začel.
Apparently it never worked.	Očitno nikoli ni uspelo.
There are quite a few of them.	Kar nekaj jih je.
He will want to know who this man is.	Želel bo vedeti, kdo je ta človek.
Hard for me.	Težko zame.
It would never be there again.	Nikoli več ga ne bi bilo.
I will never see them again.	Nikoli več jih ne bom videl.
She knew she had to do something about it.	Vedela je, da mora glede tega nekaj storiti.
I need to see you.	Moram te videti.
I don't want to do that.	Nočem tega narediti.
Glad to see you.	Vesel, da vas vidim.
It was just here, now.	Bilo je samo tukaj, zdaj.
But much more needs to be done.	Vendar je treba narediti še veliko več.
We know who they are.	Vemo, kdo so.
He can't even speak anymore.	Naprej ne more niti govoriti.
But they are not alive.	Vendar niso živi.
I feel better already.	Počutim se že bolje.
We will see much, much more of this.	Videli bomo veliko, veliko več tega.
I'll keep it simple.	To bom preprosto.
For a long time.	Že dolgo.
I need him to be happy.	Potrebujem ga, da je vesel.
Fortunately, there are many of them.	Na srečo jih je tudi veliko.
No, it's not okay.	Ne, ni v redu.
I'm tired of all this.	Utrujen sem od vsega tega.
I never forgot you.	Nikoli te nisem pozabil.
I want you to be with me.	Želim, da si z mano.
He knew everything about me.	Vedel je vse o meni.
But he doesn't.	Vendar tega ne stori.
That was all.	To je bilo vse.
There were many people who saw it.	Bilo je veliko ljudi, ki so to videli.
He was really quite tired.	Res je bil precej utrujen.
He needs money.	Potrebuje denar.
Now you know how it happened.	Zdaj veste, kako se je to zgodilo.
She will know everything.	Vse bo vedela.
He made his own decision.	Odločil se je sam.
He doesn't do that anymore.	Tega ne počne več.
We're going to have our own little party.	Imeli bomo svojo malo zabavo.
he needs it.	potrebuje ga.
You didn't say anything wrong.	Nič narobe nisi rekel.
It's actually really serious.	Pravzaprav je res resno.
However, this is not happening.	Vendar se to ne dogaja.
I want us to be together.	Želim, da sva skupaj.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
We have that too.	Tudi to imamo.
It wasn't there before.	Prej ga ni bilo.
And she wasn't at home.	In ni je bilo doma.
And he said he would go get help.	In rekel je, da bo šel po pomoč.
But these are not them.	To pa niso tisti.
It seems good.	Zdi se dobro.
It seems you didn't.	Zdi se, da nisi.
Lots of work for the kids.	Veliko dela za otroke.
I would find him.	Jaz bi ga našel.
He didn't put it there.	Ni ga dal tja.
In fact, they were much more.	Pravzaprav so bili veliko več.
But it wasn't always like that.	Vendar ni bilo vedno tako.
He didn't want help.	Ni želel pomoči.
That would be just today.	To bi bilo samo danes.
So far it is.	Do zdaj je tako.
That seems to help a bit.	Zdi se, da to malo pomaga.
I will hear you.	Jaz vas bom slišal.
I know I can.	Vem, da lahko.
And he was sure he would come back again.	In bil je prepričan, da se bo spet vrnil.
You might be a little too much.	Morda vas je malo preveč.
That's what it's all for.	Za to je vse.
I think we should.	Mislim, da bi morali.
I hope you like it!.	Upam, da vam je všeč!.
That's why she was here.	Zato je bila tukaj.
It's always like that.	Vedno je tako.
Apparently nothing happened.	Očitno se ni zgodilo nič.
She should go.	Morala bi iti.
I thought you were.	Mislil sem, da si.
I went wrong.	Narobe sem šel.
It used to be.	Nekoč je bilo.
He made it, you know.	Uspelo mu je, veš.
He wasn't the only one.	Ni bil edini.
He will do something about it.	Nekaj ​​bo naredil glede tega.
She seemed to need him there.	Zdelo se je, da ga potrebuje tam.
Nobody knows everything.	Nihče ne ve vsega.
Everything was so beautiful.	Vse je bilo tako lepo.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Ne morem, ne morem, ne morem.
I love this, it's so beautiful.	To mi je všeč, tako lepo je.
This was not the case.	Temu ni bilo tako.
This is the next problem.	To je naslednji problem.
And it's a lot.	In veliko je.
It was as if they were not there before.	Zdelo se je, kot da jih prej ni bilo.
I'm not sure what the reason for this is.	Nisem prepričan, kaj je razlog za to.
Not very well, as it turned out.	Ne prav dobro, kot se je zgodilo.
Don't tell anyone.	Nikomur ne povej.
She had to be told.	Treba ji je bilo povedati.
We will make it.	Uspelo nam bo.
Sam didn't feel good about it.	Sam se zaradi tega ni dobro počutil.
No, no one will see.	Ne, nihče ne bo videl.
And it sure was.	In zagotovo je bilo.
He knew a lot about the city.	O mestu je vedel veliko.
I'm the one who did it.	Jaz sem tisti, ki je to naredil.
I could tell.	Lahko bi povedal.
Nothing is that simple.	Nič ni tako preprosto.
However, it is not true.	Vendar pa ni res.
She didn't have to.	Ni ji bilo treba.
I'm having a good time.	lepo se imam.
I just have to say this.	Samo to moram povedati.
And we know that.	In to vemo.
Everyone will tell you.	Vsak vam bo povedal.
I must have done something right.	Moral sem narediti nekaj prav.
He's fine with that.	V redu je s tem.
Tell me right away.	Takoj mi povej.
He still plays it.	Še vedno jo igra.
So he might not do it now.	Zato tega zdaj morda ne bo storil.
If so, there are many of us.	Če je tako, nas je veliko.
He decided he had enough.	Odločil se je, da ima dovolj.
I'll try to get home early.	Poskušal bom priti zgodaj domov.
He is very good.	Zelo dober je.
That was probably a good thing.	To je bilo verjetno dobro.
We were there.	Bili smo tam.
I often am.	Pogosto sem.
Nothing seems to help.	Zdi se, da nič ne pomaga.
And as he said, so it shall be.	In kot je rekel, tako bo.
My father was just my father.	Moj oče je bil samo moj oče.
That's just not going to happen.	To se preprosto ne bo zgodilo.
I'm sorry for everything that happened.	Žal mi je za vse, kar se je zgodilo.
And it was, and it was.	In bilo je, in bil je.
Someone must know.	Nekdo mora vedeti.
But I couldn't.	Vendar nisem mogel.
Not even anything.	Niti nič.
And apparently he was right.	In očitno je imel prav.
That was everyone.	To so bili vsi.
I think he was right.	Mislim, da je imel prav.
You seem to know a lot about this.	Videti je, da veste veliko o tem.
Fortunately, no one seemed to want it.	Na srečo je bilo videti, da nihče tega ni hotel.
They didn't know where he was now.	Kje je zdaj, niso vedeli.
You don't have to do everything yourself.	Ni vam treba vsega narediti sam.
No one at all.	Sploh nihče.
Much, much more.	Veliko, veliko več.
It didn't happen to me.	Meni se to ni zgodilo.
And it happened so fast.	In zgodilo se je tako hitro.
It's just me.	To sem samo jaz.
You didn't.	Nisi .
You need to talk to me.	Moraš govoriti z mano.
He'll be fine.	Z njim bo vse v redu.
To go to school.	Iti v šolo.
Or we won't.	Ali pa ne bomo.
And you don't have to do that.	In tega vam ni treba storiti.
But he didn't want to do that.	Vendar tega ni hotel storiti.
That won't be enough.	To ne bo dovolj.
I heard him speak.	Slišal sem ga govoriti.
It was then.	Takrat je bilo.
So much has happened.	Toliko se je zgodilo.
There was nothing he could do about it now.	Zdaj glede tega ni mogel storiti ničesar.
There is no one here at all.	Tukaj sploh ni nikogar.
I wanted to know.	Hotel sem vedeti.
He was gone for a long time.	Dolgo ga ni bilo.
You are no better than him.	Nič boljši nisi od njega.
And we knew what we had to do.	In vedeli smo, kaj moramo narediti.
He simply wanted to see him.	Preprosto ga je hotel videti.
I haven't eaten anything.	Nič nisem jedel.
It used to be so simple.	Prej je bilo tako preprosto.
Please has anyone done this before.	Prosim, ali je že kdo to storil.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Mogoče, mogoče, mogoče.
The question here is really just about when.	Vprašanje tukaj je res samo o tem, kdaj.
That doesn't help me.	To mi ne pomaga.
And so it was.	In tako je tudi bilo.
Just me and him.	Samo jaz in on.
They often are.	Pogosto so.
That's not yet.	To še ni.
We have so little time.	Imamo tako malo časa.
And you were.	In ti si bil.
Often not.	Pogosto ne.
Now she said she likes it.	Zdaj je rekla, da ji je všeč.
And always would be.	In vedno bi bila.
He won't be a problem.	On ne bo problem.
I needed time alone.	Potreboval sem čas sam.
She knew when he came.	Vedela je, kdaj je prišel.
And a little more work on it.	In še malo dela na tem.
Sometimes it does, but often it doesn't.	Včasih se, pogosto pa ne.
He was my person.	Bil je moja oseba.
You know you want to see.	Veste, da želite videti.
It shouldn't even be.	Niti ne bi smel biti.
I mean, it's not just me.	Mislim, nisem samo jaz.
I didn't know that.	Tega tako nisem vedel.
I have something else for you.	Imam še nekaj zate.
This is very beautiful.	To je zelo lepo.
But they were there.	Vendar so bili tam.
But he doesn't do that.	Vendar tega ne počne.
I don't believe that one bit.	Temu niti malo ne verjamem.
This won't be pretty.	To ne bo lepo.
That was.	To je bilo.
I know him.	Poznam ga.
If it's urgent, just say so.	Če je hitro, samo povej.
And I would return them.	In bi jih vrnil.
No, it's not.	Ne, ni.
But that was all he did.	Vendar je bilo to vse, kar je naredil.
Just like yours.	Tako kot svoje.
Serious, but nice.	Resno, a lepo.
It just felt wrong to me.	Preprosto se mi je zdelo narobe.
It's probably there.	Verjetno je tam.
And I thought it was.	In zdelo se mi je, da je.
Not at all, not at all.	Sploh ne, sploh ne.
Life was good today.	Danes je bilo življenje dobro.
He needed time.	Potreboval je čas.
And he feels better.	In počuti se bolje.
She didn't like that one bit.	To ji ni bilo niti malo všeč.
I almost forgot about these.	Skoraj sem pozabil na te.
And everyone seems to love it.	In zdi se, da je vsem všeč.
It doesn't help.	Ne pomaga.
He often did this and couldn't help it.	To je pogosto počel in ni mogel pomagati.
But it was right.	Bilo je vendar prav.
And everyone had a good time.	In vsi so se imeli lepo.
She was never alone.	Nikoli ni bila sama.
I thought for sure this was it.	Zagotovo sem mislil, da je to to.
No, that's not right.	Ne, to ni prav.
He didn't look so good this morning.	Zjutraj ni bil videti tako dobro.
A lot of people are already doing this.	To počne že veliko ljudi.
I wish it wasn't like that.	Želim si, da ne bi bilo tako.
I didn't think so.	Nisem mislil.
I just called.	Pravkar sem poklical.
he asked.	je vprašal.
I was not.	Nisem bil.
They are better now.	Zdaj so boljši.
A lot of people do that.	Veliko ljudi to počne.
He really loved you.	Res te je imel rad.
All of that is gone.	Vsega tega ni več.
Sometimes it worked.	Včasih je uspelo.
That may seem a bit long.	Morda se to zdi malo dolgo.
And there's nothing you can do.	In nič ne moreš storiti.
So glad I met you.	Tako vesel, da sem te spoznal.
It works for me.	Zame gre.
But it wasn't like a person.	Vendar ni bilo kot oseba.
Normally this would be a simple job.	Običajno bi bilo to preprosto delo.
I wish none of us knew that.	Želim si, da tega nihče od nas ne bi vedel.
That's what he was doing.	To je počel.
You know, and she was.	Veš, in bila je.
I will definitely stay there again.	Zagotovo bom spet ostal tam.
I can't help it.	Ne morem si pomagati.
I could see her.	Lahko sem jo videl.
It needs something more.	Potrebuje nekaj več.
He couldn't believe it.	Ni mogel verjeti.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Vendar se zdi, da temu ni tako.
None of us are.	Nihče od nas ni.
I want it to be.	Želim, da je.
There was always a reason.	Vedno je bil razlog.
He knows her well.	Dobro jo pozna.
And who knows what else.	In kdo ve kaj še.
He just had to get there.	Samo tja je moral priti.
Okay, simple enough.	V redu, dovolj preprosto.
He won't be back.	Ne bo se vrnil.
To someone like me.	Na nekoga, kot sem jaz.
You have to do this for me.	To moraš narediti zame.
I was soon tired.	Kmalu sem bil utrujen.
That doesn't seem likely.	To se ne zdi verjetno.
He was very good there.	Tam je bil zelo dober.
I feel like a child.	Počutim se kot otrok.
I want to know if possible.	Želim vedeti, če je mogoče.
It's all there in front of us.	Vse je tam pred nami.
That's right.	Tako je.
It was fine.	Bilo je v redu.
She's fine with that.	To ji je prav.
I thought it was good.	Zdelo se mi je dobro.
A friend said.	Prijatelj je rekel.
I just want to help her.	Samo pomagati ji želim.
And that seemed to be it.	In zdelo se je, da je to to.
There are problems here too.	Tudi tukaj so težave.
I'm with him.	Jaz sem z njim.
In fact, no one was good enough.	Pravzaprav nihče ni bil dovolj dober.
Okay, here it is.	V redu, tukaj je.
He could do whatever he wanted with it.	Z njim je lahko počel, kar je hotel.
Is it for you or for.	Ali je zate ali za.
Since then I have never been without it.	Od takrat nisem bil nikoli brez njega.
And yet it happened.	In vendar se je zgodilo.
And don't talk to me like that.	In ne govori tako z mano.
They were nothing.	Niso bili nič.
Maybe I wouldn't even want it.	Morda si tega sploh ne bi želel.
You know where you are.	Veš, kje si.
Maybe someone has worked with this and can help me.	Mogoče je kdo delal s tem in mi lahko pomaga.
That's something, okay.	To je nekaj, v redu.
I couldn't see anything.	Ničesar nisem mogel videti.
Actually, not at all.	Pravzaprav sploh ne.
Was he right.	Ali je imel prav.
I kind of know what you mean.	Malo vem, kaj misliš.
So much of this is true.	Toliko tega je res.
Which he probably had.	Kar je verjetno imel.
I would have.	Jaz bi imel .
She didn't have to do what she did.	Ni ji bilo treba narediti, kar je storila.
That's really what we have.	To je res tisto, kar imamo.
No, no, it's not for me.	Ne, ne, to ni zame.
We were always together.	Vedno sva bila skupaj.
He had to.	Moral je.
I hope that's okay.	Upam, da je to v redu.
I think this is the first time.	Mislim, da je to prvič.
Nobody will tell me anything.	Nihče mi ne bo nič povedal.
I almost forgot it existed.	Skoraj sem pozabil, da obstaja.
What will we do with you?	Kaj bomo s tabo.
I found everything myself.	Vse sem našel sam.
Nothing too much.	Nič preveč.
He didn't forget.	Ni pozabil.
Okay, he could see that.	V redu, to je lahko videl.
It's hard to say.	Težko je povedati.
And that too.	In to tudi.
You are my good friend.	Ti si moj dober prijatelj.
It's simple for kids.	Za otroke je preprosto.
Good job.	Dobro delo.
No I will not.	Ne, ne bom.
I have more.	Imam več.
We will, we must.	Bomo, moramo.
It has to be here.	Tukaj mora biti.
This happens every day here.	To se tukaj dogaja vsak dan.
She said no.	Rekla je, da ne.
He never wanted to talk about it.	Nikoli ni hotel govoriti o tem.
And now he's gone.	In zdaj ga ni.
Just good to know.	Samo dobro je vedeti.
I really want that.	To si zelo želim.
We had to get out.	Morali smo ven.
I used to see her.	Včasih sem jo videl.
And so he does.	In tako tudi počne.
Because it was believable.	Ker je bilo verjeti.
Not so fast.	Ne tako hitro.
I really liked it.	Res mi je bilo všeč.
I could stay here.	Lahko bi ostal tukaj.
I want to see you go.	Želim te videti oditi.
It always goes, goes, goes.	Vedno gre, gre, gre.
Maybe he knows someone.	Morda koga pozna.
We don't care how.	Ne zanima nas, kako.
I could talk about it with him.	Lahko bi govoril o tem z njim.
Maybe it's about that.	Morda gre za to.
The problem still exists.	Problem še vedno obstaja.
I could just ask her.	Lahko bi jo samo vprašal.
We are never alone.	Nikoli nismo sami.
It's been long enough for that.	Bilo je dovolj dolgo za to.
Where are you now?.	Kje si zdaj?.
You'll be better soon.	Kmalu vam bo bolje.
He never came back.	Nikoli se ni vrnil.
You just had to know everything.	Samo vedeti je bilo treba vse.
It won't, because of you.	Ne bo, zaradi tebe.
It seems like a lot of work.	Zdi se, da je veliko dela.
It can't be.	Ne more biti.
Let it be.	Naj bo.
We knew what we had.	Vedeli smo, kaj imamo.
It was always just you.	Vedno si bil samo ti.
I've never seen so many.	Še nikoli nisem videl toliko.
To not help to help.	Da ne pomaga pomagati.
I hope it's good for you.	Upam, da je dobra zate.
Someone had to do something.	Nekdo je moral nekaj narediti.
It is much more than just that.	Je veliko več kot samo to.
My three years.	Moja tri leta.
He never asked for it.	Nikoli ni prosil za to.
I need this for work.	To potrebujem za delo.
I could see how it could be.	Videl sem, kako bi lahko bilo.
He's just fine.	Samo dobro mu je.
And it never did.	In nikoli se ni.
They are still alive.	Še vedno so živi.
Not that anyone would see him.	Saj ne, da bi ga kdo videl.
Regardless, that's a lot.	Ne glede na to je to veliko.
I knew that all along.	To sem ves čas vedel.
Or they are still alive.	Ali pa so še živi.
But if not, no.	Če pa ne, ne.
They will be here.	Tukaj bodo.
I have a job here.	Tukaj imam delo.
I called her back.	Poklical sem jo nazaj.
We'll see what we'll see.	Bomo videli, kar bomo videli.
I'll be back when you are.	Vrnil se bom, ko boš ti.
I can see it happening.	Vidim, da se dogaja.
I don't want back.	Nočem nazaj.
You will do that.	To boš naredil.
It's better that way.	Tako je že bolje.
But it will be like this from now on.	A tako bo od zdaj naprej.
That's going well too.	Tudi to gre dobro.
They seem to be.	Zdi se, da so.
Since it is nothing, there is nothing there.	Ker je nič, tam ni ničesar.
You must be alone.	Moraš biti sam.
He simply meant what he said.	Preprosto je mislil, kar je rekel.
That's what he said.	To je rekel.
That's not a good reason.	To ni dober razlog.
This is so hard.	To je tako težko.
You should talk to him about it.	O tem bi moral govoriti z njim.
For a while, everything seems fine.	Nekaj ​​časa se vse zdi v redu.
He didn't want to leave.	Ni hotel oditi.
It was just for fun.	Bilo je samo za zabavo.
It's a lot.	Je veliko.
He didn't tell me.	Ni mi povedal.
Because he couldn't find her.	Ker je ni našel.
Something she knew she had to do.	Nekaj, kar je vedela, da mora narediti.
You've probably seen it before.	Zagotovo ste ga že videli.
This is what happened here.	To se je zgodilo tukaj.
This is indeed an option.	To je res možnost.
It will.	Bo .
He saw her again.	Spet jo je videl.
I think we all have.	Mislim, da imamo vsi.
No one knew anything or no one.	Nihče ni vedel ničesar ali nihče.
I'm going out.	grem ven.
I'll admit it too.	Tudi jaz bom priznal.
I would like to die.	Rad bi umrl.
And we know that.	In to vemo.
And he said he could hardly believe it.	In rekel je, da skoraj ne more verjeti.
Dad won't be happy you're here.	Oče ne bo vesel, da si tukaj.
And one more time.	In še enkrat.
Each exists because of the other.	Vsak obstaja zaradi drugega.
I'm so glad he's back with me.	Prav vesel sem, da je spet z mano.
You got me.	Imaš me.
He wanted everything.	Hotel je vse.
It was never the right time.	Nikoli ni bil pravi čas.
I've heard it all before.	Vse sem že slišal.
Or maybe.	Ali pa morda.
To be happier.	Da bi bil bolj vesel.
I didn't expect that.	Tega nisem pričakoval.
Even if he asked me to.	Tudi če me je prosil.
It could be me, she said.	Lahko bi bila jaz, je rekla.
Right here and now.	Prav tukaj in zdaj.
Instead, it's obvious and simple.	Namesto tega je očitno in preprosto.
Without you there is no us.	Brez vas ni nas.
In fact, I know that's not the case.	Pravzaprav vem, da temu ni tako.
So far it's all been work.	Do zdaj je bilo vse delo.
When we have time.	Ko imamo čas.
Like, really really.	Kot, res res.
Very few people know this.	Zelo malo ljudi to ve.
True, the other day here.	Res je, prejšnji dan tukaj.
Not many people know this.	Tega ne ve veliko ljudi.
As if everything had never happened.	Kot da vsega nikoli ne bi bilo.
Maybe they wouldn't have.	Morda ne bi imeli.
Maybe they didn't have time for that.	Mogoče za to niso imeli časa.
Maybe he doesn't have them.	Morda jih nima.
It would be tonight or not at all.	Bilo bi nocoj ali pa sploh ne.
He really liked that.	To mu je bilo zelo všeč.
We can't do that.	Tega ne moremo narediti.
So far so good.	Za zdaj je vse dobro.
We know who he works for.	Vemo, za koga dela.
And there is nothing else to do.	In nič drugega ni za početi.
That was yesterday morning.	To je bilo včeraj zjutraj.
But something really needs to be said about it.	Nekaj ​​pa je res treba povedati o tem.
He still thinks so.	Še vedno tako misli.
Please, I am.	Prosim, sem.
And he didn't want that.	In tega ni hotel.
Either you like it or you don't.	Ali ga imaš rad ali ne.
It's none of my business.	To ni moja stvar.
He brought me back to life.	Vrnil me je v življenje.
I don't know what's going on.	Ne vem, kaj se dogaja.
I know what is true.	Vem, kaj je res.
When it's good, it's really good.	Ko je dobro, je res dobro.
Until now.	Do zdaj.
This happened the day before.	To se je zgodilo dan prej.
Except he still needed to know.	Le da je še vedno moral vedeti.
Maybe he doesn't know.	Morda ne ve.
There was just no one else.	Samo nikogar drugega ni bilo.
I'm human just like you.	Sem človek tako kot ti.
There's just a lot to do.	Samo veliko je treba narediti.
No, she had to do a little.	Ne, malo je morala storiti.
That's what she wanted to do.	To je želela storiti.
You can't do everything right.	Ne moreš narediti vsega v redu.
Now they might not do that.	Zdaj tega morda ne bodo storili.
It's very simple.	Zelo preprosto je.
Which was in the morning.	Kar je bilo zjutraj.
It's always out of place.	Vedno ni na mestu.
You'll have to come with us.	Moral boš iti z nami.
It will never be more right than now.	Nikoli ne bo bolj prav kot zdaj.
Is that still the case?.	Je še vedno tako?.
I was lucky to get this room.	Imel sem srečo, da sem dobil to sobo.
It can help.	Lahko pomaga.
And we've all done it.	In vsi smo to storili.
They will never see it.	Tega ne bodo nikoli videli.
And he liked what he saw.	In všeč mu je bilo, kar je videl.
They never knew about it.	Nikoli niso vedeli za to.
She never made it.	Nikoli ji ni uspelo.
You don't even have to.	Niti ni treba.
I don't know where.	Ne vem kje.
I won.	Zmagal sem.
But it's early.	Vendar je zgodaj.
To be what she wanted to be.	Biti to, kar je želela biti.
In what, he didn't know.	V kaj, ni vedel.
I never go there.	Nikoli ne grem tja.
It seemed too good to be true.	Zdelo se je preveč dobro, da bi bilo res.
If not, that would be fine too.	Če ne, bi bilo tudi v redu.
Tell me what you think about it.	Povej mi, kaj misliš o tem.
I thought there had to be something more.	Mislil sem, da mora biti nekaj več.
That's how it is now.	Tako je kot zdaj.
You are nobody to me.	Zame nisi nihče.
Not anymore.	Ni več.
I have all that.	Vse to imam.
It's hard, it's true.	Težko je, res je.
I see a lot.	Vidim veliko.
What he had, he did not want.	Kar je imel, ni želel.
He doesn't want to be good.	Noče biti dober.
He likes to be alone.	Rad je sam.
It can't be that good.	Ne more biti tako dobro.
But it almost didn't happen.	A se skoraj ni zgodilo.
It will always be there.	Vedno bo tam.
I didn't think it would.	Nisem si mislil, da bo.
It will be good for you.	Dober ti bo.
I can always see people.	Vedno lahko vidim ljudi.
That's pretty big.	To je precej veliko.
He was actually right.	Pravzaprav je imel prav.
Again, nothing happened.	Spet se ni zgodilo nič.
However, this cannot be the case all the time.	Vendar to ne more biti ves čas tako.
He lost his job.	Izgubil je službo.
He didn't have to work tomorrow.	Jutri mu ni bilo treba delati.
I never told anyone that.	Nikoli tega nisem povedal nikomur.
Being here and now.	Biti tukaj in zdaj.
You won't talk to me.	Ne boš govoril z mano.
Not even once.	Niti enkrat.
Sam was a good man.	Sam je bil dober človek.
And now it didn't seem so difficult.	In zdaj se to ni zdelo tako težko.
Good for that.	Dobro za to.
Or usually not.	Ali pa običajno ne.
Probably more than me.	Verjetno bolj kot jaz.
You already have a job.	Službo že imaš.
We shouldn't, we shouldn't, but we will.	Ne bi smeli, ne bi smeli, a bomo.
Okay, go ahead.	V redu, kar naprej.
I would not, could not, do that.	Ne bi, ne bi mogel, tega storiti.
Maybe it's not what you think it is.	Mogoče ni to, kar mislite, da je.
I couldn't take it anymore.	Nisem mogel več.
I need more.	Potrebujem več.
You're the one who did it.	Ti si tisti, ki je to naredil.
It's always like that.	Tako je vedno.
Life would not be easy.	Življenje ne bi bilo lahko.
No one could see.	Nihče ni mogel videti.
It was like coming home.	Bilo je, kot bi se vrnil domov.
He never did anything she liked.	Nikoli ni naredil ničesar, kar bi ji bilo všeč.
He looked completely surprised.	Videti je bil popolnoma presenečen.
Played here only once.	Igral tukaj samo enkrat.
I talked about it.	Govoril sem o tem.
That was a nice job.	To je bilo lepo delo.
Nobody knew anything.	Nihče ni vedel ničesar.
What you had to say.	Kar si imel povedati.
I hope to see him again.	Upam, da ga bom spet videl.
That's all we need to know.	To je vse kar moramo vedeti.
I don't know what it's about.	Ne vem, za kaj gre.
I don't want to talk about it.	Nočem govoriti o tem.
You will be able to see her once in .	Videli jo boste lahko enkrat v .
He was ready for it.	Bil je pripravljen na to.
If someone doesn't like me, fine.	Če me kdo ne mara, prav.
Maybe he doesn't think so.	Morda ne misli tako.
This is simply not possible.	To preprosto ni mogoče.
Now tell me.	Zdaj pa mi povej.
Nice to have you with us.	Lepo, da si z nami.
I'm also interested in how it will be.	Tudi mene zanima, kako bo.
I'd really like to see it.	Res bi ga rad videl.
I tried and tried.	Poskušal sem in poskušal.
I just don't think it's going to work.	Samo mislim, da to ne bo uspelo.
Everything is going well.	Vse gre prav.
I had a hard time finding it.	Težko sem ga našel.
There are few people.	Malo ljudi je.
They were always there.	Vedno so bili tam.
I had to do everything myself.	Vse sem morala narediti sama.
Sometimes you heard, sometimes you didn't.	Včasih si slišal, včasih ne.
We all have to go.	Vsi moramo iti.
You never know, you might like it.	Nikoli ne veš, morda ti bo všeč.
I just didn't do anything.	Samo naredil nisem ničesar.
He bought it.	Kupil ga je.
I'll always be your friend no matter what.	Vedno bom tvoj prijatelj, ne glede na to.
I could talk about this for a long time.	O tem bi lahko govoril dolgo.
All good enough.	Vse dovolj dobro.
I hope it will work tomorrow.	Upam, da bo jutri uspelo.
This is simply wrong.	To je preprosto narobe.
I hope it helps.	Upam, da pomaga.
No, it didn't work.	Ne, ni uspelo.
I hope you never have to do this again.	Upam, da ti tega ne bo treba nikoli več storiti.
But I doubt it.	Vendar dvomim.
That's how you know.	Tako se ve.
She was above it all.	Bila je nad vsem tem.
No, it felt nice.	Ne, zdelo se je lepo.
It worked again.	Spet je uspelo.
I need to go out more.	Več moram iti ven.
No one here has played it.	Nihče tukaj je ni igral.
She was really something.	Bila je res nekaj.
I felt much better.	Počutil sem se veliko bolje.
Instead, you know what happened.	Namesto tega veš, kaj se je zgodilo.
If it goes wrong.	Če gre narobe.
You can too.	Lahko tudi ti.
It feels like home to me.	Meni se zdi kot doma.
You will get there.	Prišel boš tja.
I feel much better too.	Tudi jaz se počutim veliko bolje.
She knew he shouldn't.	Vedela je, da ne bi smel.
I really liked it.	Zelo mi je bilo všeč.
However, this may not always be the case.	Vendar morda ni vedno tako.
Nothing, nothing.	Nič nič .
He was on me.	Bil je na meni.
No, that would never happen.	Ne, to se ne bi nikoli zgodilo.
There's something you need to know.	Nekaj ​​moraš vedeti.
If he wanted to be angry, so be it.	Če je hotel biti jezen, naj bo tako.
That's a long time ago.	To je že dolgo nazaj.
I don't see how he could do that.	Ne razumem, kako bi lahko to storil.
This is absolutely true.	To je popolnoma res.
He loves you very much.	Zelo te ima rad.
What would you say.	Kaj bi rekel.
I just don't see how.	Samo ne vidim, kako.
Everyone loved it.	Vsem je bilo všeč.
He never said many things.	Nikoli ni rekel veliko stvari.
Let him have it.	Naj ga ima.
Yes, something was wrong.	Da, nekaj je bilo narobe.
I said.	rekel sem.
He can never do that here.	Tega tukaj nikoli ne more narediti.
There is nothing we can do.	Ne moremo narediti ničesar.
It's true.	Res je.
And may I always want more.	In naj si vedno želim več.
It could be what he did last night.	Lahko bi bilo to, kar je naredil sinoči.
Or maybe there isn't.	Ali pa ga morda ni.
He looked angry.	Videti je bil jezen.
I mean everything.	Mislim na vse.
It's like you're not here.	Kot da te ni tukaj.
He obviously did nothing wrong.	Očitno ni naredil nič narobe.
I need to make sure you're serious.	Prepričati se moram, da misliš resno.
I didn't hear anything.	Ničesar nisem slišal.
I taught them all.	Vse sem jih naučil.
She could be there for years.	Tam bi lahko bila leta.
I wish it wasn't.	Želim si, da ne bi bilo.
Maybe he wanted to.	Mogoče je hotel.
I actually felt pretty good.	Pravzaprav sem se počutil zelo dobro.
It's simple.	To je preprosto.
I didn't expect it.	Nisem pričakoval.
But something was wrong.	Vendar je bilo nekaj narobe.
But you had to do it this way.	Vendar ste morali narediti tako.
Sometimes both.	Včasih oba.
He hadn't had one in a while.	Že nekaj časa ga ni imel.
He left and left.	Odšel je in odšel.
Maybe that happened to me.	Mogoče se je to zgodilo meni.
I don't want to be without you.	Nočem biti brez tebe.
It may or may not exist.	Morda obstaja ali pa ne.
Yes, it's true.	Da, res je.
I would never find you.	Nikoli te ne bi našel.
She really liked him then.	Takrat ji je bil zelo všeč.
He is here this morning.	Danes zjutraj je tukaj.
And she likes it.	In všeč ji je.
Not that.	Ne temu.
Maybe even more.	Morda še bolj.
And that's not the case here.	In tukaj ni tako.
You should do that.	To bi morali storiti.
He died.	Umrl je.
No one seemed to be.	Zdelo se je, da nihče ni.
This is my baby.	To je moj otrok.
He did it himself.	To je naredil sam.
It also doesn't work.	Prav tako ne dela.
Now we know.	Zdaj vemo.
It's almost gone.	Skoraj ga že ni več.
He was my father.	Bil je moj oče.
Like yesterday.	Kot včeraj.
Very and obvious.	Zelo in očitno.
How it happened.	Kako se je to zgodilo.
I would like to know who the father was.	Želel bi vedeti, kdo je bil oče.
This does not appear to be the case.	Zdi se, da temu ni tako.
I didn't let her.	Nisem je pustil.
I did this a while back.	To sem naredil nekaj časa nazaj.
This is wrong.	To je narobe.
It would never happen.	Nikoli se ne bi zgodilo.
To do it again.	Da to storim še enkrat.
He always told me everything.	Vedno mi je vse povedal.
How did that work out?	Kako je to uspelo?
He lives there.	Živi tam.
She moved on.	Šla je naprej.
I want to be sure to hear it.	Želim biti prepričan, da ga bom slišal.
I like everything.	Vse mi je všeč.
And maybe it is.	In morda je.
But everything was possible.	A vse je bilo mogoče.
But that's okay.	Vendar je to v redu.
I said, okay.	Rekel sem, v redu.
Serious question for you.	Resno vprašanje za vas.
You are a person.	Ti si oseba.
That's more than we had.	To je več, kot smo imeli.
I never would.	Nikoli ne bi.
Yes, it was difficult.	Da, bilo je težko.
That wasn't a question.	To ni bilo vprašanje.
You're not for me.	Ne zame nisi.
Tell me what else needs to be done.	Povej mi, kaj je še treba narediti.
In fact, there was quite a bit more.	Pravzaprav ga je bilo še precej.
I'm going there now.	Zdaj grem tja.
We liked each other very much the other day too.	Tudi prejšnji dan sva si bila zelo všeč.
There is nothing more to do.	Nič več ni za narediti.
I asked him how long.	Vprašal sem ga, kako dolgo.
We don't know who they are.	Ne vemo, kdo so.
He did it for us.	To je naredil za nas.
This was a child who didn't want to be alone.	To je bil otrok, ki ni želel biti sam.
It must be time.	Mora biti čas.
We've all done it.	Vsi smo to storili.
It might be true.	Morda je res.
But you shouldn't be so sure.	Vendar ne bi smeli biti tako prepričani.
I didn't expect it.	Nisem pričakoval.
He called last night.	Sinoči je poklical.
I will sit and wait for you.	Sedel bom in te čakal.
I do not understand.	ne razumem.
And it seems likely that they will.	In zdi se verjetno, da bodo.
I was also working at the time.	Takrat sem tudi delal.
I know what he means.	Vem, kaj misli.
I will find you.	Našel te bom.
Too much work for me.	Zame preveč dela.
I'd rather not know.	Bolje, da ne vem.
I thought you would come alone.	Mislil sem, da boš prišel sam.
Instead, the unfortunately obvious should be stated.	Namesto tega je treba povedati žal očitno.
I would go after him.	Šel bi za njim.
Maybe just that.	Morda le to.
And you never will.	In nikoli ne boš.
They are here and that is enough.	Tukaj so in to je dovolj.
You almost had it then.	Takrat si ga skoraj imel.
But there was nothing to do.	Vendar tega ni bilo za storiti.
And tell them.	In jih povedati.
I'm fine anyway.	Tako ali tako sem dobro.
All she had to do was be who she was.	Vse, kar je morala narediti, je bilo to, kar je.
She said she would go no matter what.	Rekla je, da bo šla ne glede na vse.
Or maybe he just arrived.	Ali pa je morda pravkar prišel.
I think we both are.	Mislim, da sva oba.
No one called me back.	Nihče me ni poklical nazaj.
Surely that was simpler.	Zagotovo je bilo to bolj preprosto.
They were there and saw it happen.	Bili so tam in videli, da se je zgodilo.
I just know it is.	Samo vem, da je.
And maybe he had.	In morda ga je imel.
We are alone here.	Tukaj sva sama.
He wants to know what you did.	Želi vedeti, kaj si naredil.
I never learned how to do it.	Nikoli se nisem naučil, kako to narediti.
I've never seen that before.	Nikoli prej tega nisem videl.
He likes to be busy all the time.	Rad je ves čas zaposlen.
I never knew.	Nikoli nisem vedel.
You will not return to this house.	Ne boš se vrnil v to hišo.
But it seemed not.	A zdelo se je, da ni.
I would love to hear from you!.	Rad bi slišal od vas!.
It was a good game.	Bila je dobra igra.
Maybe it's true that there was nothing to do.	Mogoče je res, da ni bilo kaj narediti.
It's simple enough.	Je dovolj preprosto.
It wasn't too good.	Ni bilo preveč dobro.
Because she would, she knew.	Ker bi, je vedela.
I really wasn't.	Res nisem bil.
That's when it happened.	Takrat se je.
He didn't sit down.	Ni sedel.
He says he is busy.	Pravi, da je zaposlen.
He just asked for more money.	Kar tako je prosil za več denarja.
I really like it.	Res mi je všeč.
I'm going to ask you this real quick.	To te bom res hitro vprašal.
He spoke quickly.	Govoril je hitro.
That's all for today.	To je vse za danes.
Nothing is happening.	Nič se ne dogaja.
And maybe because.	In morda zato, ker.
There was no one to help me.	Nikogar ni bilo, ki bi mi pomagal.
Everything happened quickly.	Vse se je zgodilo hitro.
I tried to convince myself that he would.	Poskušal sem se prepričati, da bi mislil, da bo.
It wasn't a big deal to me.	Zame to ni bilo veliko.
It's not happening.	Ne dogaja se.
It's nothing like that.	To ni nič takega.
He won't be coming back.	Ne bo se več vrnil.
He told me not to worry, he would get it.	Rekel mi je, naj me ne zanima, dobil bo.
That was fine with me.	To mi je bilo v redu.
I was really surprised, like.	Bil sem res presenečen, kot.
We had those.	Te smo imeli.
Tell me what you like and don't like.	Povej mi, kaj ti je všeč in kaj ne.
Something seems wrong.	Nekaj ​​se zdi narobe.
The problem is the following.	Problem je naslednji.
You're doing much better.	Veliko bolje ti gre.
Nor should they.	Pa tudi ne bi smeli.
I feel like I have it now.	Počutim se, kot da imam to zdaj.
It is and will be forever.	Tako je in bo za vedno.
They will soon know.	Kmalu bodo vedeli.
Nothing more will happen to him.	Z njim se ne bo zgodilo nič več.
That time was soon to come.	Ta čas je kmalu prišel.
I am without him.	Brez njega sem.
Sometimes it seems like a lot of something.	Včasih se zdi, da je veliko nekaj.
But he is also my friend.	Je pa tudi moj prijatelj.
I'm going to work.	grem v službo.
Everyone would know it was only momentary.	Vsi bi vedeli, da je bilo le trenutno.
And it was also something she had always known.	In to je bilo tudi nekaj, kar je vedno vedela.
However, we can do better.	Vendar pa smo lahko boljši.
About almost everything.	O skoraj vsem.
When she was gone.	Ko je ni bilo več.
I knew nothing about being a father.	Nič nisem vedel o tem, da sem oče.
We might still be.	Morda smo še vedno.
And she will do it.	In to bo storila.
Maybe still.	Morda še vedno.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
Often they are not.	Pogosto niso.
For then and for now.	Za takrat in za zdaj.
I have a question for you.	Imam vprašanje za vas.
This seems to be fine.	Zdi se, da je to v redu.
We all are and always have been.	Vsi smo in vedno smo.
This one wasn't.	Ta ni bil.
This is not my life anymore.	To ni več moje življenje.
I want to see everything.	Želim videti vse.
I wish we were.	Želim si, da bi bili.
No one thought it would ever happen, but it did.	Nihče ni mislil, da se bo to kdaj zgodilo, a se je.
He wanted her again.	Želel jo je spet.
Surely she knew that.	Zagotovo je to vedela.
But no.	Vendar ne.
I wouldn't be here long enough.	Ne bi bil dovolj dolgo tukaj.
Not even once more.	Niti enkrat več.
What to do when you don't know what to do.	Kaj storiti, ko ne veš kaj bi.
And apparently it is.	In očitno je to.
I already told you that.	To sem ti že povedal.
She never went out.	Nikoli ni šla ven.
He felt good too.	Tudi on se je dobro počutil.
I never thought it would be this hard.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da bo tako težko.
And it wasn't much.	In ni bilo veliko.
You can't do everything when you're so tired.	Ne moreš delati vsega, ko si tako utrujen.
He's just a friend.	On je samo prijatelj.
I wanted so badly.	Tako zelo sem si želel.
It was just hard.	Bilo je preprosto težko.
Never back.	Nikoli nazaj.
Maybe I would.	Morda sem bi.
He didn't say that.	Tega ni rekel.
I have to leave.	Moram oditi.
Your own way and time.	Svoj način in čas.
It happened so fast.	Tako hitro se je zgodilo.
I felt a little better today.	Danes sem se počutil nekoliko bolje.
He likes to play.	Rad se igra.
I didn't have them.	Nisem jih imel.
Not without you.	Ne brez tebe.
This was not the case at all.	Temu sploh ni bilo tako.
It's hard to believe that the time has come and it has.	Težko je verjeti, da je prišel čas in prišel je.
Little did they know he would help so much.	Niso vedeli, da bo tako zelo pomagal.
Perhaps unlikely.	Morda malo verjetno.
I'm not mad.	Nisem jezen.
It's always been that way.	Vedno je bilo tako.
Which is absolutely true.	Kar je popolnoma res.
I almost forgot how.	Skoraj sem pozabil, kako.
Say it out.	Povej ven.
We will do that.	To bomo storili.
Here and now.	Tukaj in zdaj.
For me too.	Tudi zame.
You died yesterday.	Včeraj si umrl.
He had so much money.	Imel je toliko denarja.
I'll try to help.	Poskušal bom pomagati.
I didn't like it.	Ni mi bilo všeč.
Maybe you too.	Mogoče tudi ti.
She knew what he meant.	Vedela je, kaj misli.
And that was true enough.	In to je bilo dovolj res.
I have them.	Jaz jih imam.
He said they would.	Rekel je, da bodo.
There was hardly anyone.	Skoraj nikogar ni bilo.
They were right there.	Prav tam so bili.
This is much more serious.	To je veliko bolj resno.
I didn't know that at the time.	Tega takrat še nisem vedel.
But I'm not sure how to do it.	Vendar nisem prepričan, kako to storiti.
Everyone can do something.	Vsak lahko naredi nekaj.
I hope all is well with you.	Upam, da je s tabo vse v redu.
No one is sure.	Nihče ni prepričan.
Something was still wrong.	Še vedno je bilo nekaj narobe.
Right.	Saj res.
Nothing will ever be the same again.	Nič ne bo nikoli več tako, kot je bilo.
In fact, it has more.	Pravzaprav ima več.
He didn't even see.	Sploh ni videl.
It's me again.	To sem spet jaz.
She knew he would do something.	Vedela je, da bo nekaj naredil.
And there he was.	In tam je bil.
They will be needed now.	Zdaj jih bo treba.
You have to leave.	Moraš oditi.
Nobody asked him.	Nihče ga ni vprašal.
He knew about these things.	Vedel je za te stvari.
It exists with .	Obstaja z .
In fact, it very likely was.	Pravzaprav je zelo verjetno bilo.
I won't lose it again.	Ne bom ga več izgubil.
I tried to speak.	Poskušal sem govoriti.
Just a question.	Samo vprašanje.
All right.	Vse v redu.
I'm a busy man.	Sem zaposlen človek.
A lot has happened since then.	Veliko se je zgodilo od takrat do danes.
What do you think.	Kaj misliš.
You will get this.	To boš dobil.
I came here immediately and.	Takoj sem prišel sem in.
I wasn't there.	Nisem bil tam.
Not like it used to be.	Ne tako kot včasih.
That's good because we can't.	To je dobro, ker ne moremo.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Vendar se zdi, da temu ni tako.
I went back to it.	Vrnil sem se k temu.
Maybe it will be better in the morning.	Mogoče bo zjutraj bolje.
Difficult.	Težko.
It's always possible.	Vedno je mogoče.
It seemed not.	Zdelo se je, da ni.
I don't know if that was the case.	Ne vem, če je bilo tako.
You didn't come.	Nisi prišel.
From now on, we would be something other than ourselves.	Od zdaj naprej bi bili nekaj drugega kot sami.
I feel more.	Počutim se več.
This is simply not possible.	To preprosto ni mogoče.
I'm not surprised at all.	Niti malo nisem presenečen.
You better be.	Bolje, da si.
This may seem long.	To se morda zdi dolgo.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisem mogel verjeti.
You can every week.	Lahko vsak teden.
Just like she knew she didn't want that.	Tako kot je vedela, da tega ne želi.
I needed a little help.	Potreboval sem malo pomoči.
It's true.	Res je.
You already told me that.	To si mi že povedal.
Keep going.	Kar naprej.
It's a boy.	To je fant.
It will be here.	Tukaj bo.
He really knows his stuff!.	On res pozna svoje!.
Maybe that's what work is all about.	Mogoče je to tisto, kar je delo.
This has already happened once.	To se je že enkrat zgodilo.
More people know about it.	Več ljudi ve o tem.
And he got me.	In dobil me je.
Now we know why.	Zdaj vemo zakaj.
He was very good to me.	Bil je zelo dober do mene.
More than usual.	Več kot običajno.
She thought she needed help.	Zdelo se ji je, da potrebuje pomoč.
However, this is simply not true.	Vendar to preprosto ni res.
There's something about it.	Nekaj ​​je v tem.
Maybe a little.	Morda malo.
And that's right.	In tako je prav.
Not for anyone else.	Ne za koga drugega.
It's true.	Res je.
I like you.	Všeč sem si.
That would be the day I said enough.	To bi bil dan, ko bi rekel dovolj.
I know why you came here.	Vem, zakaj si prišel sem.
You didn't know.	Niste vedeli.
There were too many.	Bili so preveč.
He never admitted.	Nikoli ni priznal.
It's true that it could be me again.	Res je, da sem to lahko spet jaz.
But there is more, much more.	Vendar je še več, veliko več.
Sometimes not fast enough.	Včasih ne dovolj hitro.
I'm the only one here.	Jaz sem edini tukaj.
You gave her life.	Dal si ji življenje.
Let it go on.	Naj gre naprej.
Nobody asked them.	Nihče jih ni vprašal.
He acts like he doesn't know.	Dela se, kot da ne ve.
But it's better to know for sure.	Vendar je bolje vedeti zagotovo.
He can't help himself.	Ne zna si pomagati.
He can be alone.	Lahko je sam.
I like this .	To mi je všeč .
He forgot where he put it, that's all.	Pozabil je, kam ga je dal, to je vse.
I think it's better than that.	Mislim, da je boljši od tega.
Something wasn't right.	Nekaj ​​ni bilo v redu.
They're all we've ever had.	So vse, kar smo kdaj imeli.
With you there.	S tabo tam.
That might not.	To morda ne.
Just like my life.	Tako kot moje življenje.
And there were a lot of them.	In bilo jih je veliko.
That's what he wanted.	Tako je hotel.
I didn't think so.	Meni se ni zdelo tako.
Just you and me.	Samo ti in jaz.
I forgot that too.	Tudi to sem pozabil.
He still hadn't seen her.	Še vedno je ni videl.
Maybe it was.	Morda je bilo.
It's pretty simple.	Precej preprosto je.
We had what there was to eat.	Imeli smo, kar je bilo za jesti.
I'll have to go.	Moral bom iti.
As good as .	Tako dobro, kot .
I thought he did a good job.	Mislil sem, da je dobro opravil delo.
He knew tonight.	Nocoj je vedel.
Maybe they're gone.	Morda jih ni več.
Yes, it helps.	Da, pomaga.
I'm going out soon.	Kmalu grem ven.
And there wouldn't be.	In ne bi ga bilo.
He really was.	Res je bil.
Nothing ever.	Nič nikoli ne.
I wouldn't forget that.	Tega ne bi pozabil.
That you were the one.	Da si bil ti tisti.
And not the next day.	In ne naslednji dan.
The next one is coming soon.	Naslednji bo kmalu.
It will be good for me.	Zame bo dobro.
That really helps.	To res pomaga.
They all are.	Vsi so.
All day already.	Že ves dan.
It was tomorrow.	Bila je jutri.
It was very nice to see him back.	Zelo lepo ga je bilo videti nazaj.
I would like to have it back.	Rad bi ga dobil nazaj.
No no, no no.	Ne ne, ne da.
And you would know, right.	In vedel bi, prav.
We'll see what he can do.	Bomo videli, kaj lahko naredi.
Are you interested in learning more about us?	Vas zanima več o nas?.
She knew better now.	Zdaj je vedela bolje.
It actually happened to me once.	Pravzaprav se mi je enkrat zgodilo.
And not just an opportunity.	In ne le priložnost.
Because we are not alone.	Ker nismo sami.
And everything will get better.	In vse bo bolje.
No, he couldn't.	Ne, ni mogel.
We're still there.	Še vedno smo tam.
I wouldn't even ask.	Niti ne bi vprašal.
He's right.	Ima prav.
Instead, something is and something isn't.	Namesto tega nekaj je in nekaj ni.
Once, but not now.	Nekoč, vendar ne zdaj.
Now he is back home.	Zdaj je spet doma.
We will never have it.	Nikoli ga ne bomo imeli.
Not from us.	Ne od nas.
He was, but he didn't want to look like that.	Bil je, a ni hotel videti tako.
She would be there soon.	Kmalu bi bila tam.
Obviously, this is not always the case.	Očitno pa ni vedno tako.
It might look a little off.	Morda bo malo videti.
Because I don't think there is such a thing.	Ker mislim, da kaj takega ne obstaja.
It was just like every day.	Bilo je tako kot vsak dan.
The more he makes, the better.	Več ko jih naredi, bolje je.
He didn't want anything.	Ničesar ni hotel.
And if anyone else is having trouble with this.	In če ima še kdo težave s tem.
Unable to do so, he returned home.	Ker tega ni mogel, se je vrnil domov.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Očitno temu ni tako.
I wanted to stay here forever.	Hotel sem ostati tukaj za vedno.
That's the way it has to be.	Tako mora biti.
I do not understand.	Ne razumem.
So many things are not what they seem.	Toliko stvari ni to, kar se zdi.
He is surprised.	Presenečen je.
I want much more.	Želim veliko več.
Not just in the morning.	Ne samo zjutraj.
And you are there.	In ti si tam.
We have many years ahead of us.	Pred nami je veliko let.
Something happened to the house.	Nekaj ​​se je zgodilo s hišo.
It always comes.	Vedno pride.
This could not be done.	Tega ni bilo mogoče storiti.
I hope so.	Malo upam.
He didn't need to know, he told himself.	Ni mu bilo treba vedeti, si je rekel.
It comes when it comes.	Pride, ko pride.
I don't know how yet.	Ne vem še kako.
Nobody knows her.	Nihče je ne pozna.
If only everyone had these problems.	Ko bi le imeli vsi te težave.
You will never see us again.	Nikoli več nas ne boste videli.
That's why they're here.	Zato so tukaj.
I love anything and everything.	Všeč mi je vse in vse.
You had to do well.	Moral si dobro narediti.
That's not it.	To ni.
He didn't know, he wasn't sure.	Ni vedel, ni bil prepričan.
And it won't feel better right away.	In ne bo se takoj zdelo bolje.
Almost exactly so.	Skoraj popolnoma tako.
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni več.
Or maybe it was just him.	Ali pa je bil to samo on.
There was nothing in it.	V tem ni bilo ničesar.
My father was not at all surprised.	Moj oče ni bil prav nič presenečen.
Better yet, do nothing.	Še bolje, ne delati ničesar.
And maybe not.	In morda tudi ne.
Dad has to go.	Oče mora iti.
Maybe right.	Morda prav.
Sometimes it can be a little too much.	Včasih je lahko malo preveč.
I love feeling that way again.	Rad se spet počutim tako.
I only saw him once.	Videl sem ga samo enkrat.
John died the next day.	John je naslednji dan umrl.
I was tired of it.	Bil sem utrujen od tega.
I won't die.	Ne bom umrl.
Now it's true.	Zdaj je res.
Nobody did anything.	Nihče ni naredil ničesar.
I don't think so.	ne mislim.
I've wanted to do this for so long.	Tako dolgo sem si želel to narediti.
Maybe he didn't have one.	Mogoče ga ni imel.
I didn't say anything either.	Tudi jaz nisem rekel nič.
He usually feels better almost immediately.	Običajno se skoraj takoj počuti bolje.
And then it was.	In takrat je bilo.
He might ask me.	Morda me bo vprašal.
He says it's nothing.	Pravi, da to ni nič.
I always have something going on.	Vedno se mi nekaj dogaja.
It will always be that way.	Tako bo vedno.
Everything is very serious.	Vse je zelo resno.
He didn't die.	Ni umrl.
In fact, there aren't many at all.	Pravzaprav jih sploh ni veliko.
You have it.	Imaš ga.
I didn't hear anything.	Ničesar nisem slišal.
He almost never succeeded.	Skoraj nikoli mu ni uspelo.
It can't be right.	Ne more biti prav.
I probably never could.	Verjetno nikoli ne bi mogel.
It will be enough.	Bo dovolj.
I've seen them do it.	Videl sem jih pri tem.
Always, for everyone.	Vedno, za vse.
It's so hard to know for sure.	Tako težko je vedeti zagotovo.
You will know what to do.	Vedel boš, kaj storiti.
Don't come here.	Ne pride sem.
You were lucky then.	Takrat si imel srečo.
I'm still not sure it's okay.	Še vedno nisem prepričan, da je v redu.
Nice to see.	Lepo videti.
It was a good question.	Bilo je dobro vprašanje.
I wonder what is wrong.	Sprašujem se, kaj je narobe.
But hardly anyone called me.	Vendar me skoraj nihče ni poklical.
Maybe that will be enough.	Mogoče bo to dovolj.
I can not.	ne morem.
I was lucky last night.	Sinoči sem imel srečo.
You might have some work to do there.	Morda boste tam imeli kaj delati.
I'm here.	Tukaj sem.
He doesn't talk much because he can't.	Ne govori veliko, ker ne more.
What they had was time.	Kar so imeli, je bil čas.
Is it enough?	Ali je dovolj.
He said they weren't.	Rekel je, da niso.
Convinced.	Prepričan.
Everyone has it.	Vsak ga ima.
You were playing.	Igral si se.
Yesterday and today and tomorrow.	Včeraj in danes in jutri.
I still know where it is.	Še vedno vem, kje je.
He didn't expect to find anything.	Ni pričakoval, da bo kaj našel.
I used to do this every week.	Včasih sem to počel vsak teden.
Maybe it's something else.	Mogoče je kaj drugega.
On that note, they may have done just that.	Glede na to so morda storili prav to.
That's not everyone.	To niso vsi.
It's really fast.	Res je hitro.
I really like it.	Zelo mi je všeč.
That's really all.	To je res vse.
It has been a village ever since.	Od takrat je vas.
We went.	Šla sva.
I can't seem to do that.	Zdi se mi, da tega ne morem storiti.
I shouldn't know all this.	Vsega tega ne bi smel vedeti.
This will not happen here.	Pri nas se to ne bo zgodilo.
He had a good angle.	Imel je dober kot.
Now he begged.	Zdaj je prosil.
I liked her.	Všeč mi je bila.
I know it's true.	Vem, da je res.
This may not always be the case.	To morda ni vedno tako.
However, this is clearly not the case.	Vendar očitno ni tako.
That wasn't enough for me.	To mi ni bilo dovolj.
It has to.	Mora .
He didn't have time for that.	Za to ni imel časa.
I hope you stay.	Upam, da boš ostal.
He went out again.	Spet je šel ven.
Something more than obvious.	Nekaj ​​več kot očitno.
This is a really good thing.	To je res dobra stvar.
And all is not as it seems.	In ni vse tako, kot se zdi.
That's every day, too.	Tudi to je vsak dan.
I could see.	Lahko sem videl.
Not so the first time.	Prvič ne tako.
I've never seen it before.	Še nikoli ga nisem videl.
Even now I'm not so well.	Niti zdaj mi ni tako dobro.
He didn't hear anything.	Ničesar ni slišal.
It's that simple and that simple.	Tako preprosto je in tako preprosto.
It worked last night.	Sinoči je uspelo.
But if they haven't seen us yet, they will soon.	A če nas še niso videli, nas bodo kmalu.
Actually no, no, it isn't.	Pravzaprav ne, ne, ni.
I do not know how.	Ne vem kako.
He seemed fine with it.	Videti je bilo v redu s tem.
I left immediately.	Takoj sem odšel.
He always has to say that.	To mora vedno povedati.
I heard about it.	Slišal sem o tem.
This is often, but not always.	To je pogosto, vendar ne vedno.
You always are.	Vedno si.
I used to do this all the time as a kid.	Kot otrok sem to ves čas počel.
She didn't even know why she was here.	Sploh ni vedela, zakaj je tukaj.
I mean, maybe it's not what it used to be.	Mislim, morda ni več to, kar je bil nekoč.
It was something anyone could do.	To je bilo nekaj, kar je lahko naredil vsak.
We don't know what is what.	Ne vemo, kaj je kaj.
If it's him, it's him.	Če je on, je on.
You didn't speak.	Nisi govoril.
This can be very common.	To je lahko zelo pogosto.
Nobody seemed to want to do anything.	Videti je bilo, da nihče ne želi ničesar narediti.
He found it hard work.	Zdelo se mu je težko delo.
They will not be idle.	Ne bodo brez dela.
I had nothing to say.	Nisem imel kaj povedati.
More than life itself.	Več kot življenje samo.
We're sure that's not the case.	Prepričani smo, da ni tako.
Not now, maybe never again.	Ne zdaj, morda nikoli več.
I am your father.	Jaz sem tvoj oče.
He won't come back, my boy.	Ne bo se vrnil, moj fant.
No, maybe more.	Ne, morda bolj.
This has never happened to me before.	To se mi še nikoli ni zgodilo.
Fortunately, we have.	Na srečo imamo.
Once, just once.	Enkrat, samo enkrat.
He will play alone.	Igral bo sam.
I understand what you mean.	Razumem kaj misliš.
No one has found it yet.	Nihče ga še ni našel.
He told him.	Povedal mu je.
But nothing of the sort happened.	Vendar se ni zgodilo nič takega.
What you did was call.	Kar si naredil, si poklical.
I don't know why that would be.	Ne vem, zakaj bi bilo tako.
I decided enough was enough.	Odločil sem se, da je dovolj.
Neither do you.	Tudi ti ne.
And there it should be.	In tam naj bi bilo.
I think it worked.	Mislim, da je uspelo.
He will give her enough time.	Dal ji bo dovolj časa.
It was because of me.	To je bilo zaradi mene.
I will call to see if they are interested.	Bom poklical, da vidim, če jih zanima.
I wanted to know what to do.	Želel sem vedeti, kaj storiti.
This is going well.	To gre dobro.
They are not from this time.	Niso iz tega časa.
It is said.	Pravi pa se.
I don't know how to do it.	Ne vem, kako to narediti.
There are my thoughts.	Tam so moje misli.
I hope he never hears about it.	Upam, da ne bo nikoli slišal za to.
Very nice of you.	Zelo lepo od tebe.
We were together every day.	Vsak dan smo bili skupaj.
Someone was waiting for her.	Nekdo jo je čakal.
Or maybe it isn't.	Ali pa morda ni.
I had to see.	Moral sem videti.
This person is already with you.	Ta oseba je že pri vas.
It's simply a matter of time.	To je preprosto vprašanje časa.
There are still few of them.	Še vedno jih malo.
It was just time.	Samo čas je bil.
As always.	Kot vedno.
Very boyish.	Zelo fant.
Instead, no.	Namesto tega ne.
you are with me.	z mano si.
He would soon be gone.	Kmalu bi ga ne bilo več.
We didn't see him again.	Nismo ga več videli.
I hope we see some things.	Upam, da bomo videli nekaj stvari.
As it used to be.	Kot je včasih res bilo.
I wasn't sure what.	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj.
In fact, no one expected this to happen.	Pravzaprav nihče ni pričakoval, da se bo to zgodilo.
That's all he needs to know.	To je vse, kar mora vedeti.
We felt like it.	Nam se je.
I don't know about that.	Ne vem za to.
Really, I should go now.	Res, zdaj bi moral iti.
He couldn't do that to her.	Tega ji ni mogel storiti.
You don't always have to talk.	Ni vam treba vedno govoriti.
You should do something about it.	Nekaj ​​bi moral narediti glede tega.
That's when I saw her.	Takrat sem jo videl.
But it wasn't always like that.	Vendar ni bilo vedno tako.
I wouldn't have heard of it.	Ne bi slišal za to.
That was nice.	To je bilo lepo.
It's still here.	Še vedno je tukaj.
I can not see.	Ne vidim.
Maybe that was too obvious.	Mogoče je bilo to preveč očitno.
That's a lot of what it is.	To je veliko tega, kar je.
Just forward.	Samo naprej.
It's not that hard.	Ni tako težko.
But that's how he died.	Vendar je tako umrl.
I never met him.	Nikoli ga nisem srečal.
He looked surprised.	Videti je bil presenečen.
You love the book forever.	Knjigo imaš rad za vedno.
I think he is the right man for the job.	Mislim, da je pravi človek za to delo.
There's just nothing else out there.	Tam preprosto ni ničesar drugega.
I would tell her about it in the morning.	Zjutraj bi ji povedal o tem.
I have nothing more to say to you today.	Danes ti nimam več kaj povedati.
They had no money, no place to go.	Niso imeli denarja, niso imeli kam.
How right they were.	Kako prav so imeli.
Maybe right away.	Morda takoj.
But there is nothing wrong with that.	Vendar s tem ni nič narobe.
Apparently she wasn't.	Očitno pa ni bila.
That may or may not be the case.	To je lahko ali pa tudi ne.
No one is right.	Nihče ni pravi.
She knew what was there.	Vedela je, kaj je tam.
I know you are really busy.	Vem, da si res zaposlen.
sorry! 	žal!
Life is good.	Življenje je dobro.
The question is not whether it will happen.	Vprašanje ni, ali se bo to zgodilo.
Maybe he's serious.	Mogoče resno misli.
He didn't give me anything.	Nič mi ni dal.
So we were all together.	Tako smo bili vsi skupaj.
No one will go to her.	Nihče ji ne bo šel.
And what .	In kaj .
Now I have.	Zdaj imam.
They're already here.	So že tukaj.
However, this is not the case.	Vendar to ni tako.
But it's better than nothing.	Vendar je bolje kot nič.
And no, you weren't.	In ne, nisi bil.
I saw him.	Videl sem ga.
We know it happened.	Vemo, da se je zgodilo.
There was no more money.	Denarja ni bilo več.
They had nothing with me.	Pri meni niso imeli ničesar.
I'll tell him something.	Nekaj ​​mu bom povedal.
This really could be it.	To bi res lahko bilo to.
She knew he was good.	Vedela je, da je dober.
I was very angry.	Bil sem zelo jezen.
How much, no one can know.	Koliko, ne more nihče vedeti.
You told us.	Povedal si nam.
He told us this and much more.	To nam je povedal in še veliko več.
I would be angry.	Bil bi jezen.
Today was not that day.	Danes ni bil ta dan.
This is the way to do it.	To je način, kako to narediti.
And we saw that happen.	In videli smo, da se je to zgodilo.
It was in this place then.	Takrat je bilo na tem mestu.
No one will hear us.	Nihče nas ne bo slišal.
Only he knows what he did.	Samo on ve, kaj je storil.
I asked them not to.	Prosil sem jih, naj ne.
It always is and always will be.	Vedno je in vedno bo.
I wonder why she did that.	Sprašujem se, zakaj je to storila.
He might become a better person.	Morda bo postal boljši človek.
He was so good to us.	Bil je tako dober za nas.
Yes yes Yes.	Da da Da.
I could have been there.	Lahko bi bil tam.
It can be done.	Lahko se naredi.
How is this possible?	Kako je to mogoče?
This may not be what you want.	To morda ni tisto, kar želite.
We just won't.	Samo ne bomo.
He does this to everyone.	To počne vsem.
It usually is.	Običajno je tako.
We know he will win.	Vemo, da bo zmagal.
That's what it really looked like.	Tako je bilo res videti.
It's about me, my work and my life.	Gre za mene, moje delo in življenje.
i have a lot of them.	veliko jih imam.
I will help.	Pomagal bom.
That was very nice of you.	To je bilo zelo lepo od tebe.
I wouldn't be able to do it.	Meni ne bi uspelo.
I could have done much better.	Lahko bi naredil veliko bolje.
It looked like that wasn't going to happen for quite some time.	Zdelo se je, da se to še kar nekaj časa ne bo zgodilo.
But that wouldn't be easy.	A to ne bi bilo lahko.
Just a boy.	Samo fant.
It feels too much.	Preveč se počuti.
This has continued to be true throughout my life.	To je še naprej res vse moje življenje.
He didn't want to go.	Ni hotel, da gre.
But no one seems to be doing that.	Vendar se zdi, da tega nihče ne počne.
She didn't know if he was right or wrong.	Ni vedela, ali ima prav ali ne.
Except it was more than that.	Le da je bilo več kot to.
He needs this for us.	To potrebuje za nas.
He was obviously happy.	Očitno je bil vesel.
I would hardly say that now.	Težko bi zdaj to rekel.
I lost so much.	Toliko sem izgubil.
If not today, tomorrow.	Če ne danes, je jutri.
I could have.	Lahko bi imel.
He didn't have to.	Ni mu bilo treba.
And they didn't.	In niso.
It was already too much.	Bilo je že preveč.
This is very wrong.	To je zelo narobe.
You will tell him not to be afraid.	Rekel mu boš, naj se ne boji.
We still have a lot of work to do.	Moramo še veliko delati.
We all have them, there's nothing wrong with that.	Vsi jih imamo, s tem ni nič narobe.
You would see them in town.	Videli bi jih v mestu.
We liked it that way.	Tako nam je bilo všeč.
Nothing seems wrong.	Zdi se, da ni nič narobe.
That was wrong.	To je bilo narobe.
But we will know more tomorrow.	Več pa bomo vedeli jutri.
He plays at home.	Igra doma.
Few of them can swim.	Malo jih zna plavati.
Father wouldn't allow it.	Oče tega ne bi dovolil.
I promised.	Obljubil sem.
He called instead.	Namesto tega je poklical.
I'm like that.	Jaz sem tako.
How did he say that.	Kako je to rekel.
I don't mean that.	Ne mislim tega.
He didn't need them.	Ni jih potreboval.
It will happen tonight too.	Zgodilo se bo tudi nocoj.
They had a reason for it.	Imeli so razlog za to.
What he always wanted.	Kar si je vedno želel.
I don't really know.	Pravzaprav ne vem.
I wanted to be something too.	Tudi jaz sem želel biti nekaj.
They are gone.	Ni jih več.
I actually didn't like them too much.	Pravzaprav mi niso bili preveč všeč.
I want you like you want me.	Želim si te tako kot ti mene.
I think he was tired.	Mislim, da je bil utrujen.
There was a reason for that.	Za to je bil razlog.
That's what he told me.	Tako mi je povedal.
It's like either you or me.	To je kot ali ti ali jaz.
You should have known something was wrong even then.	Že takrat bi morali vedeti, da je nekaj narobe.
Someone has to be.	Nekdo mora biti.
This one could wait.	Ta bi lahko čakal.
You were human when all this happened.	Bil si človek, ko se je vse to zgodilo.
It happened quickly.	Zgodilo se je hitro.
Too much time.	Preveč časa.
It has to be what it is.	Mora biti to, kar je.
He was everything a boy should be.	Bil je vse, kar mora biti fant.
You don't know anything.	Nič ne veš.
He's your friend.	Je tvoj prijatelj.
The car is gone.	Avto ni več.
You will get yours.	Dobil boš svoje.
He was working that day.	Tisti dan je delal.
Not from anyone, actually.	Pravzaprav ne od nikogar.
But I'm lucky.	Imam pa srečo.
I am employed here.	tukaj sem zaposlen.
It won't be easy and it might not be pretty.	Ne bo lahko in morda ne bo lepo.
Everyone has their own way.	Vsak je po svoje.
He can't go out.	Ne more ven.
But he liked it.	Vendar mu je bilo všeč.
Maybe it was the father.	Mogoče je bil oče.
This should be the right time.	To bi moral biti pravi čas.
There seem to be more every week.	Zdi se, da jih je vsak teden več.
To .	Da bi .
I wouldn't say that now.	Zdaj tega ne bi rekel.
It was a good opportunity.	Bila je dobra priložnost.
There was very little time to do anything.	Bilo je zelo malo časa, da bi nekaj naredili.
In the morning she was gone.	Zjutraj je ni bilo več.
I'm so glad you didn't.	Tako sem vesel, da nisi.
This one had too much.	Ta je imel preveč.
That's what they're for.	Za to so.
Obviously there's nothing you can do now.	Očitno zdaj ne moreš storiti ničesar.
He had it.	Imel ga je.
And maybe he was right.	In morda je imel prav.
That's not the case here.	Tega tukaj ni.
And he lost me.	In izgubil me je.
Not then we didn't.	Ne takrat nismo.
I'll be fine.	V redu bom.
Nobody is alone.	Nihče ni sam.
I'll tell you this.	To ti bom povedal.
That wasn't true.	To ni bilo res.
He was good at it.	Bil je dober v tem.
I won't wait that long.	Ne bom čakal tako dolgo.
You know he couldn't.	Veš, da ni mogel.
I almost didn't make it.	Skoraj nisem prišel.
You will have to do something more.	Moral boš narediti nekaj več.
Not this one either.	Tudi ta ne.
Back and forth.	Naprej in nazaj.
There's nobody there.	Tam ni nikogar.
We would.	Mi bi .
If not, I'd never know.	Če ne, ne bi nikoli vedel.
I'm a good person.	Jaz sem dober človek.
Man, you know that.	Človek, veš to.
I've never heard them.	Nikoli jih nisem slišal.
But we're not all in this together.	Vendar nismo vsi skupaj v tem.
She may never be alone.	Sama morda nikoli ne bo.
He never came.	Nikoli ni prišel.
He did more work for us.	Za nas je naredil več dela.
This one is behind us.	Ta je za nami.
And there he met her.	In tam jo je srečal.
You chose to be here.	Ti si se odločil biti tukaj.
I'm sure it's just that.	Prepričan sem, da je samo to.
I feel better.	Jaz se počutim bolje.
He was always there for me.	Vedno je bil tam zame.
Came and went, came and went.	Prišel in odšel, prišel in odšel.
Everything was so beautiful.	Vse je bilo tako lepo.
He didn't want her to know that he knew.	Ni želel, da bi vedela, da ve.
he said.	rekel je.
And it has.	In ima.
There could be more.	Lahko bi jih bilo več.
I hope that doesn't happen to me.	Upam, da se to ne bo zgodilo meni.
We can have it all.	Lahko imamo vse.
None of this was true.	Nič od tega ni bilo res.
She wasn't alone.	Ni bila sama.
She knew that.	Vedela je to.
He's not there.	Ni ga tam.
You should come and tell me.	Moral bi priti in mi povedati.
It was something we did a lot.	To je bilo nekaj, kar smo naredili veliko.
I wish he.	Želim si, da on.
You'll know when it comes.	Vedeli boste, ko pride.
And my father.	In moj oče.
He could have, but he didn't want to.	Lahko bi, a ni hotel.
Maybe there isn't one at all.	Morda ga sploh ni.
It was way too much.	Bilo je veliko preveč.
You knew it, you always knew it.	To si vedel, vedno si vedel.
He was a good person.	Bil je dobra oseba.
But that was almost not enough.	A to skoraj ni bilo dovolj.
We're having a party.	Imamo zabavo.
I can't seem to get it.	Zdi se, da tega ne razumem.
Better than all right.	Bolje kot vse v redu.
You were so good tonight.	Nocoj si bil tako dober.
I want to come home.	Želim priti domov.
It's fine for a while.	Za nekaj časa je v redu.
He has to be the one.	On mora biti tisti.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
We have everything.	Imamo vse.
Everything is fine.	Vse je v redu.
But that didn't happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
They were all about me.	Vsi so bili o meni.
I know that for sure.	To vem zagotovo.
And he knew it too.	In tudi on je to vedel.
That's not it.	To ni to.
He couldn't help it.	Ni si mogel pomagati.
But not the other part.	Drugega dela pa ne.
He couldn't know anything about it.	Nič ni mogel vedeti o tem.
And he must know what they were.	In mora vedeti, kaj so bili.
It still feels good.	Še vedno se počuti dobro.
There aren't many.	Veliko jih ni.
She should know better, she really should.	Morala bi vedeti bolje, res bi morala.
I have a book like that too.	Tudi jaz imam tako knjigo.
Not there yet.	Še ne tam.
We would have another.	Imeli bi drugega.
But not anymore.	Vendar ne več.
However, this is a problem.	Vendar je to problem.
I feel so alone.	Počutim se tako sam.
Maybe a friend will come too.	Morda pride tudi prijatelj.
He heard it as a child.	Slišal ga je kot otrok.
You're not there.	Ni te tam.
You are what you can be.	Ti si to, kar si lahko.
However, there is a possibility.	Vendar pa obstaja možnost.
However, that doesn't seem to be the case.	Vendar se zdi, da ni tako.
I could never.	Nikoli ne bi mogel.
We had nothing to do with it.	S tem nismo imeli nič.
It is for me.	Zame je.
But he didn't ask, he just waited.	A ni vprašal, samo čakal je.
I have my time again.	Spet imam svoj čas.
And it seems she's not alone.	In zdi se, da ni sama.
I never thought this would happen.	Nikoli si nisem mislil, da se bo to zgodilo.
I mean, it is.	Se pravi, je.
It's daytime again.	Spet je dan.
She went out.	Šla je ven.
I was good at it.	Bil sem dober v tem.
Keep it up.	Kar tako naprej.
It can be a really good thing for kids.	Za otroke je lahko res dobra stvar.
That's all.	To je vse.
Yes, it's true.	Da, res je.
Because if it is.	Ker če je.
I have never seen myself like this.	Še nikoli se nisem videl takega.
You are absolutely right about that.	Imaš popolnoma prav glede tega.
But we already know that.	Vendar to že vemo.
But he was quite tired all day.	Je pa bil ves dan precej utrujen.
Not so fast.	Ne tako hitro.
Okay, okay, very good.	V redu, v redu, zelo dobro.
That was yesterday and this is today.	To je bilo včeraj, to pa je danes.
He did it for me once.	Enkrat je to naredil zame.
He sat down again.	Spet je sedel.
And they are.	In so.
He's seen enough of this.	Dovolj je videl tega.
I thought so too.	Tudi jaz sem tako mislil.
I don't want to see him tonight.	Nočem ga videti nocoj.
You don't think that's good.	To se ti ne zdi dobro.
Lots of people there.	Veliko ljudi tam.
He saw things.	Videl je stvari.
Do not know.	Ne ve.
Just like myself.	Tako kot sam.
And here.	In tukaj.
It's like he never was.	Kot da nikoli ni bil.
Someone will tell you that.	To vam bo kdo povedal.
You won't tell me.	Ne boš mi povedal.
I mean, that's a lot.	Mislim, to je veliko.
And now he moved on.	In zdaj je šel naprej.
He's seen it all.	Vse je videl.
For everything they've done.	Za vse, kar so storili.
I became very good at it.	Postal sem zelo dober v tem.
Please trouble.	Prosim za težave.
But I could get lucky.	Lahko pa bi imel srečo.
I would love to hear from you.	Rad bi slišal od vas.
We have to do this.	To moramo narediti.
And maybe sometimes they are.	In morda včasih tudi so.
I got back in the car.	Vrnil sem se v avto.
I really want to see and hear you play.	Zelo si želim, da bi te videl in slišal igrati.
We all are.	Vsi smo.
I was glad to hear that.	Bil sem vesel, da sem to slišal.
She is so good.	Tako dobra je.
I was so surprised to see this.	Bil sem tako presenečen, ko sem to videl.
But even this is not as simple as it looks.	A tudi to ni tako preprosto, kot je videti.
I do not know you.	ne poznam te.
It's obvious you've moved on.	Očitno je, da si šel naprej.
If they did, my money was on us.	Če so, je bil moj denar za nas.
We just are.	Samo smo.
Everything was very simple.	Vse je bilo zelo preprosto.
Because you are what we are not.	Ker ste tisto, kar mi nismo.
Really, that simple.	Res, tako preprosto.
I still have this problem.	Še vedno imam ta problem.
And that is .	In to je .
I'll be fine.	V redu bom.
And last week.	In prejšnji teden.
I saw him tonight.	Videl sem ga nocoj.
Maybe they will.	Mogoče bodo.
He thought it would.	Mislil je, da bo.
It's that simple for me.	Zame je tako preprosto.
He doesn't seem to need to speak.	Zdi se, da mu ni treba govoriti.
I was happy about that.	Tega sem bil vesel.
There were many of them.	Veliko jih je bilo.
It was the only thing, he was sure.	To je bila edina stvar, je bil prepričan.
I thought it was probably not too likely.	Zdelo se mi je, da verjetno ni preveč verjetno.
They were never idle.	Nikoli niso bili brez dela.
My father too.	Tudi moj oče.
It might already be there.	Morda je že tam.
I couldn't do that now.	Zdaj tega ne bi mogel storiti.
Not for everyone.	Ne za vse.
That would be it.	Tako bi bilo.
I shouldn't even be here.	Sploh ne bi smel biti tukaj.
I've never heard of you.	Nikoli nisem slišal zate.
He liked the car.	Všeč mu je bil avto.
You never know!.	Nikoli ne veš!.
We wouldn't have made it anyway.	Tako ali tako nam ne bi uspelo.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Lahko je počel, kar je hotel.
But nothing was simply like that.	A nič ni bilo preprosto tako.
Both today and tomorrow will be nice.	Tako danes kot jutri bo lepo.
I'm doing pretty well.	Kar dobro mi gre.
It doesn't always exist.	Ne obstaja vedno.
He didn't have to.	Ni mu bilo treba.
I never, ever want to see them.	Nikoli, nikoli jih nočem videti.
I'm glad you called.	Vesel sem, da si poklical.
He sat down.	Sedel je.
After that, my time is all mine.	Po tem je moj čas samo moj.
It's money, money, money.	To je denar, denar, denar.
I'd love to see you there!.	Rad bi te videl tam!.
I wish someone here could help me.	Želim si, da bi mi kdo tukaj lahko pomagal.
I do not understand why.	Ne razumem zakaj.
It might not.	Morda ne bo.
He doesn't know how right he is.	Ne ve, kako prav ima.
He didn't want you.	Ni te hotel.
All thoughts are my own.	Vse misli so moje.
Sometimes he could see it too.	Včasih je to lahko videl tudi on.
We always are and always will be.	Vedno smo in vedno bomo.
Probably not enough.	Verjetno ne dovolj.
There's always someone.	Vedno je nekdo.
She had to leave.	Morala je oditi.
It was nice too.	Bilo je tudi lepo.
The question is where and how.	Vprašanje je kje in kako.
You won't work.	Ne boš delal.
Seriously, a must buy.	Resno, treba kupiti.
Before him.	Pred njim.
Not everyone is.	Niso vsi.
Today is .	Danes je .
A few days.	Nekaj ​​dni.
Maybe that's just what he's saying.	Morda samo to pravi.
Maybe just angry.	Morda samo jezen.
I prefer long.	Raje imam dolgo.
He didn't know what to think.	Ni vedel, kaj naj si misli.
Somebody said it could be, you know.	Nekdo je rekel, da bi lahko bil, veš.
It was really nice.	Res je bilo lepo.
Everything was still there.	Vse je bilo še tam.
Wrong was right.	Narobe je bilo prav.
You always thought there would be more time.	Vedno si mislil, da bo več časa.
A good teacher.	Dober učitelj.
Because you're here.	Ker tukaj si.
And that's what he wants for all of us.	In to je tisto, kar želi za vse nas.
This may or may not be true.	To je lahko res ali pa ne.
It's really hard sometimes.	Res je včasih res težko.
He obviously wasn't feeling well.	Očitno se ni počutil dobro.
He really won't say.	Res ne bo rekel.
And so it should be.	In tako mora biti.
It could be.	Lahko bi tudi bil.
You are life itself to me.	Zame si življenje samo.
They did everything.	Naredili so vse.
I was always ready.	Vedno sem bil pripravljen.
The thing wouldn't work.	Stvar ne bi šla.
Obviously I don't want to do that.	Očitno tega ne želim storiti.
With something.	Z nekaj.
I thought you might be interested.	Mislil sem, da te morda zanima.
She said she didn't.	Rekla je, da ni.
.	.
I was the good one.	Jaz sem bil tisti dober.
It's not difficult.	Ni težko.
Maybe he'll never call me again.	Mogoče me ne bo nikoli več poklical.
But it won't be easy.	A to ne bo preprosto.
He said it was mine.	Rekel je, da je moj.
I can't help it now.	Zdaj si ne morem pomagati.
They are here for you and me.	Tukaj so zate in zame.
He knew where my father was.	Vedel je, kje je moj oče.
Fortunately, it worked.	Na srečo je uspelo.
I'm glad you're here.	Vesel sem, da si tukaj.
The question is here.	Vprašanje je tukaj.
That's long enough.	To je dovolj dolgo.
He always did.	Vedno je to storil.
He will never see her again.	Nikoli več je ne bo videl.
We didn't have anyone.	Nikogar nismo imeli.
He will return to work there.	Tam se bo vrnil na delo.
But it could have been something else.	Lahko pa je bilo kaj drugega.
He doesn't want to play with me.	Noče se igrati z mano.
I was there to see.	Bil sem tam, da bi videl.
He liked it very much.	Zelo mu je bilo všeč.
Boy, this is the one you want.	Fant, to je tisti, ki ga želiš.
I certainly wouldn't.	Zagotovo ne bi.
Nothing there either.	Tudi tam nič.
I worked and worked.	Delal sem in delal.
The man saw him.	Človek ga je videl.
It took me a while to get started.	Potreboval sem nekaj časa, da sem začel.
We might make it.	Morda nam bo uspelo.
No one would know it was us.	Nihče ne bi vedel, da smo mi.
I better move on.	Bolje, da grem naprej.
Maybe he couldn't either.	Morda tudi ne bi mogel.
I have a little of it.	Malo ga imam.
As he always did.	Kot je vedno počel.
Not always okay.	Ne vedno v redu.
He has difficulty speaking.	Težko govori.
That he doesn't come home.	Da ne pride domov.
Too much.	Preveč.
This may help you.	To vam lahko pomaga.
So far so good.	Do zdaj je bilo zelo dobro.
And not for the first time.	In ne prvič.
Something had to be done, and quickly.	Nekaj ​​je bilo treba narediti, in to hitro.
I needed some serious help.	Potreboval sem resno pomoč.
He wasn't in town now.	Zdaj ga ni bilo v mestu.
I wasn't sorry.	Ni mi bilo žal.
I mean, he can't help it.	Mislim, ne more si pomagati.
It's really fine.	Res je v redu.
It didn't feel right.	Ni se mi zdelo prav.
It will be very difficult for me.	Zelo težko mi bo.
Sometimes, a lot.	Včasih, veliko.
I can see them like it was yesterday.	Vidim jih, kot bi bilo včeraj.
I just want to say.	Samo želim povedati.
As you said.	Kot si rekla.
I couldn't help it.	Nisem si mogel pomagati.
I have hardly heard from him since.	Od takrat ga skoraj nisem slišal.
And why now?	In zakaj zdaj.
It must work well.	Mora delati dobro.
No one seems to know what happened.	Zdi se, da nihče ne ve, kaj se je zgodilo.
Just this one.	Samo ta.
It is what it is not.	Je tisto, kar ni.
More needs to be done.	Še več je treba narediti.
There is only this.	Obstaja samo to.
So and so.	Tako in tako.
I just need to know where they are.	Samo vedeti moram, kje so.
I've never worked here.	Nikoli nisem delal tukaj.
Now he saw it.	Zdaj ga je videl.
That's what he does.	To počne.
Why could that be?	Zakaj bi to lahko bilo?
We have to do it now.	To moramo storiti zdaj.
It's very early.	Zelo zgodaj je.
Not just me, everyone.	Pa ne samo jaz, vsi.
It's hard to talk.	Težko je govoriti.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
You did it yourself.	Sam si si to naredil.
Who would have thought.	Kdo bi si mislil.
Do what you think is right.	Naredi, kar se ti zdi prav.
Sometimes he has to come out to play.	Včasih mora priti ven, da se igra.
And it didn't.	In ni.
Because you have so much money.	Ker imaš toliko denarja.
.	.
Money isn't everything.	Denar ni vse.
You will be convinced.	Prepričani boste.
I think we all know that.	Mislim, da to vsi vemo.
I'm pretty sure that's it.	Prepričan sem, da je to to.
I would like to know.	rad bi vedel.
I will ask her about it.	Jo bom vprašal o tem.
That seems possible too.	Tudi to se zdi mogoče.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
You also know that you are not a person.	Veš tudi, da nisi oseba.
You could also .	Lahko bi tudi .
A little more than usual.	Nekoliko več kot običajno.
Or you don't have to.	Ali pa vam ni treba.
It's not ok.	Ni v redu.
This is really very nice.	To je res zelo lepo.
Now that's gone.	Zdaj tega ni več.
A little like life, really.	Res malo kot življenje.
You love it as much as I do.	Všeč ti je tako kot jaz.
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
That would be a problem.	To bi bil problem.
He's doing so well.	Tako dobro mu gre.
It always is.	Vedno je.
I don't feel that way anymore.	Ne počutim se več tako.
You might as well.	Prav tako bi lahko.
Okay, okay, go ahead.	V redu, v redu, kar naprej.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.	Ne morem vam povedati ničesar, kar ne veste.
It's always been that way.	Vedno je bilo tako.
You knew you couldn't.	Vedel si, da ne moreš.
And now he has come.	In zdaj je prišel.
But it wasn't always like that.	Vendar ni bilo vedno tako.
He doesn't want to come home with me.	Noče z mano domov.
Please, she said.	Prosim, je rekla.
He was still angry.	Še vedno je bil jezen.
And it could not be done.	In tega ni bilo mogoče storiti.
It's never been like this before.	Še nikoli ni bilo tako.
It's you and me.	To sva ti in jaz.
Not that it happened to me.	Ne, da se je to zgodilo meni.
There was nothing yesterday.	Včeraj ni bilo nič.
But this was not the case.	Temu pa ni bilo tako.
This is no longer the case.	Temu ni več tako.
Nobody called me.	Nihče me ni poklical.
I just started.	Pravkar sem začel.
There was something wrong with what happened.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe s tem, kar se je zgodilo.
They probably never will.	Verjetno nikoli ne bodo.
In fact, it was.	Pravzaprav je bilo tako.
Almost all the time, actually.	Pravzaprav skoraj ves čas.
As if nothing happened.	Kot da se ni nič zgodilo.
Perhaps he also expected as much.	Morda je tudi on toliko pričakoval.
Not like they were together.	Ne tako, kot sta bila skupaj.
Make it better.	Naj bo bolje.
I doubt that a bit.	Malo dvomim o tem.
This has happened to me before.	To se mi je že zgodilo.
I had.	Imel sem.
No one should do that.	Nihče ne bi smel tega narediti.
And he was better.	In bil je boljši.
I'm not mad about these things.	Nisem jezen na te stvari.
But that's not all.	To pa še ni vse.
He says he has it.	Pravi, da ga ima.
And that was a very good thing.	In to je bila zelo dobra stvar.
He said what he thought.	Povedal je, kar je mislil.
But no one has managed to do this yet.	A tega še nikomur ni uspelo.
And so it is now.	In tako je zdaj to.
He needs to see where he is.	Mora videti, kje je.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
We were here this morning.	Danes zjutraj smo bili tukaj.
So, so, so good.	Tako, tako, tako dobro.
I wonder what he's up to.	Sprašujem se, kaj namerava.
And it never will be.	In nikoli ga ne bo.
Everything is fine there.	Tam je vse v redu.
He is never afraid of anything.	Nikoli se ničesar ne boji.
I didn't lose her.	Nisem je izgubil.
That's who he was.	To je kdo je bil.
I just have a few things to do.	Narediti moram le nekaj stvari.
You meant so well.	Tako dobro si mislil.
I could help him.	Lahko bi mu pomagal.
Unfortunately, this is no longer enough.	Žal to ni več dovolj.
I'm not good at all.	Sploh nisem dober.
So back and forth.	Tako naprej in nazaj.
We went to dinner.	Šla sva na večerjo.
If you can.	Če lahko.
That could be nice.	To bi lahko bilo lepo.
That way you would know for sure.	Tako bi zagotovo vedeli.
I'm going for it'.	Grem za to'.
And it won't.	In ne bo.
I don't like it at all.	Sploh mi ni všeč.
I always feel good.	Vedno se počutim dobro.
Yes, but not always.	Da, vendar ne vedno.
He knew nothing.	Nič ni vedel.
I'm always surprised.	Vedno sem presenečen.
I felt very good.	Počutil sem se zelo dobro.
They had to be almost there.	Morali so biti skoraj tam.
He seems to have succeeded.	Zdi se, da mu je uspelo.
In fact, something was very wrong.	Pravzaprav je bilo nekaj zelo narobe.
Is this .	Je to .
All life.	Vse življenje.
Now that .	Zdaj ko .
I'm always ready.	Vedno sem pripravljen.
I don't really care too much.	Pravzaprav me ne zanima preveč.
I was starting to like this kid.	Ta otrok mi je bil začel všeč.
He begged for his life.	Prosil je za svoje življenje.
When he died it was a matter of money.	Ko je umrl, je bilo vprašanje denarja.
I hope it will continue to be so.	Upam, da bo tako še naprej.
And yet it felt so right.	Pa vendar se je zdelo tako prav.
However, this is often not the case.	Vendar pogosto ni tako.
He managed to do that.	To mu je uspelo.
I will do that.	To bom naredil.
I found a way to do it.	Našel sem način za to.
I called home.	Poklical sem domov.
We'll be there tonight.	Nocoj bomo tam.
Today we know better.	Danes vemo bolje.
I really would.	Res bi.
It just will.	Samo bo.
It was all very nice indeed.	Vse skupaj je bilo res zelo lepo.
They are always there for you.	Vedno so tam za vas.
She had to do something, and fast.	Nekaj ​​je morala narediti, in to hitro.
You are no longer what you were.	Nisi več to, kar si bil.
And now we know we can.	In zdaj vemo, da lahko.
But nobody is right about everything.	Nihče pa nima prav glede vsega.
He's just doing his thing.	Samo dela svoje.
They've always been here.	Vedno so bili tukaj.
I played alone.	Igral sem sam.
He said no.	Rekel je ne.
And it's good.	In je dobro.
We haven't and we won't.	Nismo in ne bomo.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
Maybe sometimes not even that.	Morda včasih niti to ne.
He needs you now.	Potrebuje te zdaj.
Talked about it.	Govoril o tem.
Know.	Veš.
That's what makes it so hard.	Zaradi tega je tako težko.
That was nice.	To je bilo lepo.
It doesn't do anything to you.	Nič ti ne naredi.
I do not understand.	Ne razumem.
And now, here you are.	In zdaj, tukaj ste.
Don't talk anymore.	Ne govori več.
You can't be together all the time.	Ne moreš biti ves čas skupaj.
The day that is almost upon him.	Dan, ki je skoraj pred njim.
No, you are not alone.	Ne, niste sami.
I won't do anything.	Nič ne bom naredil.
Which no one was.	Kar nihče ni bil.
I didn't like it at all.	Sploh mi ni bilo všeč.
Just for fun.	Samo za zabavo.
Let me have them.	Naj jih imam.
And it doesn't happen all the time.	In to se ne dogaja ves čas.
We don't know if that ever happened.	Ne vemo, ali se je to kdaj zgodilo.
And you shouldn't.	In ne bi smeli.
But not immediately.	Vendar ne takoj.
But we had it there.	Vendar smo ga imeli tam.
I'm not good.	Nisem dober.
I just want to be alone.	Samo želim biti sam.
It's good to be back.	Dobro je biti nazaj.
I don't know what could be wrong.	Ne vem, kaj bi lahko bilo narobe.
Who can do this to me?	Kdo mi lahko to naredi?
We knew this was happening.	Vedeli smo, da se to dogaja.
I don't want to play anymore today.	Danes se nočem več igrati.
I feel like it's still here.	Počutim se, kot da je še vedno tukaj.
Did something happen to me?	Ali se mi je kaj zgodilo.
And not once.	In ne enkrat.
I'll tell you something.	Nekaj ​​ti bom povedal.
How could he not know that, that's how it was.	Kako ne bi vedel tega, tako je bilo.
You should know too.	Tudi ti bi moral vedeti.
He probably didn't even buy it himself.	Verjetno tega sam niti ni kupil.
We've all been there and probably will be there again.	Vsi smo bili tam in verjetno bomo še tam.
i am a child	jaz sem otrok
And you probably can.	In verjetno lahko.
I never knew it could be this good.	Nikoli nisem vedel, da je lahko tako dobro.
This is something that is difficult to do.	To je nekaj, kar je težko narediti.
I am really interested in the work.	Delo me res zanima.
And yet it is not so.	In vendar ni tako.
I would be so angry.	Bil bi tako jezen.
And she liked me.	In jaz sem ji bila všeč.
You made them.	Ti si jih naredil.
It can be more.	Lahko je več.
The question itself is simple.	Samo vprašanje je preprosto.
I was happy about that.	Bil sem vesel tega.
I'm not sure it ever will.	Nisem prepričan, da bo kdaj.
The man knows me a little.	Človek me malo pozna.
She knew she didn't want that.	Vedela je, da tega ne želi.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
We were next.	Mi smo bili naslednji.
I know you didn't die.	Vem, da nisi umrl.
I better go.	Bolje, da grem.
And very wrong.	In zelo narobe.
I gave her that.	To sem ji dal.
Everyone will know you did it.	Vsi bodo vedeli, da si to storil.
That's all you know.	To je vse kar veš.
He seems to be able to speak.	Zdi se, da lahko govori.
We know it happened.	Vemo, da se je zgodilo.
In fact, there is nothing.	Pravzaprav nič ni.
Well, she wasn't.	Pa ni bila.
She really doesn't have to work.	Saj ji res ni treba delati.
It was enough that it was.	Dovolj je bilo, da je.
It was what you had to do.	To je bilo tisto, kar si moral narediti.
I saw them.	Videl sem jih.
Could .	Lahko bi .
I came to speak to him.	Prišel sem, da bi govoril z njim.
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
Maybe it will be okay.	Mogoče bo v redu.
Was there anyone else there.	Ali je bil tam še kdo.
I'll tell him.	Povedal mu bom.
But you might not succeed.	Morda pa vam ne bo uspelo.
Neither is he.	Niti on ni.
But he didn't come to school today.	Danes pa ni prišel v šolo.
I know this doesn't help.	Vem, da to nič ne pomaga.
She should do something about it.	Nekaj ​​bi morala narediti glede tega.
He was waiting for me in the morning.	Zjutraj me je čakal.
I realized something.	Nekaj ​​sem spoznal.
It seems to be helping us.	Zdi se, da nam pomaga.
Well, we succeeded.	Pa nam je uspelo.
I didn't say anything else.	Nič drugega nisem rekel.
That's not the case at all.	To sploh ni tako.
And that's about it.	In gre za to.
They are not like us.	Niso kot mi.
But I like that.	To mi je pa všeč.
It's true.	Res je.
He looked a little surprised or angry.	Videti je bil nekoliko presenečen ali jezen.
You want to buy it.	Želite ga kupiti.
No one knows where he is.	Nihče ne ve, kje je.
You should see them.	Moral bi jih videti.
But there seemed to be more to say.	A zdelo se je, da je treba povedati še več.
This is always possible for you.	To je za vas vedno mogoče.
I should have told you.	Moral bi ti povedati.
That's a lot of time.	To je veliko časa.
I was ready to tell you everything.	Pripravljen sem ti bil povedati vse.
Just here.	Samo tukaj.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.	Žal temu ni tako.
Do not speak! 	Ne govori!
.	.
I didn't know what else to say.	Nisem vedel ničesar drugega povedati.
It is still likely that he will lose.	Še vedno je verjetno, da bo izgubil.
Hard, he says.	Težko, pravi.
It really didn't make me feel any better.	Zaradi tega se res nisem počutil bolje.
You were so right.	Imel si tako prav.
Maybe he knows.	Mogoče ve.
I have no doubt about that.	O tem ne dvomim.
Not so here.	Tukaj ni tako.
This seems a little hard to believe.	To se zdi malo težko verjeti.
I wouldn't want that.	Tega ne bi želel.
I didn't have time for that.	Nisem imel časa za to.
That's all I want.	To je vse kar si želim.
I could tell her.	Lahko bi ji povedal.
That's all he does.	To je vse, kar počne.
It needs a lot of work.	Potrebuje veliko dela.
I wasn't sure what to do or think.	Nisem bil prepričan, kaj naj storim ali mislim.
If we .	Če bomo .
I asked if he could help me.	Vprašal sem, če mi lahko pomaga.
No, nothing like that.	Ne, nič takega.
It was wrong then and it is wrong now.	Narobe je bilo takrat in je narobe zdaj.
I wouldn't let it be known.	Ne bi dal malo vedeti.
And you never know.	In nikoli ne veš.
She was just a child.	Bila je samo otrok.
I have to go back.	Moram nazaj.
He's totally into it.	On je popolnoma v to.
And we must do it.	In to moramo storiti.
I still think so.	Še vedno tako mislim.
That was a big question.	To je bilo veliko vprašanje.
I hope he gets a job.	Upam, da bo dobil službo.
How do I do this?	Kako naj to storim?
I forgot what happened here.	Pozabil sem, kaj se je zgodilo tukaj.
He saw that it would be possible.	Videl je, da bi bilo mogoče.
He has lived there ever since.	Od takrat živi tam.
I didn't want to tell you before.	Nisem ti hotel povedati prej.
I might have a problem.	Morda bom imel težave.
It is now.	Zdaj je.
They didn't have time for that.	Niso imeli časa za to.
Maybe I could do more here.	Mogoče bi lahko tukaj naredil kaj več.
I thought, just maybe.	Mislil sem, samo mogoče.
She didn't say anything.	Nič ni rekla.
I didn't succeed.	Ni mi uspelo.
And now he was gone.	In zdaj ga ni bilo več.
Maybe you've seen it.	Mogoče ste ga videli.
He was next.	Bil je naslednji.
Nobody expected anything from him.	Od njega nihče ni pričakoval ničesar.
They will always be with us.	Vedno bodo z nami.
It was what he wanted.	To je bilo tisto, kar je hotel.
And he told me everything.	In vse mi je povedal.
I'm sure we probably have.	Prepričan sem, da jih verjetno imamo.
It wasn't enough.	Ni bilo dovolj.
They saw him.	Videli so ga.
I don't know her.	ne poznam je.
No, luckily not.	Ne, na srečo ne.
We don't have to talk.	Ni nam treba govoriti.
I really want her back.	Zelo si jo želim nazaj.
he says.	pravi.
Obviously that's not what we have.	Očitno to ni tisto, kar imamo.
You would never make it.	Nikoli ti ne bi uspelo.
It was the thing I would do.	To je bila stvar, ki bi jo naredil.
You don't think so.	Ne misliš tako.
I know you did everything you could.	Vem, da si naredil vse, kar si lahko.
We still have some time.	Imamo še nekaj časa.
She is doing so well.	Tako dobro ji gre.
He is also a good father.	Je tudi dober oče.
You can't do anything.	Ne moreš storiti ničesar.
It was good when I was doing it.	Bilo je dobro, ko sem to delal.
I have a problem.	Imam problem.
That's how it's always done.	Tako se vedno dela.
He speaks and so it is.	Govori in tako je.
Maybe it helps.	Mogoče pomaga.
He didn't do anything.	Naredil ni ničesar.
And maybe more.	In morda še več.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
That was all the time this kid had.	To je bil ves čas, ki ga je imel ta otrok.
And not just anyone.	In ne kar kdo.
He really liked to talk.	Res rad govoril.
It was nice.	Bilo je lepo.
It was very difficult to convince her.	Zelo težko jo je bilo prepričati.
You have to tell me everything.	Vse mi moraš povedati.
It helps you.	Pomaga ti.
I can't believe he's serious.	Ne morem verjeti, da misli resno.
My father too.	Moj oče tudi.
Not after everything that happened.	Ne po vsem, kar se je zgodilo.
I'm not afraid of that.	Jaz se tega ne bojim.
It still hasn't happened.	Še vedno se ni zgodilo.
I hope everything will be fine.	Upam, da bo vse v redu.
And he found nothing at all.	In sploh ni našel ničesar.
I was always fine.	Vedno sem bil dobro.
It's just not happening.	To se preprosto ne dogaja.
I hope someone can help.	Upam, da lahko kdo pomaga.
Or almost.	Ali pa skoraj.
I don't want to come there anymore.	Nočem več priti tja.
I do not know when.	Ne vem kdaj.
They were all there.	Vsi so bili tam.
Apparently everything was fine.	Očitno je bilo vse v redu.
Once a teacher, always a teacher.	Enkrat učitelj, vedno učitelj.
And a lot of people want it.	In veliko ljudi si to želi.
No, it was really good.	Ne, res je bilo dobro.
I believe there is none.	Verjamem, da ga ni.
Just .	Samo .
It will probably happen.	Verjetno se bo to zgodilo.
Everything you did was wrong.	Vse kar si naredil je bilo narobe.
I just don't know why.	Samo ne vem zakaj.
But I have a question for you.	Imam pa vprašanje zate.
I never knew who.	Nikoli nisem vedel, kdo.
I think it has to be.	Mislim, da mora biti.
It feels like no, nothing.	Počuti se, kot da ne, nič.
They are with us forever.	Za vedno so z nami.
I just want to know what you think.	Samo želim vedeti, kaj misliš.
That is, almost nothing.	Se pravi skoraj nič.
It could be like this for several days.	Lahko bi bilo tako več dni.
She knew something was up.	Vedela je, da se nekaj dogaja.
I have to leave home.	Moram od doma.
And certainly not anything he did.	In zagotovo ne ničesar, kar je naredil.
I haven't played yet.	Nisem še igral.
I tried to do everything you said.	Poskušal sem narediti vse, kar si rekel.
I would know you were there.	Vedel bi, da si tam.
As if nothing happened.	Kot da se ni nič zgodilo.
It really wasn't my problem.	To res ni bil moj problem.
And he probably knew it.	In verjetno je to vedel.
You shouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi smeli storiti.
I'm afraid it was me.	Bojim se, da sem bil jaz.
And you should know.	In morali bi vedeti.
I'm just begging you.	Samo prosim te.
I decided not to eat.	Odločil sem se, da ne bom jedel.
I hope it never will.	Upam, da nikoli ne bo.
Don't talk to me anymore.	Ne govori več z mano.
It's not just a game.	To ni le igra.
And you said it yourself.	In sam si rekel.
Will it be possible, no.	Ali bo lahko, ne.
Maybe I'll go.	Mogoče bom šel.
Indeed, they did so.	Res so tako tudi storili.
He thinks he knows.	Misli, da ve.
We know nothing about it.	O tem ne vemo nič.
However, this is highly unlikely.	Vendar je to zelo malo verjetno.
You're not really here.	Nisi res tukaj.
Tomorrow is tomorrow.	Jutri je jutri.
I can understand why you would prefer that.	Lahko razumem, zakaj bi imel to raje.
Even if you.	Tudi če ti.
I shouldn't be in this town.	Ne bi smel biti v tem mestu.
I haven't played in a while.	Že nekaj časa nisem igral.
He is here with me.	Tukaj je z mano.
Maybe there's nothing anyone can do.	Mogoče nihče ne more storiti ničesar.
What is he anyway? 	Kaj sploh je on?
I could be a teacher.	Lahko bi bil učitelj.
I never would.	Nikoli ne bi.
I will make some.	Nekaj ​​jih bom naredil.
Who you want to be.	Kdo želite biti.
I should have known better.	Moral bi vedeti bolje.
He needs something.	Nekaj ​​potrebuje.
I would, you need to know that.	Jaz bi, to moraš vedeti.
Mine is fine.	Moj je v redu.
He's gone now.	Zdaj ga ni več.
It's good that we're here.	Da smo tukaj, je dobro.
He said how good it was to see me.	Rekel je, kako lepo me je videti.
I believe he meant well.	Verjamem, da je mislil dobro.
I just wish he would have stayed.	Samo želim si, da bi ostal.
I waited for a while.	Čakal sem nekaj časa.
That will probably happen next week.	To se bo verjetno zgodilo naslednji teden.
This is your friend.	To je tvoj prijatelj.
I knew where they were.	Vedel sem, kje so.
He is ready.	Pripravljen je.
I lost everything.	Izgubil sem vse.
Yes, she knew.	Da, vedela je.
They were not alone in this.	V tem niso bili sami.
I believe he will be able to help us immediately.	Verjamem, da nam bo lahko takoj pomagal.
I made it this afternoon.	Uspelo mi je danes popoldne.
You have to know that you can be enough.	Vedeti moraš, da si lahko dovolj.
.	.
No, just too many years.	Ne, samo preveč let.
So I didn't want to do it.	Tako nisem hotel narediti tega.
As if we don't already know that.	Kot da tega še ne vemo.
We can't do enough.	Ne moremo narediti dovolj.
You should come alone.	Moral bi priti sam.
Something more was needed.	Treba je bilo nekaj več.
I know it was.	Vem, da je bilo.
I just want to help.	Želim samo pomagati.
So, we had a party.	Tako, imeli smo zabavo.
Never do that to me.	Nikoli mi tega ne stori.
It can't come fast enough.	Ne more priti dovolj hitro.
It never actually happened.	Pravzaprav se ni nikoli zgodilo.
As if all this had already happened.	Kot bi se vse to že zgodilo.
Things are wrong.	Stvari so narobe.
There will be a lot of people there.	Tam bo veliko ljudi.
I won't say anything to anyone.	Nikomur ne bom nič rekel.
You wont.	Ne boste.
We didn't know at the time.	Takrat nismo vedeli.
That's it for me.	Zame je to.
And there are so few of us.	In tako malo nas je.
And I never would.	In nikoli ne bi.
That was a lot of work.	To je bilo veliko dela.
The problem is, he doesn't know how.	Problem je, da ne ve, kako.
No one has heard of it.	Nihče ni slišal za to.
Probably about everything.	Verjetno o vsem.
In fact, she doesn't even want to be here.	Pravzaprav se ji sploh ne da biti tukaj.
I have no money.	Nimam denarja.
I tried to convince you more than once.	Več kot enkrat sem te poskušal prepričati.
I've always liked him.	Vedno mi je bil všeč.
I liked that.	To mi je bilo všeč.
We all had a little.	Vsi smo imeli malo.
i will stay here.	ostal bom tukaj.
We have to do something about it.	Nekaj ​​moramo narediti glede tega.
To each his own.	Vsak po svoje.
But that may not be the case.	Vendar morda ni tako.
I hope so.	Upam, da je.
It wasn't right.	Ni bilo prav.
You didn't mean that.	Nisi mislil tega.
Everything was very difficult.	Vse je bilo zelo težko.
You must be with us immediately.	Takoj moraš z nami.
Now he knows what to call it.	Zdaj ve, kako bi temu rekel.
He was here, he was there.	Bil je tukaj, bil je tam.
Like not even a little.	Kot da niti malo.
I prefer that life.	Raje imam tako življenje.
It's nice to be home again.	Lepo je biti spet doma.
It seemed so long ago.	Zdelo se mi je tako dolgo nazaj.
We would never make it.	Nikoli nam ne bi uspelo.
It has nothing like that.	Ničesar takega nima.
she will say.	bo rekla.
As it used to happen with everything.	Tako kot se je včasih zgodilo z vsem.
But they looked enough.	Vendar so bili videti dovolj.
You are good.	Dober si.
Not everything works.	Ne gre vse.
Not always or sometimes.	Vedno ali včasih ne.
I didn't hear well.	Nisem dobro slišal.
I couldn't find anything to say.	Nisem našel ničesar za povedati.
This is now.	To je zdaj.
I will do that.	To bom naredil.
Is there a better way.	Ali obstaja boljši način.
And he hadn't either.	In tudi on ni imel.
He was and is a man.	Bil je in je človek.
This happens all the time.	To se dogaja ves čas.
And it's good too.	In tudi dobro je.
I saw it happen.	Videl sem, da se je to zgodilo.
I could do that.	Lahko bi naredil to.
This is happening.	To se dogaja.
It's not about who we are.	Ne gre za to, kar smo.
I'd like to see what he has to say, if anything.	Rad bi videl, kaj bo rekel, če sploh kaj.
I got the job.	Dobil sem službo.
He couldn't see it yet.	Tega še ni mogel videti.
She almost managed to swim.	Skoraj ji je uspelo plavati.
And maybe we won't.	In morda ne bomo.
I'm better.	Bolje mi je.
We know that too.	Vemo tudi to.
I told her.	Povedal sem ji.
Who just had something wrong with him.	Ki je imel samo nekaj narobe z njim.
It may never be.	Morda ga nikoli ne bo.
He did his job.	Opravil je svoje delo.
Obviously, that's not the case here.	Očitno tukaj ni tako.
I think we did that very well.	Mislim, da nam je to zelo dobro uspelo.
I could do that.	Lahko bi naredil to.
You will see in this.	V tem boste videli.
This is not true.	To ni res.
He is no longer of any help to you.	Ni vam več v pomoč.
I feel really good about it.	Ob tem se res dobro počutim.
Here is the reason.	Tukaj je razlog.
There was no one in the room with him.	Z njim v sobi ni bilo nikogar.
Not so at all.	Sploh ni tako.
I don't want to believe it.	Nočem verjeti.
I was there.	Bil sem tam.
But it is difficult.	Je pa težko.
It never happened.	Nikoli od tega, ni bilo.
Someone who knows her really well, that is.	Nekdo, ki jo res dobro pozna, to je.
Today is not that day.	Danes ni ta dan.
He was there the whole time.	Ves čas je bil tam.
It's happening.	Dogaja se.
Good, good for you.	Dobro, dobro zate.
I don't need anything else.	Ne potrebujem ničesar drugega.
It has to be a little.	Mora biti malo.
That is a lot.	To je veliko.
I don't feel well in the morning.	Zjutraj se ne počutim dobro.
I almost died.	Skoraj bi umrl.
It's not them.	To niso tisti.
And did what was right.	In naredil, kar je prav.
That felt really good.	To se je res zdelo zelo dobro.
Sometimes he is alone.	Včasih je sam.
You have enough time.	Imaš dovolj časa.
Please do this.	Prosim, naredi to.
it's true	res je
What he needs is time.	Kar potrebuje, je čas.
You know it's not going well.	Veš, da ne gre dobro.
Illberightback .	Takoj bom nazaj .
Or maybe it was him.	Ali pa je bil morda on.
I'm not sorry.	Ni mi žal.
That's why they made me.	Zato so me naredili.
He never returned to work.	Nikoli se ni vrnil na delo.
It was too much work for that.	Za to je bilo preveč dela.
But nothing came of it.	Vendar iz tega ni bilo nič.
It's all too much for me.	Zame je vse skupaj preveč.
He had to be helped.	Treba mu je bilo pomagati.
And so it was.	In tako je bilo.
I came as always.	Prišel sem kot vedno.
But they had to know.	Vendar so morali vedeti.
That's all he does, you know.	To je vse, kar počne, veš.
You need to get out.	Moraš ven.
Good day to you now.	Dober dan vam zdaj.
He obviously has a chance now.	Očitno ima zdaj priložnost.
That's all he ever eats.	To je vse, kar kdaj poje.
We can all be better.	Vsi smo lahko boljši.
He knew there was a reason.	Vedel je, da obstaja razlog.
He asked if he could talk to me.	Prosil je, če lahko govori z mano.
But it wasn't always like that.	Vendar ni bilo vedno tako.
Nobody knew that.	Nihče tega ni vedel.
No, none of that.	Ne, nič od tega.
It can't go wrong.	Ne more iti narobe.
probably.	verjetno.
He wants you to know that.	Želi, da to veš.
Sometimes quite quickly.	Včasih kar hitro.
If they do, fine.	Če jih, v redu.
I know what you mean.	Vem, kaj misliš.
I'm going tomorrow.	jutri grem.
He was here.	Bil je tukaj.
If it was true, everyone would know.	Če bi bilo res, bi vsi vedeli.
There's nowhere to go now.	Zdaj ni kam iti.
I can't tell you.	Ne morem ti povedati.
We are really lucky.	Res imamo srečo.
We have to eat sometime.	Nekoč moramo jesti.
This afternoon actually.	Pravzaprav danes popoldne.
They had to be.	Morali so biti.
Without people.	Brez ljudi.
I already did.	Sem že storil.
I'd love to see some of that.	Rad bi videl nekaj od tega.
I think you'll like it.	Mislim, da ti bo všeč.
Why? 	Zakaj?
No, no and no.	Ne, ne in ne.
I can see he might be better off here.	Vidim, da mu je tukaj morda bolje.
I know this can't be easy for you.	Vem, da ti to ne more biti lahko.
I wasn't a friend.	Nisem bil prijatelj.
That's what's hard.	To je tisto, kar je težko.
Go ahead, he seems to say.	Naprej, se zdi, da pravi.
I was never up for it.	Nikoli nisem bil za to.
It was still early.	Bilo je še tako zgodaj.
He called her.	Poklical jo je.
Dad told us.	Oče nam je povedal.
I couldn't get out of it.	Nisem mogel priti iz tega.
She said she didn't know.	Rekla je, da ne ve.
And they were right.	In imeli so prav.
He never thought he would.	Nikoli si ni mislil, da bo.
We'll have to see.	Bomo morali videti.
The one who died.	Tisti, ki je umrl.
I wanted out.	Hotel sem ven.
He knew he was human.	Vedel je, da je človek.
He wants more money.	Želi več denarja.
That felt right.	To se je zdelo prav.
If I wanted to, I could.	Če bi hotel, bi lahko.
Still not and never will be.	Še vedno ne in nikoli ne bo.
She wanted to be alone.	Želela je biti sama.
That could be a problem.	To bi lahko bil problem.
I'm so glad it worked out for you.	Tako sem vesel, da ti je uspelo.
Have you ever seen anything like this?	Ste že kdaj videli kaj takega?
We had dinner.	Imeli smo večerjo.
You should be happy about that.	Moral bi biti vesel tega.
I really like the guy.	Fant mi je res všeč.
No, you have to work at it.	Ne, moraš delati na tem.
I'm really very sorry about that.	Res mi je zelo žal za to.
You just need to know.	Samo vedeti je treba.
I think that's all.	Mislim, da je vse.
You'll be back here, as always.	Vrnil se boš sem, kot vedno.
But it seems not.	Vendar se zdi, da ni.
But nothing came of it.	A iz tega ni bilo nič.
If only I could see her now.	Ko bi jo le videl zdaj.
You're not anymore.	Nisi več.
I spoke to him the next day.	Naslednji dan sem govoril z njim.
That didn't happen.	To se ni zgodilo.
It doesn't help.	Ne pomaga.
Maybe it's not always easy.	Mogoče ni vedno lahko.
Now you know your father would do that.	Zdaj veš, da bi tvoj oče to storil.
And he has something to say.	In ima kaj povedati.
I would never want to see you.	Nikoli te ne bi želel videti.
But it was hard to do.	Vendar je bilo težko narediti.
I just couldn't find it.	Samo nisem našel.
I'm so good right now.	Trenutno sem tako dobra.
There is no money at the moment.	Trenutno ni denarja.
Yes, and we are better off without it.	Da, in bolje nam je brez tega.
Again, they had nothing.	Še enkrat, niso imeli nič.
Or he thought he could.	Ali pa je mislil, da lahko.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
You have to work here.	Tukaj moraš delati.
There's always tomorrow.	Vedno je jutri.
There and there and there.	Tam in tam in tam.
You still have a chance.	Še vedno imaš možnost.
Everything seems to be fine.	Zdi se, da je vse v redu.
You should already know.	Moral bi že vedeti.
And apparently she doesn't see anything wrong with that.	In očitno se ji ne zdi s tem nič narobe.
Neither do I.	Tudi meni ne.
So we all knew what to do.	Tako smo vsi vedeli, kaj storiti.
I don't care if they are today.	Ne zanima me, če so danes.
There were many of them.	Veliko jih je bilo.
It is not and never will be.	Ni in nikoli ne bo.
You will make it.	Uspelo ti bo.
It doesn't work anymore.	Nič več dela.
It's in us.	V nas je.
I told her this morning.	Povedal sem ji zjutraj.
He said he couldn't know.	Rekel je, da ne more vedeti.
But he knew all along that it would.	A ves čas je vedel, da bo.
Some work.	Nekaj ​​dela.
It was not an easy job.	To ni bilo lahko delo.
Now it's just tonight.	Zdaj je samo nocoj.
Something was wrong, he was sure.	Nekaj ​​ni bilo v redu, prepričan je bil.
But it was never simple.	A nikoli ni bilo preprosto.
Obviously they are not.	Očitno je, da niso.
It's not all work, but it's not all play.	Ni vse delo, ni pa igra.
And you are mine.	In ti si moj.
He said he could be.	Rekel je, da bi lahko bil.
You could be.	Lahko pa, da si.
I thought he was lost.	Mislil sem, da se je izgubil.
I hope this works out.	Upam, da bo to uspelo.
And now we know why.	In zdaj vemo zakaj.
We have to see each other a lot.	Moramo se veliko videti.
This one was good.	Ta je bil dober.
Obviously, that's not the case here.	Očitno tukaj ni tako.
It wasn't much.	Ni bilo veliko.
He has all the money he wants.	Ima ves denar, ki ga želi.
And he found it.	In našel je to.
My friend meant well.	Moj prijatelj je mislil dobro.
And knew everything about everything.	In vedel vse o vsem.
I probably will someday.	Verjetno bom nekoč.
I've had enough of this.	Dovolj imam tega.
He never came back.	Nikoli se ni vrnil.
He was what he was.	Bil je to, kar je bil.
It makes you want to go there.	Zaradi tega si želiš iti tja.
And a lot of it is very good.	In veliko tega je zelo dobro.
I didn't always do that.	Tega nisem vedno počel.
No, just don't do anything.	Ne, samo ne naredi ničesar.
I'm going to need some help here.	Tukaj bom potreboval nekaj pomoči.
I think it's there now.	Mislim, da je zdaj tam.
Just not now.	Samo ne zdaj.
I was lucky, man.	Imel sem srečo, človek.
If only I knew what it was.	Ko bi le vedel, kaj je to.
I met him once.	Enkrat sem ga srečal.
I think it needs some time.	Mislim, da potrebuje nekaj časa.
He no longer needed them.	Ni jih več potreboval.
He's not even good enough to be human.	Niti ni dovolj dober, da bi bil človek.
He hasn't got it yet.	Ni ga še dobil.
We did ours.	Mi smo naredili svoje.
The money is still there.	Denar je še vedno tam.
I wonder if it's not true.	Sprašujem se, če ni res.
Everyone knew.	Vsi so vedeli.
I'll do that here.	To bom naredil tukaj.
I liked him immediately.	Takoj mi je bil všeč.
This was usual.	To je bilo običajno.
I am? 	Sem jaz?
He will have her again.	Spet jo bo imel.
You don't even know how it happened.	Sploh ne veš, kako se je to zgodilo.
That's not the case.	To ni tako.
That may or may not be the case.	To je lahko ali pa tudi ne.
He likes it very much.	Zelo mu je všeč.
We could be just like you and me.	Lahko bi bili tako kot jaz in ti.
And he's right.	In prav ima.
However, this is not as simple as it may seem.	Vendar to ni tako preprosto, kot se morda zdi.
I can not do it anymore.	Ne morem več.
I would be happy about that.	Tega bi bil vesel.
But there are enough of them.	Vendar jih je dovolj.
Who, why, how.	Kdo, zakaj, kako.
We will do this together.	To bomo naredili skupaj.
Maybe I can't see it.	Mogoče ga ne vidim.
No one ever tells her what to do.	Nihče ji nikoli ne govori, kaj naj naredi.
We should have something to say.	Imeli bi kaj povedati.
He always liked to talk too much.	Vedno je rad preveč govoril.
I thought you would like it.	Mislil sem, da ti bo všeč.
Nothing to see there.	Tam ni ničesar za videti.
If it is there.	Če je tam.
In fact, he never did.	Pravzaprav tega nikoli ni storil.
It's not like anything happened.	Ni tako, kot da bi se kaj zgodilo.
After that.	Po tem.
But he usually didn't do anything like that.	Vendar običajno ni storil ničesar takega.
They are long gone.	Že dolgo jih ni več.
We didn't make it today.	Danes nam ni uspelo.
They both said no.	Oba sta rekla ne.
I just wanted to make something to eat.	Hotel sem samo narediti nekaj za jesti.
What they did to me.	Kaj so mi naredili.
He came to me.	Prišel je do mene.
Nobody and nothing was there.	Nikogar in ničesar ni bilo tam.
There is so much to see and do.	Toliko je videti in narediti.
I could tell she wasn't interested.	Lahko bi rekel, da je ne zanima.
And that is.	In to je.
How few of us there are.	Kako malo nas je.
I would help him.	Pomagal bi mu.
It wasn't what he expected.	Ni bilo tisto, kar je pričakoval.
He doesn't want anything else.	Ne želi ničesar drugega.
But we don't know what it is.	Vendar ne vemo, kaj je.
The man was ready for what he could get.	Človek je bil pripravljen za tisto, kar je lahko dobil.
You didn't say.	Nisi rekel.
Why not.	Zakaj pa ne.
You were helpful.	Bil si v pomoč.
That didn't work.	To ni uspelo.
I was quite surprised by that.	Prav presenečen sem bil nad tem.
There's something there.	Nekaj ​​je tam.
He worked well that day too.	Tudi ta dan je dobro delal.
Even if he doesn't want to do it.	Tudi če tega ne želi storiti.
Life was good.	Življenje je bilo dobro.
Once, then again.	Enkrat, pa spet.
I continue to do this often.	Še naprej to pogosto počnem.
We could do much better.	Lahko bi naredili veliko bolje.
More than just a few things.	Več kot le nekaj stvari.
Maybe you can't talk.	Mogoče ne moreš govoriti.
I like this one too.	Ta mi je tudi všeč.
It must be soon.	Mora biti kmalu.
He needs to know where he's been.	Vedeti mora, kje je bil.
I think he's right.	Mislim, da ima prav.
My father is.	Moj oče je.
But you're probably right.	Vendar imaš verjetno prav.
No matter what happened to you or what you did.	Ne glede na to, kaj se ti je zgodilo ali kaj si naredil.
But we'll see if that actually happens or not.	Bomo pa videli, ali se bo to res zgodilo ali ne.
Pretty good actually.	Pravzaprav kar dobro.
And we'll see each other again.	In spet se bomo videli.
This is never possible.	To nikoli ni mogoče.
Your car was here.	Tvoj avto je bil tukaj.
I can't seem to help myself.	Zdi se mi, da si ne morem pomagati.
She still looked fine.	Še vedno je bila videti v redu.
I'm not sure either.	Tudi jaz nisem prepričan.
Why are you even here?	Zakaj si sploh tukaj?
I will help you.	Pomagal ti bom.
Neither do you.	Tudi ti ne.
It happened again.	Še enkrat se je zgodilo.
But more can be done.	Vendar je mogoče storiti več.
But we didn't know that.	Vendar tega nismo vedeli.
It's not about money.	To ni stvar denarja.
I've never done that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem naredil.
Obviously not.	Očitno ne.
But I wouldn't do that.	Vendar tega ne bi storil.
We know where it is.	Vemo, kje je.
He might be doing it wrong.	Morda dela narobe.
He was sure to be next.	Zagotovo je bil naslednji.
Yes, yes, she knew what she had to do now.	Da, da, vedela je, kaj mora storiti zdaj.
But I saw something.	Sem pa nekaj videl.
He will go to the house.	Šel bo v hišo.
Many things they did not know.	Veliko stvari, ki jih niso vedeli.
What they did and why.	Kaj so storili in zakaj.
That's why he came out.	Zato je prišel ven.
And something will be difficult.	In nekaj bo težko.
I still want it.	Še vedno si ga želim.
Usually no one was.	Običajno nihče ni bil.
It's happened to me before.	Zgodilo se mi je že.
I decided to do it.	Odločil sem se za to.
It can be done quickly.	Lahko se naredi hitro.
No one here could say what they were thinking.	Nihče tukaj ni mogel povedati, kaj misli.
I thought you might have seen it.	Mislil sem, da si ga morda videl.
I am here ready to work for you.	Tukaj sem pripravljen delati za vas.
Maybe it was better here.	Mogoče je bilo tukaj bolje.
We might not.	Morda ne bomo.
It seemed to go on and on.	Zdelo se je, da gre naprej in naprej.
Right is wrong and wrong is right.	Prav je narobe in narobe je prav.
I felt that way too.	Tudi jaz sem se počutil tako.
He didn't want to talk about it.	O tem ni želel govoriti.
Why didn't he come home last night.	Zakaj sinoči ni prišel domov.
Not yet and maybe never.	Ne še in morda nikoli.
I should have told you tonight.	Moral bi ti povedati nocoj.
I was just a kid.	Bil sem samo otrok.
I got better.	Postal sem boljši.
There weren't many of them there.	Tam jih ni bilo veliko.
I've seen her more than once, you know.	Več kot enkrat sem jo videl, veš.
Who's singing now?	Kdo zdaj poje.
It's always day.	Vedno je dan.
This is not a game.	To ni igra.
No one knows what to call it.	Nihče ne ve, kako bi temu rekel.
You will be there.	Ti boš tam.
I still need them.	Še vedno jih potrebujem.
No one came to get us.	Nihče ni prišel po nas.
I asked him for help.	Prosil sem ga za pomoč.
I always do.	Jaz vedno.
And it was there.	In bilo je tam,.
You should see her.	Morali bi jo videti.
Maybe it was yesterday.	Mogoče je bilo včeraj.
Opportunity is what he wanted.	Priložnost je tisto, kar je želel.
I did a pretty good job.	Opravil sem kar dobro delo.
But not as much as I could.	A ne toliko, kot bi lahko.
I think that is sometimes true.	Mislim, da je to včasih res.
There is no work.	Delo ni.
Actually, it's all of us.	Pravzaprav smo vsi mi.
I don't want to say.	Nočem povedati.
He needed her and didn't want anyone.	Potreboval jo je in ni hotel nikogar.
And it should be.	In moral bi biti.
He works for me now.	Zdaj dela zame.
Not that it would be good.	Ne da bi bilo dobro.
If you will.	Če boš.
It's a quick job.	To je hitro delo.
Not often enough.	Ne dovolj pogosto.
No, no, not just the game.	Ne, ne, ne samo igra.
He asked her to help him.	Prosil jo je, naj mu pomaga.
What for.	Kaj za .
That's what I'll do.	Tako bom naredil.
I do not understand why.	Ne razumem zakaj.
There was something more.	Bilo je nekaj več.
I am as always.	Kot vedno sem.
However, much remains to be done!	Vendar je treba še veliko narediti!
It had to be done quickly.	Treba je bilo narediti hitro.
I have to do all this.	Vse to moram narediti.
And I wouldn't allow that.	In tega ne bi dovolil.
It is also true.	Prav tako je res.
And much more.	In veliko več.
I didn't want to go there.	Nisem hotel tja.
I want help.	Želim pomoč.
So they did.	Tako so tudi storili.
Nothing was ever good enough.	Nikoli nič ni bilo dovolj dobro.
And that is very good to know.	In to je zelo dobro vedeti.
Maybe that helps.	Mogoče to pomaga.
Which she said to him as before.	Ki mu je rekla kot prej.
Everything is eating something else.	Vse poje nekaj drugega.
There aren't many of them.	Ni jih veliko.
You will come now.	Zdaj boš prišel.
That would be wrong.	To bi bilo narobe.
I suspect not.	Sumim, da ni.
That's all he needs right now.	To je vse, kar trenutno potrebuje.
That felt right to me.	To se mi je zdelo prav.
He said he hoped everything would be fine.	Rekel je, da upa, da bo vse v redu.
Nothing can be the way it was.	Nič ne more biti več tako, kot je bilo.
There are so many people.	Toliko ljudi je.
Maybe someone else will come.	Morda pride še kdo.
That was before.	To je bilo prej.
I decided to be alone.	Odločil sem se, da bom sam.
I was just a kid.	Bil sem samo otrok.
Tonight they had.	Nocoj so imeli.
As we shall see, this is indeed the case.	Kot bomo videli, je temu res tako.
But there was very little time.	A časa je bilo zelo malo.
I mean, someone had to do it.	Mislim, nekdo je to moral narediti.
She should have known better.	Morala bi vedeti bolje.
I wanted to be angry.	Hotel sem biti jezen.
Now I was tired.	Zdaj sem bil utrujen.
As if it were the first time.	Kot bi bilo prvič.
There is no time for anything else.	Ni časa za kaj drugega.
I was so sure how I was going to do it.	Bil sem tako prepričan, kako mi bo uspelo.
You just have to know how.	Samo vedeti moraš, kako.
He has everything to do.	Ima vse za početi.
She would never be.	Nikoli ne bi bila.
If there was anyone else.	Če bi bil še kdo.
It might not be there.	Morda ga ni tam.
I have a hard time believing it.	Težko verjamem.
But we know what we have to do.	Vemo pa, kaj moramo storiti.
Who could speak.	Kdo bi lahko govoril.
That's because it is.	To je zato, ker je.
Life must go on.	Življenje mora iti naprej.
Everything was someone else's business.	Vse je bila stvar nekoga drugega.
That was not good.	To ni bilo dobro.
Neither does life.	Tudi življenje ne.
Tell me how you felt.	Povej mi, kako si se počutil.
It wasn't easy for him.	Ni mu bilo lahko.
But I would hear them.	Vendar bi jih slišal.
She'll just say no.	Samo rekla bo ne.
I haven't seen much.	Nisem veliko videl.
I wonder who it could be.	Zanima me, kdo bi to lahko bil.
I would like to learn how to do this.	Rad bi se naučil, kako to narediti.
Instead, I could make it simple.	Namesto tega bi lahko naredil preprosto.
If he didn't want to help her, she had to help herself.	Če ji ni hotel pomagati, si je morala pomagati sama.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ne vem, kaj je bilo z njim.
What can he do?	Kaj pa lahko naredi.
A thing to see.	Stvar za videti.
He told me it was fine.	Povedal mi je, da je v redu.
I felt good.	Dobro sem se počutil.
But it will.	Vendar bo.
Now we know what they are.	Zdaj vemo, kaj so.
Think for yourself.	Mislite sami.
This happened tonight.	To se je zgodilo nocoj.
And the man will say.	In človek bo rekel.
It's not wrong.	Ni narobe.
Much more can and should be done.	Veliko več je mogoče in treba narediti.
No one can help now.	Zdaj nihče ne more pomagati.
I will never forget.	Nikoli ne bom pozabil.
All this time, no one said anything.	Ves ta čas nihče ni rekel ničesar.
He always wants to do things the right way.	Vedno želi stvari narediti na pravi način.
This is the one.	To je ta.
I never actually met her, you know.	Nikoli je pravzaprav nisem srečal, veš.
But it wasn't enough.	Vendar ni bilo dovolj.
And better yet, he knows how to get there.	In kar je še bolje, ve, kako priti tja.
And that's a good thing.	In tako je dobro.
I hope he becomes one.	Upam, da bo to postal.
But it's okay.	Vendar je v redu.
I've always been here.	Vedno sem bil tukaj.
But it might not be enough.	Vendar morda ne bo dovolj.
And we will be all the better for it.	In zaradi tega bomo še toliko boljši.
Keep it up!.	Kar tako naprej!.
No, he said, he was sorry.	Ne, je rekel, žal mu je.
It didn't happen that way.	Ni se zgodilo tako.
Not even today.	Tudi danes ne.
She was already there.	Tam je že bila.
I have nothing to do.	Nimam kaj početi.
Maybe nothing at all.	Mogoče sploh nič.
That was something.	To je bilo nekaj.
He expected that.	To je pričakoval.
We'll just have to say.	Samo povedati bomo morali.
I couldn't do it.	Nisem mogel narediti.
I know many things.	Vem veliko stvari.
It's much better.	Veliko bolje je.
That sure was fast.	To je bilo zagotovo hitro.
Nevermind.	Nič za to.
There is nothing else.	Nič drugega ni.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Zdelo se je, da gre vse prav.
Nobody like that anymore.	Nihče več tako.
He probably doesn't think anyone is good enough for me.	Verjetno se mu ne zdi nihče dovolj dober zame.
Maybe so.	Morda je tako.
If I had known that, I would have left immediately.	Če bi to vedel, bi takoj odšel.
They always have.	Vedno so imeli.
No, I wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
I don't know how that can be.	Ne vem, kako je to lahko.
Nothing yet, he decided.	Nič še, se je odločil.
Someone will probably be there soon.	Verjetno bo nekdo kmalu tam.
I will go again this week.	Ta teden bom spet šel.
I don't know why one would expect anything else.	Ne vem, zakaj bi človek pričakoval kaj drugega.
And someone came back and begged him.	In nekdo se je vrnil in ga prosil.
He likes to do these things.	Te stvari rad počne.
I don't care that much.	Ne zanima me tako veliko.
I don't know that for sure.	Tega ne vem zagotovo.
But we all knew.	Vendar smo vsi vedeli.
And maybe he wasn't mad yet.	In morda še ni bil jezen.
He wanted more.	Želel je več.
Not now.	Zdaj pa ne.
But apparently it wasn't enough.	Vendar očitno ni bilo dovolj.
He better not know.	Bolje, da ne ve.
But it's more than that.	Vendar je to še več.
I wonder if he knew then.	Sprašujem se, ali je takrat vedel.
She knew she couldn't stay.	Vedela je, da ne more ostati.
Yes, you didn't say anything for a long time.	Da, dolgo časa nisi rekel ničesar.
He might have something there.	Morda ima tam kaj.
I knew there would be more.	Vedela sem, da jih bo še več.
It just didn't feel right.	Samo ni se zdelo prav.
Yes, we are here too.	Da, tudi mi smo tukaj.
We always are.	Vedno smo.
I think that's a possibility.	Mislim, da je to možnost.
I have decided.	Odločil sem se.
This is a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
It was like going back to school again.	Bilo je, kot bi se spet vrnil v šolo.
Just that it was work.	Samo da je bilo delo.
It was fine for me.	Meni je bilo v redu.
I don't anymore.	Jaz ne več.
Father was in the room.	Oče je bil v sobi.
We both knew.	Oba sva vedela.
It seemed unlikely.	Zdelo se je malo verjetno.
I know why you are angry.	Vem zakaj si jezen.
Talk about it.	Govori o tem.
He came so hard in the morning.	Zjutraj je prišel tako težko.
It should be for me.	Zame naj bi bilo.
Because he couldn't.	Ker ni mogel.
And you should.	In moral bi.
It makes us.	To nas naredi.
I wonder if anyone can help me.	Zanima me, če mi lahko kdo pomaga.
No one can know for sure.	Nihče ne more vedeti zagotovo.
I won't be here long.	Ne bom dolgo tukaj.
And nobody did anything.	In nihče ni naredil ničesar.
That was my job.	To je bilo moje delo.
Might as well say now.	Lahko bi tudi rekel zdaj.
I really don't know anymore.	Res ne vem več.
Hope you all like it.	Upam, da vam bo vsem všeč.
No one knew for sure and refused to say.	Nihče ni vedel zagotovo in ni hotel povedati.
They saw nothing.	Nič niso videli.
But it won't be easy.	A ne bo lahko.
She didn't know any better.	Ni vedela bolje.
I wouldn't tell anyone.	Nikomur ne bi povedal.
None of us wanted to.	Nihče od nas ni hotel.
But she didn't have to.	Vendar ji tega ni bilo treba storiti.
However, this is often a problem.	Vendar je to pogosto problem.
I found.	Našel sem.
It was good to be home.	Dobro je bilo biti doma.
He is too.	Tudi on je.
Like, you know, man.	Kot, veš, človek.
I doubt they even saw me.	Dvomim, da so me sploh videli.
That's not it.	To ni to.
We have to do things, but we can't.	Stvari moramo narediti, a ne moremo.
It really is a gamble.	Res je igra na srečo.
He saw it happen.	Videl je, kako se je zgodilo.
Who did it, she said.	Kdo je to storil, je rekla.
He promised me that much.	Toliko mi je obljubil.
She told herself she wasn't alone.	Rekla si je, da ni sama.
The reason we're here.	Razlog, zakaj smo tukaj.
No kids now, maybe never.	Zdaj brez otrok, morda nikoli.
I didn't leave.	Nisem odšel.
Let him go out.	Naj gre ven.
Today was clearly not a good day.	Danes očitno ni bil dober dan.
She was not sorry.	Ni ji bilo žal.
Really, really.	Res, res.
My father taught me that.	Oče me je tega naučil.
I don't know anything.	Ničesar ne vem.
I thought I should see.	Mislil sem, da bi moral videti.
You just did that.	Samo to si naredil.
I know what you mean.	Vem kaj misliš.
How nice it was.	Kako lepo je bilo.
He was really there.	Res je bil tam.
They had a party.	Imeli so zabavo.
I thought you might know where.	Mislil sem, da morda kje veš.
There were more of them than us.	Bilo jih je več kot nas.
Tell me what you can.	Povej mi kar lahko.
It is for us.	Za nas je.
There is nothing more to it than that.	Na tem ni nič drugega kot to.
I have to go back to school.	Moram nazaj v šolo.
I think there is something to be done.	Mislim, da je nekaj za narediti.
That seems right to me.	To se mi zdi prav.
I don't know what to think about it.	Ne vem, kaj naj si mislim o tem.
He loves you very much.	Zelo te ima rad.
i will go home	šel bom domov.
Never or almost never.	Nikoli ali skoraj nikoli.
Okay okay okay.	V redu v redu v redu.
Happy but angry.	Vesel, a jezen.
He's still a happy boy.	Še vedno je vesel fant.
I was able to learn a lot.	Veliko sem se lahko naučil.
It looked like it was just me now.	Videti je bilo, kot da sem zdaj samo jaz.
Good job too.	Tudi dobro delo.
Everything is fine for me.	Zame je vse v redu.
You couldn't say why.	Nisi mogel povedati zakaj.
You want to know, so you know now.	Želite vedeti, zato zdaj veste.
As it should be.	Kot mora biti.
Where are they now?.	Kje so zdaj?.
But he won't tell you.	Vendar ti ne bo povedal.
Just like him.	Tako kot on.
I've never eaten it.	Nikoli ga nisem jedel.
As you now know, this is not the case.	Kot zdaj veste, temu ni tako.
I didn't even see that.	Nisem niti videl tega.
He could be like that at times.	Tako je lahko bil včasih.
You are nothing.	Ti nisi nič.
We had nothing to do for a while.	Nekaj ​​časa nismo imeli kaj početi.
And really, it could be better.	In res, lahko bi bil boljši.
There was no money.	Denarja ni bilo.
This is very good.	To je zelo dobro.
Sometimes that's hard to do.	Včasih je to težko narediti.
Which is very nice.	Kar je zelo lepo.
Good thing it is.	Še dobro, da je.
He'll be here soon.	Kmalu bo tukaj.
He's with me again.	Spet je pri meni.
I don't seem to feel like myself.	Zdi se, da se ne počutim kot jaz.
Life is like a flight.	Življenje je kot let.
I like the work.	Delo mi je všeč.
It's better than before.	Bolje je kot prej.
Much more my thing.	Veliko bolj moja stvar.
Really, that's why we're here.	Res, zato smo tukaj.
He liked to be good at it.	Rad je bil dober v tem.
It's not for me.	Ni zame.
He couldn't even.	Niti ni mogel.
That's hard too.	Tudi to je težko.
It wouldn't be like going alone.	Ne bi bilo tako, kot da bi šla sama.
Maybe it's true.	Mogoče je res.
More work.	Več dela.
I don't mean to do that.	Tega ne mislim storiti.
It was probably the first time.	Verjetno je bilo prvič.
He succeeded once.	Enkrat mu je uspelo.
That was more.	To je bilo več.
He was still angry about it.	Še vedno je bil jezen zaradi tega.
Yes, it's true.	Da, res je.
That was wrong too.	Tudi to je bilo narobe.
He doesn't seem to want to help you.	Zdi se, da vam ne želi pomagati.
I haven't returned it since.	Od takrat ga nisem več vrnil.
She should do something.	Morala bi nekaj narediti.
Just a little bit more.	Samo še malo.
Maybe it was time.	Mogoče je bil čas.
I wasn't a good person.	Nisem bil dober človek.
As if I could see it.	Kot bi to videl.
I already had that.	To sem že imel.
Maybe they were.	Mogoče so bili.
I feel fast.	Počutim se hitro.
It was good too.	Tudi dobro je bilo.
As they were now.	Kot so bili zdaj.
He had something to say.	Imel je povedati.
It's the only way.	To je edini način.
She will want to help him.	Želela mu bo pomagati.
The time is right.	Čas je pravi.
I don't see him.	Ne vidim ga.
You'll have to again.	Moral boš še enkrat.
I like everything.	Všeč mi je vse.
All by myself.	Vse sam.
Something had to be done.	Nekaj ​​je bilo treba narediti.
What happened happened.	Kar se je zgodilo, se je zgodilo.
They knew about it.	Vedeli so za to.
I can't believe you came alone.	Ne morem verjeti, da si prišel sam.
Everyone will love this one.	Ta bo vsem všeč.
You would do it, you said.	Ti bi to naredil, si rekel.
But getting there won't be easy.	Priti tja pa ne bo lahko.
But we did it.	Vendar nam je uspelo.
It will be nice to see.	Lepo bo videti.
I gave you some.	Dal sem ti jih nekaj.
He was still playing.	Še vedno je igral.
Now they were here.	Zdaj so bili tukaj.
It's still good to see.	Še vedno je dobro videti.
He seemed to have nothing more to say.	Zdelo se je, da nima več kaj povedati.
Nothing happened.	Nič se ni zgodilo.
He is, okay.	On je, v redu.
And someone needed help.	In nekdo je potreboval pomoč.
That was a lot too.	Tudi to je bilo veliko.
But it won't happen.	Vendar se ne bo zgodilo.
He only has you.	Samo tebe ima.
Everything is possible.	Vse je mogoče.
But it can't be helped.	Vendar si ni mogoče pomagati.
They were a problem then, they are a problem now.	Bili so problem takrat, problem so zdaj.
And more and more.	In vedno več.
He is alone.	On je sam.
Again, it's okay.	Še enkrat, v redu je.
He was always with us.	Vedno je bil z nami.
He had never seen him look like this.	Še nikoli ga ni videl videti tako.
We like it a lot.	Zelo nam je všeč.
I just got really lucky.	Pravkar sem imel res srečo.
She wants the boy to have it.	Želi, da ima fant to.
I might do something like that.	Morda bi naredil kaj takega.
You haven't seen anything yet.	Ničesar še nisi videl.
In fact, we should all be here soon.	Pravzaprav bi morali biti vsi kmalu tukaj.
And now it's gone.	In zdaj ni več.
The question here again is why.	Vprašanje tukaj je spet, zakaj.
I do not think so.	Mislim, da ne.
Sometimes it's hard to do more than that.	Včasih je težko narediti več kot to.
And you just know.	In preprosto veš.
She was no longer a person.	Ni bila več oseba.
Anyone who has ever played.	Vsak, ki je nekoč igral.
This may not be easy for you.	To vam res morda ne bo lahko.
I started eating.	Začel sem jesti.
He told me he was sorry.	Rekel mi je, da mu je žal.
It's more than meets the eye.	Je več kot se zdi.
I wish we had time.	Želim si, da bi imeli čas.
Very, very few people do.	Zelo, zelo malo ljudi to počne.
And we will.	In bomo.
We really don't need to tell you more than that.	Več kot to nam res ni treba povedati.
Now she knew.	Zdaj je vedela.
I have to do this.	To moram narediti.
Very very nice.	Zelo zelo lepo.
It could be us again.	Lahko bi bili spet mi.
That's nice and right.	To je lepo in prav.
She just knew what she needed.	Samo vedela je, kaj potrebuje.
He heard everything.	Slišal je vse.
You started it.	Ti si začel.
I wish I didn't do anything.	Rad bi, da ne bi naredil ničesar.
But we know that.	To pa vemo.
We are alone here.	Tukaj smo sami.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe.
Like never before.	Kot še nikoli.
I believe her.	Jaz ji verjamem.
He returned home angry.	Jezen se je vrnil domov.
I am sure you will like it.	Prepričan sem, da ti bo všeč.
He came into the room.	Prišel je v sobo.
But I refuse to believe that this is the case.	Vendar nočem verjeti, da je temu tako.
I only know a little.	Vem le malo.
In fact, it almost always was.	Pravzaprav je bilo skoraj vedno tako.
We know better now and we should have known then.	Zdaj vemo bolje in bi morali vedeti takrat.
And there's nothing wrong with that.	In s tem ni nič narobe.
It will be fine.	V redu bo.
He knew what he had to do.	Vedel je, kaj mora storiti.
It would be better for everyone.	Vsem bi bilo bolje.
All was not well.	Ni bilo vse v redu.
I liked this one.	Ta mi je bil všeč.
I never said.	Nikoli nisem rekel.
But you are doing very well.	Vendar ti gre zelo dobro.
And if that were true.	In če bi bilo to res.
If not now, then soon.	Če ne zdaj, pa kmalu.
It was because he wasn't there.	To je bilo zato, ker ga ni bilo.
Never as much as then.	Nikoli toliko kot takrat.
Make it work for you.	Naj dela zate.
No one is afraid now.	Zdaj se nihče ne boji.
Unfortunately, he is right.	Žal ima prav.
More soon.	Več kmalu.
I wished I had.	Želela sem si, da bi imel.
But he would never admit it.	A tega ne bi nikoli priznal.
No one ever said they saw it happen.	Nihče ni nikoli rekel, da je videl, da se je to zgodilo.
More than it used to be.	Bolj kot včasih.
That was big for me.	To je bilo zame veliko.
Apparently it's also the only thing he does.	Očitno je to tudi edina stvar, ki jo počne.
We didn't make it.	Ni nam uspelo.
I wasn't going to buy it either.	Tudi jaz ga nisem mislil kupiti.
Apparently that was it.	Očitno je bilo to to.
A lot of things.	Veliko stvari.
It's so hard.	Tako je težko.
There were simply too many.	Preprosto jih je bilo preveč.
I will forget him.	Pozabil ga bom.
So many people.	Toliko ljudi.
The game went very, very well.	Igra je šla zelo, zelo dobro.
They won't.	Ne bodo.
I thought you might want to come with me.	Mislil sem, da bi morda rad šel z mano.
Unfortunately, it's true.	Žal je res.
That was me.	To sem bil jaz.
He had had enough.	Imel je dovolj.
Nothing to do with you.	Nič vam s tabo.
I just want to know sooner.	Samo želim vedeti prej.
I don't know for sure.	Ne vem zagotovo.
It's not as simple as you think.	Ni tako preprosto, kot mislite.
Would or wouldn't.	Ali bi ali ne bi.
He likes to talk.	Rad govori.
That was it.	To je bilo tisto.
What is a.	Kaj je a.
Except maybe not so much.	Le da morda ne toliko.
Feel like home.	Počuti se kot doma.
No one talks to him.	Nihče ne govori z njim.
It's not really me.	Pravzaprav nisem jaz.
It will take time.	Potreboval bo čas.
John would have none of it.	John ne bi imel nič od tega.
No one ever talks about it.	Nihče nikoli ne govori o tem.
He has no time for me.	Nima časa zame.
He always thought it was not possible for someone like him.	Vedno je mislil, da to ni mogoče za nekoga, kot je on.
I can't reach him.	Ne morem do njega.
Tough question.	Težko vprašanje.
I loved this week.	Ta teden mi je bil všeč.
we do not know.	ne vemo.
The car has arrived.	Avto je prišel.
He was .	Bil je .
And no children.	In brez otrok.
Now he had his money.	Zdaj je imel svoj denar.
It's been a while.	Nekaj ​​časa je bilo.
I need it so much.	Tako zelo ga potrebujem.
And they did.	In to so storili.
That was the problem, he decided.	To je bil problem, se je odločil.
How nice of you.	Kako lepo od tebe.
Indeed, he probably was.	Res, verjetno je bil.
You should be fine.	Moral bi biti v redu.
I thought you knew.	Mislil sem, da veš.
Man, this is so hard.	Človek, to je tako težko.
Long time.	Dolgo časa.
Maybe he's all right.	Morda je z njim vse v redu.
I never felt good.	Nikoli se nisem dobro počutil.
She had to do this often.	To je morala pogosto početi.
That will be all for today.	To bo vse za danes.
I can't be sure.	Ne morem biti prepričan.
It looked like .	Videti je bilo kot .
I didn't think it was enough.	Ni se mi zdelo dovolj.
We've all been there.	Vsi smo takrat.
True, not always.	Res je, ne vedno.
All we have is money.	Vse kar imamo je denar.
But it's not very fast.	Vendar ni zelo hitro.
Everyone can and must and must.	Vsak lahko in mora in mora.
That's right.	Tako je.
He doesn't do that.	On tega ne počne.
You have to get out of here.	Tukaj moraš ven.
It was nothing like that.	Ni bilo nič takega.
But there is much more here.	A tukaj je še veliko več.
I had to help.	Moral sem pomagati.
I absolutely loved it.	Popolnoma mi je bilo všeč.
It was business as usual.	Bilo je kot običajno.
I will never go back this way again.	Nikoli več se ne bom vrnil na ta način.
Maybe it was too far ahead.	Mogoče je bilo preveč naprej.
That's as much as he told us.	To je toliko, kot nam je povedal.
And they should.	In morali bi.
Nobody said anything.	Nihče ni rekel ničesar.
I didn't know why.	Nisem vedel zakaj.
I never expected to see you here.	Nikoli nisem pričakoval, da te bom videl tukaj.
That was then, this is now.	To je bilo takrat, to je zdaj.
I still haven't made it.	Še vedno mi ni uspelo.
It often is.	Pogosto se je.
I was pretty good at it.	Bil sem kar dober v tem.
You were right the first time.	Prvič si imel prav.
That's it.	To je tisto.
We could almost be home.	Lahko bi bili skoraj doma.
He's not very good.	Ni zelo dober.
That's why he came.	Zato je prišel.
It is, but not for long.	Je, a ne za dolgo.
It's all or nothing.	Je za vse ali pa ni nič.
Even that is too much.	Tudi to je preveč.
I definitely don't want this anymore.	Tega zagotovo ne želim več.
I wasn't sure.	Nisem bil prepričan.
The more, the better.	Več kot je, tem bolje.
I'm glad we did.	Vesel sem, da smo.
And actually it was.	In pravzaprav je bilo.
Now he knew everything.	Zdaj je vedel vse.
This is really just like me.	To je res tako kot jaz.
We really did it.	Res nam je uspelo.
He just talked and talked and talked.	Samo govoril je in govoril in govoril.
It was so good to be with him again.	Bilo je tako dobro spet biti z njim.
He's just not ready for it.	Preprosto ni pripravljen na to.
You can't help me.	Ne moreš mi pomagati.
It better be good.	Bolje je, da je dobro.
Many people live there.	Tam živi veliko ljudi.
No one ever saw him again.	Nihče ga ni nikoli več videl.
Apparently not.	Očitno ni tako.
He was gone today too! 	Tudi danes je bil odšel!
all day.	ves dan.
I have too much money to work with.	Imam preveč denarja za delo.
I didn't want to.	Nisem hotel.
That's a problem for me.	Zame je to problem.
It is now.	Zdaj je.
It will always be there.	Vedno bo tam.
That's why everything happened.	Zato se je vse zgodilo.
It was anything but that.	Bilo je vse prej kot to.
I don't know where.	Ne vem kje.
And yet she wasn't.	Pa vendar ni bila.
He never won.	Nikoli ni zmagal.
And that's not right.	In to ni prav.
Sorry, it isn't.	Žal, ni.
Maybe that was the problem.	Mogoče je bil to problem.
Here's a question.	Tukaj je vprašanje.
Or maybe not.	Lahko pa tudi ne.
You shouldn't come to me.	Ne bi smel priti k meni.
And we have.	In imamo.
He knows it, and yet he doesn't.	On to ve, pa vendar ne.
But it wasn't that simple.	Vendar to ni bilo tako preprosto.
This happens to me too.	Tudi meni se to dogaja.
That's something, isn't it?	To je nekaj, kajne?
Maybe nothing would have happened.	Mogoče se ne bi zgodilo nič.
I had to move on.	Moral sem naprej.
I had enough money.	Imel sem dovolj denarja.
But it exists.	Vendar obstaja.
It's too much.	Preveč je.
We knew nothing.	Nič nismo vedeli.
But it is true.	Je pa res.
Maybe no one told her.	Mogoče ji nihče ni povedal.
They were right.	Imeli so prav.
He was never very good at it.	Nikoli ni bil zelo dober v tem.
I would if I had to.	Bi, če bi bilo treba.
So he decided.	Tako se je odločil.
Being back home.	Biti nazaj domov.
We know so little.	Tako malo vemo.
I want to go fast.	Želim iti hitro.
Like, that's my baby.	Kot, to je moj otrok.
He would do it.	On bi to naredil.
Which is also good.	Kar je tudi dobro.
I don't want to work.	Nočem delati.
Actually nothing.	Pravzaprav nič.
I didn't say that.	tega nisem rekel.
That makes me think you'll be fine!.	Zaradi tega mislim, da boš v redu!.
I thought that for a really long time.	To sem res dolgo mislil.
I really don't understand why.	Res ne razumem zakaj.
I know, it's hard to believe.	Vem, težko je verjeti.
But I didn't say that.	Vendar tega nisem rekel.
And maybe he just needs a job.	In morda samo potrebuje službo.
It seemed to help.	Zdelo se je, da pomaga.
You shouldn't do that.	Ne bi smel tega storiti.
You are the one.	Ti si tisti pravi.
The car has arrived.	Avto je prišel.
He soon felt better.	Kmalu se je počutil bolje.
I'm sure they'll be here soon.	Prepričan sem, da bodo kmalu tukaj.
He wanted to be nothing.	Hotel je biti nič.
He wasn't at home.	Ni ga bilo doma.
Tomorrow he would be gone.	Jutri bi ga ne bilo več.
I am very glad to have met you.	Zelo sem vesel, da sem te spoznal.
I'm not afraid of it.	Ne bojim se tega.
I like them.	Všeč so mi.
You know that.	Ti to veš.
That wasn't a problem.	To ni bil problem.
It had to be someone.	Nekdo je to moral biti.
Really good.	Res dobro.
Maybe there's more.	Mogoče je več.
He didn't know he was here.	Ni vedel, da je tukaj.
Probably not.	Verjetno ni.
I will meet her.	Spoznal jo bom.
I didn't always know that.	Tega nisem vedno vedel.
There really wasn't much there.	Tam res ni bilo veliko.
I mean boy.	Mislim fant.
I'm sure it's fine.	Prepričan sem, da je v redu.
Sometimes from people.	Včasih od ljudi.
I wouldn't say no.	Ne bi rekel ne.
He helped us a lot.	Zelo nam je pomagal.
I see you're not sure.	Vidim, da nisi prepričan.
What is happening to me.	Kaj se mi dogaja.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
I do not have any children	nimam otrok
The question is whether you mean it or not.	Vprašanje je, ali misliš resno ali ne.
She wasn't home enough.	Ni bila dovolj doma.
I will make dinner.	Naredil bom večerjo.
She was never into it.	Nikoli ni bila v tem.
But it didn't look like work.	Vendar ni bilo videti kot delo.
I bought a lot of things for you.	Kupil sem veliko stvari zate.
Everything would be fine.	Vse bi bilo v redu.
I'm sure about it.	Prepričan sem, o tem.
He had a house.	Imel je hišo.
I wouldn't do that.	Jaz tega ne bi naredil.
I hope someone can help.	Upam, da lahko kdo pomaga.
This is also common.	Tudi to je pogosto.
I mean, no one.	Mislim, nihče.
But something felt right.	Nekaj ​​pa se mi je zdelo prav.
We can't be sure about that.	O tem ne moremo biti prepričani.
I hope she feels better.	Upam, da se počuti bolje.
Talk to me.	Govori z mano.
You will be back.	Vrnil se boš.
But it wasn't good.	Vendar ni bilo dobro.
A lot happened with that.	Veliko se je zgodilo ob tem.
Only, not everything is so simple.	Samo, ni vse tako preprosto.
Just being in the city wasn't enough.	Samo biti v mestu ni bilo dovolj.
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
She had to talk about it.	Morala je govoriti o tem.
And not in the way you might think.	In ne tako, kot si morda mislite.
Nobody likes me.	Nihče me nima rad.
He's going.	On gre.
We all have them.	Vsi jih imamo.
Now you like it.	Zdaj ti je všeč.
Not right either.	Tudi ne prav.
But he wasn't sure he could.	A ni bil prepričan, da bi lahko.
I'd rather talk to him.	Raje bi govoril z njim.
I have to do everything.	Vse moram narediti.
This was something else.	To je bilo nekaj drugega.
You have what you want.	Imaš, kar želiš.
I will work for you.	Delal bom zate.
To this day she never said anything about it.	Do danes ni nikoli rekla ničesar o tem.
And no.	In ne.
Because I'm there.	Ker sem tam.
Sometimes it just comes, sometimes it goes.	Včasih samo pride, včasih gre.
It's okay to .	V redu je, da .
I don't like many people.	Ne maram veliko ljudi.
He worked as a teacher all his life.	Vse življenje je delal kot učitelj.
Nobody still likes you.	Nihče te še vedno nima rad.
That was all at the time.	Takrat je bilo to vse.
Not once, not once, and she knew it.	Ne enkrat, niti enkrat, in to je vedela.
That was it.	Toliko je bilo.
He was very happy.	Bil je zelo vesel.
Maybe a little too happy.	Mogoče malo preveč vesel.
He's never heard of you.	Nikoli ni slišal za vas.
None of us are talking.	Nihče od nas ne govori.
No one spoke at all.	Sploh nihče ni govoril.
It's not about you.	Ne gre zate.
And that's what you'll have to do.	In to je tisto, kar boste morali narediti.
She needs to see for herself what's here.	Sama mora videti, kaj je tukaj.
The game went well.	Igra je šla dobro.
I would say that.	To bi rekel.
He knows better than to do that.	On ve bolje, kot to storiti.
Because you know.	Ker veš.
There is no one to help us.	Nikogar ni, ki bi nam pomagal.
He probably likes it.	Verjetno mu je všeč.
I have my own life.	Imam svoje življenje.
He is a very good friend.	Je zelo dober prijatelj.
Does anyone know why? 	Ve kdo zakaj?
This is the right way.	To je pravi način.
You know you would.	Veš, da bi.
I don't understand you anymore.	Ne razumem te več.
But he hasn't gone there yet.	A tja še ni šel.
Again, we've seen it all.	Še enkrat, videli smo vse.
He played up to it.	Igral je do tega.
He looks like he can play.	Videti je, kot da zna igrati.
I think he can play forward.	Mislim, da lahko igra naprej.
I was all about it.	Bil sem ves o tem.
He heard her talking to the room.	Slišal jo je govoriti s sobo.
I mean it my friend.	Resno mislim, prijatelj.
It was more than that.	Bilo je več kot to.
I have to do something.	Nekaj ​​moram narediti.
I don't understand everything myself.	Sam ne razumem vsega.
I mean very well.	Mislim zelo dobro.
This was much better.	To je bilo veliko bolje.
A lot of them don't.	Veliko jih ne.
You may have the opportunity to do so.	Morda boste imeli priložnost za to.
He liked me.	Bil sem mu všeč.
There was nothing more.	Nič več ni bilo.
I'm not afraid of money.	Ne bojim se denarja.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Mogoče noče.
All this is supposed to be nice.	Vse to naj bi bilo lepo.
I feel very good in the morning.	Zjutraj se počutim zelo dobro.
As I should.	Kot bi moral.
I just got another one.	Pravkar imam drugega.
This father is not a father.	Ta oče ni oče.
Or you don't have to.	Ali pa ti ni treba.
I had to get out of here.	Moral sem od tukaj.
As fast as possible.	Tako hitro, kot je le mogoče.
Someone is doing it.	Nekdo to počne.
Everything that has ever happened will happen.	Vse, kar se je kdaj zgodilo, se bo zgodilo.
He was good to me.	Bil je dober do mene.
Once for me.	Enkrat zame.
A child wouldn't know.	Otrok ne bi vedel.
This is simply not the case.	Temu preprosto ni tako.
And you wouldn't know.	In ne bi vedel.
But they will.	Vendar bodo.
Mine has been around for a long time too.	Tudi moj je že dolgo.
Yes, this one too.	Da, tudi ta.
He couldn't do without it.	Brez tega ni mogel.
But there isn't much to do.	Vendar ni veliko za narediti.
He doesn't even speak.	Sploh ne govori.
However, this was not true.	Vendar to ni bilo res.
Not now.	Zdaj pa ne.
Nice, actually.	Lepo, pravzaprav.
You should do that.	To bi morali storiti.
Because I'm him.	Ker sem on.
This is hard for me to understand.	To težko razumem.
And saw you.	In videl tebe.
Like, really okay.	Kot, res v redu.
It worked very well and still does.	Uspelo je zelo dobro in je še vedno.
He also looked a little wrong.	Videti je bil tudi nekoliko narobe.
I would really like to see her.	Res bi jo rad videl.
I don't know how to proceed.	Ne vem kako naprej.
He sat back.	Sedel je nazaj.
The man simply put it out.	Človek ga je preprosto dal ven.
You are so right.	Tako prav imaš.
He couldn't believe any of it.	Nič od tega ni mogel verjeti.
I thought he was right.	Mislil sem, da ima prav.
We knew what was what.	Vedeli smo, kaj je kaj.
But I have a question.	Imam pa vprašanje.
He's right and he knows it.	Ima prav in to ve.
In entertainment.	V zabavi.
No one had it.	Nihče tega ni imel.
I suspect it will always be this way.	Sumim, da bo vedno tako.
I just don't want it.	Samo tega nočem.
You'll get your chance.	Dobil boš svojo priložnost.
But that didn't happen.	Vendar se to ni zgodilo.
I am too	jaz sem tudi
This job is serious.	To delo je resno.
Maybe you'll hear from me tomorrow.	Morda se boš jutri slišal.
There is nothing more I can do about it.	Glede tega ne morem narediti nič več.
I hope yours was better.	Upam, da je bil tvoj boljši.
What a good child you are.	Kako dober otrok si.
There is nothing else in the room.	V sobi ni ničesar drugega.
It was totally.	Bilo je popolnoma.
Somebody talk to me.	Naj nekdo govori z mano.
There's always something to do.	Vedno je treba kaj narediti.
And it's not difficult.	In to ni težko.
They didn't have much time.	Niso imeli veliko časa.
Even if you don't.	Tudi če ne.
It's not like .	Ni kot .
She was very good at it.	Bila je zelo dobra v tem.
It can't be money.	To ne more biti denar.
And actually he didn't because he didn't let it.	In pravzaprav ni, ker tega ni pustil.
You'd never know.	Nikoli ne bi vedel.
I think he moved on.	Mislim, da je šel naprej.
All on me.	Vsi na mene.
Everything happened very quickly.	Vse se je zgodilo zelo hitro.
I wish it wasn't like that.	Želim si, da ne bi bilo tako.
I can see you are surprised.	Vidim, da si presenečen.
He did, he didn't.	Je, ni imel.
Hence my question.	Zato moje vprašanje.
You're a good kid.	Ti si dober otrok.
Which almost happened.	Kar se je skoraj zgodilo.
And for all people.	In za vse ljudi.
I have not encountered this before.	S tem se še nisem srečal.
You won't leave me anything.	Ničesar mi ne boš pustil.
He was the next to leave.	Bil je naslednji, ki je odšel.
It will be very good for all of us.	Vsem nam bo zelo dobro.
I could tell it was serious.	Lahko bi rekel, da je resno.
And this one.	In ta.
I came up with it myself.	Sam sem prišel do tega.
He preferred to come home.	Raje je prišel domov.
No, he didn't come.	Ne, ni prišel.
Can it be.	Ali je lahko.
It was too much for me.	Zame je bilo preveč.
Why, he wasn't sure.	Zakaj, ni bil prepričan.
For all.	Za vse.
No, that would be my job and he knew it.	Ne, to bi bilo moje delo in on je to vedel.
Okay, almost everyone.	V redu, skoraj vsi.
Normally it wouldn't be much.	Običajno to ne bi bilo veliko.
I probably shouldn't.	Verjetno ne bi smel.
I think she likes it.	Mislim, da ji je všeč.
And he obviously wanted something.	In očitno je nekaj hotel.
It never did, it never will.	Nikoli ni uspelo, nikoli ne bo.
I decided not to.	Odločil sem se, da ne bom.
Everything was good.	Vse je bilo dobro.
You had to.	Moral si.
I thought it was something like that.	Mislil sem, da je nekaj takega.
And that was always fine with everyone.	In to je bilo vedno v redu za vse.
No one knows about it.	Nihče ne ve za to.
It's hard work.	To je težko delo.
He didn't tell her.	Ni ji povedal.
There is no money.	Denar ni.
But only a little.	Vendar le malo.
Okay, it wasn't much.	V redu, ni bilo veliko.
I've heard them all.	Vse sem jih slišal.
I wouldn't even know you were here.	Sploh ne bi vedela, da si tukaj.
I didn't have time to do anything.	Nisem imel časa narediti ničesar.
That he hasn't forgotten you.	Da te ni pozabil.
I just want him back.	Samo želim ga nazaj.
I don't want him anymore.	Nočem ga več.
I'm sure it's not that.	Prepričan sem, da ni to.
It's that simple.	To je tako preprosto.
I doubt he speaks for me.	Dvomim, da govori namesto mene.
He feels better and better every day.	Vsak dan se počuti bolje in bolje.
It's been there for a long time.	Tam je že dolgo.
I always wanted to go there.	Vedno sem si želel iti tja.
But I didn't say that.	Vendar tega nisem rekel.
That's fine.	To je v redu.
Don't think he can't.	Ne mislite, da ne more.
This and much more.	To in še veliko več.
Sometimes this is not a problem.	Včasih to ni problem.
Nothing to see here.	Tukaj ni ničesar videti.
When none of that is true.	Ko nič od tega ni res.
But nothing can be done.	Vendar ni mogoče storiti ničesar.
She didn't know how he found her.	Kako jo je našel, ni vedela.
That's what I did.	To sem naredil.
But we were lucky.	Vendar smo imeli srečo.
I don't see why it would be a problem.	Ne razumem, zakaj bi bil problem.
That wasn't the only reason.	To ni bil edini razlog.
That's probably true.	To je verjetno res.
He will do whatever he likes.	Delal bo vse, kar mu bo všeč.
No, you won't eat them.	Ne, ne boš jih jedel.
How is that even possible.	Kako je to sploh mogoče.
We were very into it.	Zelo smo bili v tem.
He asked why.	Vprašal je zakaj.
We're gone tomorrow.	Jutri nas ni.
As if he knew.	Kot da bi vedel.
If I didn't, I would die.	Če ne bi, bi umrl.
They're fine fast.	Hitro so v redu.
And no, it wasn't.	In ne, ni bilo.
But they weren't there last week.	A prejšnji teden jih ni bilo.
You were right about that.	Imel si prav glede tega.
He must see her.	Videti jo mora.
Good thing you're back now.	Še dobro, da si se zdaj vrnil.
I'll go and return it right away.	Takoj bom šel in ga vrnil.
Not an option.	Ni možnost.
Maybe never again.	Mogoče nikoli več.
I feel good.	Počutim se dobro.
His father called him.	Poklical ga je oče.
And anyone can do it.	In vsak lahko to stori.
There is so little time.	Tako malo časa je.
I did everything here.	Vse sem naredil tukaj.
They are for us and only us.	So za nas in samo za nas.
I'd like to do that.	To bi rad naredil.
I've known her for a long time.	Poznam jo že dolgo.
It really didn't make me feel any better.	Zaradi tega se res nisem počutil bolje.
However, much remains to be done.	Vendar je treba še veliko narediti.
But he knew it would happen someday.	A vedel je, da bo nekoč.
I wanted to see.	Hotel sem videti.
That seemed highly unlikely.	To se je zdelo zelo malo verjetno.
I have it backwards.	Imam ga za nazaj.
It's on the car.	Na avto je.
There are a few.	Nekaj ​​jih je.
But I'm not.	Jaz pa nisem.
Surely no one wanted that.	Zagotovo si tega nihče ni želel.
She'll be better now that you're here.	Zdaj ji bo bolje, ko si tukaj.
Not so soon.	Ne tako kmalu.
Dad couldn't do anything.	Oče ni mogel narediti ničesar.
But he is not alone.	A ni sam.
It was difficult.	Bilo je težko.
Not really a good thing.	Pravzaprav ni dobra stvar.
Can anyone please help regarding this.	Ali lahko kdo prosim pomaga glede tega.
This is actually a good thing for us.	Za nas je to pravzaprav dobra stvar.
He was saying something.	Nekaj ​​je govoril.
Something or other.	Nekaj ​​ali drugega.
It doesn't work.	Ne gre.
He was fine yesterday.	Včeraj je bil v redu.
I played quite a bit.	Kar malo sem igral.
He can't stay still.	Ne zna ostati na mestu.
Fortunately, that was not the case.	Na srečo ni bilo tako.
This wasn't the right guy.	To ni bil pravi fant.
She just didn't know what.	Samo ni vedela, kaj.
I'm not sure what he's going to do.	Nisem prepričan, kaj bo naredil.
They were last Monday.	Prejšnji ponedeljek so bili.
I have been there often.	Pogosto sem bil tam.
Some, but not much.	Nekaj, a ne veliko.
Not now and never was.	Ne zdaj in ni bilo nikoli.
I could leave it.	Lahko bi ga pustil.
Not any of you.	Ne nihče od vas.
And you should know what you mean.	In morali bi vedeti, kaj mislite.
I didn't do anything.	Nič nisem naredil.
Without him, we would have nothing.	Brez njega ne bi imeli ničesar.
He said that a lot.	To je rekel veliko.
Now he knows even better.	Zdaj ve še bolje.
Maybe there is a better way to do this.	Mogoče obstaja boljši način za to.
Even if it seemed that way.	Tudi če bi se tako zdelo.
They always did the right thing.	Vedno so naredili prav.
She was mine all along.	Ves čas je bila moja.
Mine stayed too.	Tudi moj je ostal.
None of this seemed too difficult.	Nič od tega se ni zdelo preveč težko.
I must have forgotten.	Verjetno sem pozabil.
Luckily we didn't.	Na srečo nismo.
But I like how you did it.	Vendar mi je všeč, kako si to naredil.
What could be.	Kaj bi lahko bilo.
Now we can do better.	Zdaj smo lahko boljši.
He didn't actually hear anything.	Pravzaprav ni slišal ničesar.
Don't think.	Ne misli .
Not with him.	Ne z njim.
He made up his mind immediately.	Takoj se je odločil.
This was much better.	To je bilo veliko bolje.
I have so much here.	Tukaj imam toliko.
But never alone.	Nikoli pa sama.
Not even like that.	Niti ne tako.
There is much to be done.	Veliko je treba narediti.
He didn't move on.	Ni šel naprej.
Not like my father.	Ne kot moj oče.
It is what it is, right?	Je kar je, kajne?
I heard about you.	Slišal sem zate.
Today is today, this is life.	Danes je danes, to je življenje.
It didn't look good.	Ni bilo videti dobro.
That's all we got.	To je vse, kar imamo.
I hope you are doing well.	Upam, da ti gre dobro.
Fortunately, she didn't have to.	Na srečo ji ni bilo treba.
He couldn't believe how tired he was.	Ni mogel verjeti, kako je utrujen.
I have money.	Imam denar.
I want you here.	Želim ti tukaj.
It's not like that.	Ni tako.
Better not to know.	Bolje ne vedeti.
Something was wrong.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe.
I had to do it too.	Tudi jaz sem moral to narediti.
Let me see, here it is.	Naj vidim, tukaj je.
This is something else.	To je nekaj drugega.
No need to go any further.	Ni treba iti več.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
He's still my baby.	Še vedno je moj otrok.
And you'll get a job.	In dobil boš delo.
I'm sorry for everyone.	Žal mi je za vse.
But he doesn't feel well.	Vendar se ne počuti dobro.
A man would.	Človek bi.
Here's something else.	Tukaj je še nekaj.
Very very much.	Zelo zelo veliko.
So much about it feels wrong.	Toliko o tem se zdi narobe.
You would love it.	Všeč bi ti bilo.
It's better than it was.	Bolje je, kot je bilo.
And he obviously knows a lot more than we do.	In očitno ve veliko več kot mi.
Or he gave me time.	Ali pa mi je dal čas.
It's good, but problems.	Dober je, a težave.
I just want to say.	Samo povedati želim.
Never was, never will be.	Nikoli ni bilo, nikoli ne bo.
.	.
We all knew he did.	Vsi smo vedeli, da je to storil.
I don't mean to do that.	Ne mislim tega storiti.
Obviously you can.	Očitno lahko.
I could always find someone else to help me.	Vedno bi lahko našel koga drugega, ki bi mi pomagal.
You can still be better.	Še vedno si lahko boljši.
You spoke.	Govoril si.
Actually, it's not like that.	Pravzaprav ni tako.
As they were for all of us.	Kot so bili za vse nas.
That's all it is.	Samo to je.
We should.	Morali bi .
I just think there's more to it.	Samo mislim, da je na tem še več.
I can't talk for long.	Ne morem dolgo govoriti.
Very good work.	Zelo dobro delo.
We don't have to play nice anymore.	Ni nam več treba igrati lepo.
He was no more than a child.	Ni bil več kot otrok.
We'll have to leave.	Morali bomo oditi.
A child, are you.	Otrok, ali si.
We could have many children.	Lahko bi imeli veliko otrok.
They may not even be there.	Lahko jih tudi ni tam.
I really don't know anymore.	Res ne vem več.
I would know everything.	Vse bi vedel.
Something happened and.	Nekaj ​​se je zgodilo in.
There was nothing for it.	Nič ni bilo za to.
He just says he needs more time.	Samo pravi, da potrebuje več časa.
And there it goes.	In tam gre.
I ate in my room.	Jedel sem v svoji sobi.
If not sorry.	Če ne žal.
There may not be time soon.	Morda kmalu ne bo časa.
There I saw it, heard it.	Tam sem videl, to slišal.
Apparently not much.	Očitno ni veliko.
We've seen that before.	To smo že videli.
Today it is.	Danes se je.
Something needs to be done about this.	Glede tega je treba nekaj narediti.
I didn't do it.	Jaz tega nisem naredil.
Went to dinner.	Šla na večerjo.
Right and wrong.	Prav in narobe.
He didn't think she really wanted to know.	Ni mislil, da res želi vedeti.
I think it's so good.	Mislim, da je tako dobro.
I'll start right away.	Takoj bom začel.
We didn't know.	Nismo vedeli.
I have many, many thoughts.	Imam veliko, veliko misli.
He didn't tell me anything.	Povedal mi ni ničesar.
I loved her very much.	Zelo sem jo imel rad.
I would do anything to help him.	Naredil bi vse, da bi mu pomagal.
That was me.	To sem bil jaz.
That should be good enough.	To mora biti dovolj dobro.
I think he must be angry now.	Mislim, da mora biti zdaj jezen.
I didn't want to go there.	Nisem hotel iti tja.
There were quite a few.	Bilo jih je kar nekaj.
Actually, we both are.	Pravzaprav sva oba.
They are for people.	Za ljudi so.
No, we won't.	Ne, ne bomo.
Not just me, everyone.	Ne samo meni, vsem.
Work, work, work.	Delo, delo, delo.
If I did, I would know about it.	Če bi, bi vedel za to.
It wasn't very long.	Ni bilo prav dolgo.
He was much better.	Bil je veliko boljši.
Today we know better, fortunately.	Danes vemo bolje, na srečo.
I wouldn't do it myself.	Sam tega ne bi naredil.
It's always so nice with you.	Pri vas je vedno tako lepo.
It can't be that.	Ne more biti to.
This is none of those things.	To ni nič od tega.
He's not even there anymore.	Sploh ga ni več.
Maybe a lot more.	Mogoče veliko več.
She loved it and you love her.	Všeč ji je bilo in ti jo imaš rad.
I wasn't sorry.	Ni mi bilo žal.
But he didn't know where.	Ni pa vedel kam.
I have nothing.	Nimam ničesar.
A person who.	Oseba, ki.
He thinks you are.	Misli, da si.
She didn't say anything about it.	O tem ni rekla nič.
This is not difficult to do today.	Tega danes ni težko narediti.
He was good.	Bil je dober.
Not three days.	Ne tri dni.
I'll get it back.	Dobil bom nazaj.
I'll be fine now.	Bom zdaj v redu.
It is very difficult for me.	Zelo težko mi je.
Soon everyone would know who he was.	Kmalu bi vsi vedeli, kdo je.
It was nice.	Lepo je bilo.
You would love it.	Všeč bi ti bil.
Sorry, nothing worked.	Žal, nič ni uspelo.
Maybe that's true.	Morda je res tako.
I won't allow that.	Tega ne bom dovolil.
he made up his mind.	on se je odločil.
But maybe it really won't.	Morda pa res ne bo.
This man has lost everything.	Ta človek je izgubil vse.
First, it is always very difficult.	Prvič, vedno je zelo težko.
He needs someone to help him.	Potrebuje nekoga, ki mu bo pomagal.
No, that's not true.	Ne, to ni res.
And he does it himself.	In to stori sam.
And he always looked tired.	In vedno je bil videti utrujen.
You are true.	Si res.
It was true.	Res je bilo.
Nobody ever gave him anything.	Nihče mu ni nikoli ničesar dal.
We don't know why he thinks it's wrong.	Ne vemo, zakaj misli, da je narobe.
Maybe he doesn't live here anymore.	Mogoče ne živi več tukaj.
He was just something else.	Bil je le nekaj drugega.
Someone spoke.	Nekdo je govoril.
I'm just surprised, that's all.	Samo presenečen sem, to je vse.
I wanted him to be a child.	Želela sem, da bi bil otrok.
That could be true.	To bi lahko bilo res.
We don't know enough to be sure yet.	Ne vemo še dovolj, da bi bili prepričani.
Probably too much.	Verjetno preveč.
My father didn't want to leave.	Moj oče ni hotel oditi.
I'd better forget.	Bolje bi bilo, da bi pozabil.
I know you will too.	Vem, da boš tudi ti.
That's what they're here for.	Tukaj so za to.
Must be ready for work immediately.	Takoj mora biti pripravljen za delo.
I will say.	Bom rekel.
He always did everything right.	Vedno je vse naredil prav.
And that cannot be.	In to ne more biti.
He can help you.	Lahko ti pomaga.
It's just work.	To je samo delo.
You can't make more, you can't buy more.	Ne moreš narediti več, ne moreš kupiti več.
It doesn't work without him anyway.	Brez njega tako ali tako ne gre.
It just felt like it needed to be done.	Zdelo se je, kot da je treba narediti.
I won't forget.	Ne bom pozabil.
Not if only here.	Ni če le tukaj.
This is the reason for the question.	To je razlog za vprašanje.
I may not know today.	Danes morda ne vem.
That's all right.	To je vse v redu.
He says you weren't.	Pravi, da nisi bil.
This is a difficult question.	To je težko vprašanje.
I still want it.	Še vedno si ga želim.
And they did just that.	In naredili so prav to.
He said he wanted something more.	Rekel je, da želi nekaj več.
No matter what anyone wants.	Ne glede na to, kaj si kdo želi.
That was enough.	To je bilo dovolj.
It's simple.	Preprosto je.
There weren't too many people there.	Tam ni bilo preveč ljudi.
I don't want any of that.	Nočem nič od tega.
He became nothing.	Postal je nič.
I feel better.	Počutim se bolje.
It can only be me.	Lahko sem samo jaz.
That's fast.	To je hitro.
It was fine.	Bilo je v redu.
We will too.	Tudi mi bomo.
Hope you like this one.	Upam, da vam bo ta všeč.
It was something.	Bilo je nekaj.
I wasn't alone either.	Tudi jaz nisem bil sam.
I heard all that and more.	Vse to sem slišal in še več.
They were still in place.	Še vedno so bili na mestu.
Actually, it's not.	Pravzaprav ni.
I did everything.	Naredil sem vse.
If only you could see me now.	Ko bi me le videl zdaj.
It's not difficult at all.	Sploh ni težko.
It's not even early.	Niti ni zgodaj.
And it still is.	In še vedno je.
And there is nothing we can do about it.	In glede tega ne moremo storiti ničesar.
That person just wouldn't do it.	Ta oseba tega preprosto ne bi storila.
Even everything, if you were lucky.	Tudi vse, če bi imel srečo.
Someone I would love so much.	Nekoga, ki bi ga imel tako rad.
I asked him to come.	Prosil sem ga, naj pride.
I thought maybe he needed help.	Mislil sem, da morda potrebuje pomoč.
That was too much.	To je bilo preveč.
Today was much better.	Danes je bilo veliko bolje.
I'm afraid of it now.	Zdaj se bojim tega.
We've all done it.	To smo storili vsi.
Sometimes just for fun.	Včasih samo za zabavo.
She's gone, she's just gone.	Ni je več, preprosto ni več.
I feel so good about it.	Tako dobro se počutim glede tega.
How hard it feels now.	Kako težko se počuti zdaj.
Not for a few more years.	Še nekaj let ne.
And you are not alone.	In niste sami.
This is already happening.	To se že dogaja.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
Except it was more than that.	Le da je bilo več kot to.
He just didn't know how to do it yet.	Samo še ni vedel, kako to narediti.
I really want to work with him.	Zelo si želim delati z njim.
He doesn't even talk about getting back together.	Sploh ne govori o tem, da bi bila spet skupaj.
That would soon be me.	To bi bil kmalu jaz.
He asked her why.	Vprašal jo je zakaj.
Let it be all that.	Naj bo vse to.
Yes, we really do have it all.	Da, res imamo vse.
And it's really not that hard.	In res ni tako težko.
He is my person.	On je moja oseba.
He seems to be doing much better.	Zdi se, da mu gre veliko bolje.
He wanted to be alone.	Hotel je biti sam.
Or maybe he doesn't have one.	Ali pa ga morda nima.
Me with him.	Jaz z njim.
It's really not hard.	Res ni težko.
She was never here.	Nikoli je ni bilo tukaj.
Not that we are.	Ne da smo.
I would like some help.	Rad bi malo pomoči.
No one wanted him here.	Nihče si ga ni želel tukaj.
For what, he didn't say.	Za kaj, ni povedal.
It's already nice.	Je že lepo.
These are.	To so.
He didn't work alone.	Ni delal sam.
I had to see him.	Moral sem ga videti.
He really is that good.	Res je tako dober.
No one knows where he is now.	Nihče ne ve, kje je zdaj.
I won't do that to you.	Tega ti ne bom naredil.
I didn't need to know before.	Prej mi ni bilo treba vedeti.
Not everyone is.	Niso vsi.
We can't do much.	Ne moremo narediti veliko.
To each his own.	Vsak po svoje.
And it's all true.	In vse je res.
And they will.	In bodo.
He didn't like it there.	Tam mu ni bilo všeč.
It would be just like this one.	To bi bilo tako kot ta.
I didn't hear what it was.	Nisem slišal, kaj je bilo.
That's why he wanted it in the first place.	Zato si je tega sploh želel.
Something he does just for me.	Nekaj, kar počne samo zaradi mene.
When it's there, it's there.	Ko je tam, je tam.
Well, he left.	Pa je odšel.
Why does it have to be so difficult?	Zakaj mora biti to tako težko?
I really should go home.	Res bi moral iti domov.
I would have it again.	Spet bi ga imel.
The boy is still there.	Fant je še vedno tam.
I gave him that.	To sem mu dal.
No, it's not always like that.	Ne, ni vedno tako.
If he did that.	Če bi to storil.
He was with me all day.	Ves dan je bil z mano.
Still actually.	Pravzaprav še vedno.
I already told you that.	To sem ti že povedal.
Knowing them, it could be true.	Če jih poznam, bi lahko bilo res.
That's why this problem exists.	Zato ta problem obstaja.
That was so wrong.	To je bilo tako narobe.
I have a job.	Imam delo.
He decided that was enough for now.	Odločil se je, da je za zdaj dovolj.
But he knew better than that.	Vendar je vedel bolje od tega.
He asked what he should do.	Vprašal je, kaj naj naredi.
He was only human.	Bil je le človek.
I never thought.	Nikoli si nisem mislil.
We didn't do anything wrong.	Ničesar nismo naredili narobe.
Usually very quickly.	Običajno zelo hitro.
I believe.	Verjamem.
It never was and never will be.	Nikoli ni bilo in nikoli ne bo.
To do that.	Da bi to naredil.
There was nothing to eat.	Nič ni bilo za jesti.
He was just busy.	Samo zaposlen je bil.
I think he wanted to talk to me.	Mislim, da je hotel govoriti z mano.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
Just like he told you.	Tako kot ti je rekel.
I wish I didn't talk that way.	Želim si, da ne bi govoril na ta način.
Everything is wrong.	Vse je narobe.
Because he can't go back.	Ker ne more nazaj.
That's not true at all.	To sploh ni res.
Everything was there.	Tam je bilo vse.
It wasn't for me.	Ni bilo zame.
I would be there by tomorrow.	Do jutri bi bil tam.
It was true.	Res je bilo.
But it is also much more than that.	Vendar je tudi veliko več kot to.
Everything seems possible.	Zdi se, da je vse mogoče.
I know about you.	Vem zate.
I think that's a good thing too.	Tudi jaz mislim, da je to dobra stvar.
That's not what you have at all.	To sploh ni tisto, kar imaš.
If not now.	Če ne zdaj.
I didn't say anything.	Nič nisem rekel.
It must be zero.	Mora biti nič.
Now he had everything.	Zdaj je imel vse.
And we had a great time.	In imeli smo se lepo.
And here it is.	In tukaj je.
It's not easy.	Ni lahko.
He felt better.	Počutil se je bolje.
A friend asked how he was.	Prijatelj je vprašal, kako je.
No, it was too much.	Ne, bilo je preveč.
That's when I saw.	Takrat sem videl.
I didn't go after him.	Nisem šel za njim.
As has been my whole life.	Kot je bilo vse moje življenje.
Something was wrong with him.	Nekaj ​​ni bilo v redu z njim.
I have so much to say.	Toliko imam za povedati.
There was too much to do.	Preveč je bilo treba narediti.
If so, that's good.	Če je tako, je to dobro.
And you? 	In ti?
.	.
I found it.	Našel sem ga.
Really simple.	Res preprosto.
She didn't tell me anything.	Nič mi ni rekla.
Which it should be.	Kar tudi mora biti.
You always want to know where the person is.	Vedno želite vedeti, kje je oseba.
Nobody cares now.	Zdaj nikogar ne zanima.
He liked to talk.	Rad je govoril.
You probably already know this.	To verjetno že veste.
I think that would be pretty obvious.	Mislim, da bi bilo to precej očitno.
Not from him.	Ne od njega.
This is quite common and you have definitely seen it before.	To je precej pogosto in zagotovo ste ga že videli.
I won't ask.	Ne bom vprašal.
It's not going back.	Ne gre nazaj.
Where are they.	Kje so.
That always seems to be the case.	Zdi se, da je vedno tako.
Or a long life.	Ali dolgo življenje.
We may not have to.	Morda nam ne bo treba.
Sometimes it goes well, sometimes it doesn't.	Včasih gre dobro, včasih pa ne.
We failed to do so here.	Tukaj nam tega ni uspelo.
You will never be like us.	Nikoli ne boš kot mi.
He doesn't know children.	Ne pozna otrok.
This is so good.	To je tako dobro.
He seems to have done quite well.	Zdi se, da mu je kar dobro uspelo.
We have to do this.	To moramo storiti.
Actually before that.	Pravzaprav pred tem.
And I would.	In tudi bi.
They can no longer be made.	Ni jih več mogoče narediti.
She liked it immediately.	Takoj ji je bilo všeč.
It's so beautiful.	Tako je lepo.
Forever, if he's lucky.	Za vedno, če bo imel srečo.
Yes, he is.	Da, on je.
There was no one here.	Tukaj ni bilo nikogar.
She went out.	Šla je ven.
And that's it, you know.	In to je to, veš.
But he had to be sure.	Vendar je moral biti prepričan.
I thought when you left last night.	Mislil sem, ko si sinoči odšel.
Unfortunately it isn't.	Žal ni.
He has no other job.	Nima drugega dela.
It doesn't exist and never will.	Ne obstaja in ne bo nikoli.
No, more back.	Ne, bolj nazaj.
Everyone knew why.	Vsi so vedeli zakaj.
I think he knew that.	Mislim, da je to vedel.
We have to leave.	Moramo oditi.
I'm doing well.	Dobro mi gre.
You really are alone.	Res si samo.
I have a job.	službo imam.
If even.	Če sploh.
That may be true.	To je morda res.
I didn't like that.	To mi ni bilo všeč.
She was here in town.	Bila je tukaj v mestu.
It's true that it wasn't difficult for us.	Res je, da nam ni bilo težko.
You didn't do anything wrong.	Nič nisi naredil narobe.
That's not what we have here.	To ni tisto, kar imamo tukaj.
To get to.	Priti do.
Everyone knew who they were.	Vsi so vedeli, kdo so.
They were fine with it.	Bili so v redu s tem.
But there really weren't any.	A jih res ni bilo.
But it was a good question.	Bilo pa je dobro vprašanje.
Will probably get more again.	Verjetno bo spet dobil več.
That was gone too.	Tudi tega ni bilo več.
This is who and what we are.	To je kdo in kaj smo.
It's something else!.	Je nekaj drugega!.
Instead, she said nothing.	Namesto tega ni rekla ničesar.
But he couldn't seem to leave.	Vendar se je zdelo, da ne more oditi.
There was something wrong with the way he felt.	Nekaj ​​je bilo narobe s tem, kako se je počutil.
He decided to give it.	Odločil se je, da ga bo dal.
To do so.	Narediti tako.
We know what needs to be done.	Vemo, kaj je treba storiti.
Probably as soon as he could get to him.	Verjetno takoj, ko je lahko prišel do njega.
We never saw anything.	Nikoli nismo videli ničesar.
You all knew.	Vsi ste vedeli.
He didn't need to see that.	Tega mu ni bilo treba videti.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Nočem več govoriti o tem.
But it didn't seem likely.	Vendar se ni zdelo verjetno.
That's it.	To je tisto.
It's hard not to be.	Težko je ne biti.
Fortunately, we never had to.	Na srečo nam nikoli ni bilo treba.
Is there a way to do this?.	Ali obstaja način za to?.
He seems like a good guy.	Videti je kot dober fant.
He was happy.	Bil je vesel.
However, this will not be the case.	Vendar temu ne bo tako.
I love doing it.	Rad to počnem.
Let me see the book.	Naj vidim knjigo.
And I might have been.	In morda bi bil.
Not so much.	Ne tako zelo.
I'm so afraid of him.	Tako se ga bojim.
He is like a child.	Je kot otrok.
I'm not good anymore.	Nisem več dober.
I don't think this is good.	Mislim, da to ni dobro.
It certainly isn't.	Zagotovo ni.
I won't hear anything.	Ničesar ne bom slišal.
In .	V .
No one talks about it.	Nihče ne govori o tem.
This life is no longer life.	To življenje ni več življenje.
What is afraid of me.	Kaj se me boji.
Then as now.	Takrat, kot zdaj.
We had so little time.	Imeli smo tako malo časa.
It can go.	Lahko gre.
Sam is still alone.	Sam je še vedno sam.
But there was an opportunity.	Vendar je bila priložnost.
Life was pretty good.	Življenje je bilo kar dobro.
I don't even want to say.	Sploh nočem povedati.
Everything was right here, right now.	Vse je bilo prav tukaj, prav zdaj.
We had three.	Imeli smo tri.
I sat down again.	Spet sem sedel.
We have money.	Denar imamo.
You can know that right now.	To lahko prav zdaj veste.
But I was lucky to get this job.	Vendar sem imel srečo, da sem dobil to službo.
I still can't believe someone wanted this.	Še vedno ne morem verjeti, da si je nekdo to želel.
He was often absent.	Pogosto ga ni bilo.
He told me you would come here.	Rekel mi je, da boš prišel sem.
And you should be here.	In moral bi biti tukaj.
I called them together.	Poklical sem jih skupaj.
And maybe that's true even today.	In morda je to res še danes.
Yes, just that.	Da, samo to.
I will give it.	dal ga bom.
I'm sure everything will be fine.	Prepričan sem, da bo vse v redu.
Maybe he already knows we're here.	Morda že ve, da smo tukaj.
That was for sure.	To je bilo zagotovo.
No, you know that.	Ne, to veš.
He left.	Odšel je.
Now or never.	Zdaj ali nikoli.
He says yes.	Pravi, da.
As fast as possible.	Kar se da hitro.
That's all.	To je vse.
Maybe it wouldn't.	Morda ne bi.
He looked beyond tired.	Videti je bil več kot utrujen.
What to do next?.	Kaj storiti naprej?.
And still.	In še vedno.
Nobody cares what I would do to you.	Nikogar ne zanima, kaj bi ti naredil.
I went to him.	Šla sem do njega.
I'll give them all to you.	dal ti jih bom vse.
He said he had to go.	Rekel je, da mora iti.
Someone would find them.	Nekdo bi jih našel.
And that's me.	In to sem jaz.
I hope there are many more people like you.	Upam, da je še veliko ljudi, kot si ti.
I couldn't take it anymore.	Nisem mogel več.
He didn't ask us.	Ni nas vprašal.
I wish he would stay.	Želim si, da bi ostal.
There again tonight.	Nocoj spet tam.
I am surprised by this.	Presenečen sem nad tem.
Life is hard enough as it is.	Življenje je dovolj težko, kot je.
Today is such a good day.	Danes je tako dober dan.
Or just know.	Ali pa samo vedeti.
How does he feel about it?.	Kako se počuti glede tega?.
I will come alone.	Prišel bom sam.
I have to see him.	Moram ga videti.
It's fine with me.	Z mano je v redu.
It's true, it's not.	Res je, ni.
I just want it to be here already.	Samo želim, da je že tukaj.
I didn't want anyone to know.	Nisem želel, da bi kdo vedel.
I need it.	Potrebujem ga.
I believe you are not.	Verjamem, da nisi.
Maybe they were never there.	Mogoče jih nikoli ni bilo tam.
She loved everything about it.	Všeč ji je bilo vse na tem.
I've been a good boy all along.	Ves čas sem bil dober fant.
What's not to like.	Kaj ni všeč.
It never is.	Nikoli ni.
None of that money gets to anyone else.	Nič od tega denarja ne pride do nikogar drugega.
I was a child.	Bil sem otrok.
For a long time.	Že dolgo časa.
It will never happen.	Nikoli se ne bo zgodilo.
Because I'm here.	Ker sem tukaj.
But there aren't any.	Vendar jih ni.
I know you really don't want to do this.	Vem, da tega res ne želiš storiti.
He actually did.	Pravzaprav je to storil.
It would also take time.	Potreboval bi tudi čas.
He knew something.	Nekaj ​​je vedel.
It really made me feel good.	Zaradi tega sem se res dobro počutil.
I saw this last night.	To sem videl sinoči.
Once a week for a while.	Enkrat na teden nekaj časa.
You may have seen it.	Morda ste ga videli.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.	Žal temu ni tako.
That will never happen.	To se ne bo nikoli zgodilo.
He knows it and we know it.	On to ve in mi to vemo.
She didn't know what to do.	Ni vedela, kaj naj naredi.
Fortunately, they didn't have that many things.	Na srečo niso imeli toliko stvari.
He called him for help.	Poklical ga je na pomoč.
But not anymore.	Vendar ne več.
I know everyone is here too.	Vem, da so tudi vsi tukaj.
No one was to be seen.	Nikogar ni bilo videti.
A lot of people say that.	To pravi veliko ljudi.
I'll never know for sure.	Nikoli ne bom zagotovo vedel.
I'll call him.	Poklical ga bom.
Boy, have we ever.	Fant, ali sva kdaj.
I never said or did anything.	Nikoli nisem rekel ali naredil ničesar.
To tell her everything was going to be okay.	Da bi ji rekel, da bo vse v redu.
That's how it was here.	Tako je bilo tukaj.
Years and years of it.	Leta in leta tega.
But that's not a problem.	Vendar to ni problem.
I knew immediately.	Takoj sem vedel.
It was mine, okay.	Bil je moj, v redu.
Certainly not Tom.	Tom zagotovo ne.
He seems to like it there.	Zdi se, da mu je tam všeč.
I know everything.	Poznam vse.
It was so good to do that.	Tako dobro je bilo to narediti.
I didn't know if I should believe him.	Nisem vedel, ali naj mu verjamem.
You didn't do any of that.	Nič od tega nisi naredil.
I didn't regret anything at all.	Prav nič mi ni bilo žal.
I would work.	delal bi.
Yes, it can and it is.	Da, lahko in tudi je.
I don't know why anyone would be there.	Ne vem, zakaj bi bil kdo tam.
I wasn't even human.	Sploh nisem bil človek.
And here's the problem.	In tukaj je problem.
That's also a possibility.	Tudi to je možnost.
There are already many of them.	Veliko jih je že.
Many people.	Veliko ljudi.
She was like, not really.	Bila je kot, res ne.
That's quite a question.	To je kar vprašanje.
And it was all good too.	In vse je bilo tudi dobro.
I don't have it	jaz ga nimam
Maybe it's still there.	Mogoče je še vedno tam.
As you wish.	Kot želiš.
We were very lucky indeed.	Imeli smo res veliko srečo.
It will be true.	Res bo.
Just like your father.	Tako kot tvoj oče.
You know everything about me.	Veš vse o meni.
I should.	Moral bi.
Not at all next week.	Naslednji teden sploh ne.
You wanted to do it.	Hotel si to storiti.
Sometimes you'll succeed, sometimes you won't.	Včasih ti bo uspelo, včasih ne.
I wish I would.	Želim si, da bi.
I do not have it.	Nimam ga.
Sam doesn't like you.	Sam te ne mara.
Being human.	Biti človek .
And now you have to leave.	In zdaj moraš oditi.
I do not like.	Ni mi všeč.
If you want to.	Če želite.
Maybe she never knew it.	Morda tega nikoli ni vedela.
Maybe he'll leave tomorrow.	Mogoče bo jutri odšel.
He didn't have to do that.	Tega mu ni bilo treba narediti.
I know you tried to leave.	Vem, da si poskušal oditi.
I feel much better about it.	Glede tega se počutim veliko bolje.
I'm just wondering that.	Samo to se sprašujem.
You can be sure of that.	O tem ste lahko prepričani.
There's always a good reason.	Vedno obstaja dober razlog.
He knows he should be happy.	Ve, da bi moral biti vesel.
That or work harder.	To ali delati še bolj.
I would never go back there again.	Nikoli več se ne bi vrnil tja.
He doesn't want to leave home.	Noče od doma.
I would admit it to you.	Bi ti priznal.
So he did it.	Tako je to naredil.
She was here.	Bila je tukaj.
I could do that.	Lahko bi to naredil.
And she really wants me.	In res si me želi.
Someone was saying that.	Nekdo je to govoril.
Right, you said it.	Prav, rekel si.
Both were good.	Oba sta bila dobra.
i have children	imam otroke
Let it be for something.	Naj bo za nekaj.
I was just thinking.	Samo mislil sem.
We had a few.	Nekaj ​​smo jih imeli.
That was likely.	To je bilo verjetno.
He has a question.	Ima vprašanje.
Do more.	Naredi še več.
It was hard work.	To je bilo težko delo.
Maybe it was better that way.	Mogoče je bilo bolje tako.
And rightly so.	In prav je tako.
I don't want it to feel like work.	Nočem, da se počuti kot delo.
Surely we can do better, right?	Zagotovo smo lahko boljši, kajne?
It will probably be a while.	Verjetno bo še nekaj časa.
This was not the case.	Temu ni bilo tako.
It's everything you want it to be.	Je vse, kar želite, da je.
Ordinarily it might be so.	Običajno bi lahko bilo tako.
Here was an opportunity.	Tukaj je bila priložnost.
Here's something.	Tukaj je nekaj.
Which is not happening.	Kar se ne dogaja.
He will succeed.	Uspelo mu bo.
He made you from nothing.	Naredil te je iz nič.
You said it wouldn't happen.	Rekel si, da se to ne bo zgodilo.
But he learned to speak like us.	Vendar se je naučil govoriti kot mi.
All that you can be, you have already been.	Vse, kar si lahko, si že bil.
Which was not the case.	Kar pa ni bilo.
They won't have you.	Ne bodo te imeli.
I believe he likes me.	Verjamem, da sem mu všeč.
Like we have a lot more.	Kot da imamo še veliko več.
I said it wouldn't.	Rekel sem, da ne bo.
I could do that right now.	To bi lahko storil takoj.
We could do that.	To bi lahko storili.
Maybe it's that simple.	Mogoče je tako preprosto.
Come here.	Priti sem.
He saw something.	Nekaj ​​je videl.
But maybe that's just me.	Vendar sem to morda samo jaz.
Again, no one did anything.	Spet nihče ni naredil nič.
It's just a game.	To je samo igra.
He came and called us.	Prišel je in nas poklical.
They didn't see.	Niso videli.
Nobody knows him.	Nihče ga ne pozna.
She didn't like that too much.	To ji ni bilo preveč všeč.
Everything is fine, he says.	Vse je v redu, pravi.
I didn't want to do it anymore.	Nisem več hotel tega početi.
And he looked fine too.	In tudi on je bil videti v redu.
It's happening there all the time.	Tam se ves čas dogaja.
You will never forget.	Nikoli ne boš pozabil.
No one knows what it is.	Kaj je to, ne ve nihče.
I immediately left there.	Takoj sem odšel od tam.
We all have to be in this together.	Vsi moramo biti v tem skupaj.
When it comes, it's good.	Ko pride, je dobro.
But you know, it could be.	Vendar veste, lahko bi bilo.
Not after last night.	Ne po sinoči.
He can't get here fast enough.	Sem ne more priti dovolj hitro.
And quickly.	In to hitro.
This was much better.	To je bilo veliko bolje.
He's just a kid.	On je samo otrok.
It's like it doesn't exist sometimes.	Kot da včasih sploh ne obstaja.
Not yet and maybe not ever.	Ne še in morda ne nikoli.
No matter how many there are.	Ne glede na to, koliko jih je.
I wouldn't expect it to be a problem.	Ne bi pričakoval, da bo problem.
They are not there.	Ni jih tam.
It's certainly not that hard.	Zagotovo ni tako težko.
He will ask Fr.	Vprašal bo o.
I like them all.	Vse so mi všeč.
They were both penniless.	Oba sta bila brez denarja.
We don't know why he stayed.	Zakaj je ostal, ne vemo.
There is no one like that here.	Tukaj ni nikogar takega.
And that's some work, as you'll see.	In to je nekaj dela, kot boste videli.
Because you can't know.	Ker ne moreš vedeti.
He probably had a good reason.	Verjetno je imel dober razlog.
I just want it to be right.	Samo želim, da je prav.
He had everything a man could wish for.	Imel je vse, kar si človek lahko želi.
Maybe it's more than that.	Mogoče je več kot to.
And here we are now.	In tukaj smo zdaj.
It could work.	Lahko bi uspelo.
He was a father.	Bil je oče.
I see them every day.	Vidim jih vsak dan.
Not just then, you know.	Ne samo takrat, veš.
It's better now.	Zdaj je bolje.
I think that's how it goes.	Mislim, da tako gre.
He seems to be working a lot.	Zdi se, da veliko dela.
But he won't talk.	Vendar ne bo govoril.
I came with him.	Prišel sem z njim.
That is, if he still works there.	Se pravi, če še vedno dela tam.
Everything comes together.	Vse pride skupaj.
Because there were so few of them.	Ker jih je bilo tako malo.
The only one.	Edina še.
I think we'll be fine here.	Mislim, da nam bo tukaj dobro.
We just know.	Samo vemo.
I did it.	Jaz sem naredil to.
He went and saw them.	Šel je in jih videl.
He wouldn't do that to her.	On ji tega ne bi naredil.
You're not serious.	Ne misliš resno.
It would probably be a very good game.	Verjetno bi bila zelo dobra igra.
She didn't say anything else for a long time.	Dolgo časa ni rekla ničesar drugega.
I see.	Vidim.
You don't need to see me anymore.	Ni me treba več videti.
And what not.	In kaj ne.
It was almost too much to believe.	Bilo je skoraj preveč za verjeti.
He will have time soon.	Kmalu bo imel čas.
I do not like.	Ni mi všeč.
I had to be.	Moral sem biti.
He asked for it.	Prosil je za to.
He didn't see anyone else.	Nikogar drugega ni videl.
I'll leave if you want.	Odšel bom, če želiš.
I really think it's that serious.	Res mislim, da je tako resno.
For quite some time.	Kar nekaj časa.
And never.	In nikoli.
Long after that.	Dolgo po tem.
It's so good.	Tako dobro je.
There were a lot of things I wasn't supposed to see yet.	Bilo je veliko stvari, ki jih še ne bi smel videti.
Maybe you wouldn't.	Mogoče ne bi.
I saw him.	Videl sem ga.
I'll stay home.	Bom ostal doma.
Which won't be difficult.	Kar ne bo težko.
Obviously, it's not easy to talk.	Očitno ni lahko govoriti.
I'm glad it's possible.	Vesel sem, da je to mogoče.
In fact, it was better than good.	Pravzaprav je bilo bolje kot dobro.
Either she went out or something was wrong.	Ali je šla ven ali pa je bilo nekaj narobe.
It sure would be.	Zagotovo bi bilo.
It's not what he did.	Ni to, kar je naredil.
The only thing is.	Edina stvar je.
It just doesn't do anything.	Samo nič ne počne.
I'm glad they are.	Vesel sem, da so.
Now and forever.	Zdaj in za vedno.
For the car.	Za avto.
I have it.	jaz jo imam.
I understand what you mean.	Razumem, kaj misliš.
I could go home.	Lahko bi šel domov.
And he wants to do just that.	In želi narediti prav to.
It's good to eat.	To je dobro jesti.
She was from home.	Bila je od doma.
I hope you are OK.	Upam da si v redu.
I wouldn't know how.	Ne bi vedel, kako.
He didn't like it.	Ni mu bilo všeč.
He had enough of everything.	Vsega je imel dovolj.
Maybe that wasn't good.	Mogoče to ni bilo dobro.
Everyone knew about it.	Vsi so vedeli za to.
Don't say things.	Ne govori stvari.
They had too much work.	Imeli so preveč dela.
But it isn't.	Vendar ni.
She didn't say anything today.	Danes ni rekla nič.
I actually really like it.	Pravzaprav mi je zelo všeč.
Almost no one wanted to eat anything anymore.	Skoraj nihče ni hotel ničesar več jesti.
I didn't do much.	Nisem naredil veliko.
It's not time yet.	Ni še čas.
I just wanted to leave.	Hotel sem samo oditi.
Here is someone who knows you.	Tukaj je nekdo, ki te pozna.
I always would.	Vedno bi.
I wonder what it could be.	Zanima me, kaj bi lahko bilo.
There was something else.	Pa še nekaj je bilo.
I would like to say.	Rad bi povedal.
Something is telling her.	Nekaj ​​ji govori.
She liked it very much.	Zelo ji je bilo všeč.
There is a way.	Obstaja način.
They did something to you.	Nekaj ​​so ti naredili.
Actually, it did.	Pravzaprav se je.
I want to buy something.	Želim kupiti nekaj.
I think there is something to it.	Mislim, da je nekaj na tem.
And yet he could not see them.	In vendar jih ni mogel videti.
I know everything here.	Tukaj vem vse.
But she likes what he just said.	Vendar ji je všeč, kar je pravkar rekel.
really very true.	res zelo res.
I'm okay	v redu sem
He didn't have it, that's all.	Ni ga imel, to je vse.
And maybe you will.	In morda boš.
I will do anything you want.	Naredil bom vse, kar želiš.
But he won.	Vendar je zmagal.
Maybe he knew he was going to die.	Mogoče je vedel, da bo umrl.
There is much more for you.	Za vas je še veliko več.
It's not your problem.	To ni tvoj problem.
It was a good opportunity.	Bila je dobra priložnost.
Not much, but some.	Ne veliko, nekaj pa.
You can't do that here.	Tukaj tega ne moreš storiti.
It can and will happen.	Lahko in se bo zgodilo.
No one saw her.	Nihče je ni videl.
He heard me there for the first time.	Tam me je prvič slišal.
I would give anything to be here.	Vse bi dal, da bi bil tukaj.
It wasn't the first time either.	Tudi to ni bilo prvič.
she said to herself.	si je rekla.
He knew he wouldn't.	Vedel je, da ne bo.
I don't actually believe that.	Tega pravzaprav ne verjamem.
You will have it.	Imeli ga boste.
I understand that too.	Tudi to razumem.
Nice, I'd say.	Lepo, bi rekel.
They saw.	Videli so.
It's a few things.	To je nekaj stvari.
Maybe it's something else.	Mogoče je kaj drugega.
That doesn't help anyone.	To nikomur ne pomaga.
This is not what you want.	To ni tisto, kar si želiš.
I needed something more.	Potreboval sem nekaj več.
No one seemed to know or care.	Zdelo se je, da nihče ne ve ali ga ne zanima.
She should be with us.	Morala bi biti z nami.
I would come home and tell her all about it.	Prišel bi domov in ji povedal vse o tem.
I hope for your sake.	Upam, da zaradi tebe.
Until now, I hope.	Do zdaj, upam.
The more people who know about it, the better.	Več ljudi, ki ve o tem, bolje je.
He always had to work.	Vedno je moral delati.
It just isn't.	Preprosto ni.
However, when the .	Vendar, ko je .
And that's all.	In to je vse.
He's just not sure.	Samo ni prepričan.
There was something else.	Bilo je še nekaj.
As he says.	Kot pravi.
They really are.	Res so.
He went there.	Šel je tja.
I got everything.	Vse sem dobil.
I don't understand how to do it.	Ne razumem, kako to narediti.
We're not doing very well.	Ne gre nam prav dobro.
Or not much.	Ali pa ne veliko.
But it is true.	Je pa res.
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
It cannot be what it seems.	To ne more biti to, kar se zdi.
It was as if no one else was there.	Kot da ni bilo nikogar drugega.
No one was surprised.	Nihče ni bil presenečen.
They knew it was him.	Vedeli so, da je on.
I do not have to.	Ni mi treba.
I hope you like this.	Upam, da vam je to všeč.
They weren't enough.	Niso bili dovolj.
I think you are absolutely right.	Mislim, da imaš popolnoma prav.
He was spot on.	Bil je na mestu.
Maybe he will succeed.	Mogoče mu bo uspelo.
He may have already done this.	Morda je to že naredil.
I want someone.	Želim si nekoga.
I don't want to see him do that.	Nočem ga videti, da to počne.
He died, you know.	Umrl je, veš.
You needed more.	Potreboval si več.
None of this would be possible without you.	Nič od tega ne bi bilo mogoče brez vas.
I don't know man.	Ne vem človek.
He works for the people.	Dela za ljudi.
It does more than one thing.	Dela več stvari.
I think it's fine.	Mislim, da je v redu.
There's a lot going on.	Veliko se dogaja.
I'm going fast.	grem hitro.
He had never seen anything like it before.	Še nikoli prej ni videl takega.
There were only a few other people there.	Tam je bilo le še nekaj ljudi.
Time is money.	Čas je denar.
They never were.	Nikoli niso bili.
Or very early in the morning.	Ali pa zelo zgodaj zjutraj.
Not even me.	Niti meni.
You never said anything to me.	Nikoli mi nisi rekel ničesar.
If I had never met him.	Če ga še nikoli ne bi srečal.
But it wasn't like that.	Vendar ni bilo tako.
I could do this for quite some time.	To bi lahko počel precej dolgo.
All would not be well.	Ne bi bilo vse v redu.
Nothing like that.	Niti kaj takega.
Or maybe just tired.	Ali morda samo utrujen.
That's when he saw him.	Takrat ga je videl.
everything will be okay.	vse bo v redu.
Sometimes it's better to know nothing.	Včasih je bolje ne vedeti ničesar.
He said nothing.	Nič rekel.
We're into it.	Mi smo v to.
Not that I have much.	Ne da bi imel veliko.
How long will they be there.	Kako dolgo bodo tam.
Money was everything to him.	Denar mu je bil vse.
It was always a problem.	Vedno je bil problem.
He didn't talk much.	Ni veliko govoril.
I'm just not sure where to go from here.	Samo nisem prepričan, kam naj grem od tukaj.
He will come tonight.	Prišel bo nocoj.
Let them be.	Naj bodo.
I got it too, but maybe not as much.	Tudi jaz sem ga dobil, a morda ne toliko.
I know that's not true.	Vem, da to ni res.
Something else is going on.	Nekaj ​​drugega se dogaja.
I didn't love anyone.	Nikogar nisem imel rad.
I met her once.	Enkrat sem jo srečal.
I'm glad you came.	Vesel sem, da si prišel.
She didn't know where he was.	Ni vedela, kje je.
Almost three in the morning.	Skoraj tri zjutraj.
And yet they didn't.	Pa vendar niso.
And that is good and right.	In to je dobro in prav.
But it's not just my time.	Vendar ni samo moj čas.
But there was no help for that.	A temu ni bilo pomoči.
Not a boy.	Ne fant.
Yes and yes and yes.	Da in da in da.
You promised.	Obljubil si.
I can not.	Ne morem.
Why would you do that?	Zakaj bi to naredil?
It wasn't good enough anymore.	Ni bilo več dovolj dobro.
You are here with me.	Tukaj si z mano.
He never asked me about it again.	Nikoli več me ni vprašal o tem.
If only she knew.	Ko bi le vedela.
And he loved it.	In bilo mu je všeč.
He's still angry this morning.	Zjutraj je še vedno jezen.
I've been there before.	tam sem že bil.
We really are.	Res smo.
He didn't leave either.	Tudi on ni odšel.
Maybe very soon.	Morda zelo kmalu.
He wasn't even sure if they were alive.	Sploh ni bil prepričan, ali so živi.
We all will.	Vsi bomo.
I had to go home.	Moral sem iti domov.
Maybe he was right.	Morda je imel prav.
It seemed like a lot.	Zdelo se je zelo veliko.
It was the same with me.	Tako je bilo tudi pri meni.
Nobody came here.	Nihče ni prišel sem.
You are the only one.	Ti si edini.
I know where he's going.	Vem, kam gre.
Maybe she knew he wouldn't be there.	Morda je vedela, da ga ne bo.
He was there now.	Tam je bil zdaj.
Just better, so much better.	Samo bolje, toliko bolje.
I hope you are doing well.	Upam, da ti gre dobro.
It wasn't like that with me.	Pri meni ni bilo tako.
More and more of it.	Vedno več tega.
It seems to be doing just that.	Zdi se, da počne prav to.
Okay, maybe not.	V redu, morda ne.
That's all he does, but it's enough.	To je vse, kar počne, vendar je dovolj.
But nobody knew.	A nihče ni vedel.
We are everything.	Mi smo vse.
He lost them.	Izgubil jih je.
Everything was good then.	Takrat je bilo vse dobro.
If you are really good, you will get it!.	Če si res dober, ga boš dobil!.
Never was, never will be.	Nikoli ni bilo, nikoli ne bo.
This is true.	To je res.
It was a nice job.	Bilo je lepo delo.
I am happy.	Sem vesel.
We don't know anything more.	Nič več ne vemo.
I wouldn't go any further.	Ne bi šel naprej.
No one should know he wasn't the father.	Nihče ne bi smel vedeti, da ni bil oče.
I don't want it now.	Zdaj tega nočem.
I wonder what he thinks.	Zanima me, kaj misli.
We should go and help.	Morali bi iti in pomagati.
But that wasn't all.	A to še ni bilo vse.
That's all he does.	To je vse, kar počne.
I told you that afternoon.	Povedal sem ti tisto popoldne.
It could be.	Lahko bi bilo.
He wanted to know everything about me.	Želel je vedeti vse o meni.
And it's not an easy life.	In to ni lahko življenje.
Nobody wants them.	Nihče jih noče.
That's really not the case.	Temu res ni tako.
Sometimes it's more.	Včasih je več.
.	.
You just didn't hear me.	Samo nisi me slišal.
This can't be right.	To ne more biti prav.
And now they are gone.	In zdaj jih ni več.
I can't do anything to you.	Ne morem ti narediti ničesar.
I know it will.	Vem, da bo.
Tell me what happened.	Povej mi, kaj se je zgodilo.
That's nice too.	Tudi to je lepo.
He's gone for sure.	Zagotovo je odšel.
I immediately went home.	Takoj sem šla domov.
He didn't come back.	Ni se vrnil.
Let me see now.	Naj vidim zdaj.
You will see her again, for sure.	Spet jo boš videl, zagotovo.
He just sat there.	Samo sedel je tam.
You can never tell.	Nikoli ne moreš povedati.
He was all the time.	Bil je ves čas.
Someone has already seen this.	Nekdo je to že videl.
I believe it was him.	Verjamem, da je bil on.
I still thought it was you.	Še vedno sem mislil, da si ti.
I wonder if they were okay.	Sprašujem se, ali so bili v redu.
For a while, that is.	Za nekaj časa, to je.
They had nothing, they had nothing.	Nič niso imeli, nič niso imeli.
No, it was nothing like that.	Ne, ni bilo nič takega.
He talks about it.	On govori o tem.
Everyone saw you.	Vsi so te videli.
I'm nothing.	Nisem nič.
It is, almost every day.	Je, skoraj vsak dan.
Maybe there's no one there.	Morda tam ni nikogar.
It took me a long time to do this.	Za to sem potreboval veliko časa.
She knew she couldn't stay there long.	Vedela je, da tam ne more ostati dolgo.
Maybe it's better that way.	Morda je bolje tako.
He didn't like it.	Ni mu bilo všeč.
Now I see, for the first time.	Zdaj vidim, prvič.
And then he realized something else.	In takrat je spoznal nekaj drugega.
Now everything comes to light.	Zdaj pa vse pride na dan.
You gave me my life back.	Vrnil si mi življenje.
But he didn't say what he thought.	A tega, kar je mislil, ni povedal.
It's not working right.	Ne dela prav.
That could be good.	To bi lahko bilo dobro.
Not good.	Ni dobro.
You have to leave.	Moraš oditi.
Okay, it was unlikely.	V redu, bilo je malo verjetno.
I actually felt a lot better when he was by my side.	Pravzaprav sem se počutil veliko bolje, ko je bil ob meni.
But all is not as it seems.	Vendar ni vse tako, kot se zdi.
We don't know how serious it is.	Ne vemo, kako resno je.
Just a little bit more.	Samo še malo.
Regardless of what seems to be happening.	Ne glede na to, kaj se zdi, da se dogaja.
You wanted to, but you couldn't, right?	Hotel si, pa nisi mogel, kajne.
It looks like trouble.	Videti je kot težave.
I never expected any of this to happen.	Nikoli nisem pričakoval, da se bo kaj od tega zgodilo.
And often.	In to pogosto.
This may or may not help.	To lahko pomaga ali pa tudi ne.
It almost didn't happen.	Skoraj se ni zgodilo.
He came.	Prišel je.
He didn't want to do that.	Tega ni hotel storiti.
That's not good.	To ni dobro.
Maybe someday.	Mogoče bo nekoč.
He's a good guy.	On je dober fant.
He was always at home, we were always together.	Vedno je bil doma, vedno sva bila skupaj.
I passed too.	Tudi jaz sem opravil.
No, that wasn't good.	Ne, to ni bilo dobro.
I have to leave.	Moram oditi.
No, no, you're not.	Ne, ne, da nisi.
Everyone is at it.	Vsi so pri tem.
I mean, there was a time when he was.	Mislim, bil je čas, ko je bil.
And is.	In je.
And nobody said anything.	In nihče ni nič rekel.
All by myself.	Vse sam.
There were many children.	Bilo je veliko otrok.
And maybe it is.	In morda tudi je.
You will help me.	Pomagal mi boš.
That seems likely.	To se zdi verjetno.
It was better that way.	Tako je bilo bolje.
We could probably do quite well with that.	Verjetno bi nam to kar dobro uspelo.
He had little money.	Imel je malo denarja.
She said.	Rekla je.
I found it again.	Spet sem našel.
I don't think it will.	Mislim, da ne bo.
No one has to do any of this.	Nikomur ni treba ničesar od tega storiti.
Not so much anymore.	Ne več toliko.
It's true, it's true.	Res je, res.
He just wasn't a good person.	Samo ni bil dober človek.
No one knows how he died.	Nihče ne ve, kako je umrl.
I haven't eaten since.	Od takrat nisem jedel več.
I have so much going on.	Toliko se mi dogaja.
Maybe he's not feeling well.	Mogoče se ne počuti dobro.
It never was and never will be.	Nikoli ni bilo in nikoli ne bo.
It seems to be true.	Zdi se, da je res.
I would do everything right.	Vse bi naredil prav.
However, no one seems to have done so.	Vendar se zdi, da tega ni storil nihče.
You should be there instead.	Namesto tega bi moral biti tam.
This is very difficult.	To je zelo težko.
If only for a few days.	Če le za nekaj dni.
Maybe he is too.	Mogoče je tudi on.
You know it is.	Veš, da je.
My teacher was right.	Moj učitelj je imel prav.
I hope this is true.	Upam, da je to res.
That's why it happened.	Zato se je to zgodilo.
You always are.	Vedno si.
They never knew we were there.	Nikoli niso vedeli, da smo tam.
You are my friend.	Ti si moj prijatelj.
The question is how to do it.	Vprašanje je, kako to narediti.
I thought you should know.	Mislil sem, da bi moral vedeti.
No, it can't be true.	Ne, ne more biti res.
I had to leave there for a while.	Za nekaj časa sem moral od tam.
He stayed there.	Tam je ostal.
I need such a job.	Potrebujem tako službo.
It's just stuff.	To so samo stvari.
This is true.	To je res.
He had to know about it.	Moral je vedeti za to.
What could be wrong.	Kaj bi lahko bilo narobe.
She seems to be doing well.	Zdi se, da ji gre dobro.
And now everything must go.	In zdaj mora vse iti.
It's not as hard as you think.	Ni tako težko, kot si mislite.
I wanted to come back so badly.	Tako zelo sem si želel priti nazaj.
That doesn't help either.	Tudi to ne pomaga.
All he cares about is himself.	Vse, kar ga zanima, je sam.
I'm not so sure about that now.	Zdaj nisem tako prepričan o tem.
And maybe it would.	In morda bi bilo.
No one thought it would, but it did.	Nihče si ni mislil, da bo, a se je.
I'm so tired of feeling alone.	Tako zelo sem utrujen od tega, da se počutim sam.
That's what she was supposed to say.	To naj bi rekla.
I never found it.	Nikoli ga nisem našel.
You will come tomorrow and meet me.	Prišel boš jutri in se srečal z mano.
He couldn't eat all day.	Ves dan ni mogel jesti.
Children's question.	Vprašanje otrok.
Apparently not.	Očitno ni.
I have several.	Imam jih več.
Not the way she wanted him to go tonight.	Ne tako, kot si je želela, da bi nocoj odšel.
There is absolutely nothing to do in town.	V mestu ni prav nič za početi.
I really liked them.	Zelo so mi bili všeč.
I've felt that way before.	Tako sem se že počutil.
But I know enough to know he's right.	Vem pa dovolj, da vem, da ima prav.
This is what we all can and must do.	To je tisto, kar lahko in moramo storiti vsi.
Something is right.	Nekaj ​​je prav.
We were often there together.	Pogosto sva bila tam skupaj.
Not that he was working.	Saj ne, da je delal.
This is just for fun.	To je samo za zabavo.
And so it is here.	In tako je tudi tukaj.
I didn't see any of that.	Nič od tega nisem videl.
How can this be done?	Kako je to mogoče storiti?
But not him.	Vendar ne on.
I'd like to see her.	Rad bi jo videl.
I had to stay at home all day.	Ves dan sem moral ostati doma.
If it goes back.	Če gre nazaj.
That's all you got.	To je vse, kar imaš.
I didn't like this car.	Ta avto mi ni bil všeč.
She failed.	Ni ji uspelo.
This won't look right.	To ne bo videti prav.
I mean, no, not really.	Mislim, ne, res ne.
He doesn't want to talk or eat.	Noče govoriti ali jesti.
It was more than a question.	Bilo je več kot vprašanje.
That's what we did if it comes to that.	Tako smo tudi storili, če pride do tega.
It's hard to say more.	Težko je povedati več.
I want to know who knew.	Želim vedeti, kdo je vedel.
It took him a long time to get over it.	Potreboval je dolgo časa, da je opravil s tem.
Maybe he thought he didn't have time.	Mogoče se mu je zdelo, da ni imel časa.
I believe he will decide on that.	Verjamem, da se bo o tem odločil.
I couldn't even speak.	Sploh nisem mogel govoriti.
And there are more.	In še več jih je.
I waited for a while.	Čakal sem nekaj časa.
It looked like no one was home.	Videti je bilo, da ni nikogar doma.
But it was so.	Vendar je bilo tako.
Simple, I think.	Preprosto, se mi zdi.
It's possible.	Mogoče je.
I know you went to that house.	Vem, da si šel v tisto hišo.
I didn't have that either.	Tudi tega nisem imel.
Everything is in place.	Vse je na mestu.
This happened very soon.	To se je zgodilo zelo kmalu.
and it clearly was.	in očitno je bilo.
We all know he has money.	Vsi vemo, da ima denar.
I hope it looks nice.	Upam, da bo videti lepo.
I wouldn't do that now.	Zdaj tega ne bi naredil.
I would lose my job.	Izgubil bi službo.
That he certainly wasn't.	Da zagotovo ni bil.
I didn't see anyone with him.	Nikogar nisem videl z njim.
I have to believe it isn't.	Moram verjeti, da ni.
Not for life.	Ne za življenje.
And you certainly can't see it that way.	In zagotovo ne moreš videti tako.
There may be more by now.	Morda jih je do zdaj več.
I need to talk to him right away.	Takoj moram govoriti z njim.
He wanted nothing for now.	Za zdaj ni hotel nič.
I thought.	Mislil sem.
That's what we did.	To smo naredili.
.	.
Now it's this, and this, and this, and more.	Zdaj je to, in to, in to in še več.
We can be sure of that.	To smo lahko prepričani.
I certainly wouldn't.	Zagotovo ne bi.
You'd better get out.	Dobro bi bilo, da bi šel ven.
You promised that.	To si obljubil.
Therefore.	Zaradi tega.
I don't want anymore.	Nočem več.
But now he had it too.	A zdaj jo je imel tudi on.
We don't even know who they are.	Sploh ne vemo, kdo so.
I know it's not, really not.	Vem, da ni, res ne.
It has been a long time since I returned home.	Dolgo je bilo, da se nisem vrnil domov.
Please someone help her.	Prosim, kdo ji pomaga.
They might be there too.	Morda so tudi tam.
That was her.	To je bila.
That's how it is with me.	Tako je pri meni.
I was happy about that.	Tega sem bil vesel.
Maybe now.	Mogoče ga zdaj.
He said it never happened.	Rekel je, da se to nikoli ni zgodilo.
I must have a problem.	Verjetno imam problem.
Came and went.	Prišel in odšel.
I told him he had to help me.	Rekel sem mu, da mi mora pomagati.
I believe he knows.	Verjamem, da ve.
That too will happen.	Tudi to se bo zgodilo.
I actually know him.	Pravzaprav ga poznam.
But you'll have to believe me.	Vendar mi boš moral verjeti.
I started them last week.	Prejšnji teden sem jih začel.
To understand him.	Da ga razumem.
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.	Tega ne bi želel nikomur.
No one should know.	Nihče ne bi smel vedeti.
There will be more after that.	Po tem pa bo še kaj.
I hope he feels better soon.	Upam, da se kmalu počuti bolje.
You really should know.	Res bi moral vedeti.
I won't soon forget.	Ne bom kmalu pozabil.
I see him play.	Vidim ga igrati.
It's a good question though.	Je pa dobro vprašanje.
you can not	ne moreš
I think we need to do it now.	Mislim, da moramo to storiti zdaj.
Maybe she would know something.	Mogoče bi kaj vedela.
And in this.	In v tem.
But you know when it's there and when it's not.	Vendar veš, kdaj je tam in kdaj ni.
Not only that.	Niti to samo.
He is here to help.	Tukaj je, da pomaga.
Right right.	Prav prav .
Just for a little while.	Samo za malo.
As you were to me the other day.	Kot si meni prejšnji dan.
Or maybe not.	Ali pa morda ne.
He said he would win.	Rekel je, da bo zmagal.
I mean, how could you.	Mislim, kako bi lahko.
You have to leave.	Moraš oditi.
I'll never tell.	Nikoli ne bom povedal.
He liked to make a party out of it.	Iz tega je rad delal zabavo.
It's really very simple.	Res je zelo preprosto.
I don't know about that.	Ne vem za to.
He said it was wrong.	Rekel je, da je to narobe.
I could do it today if I wanted to.	To bi lahko storil še danes, če bi hotel.
Just like it used to be.	Tako kot včasih.
But we did it.	Vendar nam je uspelo.
He has everything.	On ima vse.
You'll be fine tomorrow.	Jutri boš v redu.
It should be me.	Moral bi biti jaz.
He'll get it too.	Tudi on ga bo dobil.
I hope not.	Upam, da ne bi.
Nobody can do that.	Nihče tega ne more narediti.
Now he had to know why.	Zdaj je moral vedeti zakaj.
I'm sure it will.	Prepričan sem, da bo.
He got his.	Dobil je svoje.
Yes, there is a reason behind it.	Da, za tem je razlog.
She should know why he did what he did.	Morala bi vedeti, zakaj je naredil, kar je naredil.
You are too happy.	Preveč si vesel.
You were there a long time.	Tam si bil dolgo časa.
He was too, man.	Je bil tudi on, človek.
Too much, I might say.	Preveč, bi lahko rekla.
No, that's not it.	Ne, to ni to.
You'll get her back.	Dobil jo boš nazaj.
You didn't know.	Niste vedeli.
It was difficult to speak again.	Spet je bilo težko govoriti.
there! 	tam!
there! 	tam!
It's not.	Ni .
Almost only mine.	Skoraj samo moje.
It's okay, you're okay.	V redu je, v redu si.
It doesn't even exist anymore.	Sploh ne obstaja več.
Everything for everyone.	Vse za vse.
I'm mad at you.	Jezen sem na tebe.
Or early in the morning.	Ali zgodaj zjutraj.
I saw it last week.	Videl sem prejšnji teden.
Everyone really liked it.	Vsem je bilo zelo všeč.
And there is enough time.	In časa je dovolj.
You will see.	Videli boste.
We know how to do it.	Vemo, kako to narediti.
You should tell him.	Moral bi mu povedati.
I saw him.	Videl sem ga.
Not what she just said.	Ne tega, kar je pravkar rekla.
He couldn't do enough.	Ni mogel narediti dovolj.
Or from him.	Ali iz njega.
That's what it's about.	Za to gre.
He will be home tomorrow.	Bo jutri doma.
Not good at all.	Sploh ni dobro.
It won't happen.	Ne bo se zgodilo.
I'm here to have a good time.	Tukaj sem, da se imam lepo.
He doesn't know when, but he knows it will happen.	Ne ve kdaj, ve pa, da se bo zgodilo.
It was anything but.	Bilo je vse prej kot.
It is very helpful.	Zelo je v pomoč.
And so far it has been.	In do zdaj je bilo.
I'm afraid we can't tell you much.	Bojim se, da vam ne moremo povedati veliko.
Maybe that wasn't right.	Morda to ni bilo prav.
I can see that right now.	To vidim prav zdaj.
There was something about.	Bilo je nekaj o.
With me, as always.	Pri meni, kot vedno.
Then you will see her.	Takrat jo boš videl.
This simply cannot be true.	To preprosto ne more biti res.
He is like a father to us.	Za nas je kot oče.
I'd like to see more of it.	Rad bi ga videl več.
You all are.	Vsi ste.
There was nothing more to say.	Nič več ni bilo za povedati.
That's fine with me.	Meni je to v redu.
I really can't believe it.	Res ne morem verjeti.
He is a real man.	On je pravi človek.
Here, it isn't.	Tukaj, ni.
I just don't know how.	Samo ne vem, kako.
I'll tell you what happened to me.	Povedal vam bom, kaj je bilo meni.
I don't believe it myself.	Sam ne verjamem.
That's how he saw me.	Tako me je videl.
He seems to be a good man.	Videti je, da je dober človek.
I told her not to.	Rekel sem ji, naj ne.
We'll see a lot of him.	Veliko ga bomo videli.
No one will give it to you.	Nihče vam ga ne bo dal.
There is no help for you.	Ni vam pomoči.
Someone left you here.	Nekdo te je pustil tukaj.
They only care about money.	Zanima jih samo denar.
That alone is not enough.	Samo to ni dovolj.
I meant no.	Mislil sem ne.
We weren't there then, even a very long time ago.	Takrat nas ni bilo, tudi zelo dolgo nazaj.
However, he failed to do so.	Vendar mu to ni uspelo.
He came right away.	Takoj je prišel.
I've said my piece.	Povedal sem svoje.
If she said it was, it was.	Če je rekla, da je tako, je bilo tako.
It would happen.	Zgodilo bi se.
Yes, this is the first time.	Da, to je prvič.
That's how you know.	Tako veš.
Apparently there was more.	Očitno je bilo več.
He just died.	Pravkar je umrl.
He knew he wouldn't.	Vedel je, da ne bo.
I've never had to do one before.	Še nikoli mi ga ni bilo treba narediti.
This man and what he knew.	Ta človek in kaj je vedel.
I don't know where the problem could be.	Ne vem kje bi lahko bil problem.
It's not that hard, but it's long.	Ni tako težko, je pa dolgo.
And there are a lot of them.	In veliko jih je.
For a little bit.	Za malo.
And you could.	In lahko bi.
He didn't say no.	Ni rekel ne.
He is that for me.	On je to zame.
This boy is angry sometimes.	Ta fant je včasih jezen.
I wouldn't have much sooner.	Veliko prej ne bi.
You know, for me.	Veš, zame.
It's hard to believe she's not here.	Težko je verjeti, da je ni tukaj.
We went to work.	Šla sva na delo.
Not even in this way.	Niti ne na ta način.
You have to say it your way.	Povedati moraš na svoj način.
I think it needs time.	Mislim, da potrebuje čas.
It looks good.	Videti je dobro.
That wasn't it.	To ni bilo to.
And maybe that was a good thing.	In morda je bilo to dobro.
But he loved her too much.	Vendar jo je imel preveč rad.
He too.	Tudi on.
I'm just not sure what it is.	Samo nisem prepričan, kaj je.
I mean, it can be when it has to be.	Mislim, lahko je, ko mora biti.
I know why.	Vem zakaj.
It must be done today.	To je treba storiti danes.
This may not be so obvious.	To morda ni tako očitno.
It was never something to do back then.	Takrat tega nikoli ni bilo za početi.
Not yet.	Še ni.
I have to do everything right.	Vse moram narediti prav.
But you were lucky.	Vendar ste imeli srečo.
I beg you .	Prosim te .
That's why we're here.	Zato smo tukaj.
I can too.	Lahko tudi jaz.
You obviously didn't.	Očitno nisi.
He had a great big book.	Imel je veliko veliko knjigo.
You always wanted to talk about it.	Vedno si želel govoriti o tem.
And say it.	In povej.
You were good, but not now.	Bil si dober, zdaj pa ne.
He wanted to know who it was.	Želel je vedeti, kdo je to.
Someone would definitely see us.	Nekdo bi nas zagotovo videl.
I don't need it.	Ne potrebujem ga.
There was a teacher.	Tam je bil učitelj.
Not that we did much of that.	Saj ne, da smo tega naredili veliko.
It's the only way.	To je edini način.
It's here all the time.	Tukaj je ves čas.
Not much.	Ni veliko.
Still some of it.	Še vedno nekaj od tega.
I want you to know something.	Želim, da nekaj veš.
Everything she said was right.	Vse, kar je rekla, je bilo prav.
Were there many people?	Ali je bilo veliko ljudi.
But I don't see much anymore.	Vendar ne vidim veliko več.
I had to leave.	Moral sem oditi.
Do something there.	Naredi nekaj tam.
I couldn't see her anymore.	Nisem je mogel več videti.
I understand them much better.	Veliko bolje jih razumem.
He didn't want to talk much.	Ni hotel veliko govoriti.
I have a job.	Imam službo.
That's quite a lot of money.	To je kar veliko denarja.
And so it was.	In tako je bilo.
There's a lot more going on here than that.	Tukaj se dogaja veliko več kot to.
He's not here right now.	Trenutno ga ni tukaj.
That's also a possibility.	Tudi to je možnost.
Not like it used to be.	Ne tako kot včasih.
I can hardly believe we have it.	Skoraj ne morem verjeti, da ga imamo.
I still have work to do here.	Tukaj imam še vedno delo.
It's not true anymore.	Ni več res.
That's always an option.	To je vedno možnost.
And he didn't get any of us.	In nikogar od nas ni dobil.
Once three.	Enkrat tri.
And you look tired too.	In tudi ti si videti utrujen.
It always happened to me.	Vedno se mi je zgodilo.
She was in her room.	Bila je v svoji sobi.
We didn't have much time.	Nismo imeli preveč časa.
We all thought it was very good.	Vsem se nam je zdelo zelo dobro.
It was very helpful.	Bilo je v veliko pomoč.
He can't do anything about it.	Nič ne more s tem.
I have to eat.	Moram jesti.
He succeeded.	Uspelo mu je.
Or maybe not.	Lahko pa tudi ne.
We probably should.	Verjetno bi morali.
You absolutely can.	Popolnoma lahko.
But that is not enough.	To pa ni dovolj.
It wouldn't happen.	Ne bi se zgodilo.
But it wasn't.	Vendar ni bilo.
He said.	On je rekel.
I heard him say something to her.	Slišal sem ga, kako ji je nekaj rekel.
Everything here is mine.	Vse tukaj je moje.
Here, he just couldn't tell.	Tukaj, preprosto ni mogel povedati.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisem mogel verjeti.
He might have left.	Morda je odšel.
I'll just say this.	Rekel bom samo to.
He said he didn't.	Rekel je, da ni.
But there wouldn't be time for that.	Vendar za to ne bi bilo časa.
You should do that.	To bi moral storiti.
Now, that's not going to happen.	Zdaj, to se ne bo zgodilo.
I'm doing very well.	Zelo dobro mi gre.
He will forget you like he forgot me.	Pozabil te bo tako kot je pozabil mene.
If you're interested.	Če te zanima.
You will meet her tomorrow.	Spoznal jo boš jutri.
He was for me.	Zame je bil.
Something was there.	Nekaj ​​je bilo tam.
He probably was.	Verjetno je bil.
You know, a long time.	Veste, dolgo časa.
You just have to be seen.	Samo videti te je treba.
I didn't go to school the other day.	Prejšnji dan nisem šel v šolo.
I've never seen her do that before.	Še nikoli je nisem videl narediti tega.
However, it is not.	Vendar pa ni.
But that's not the case here.	Vendar tukaj ni tako.
They were lucky.	Imeli so srečo.
Always has been, always will be.	Vedno je bilo, vedno bo.
She said she couldn't tell.	Rekla je, da ne more povedati.
Tell me why you like it.	Povej zakaj ti je všeč.
I don't even believe it.	Sploh ne verjamem.
He had never seen it before.	Nikoli prej ga ni videl.
We had a very, very good time doing that.	Pri tem smo se imeli zelo, zelo dobro.
He's doing fine.	V redu mu gre.
And immediately.	In to takoj.
More about.	Več o tem.
I'm here a lot.	Veliko sem tukaj.
I don't feel that way now.	Zdaj se ne počutim tako.
They are always there.	Vedno so tam.
Lots of help.	Veliko pomoči.
It seems a bit much to me.	Kar malo se mi zdi.
Not that he talks much.	Saj ne, da bi veliko govoril.
We'll know soon enough.	Kmalu bomo vedeli.
And she seems interested.	In zdi se, da jo zanima.
Maybe they were better.	Morda so bili boljši.
And there is.	In obstaja.
I love my job.	Rad imam službo.
And now it is.	In zdaj je.
I go to work every day.	Vsak dan grem v službo.
That's the real reason.	To je pravi razlog.
You don't have to be better than me at everything.	Ni ti treba biti v vsem boljši od mene.
And no one saw them.	In nihče jih ni videl.
And you really can.	In res lahko.
It's nothing now.	Zdaj ni nič.
There must be something in me.	Nekaj ​​mora biti v meni.
No, not that much.	Ne, ne tako veliko.
So much the better for you.	Toliko bolje za vas.
She wanted them.	Želela jih je.
I've never actually been there.	Pravzaprav še nikoli nisem bil tam.
Because he doesn't need us.	Ker nas ne potrebuje.
That's not life, you know.	To ni življenje, veš.
It had to do for now.	To je bilo treba storiti za zdaj.
Unfortunately, this is not enough.	Žal to ni dovolj.
And it still is today.	In še danes je.
I have a few.	Nekaj ​​jih imam.
I ate well.	Dobro sem jedel.
I thought that was it.	Mislil sem, da je to to.
It probably is.	Verjetno je.
It always is.	Vedno je.
I don't think I should go.	Mislim, da ne bi smel iti.
how are you	kako si kaj
I mean, he's a teacher.	Mislim, on je učitelj.
Just like that, he's gone.	Kar tako ga ni več.
He could see everything.	Vse je lahko videl.
I won't forget.	Ne bom pozabil.
I like.	Všeč mi je.
I had to tell myself that.	To sem si morala povedati.
They should.	Morali bi.
Or you know.	Ali pa veš.
It could be.	Lahko bi bilo.
He still expected to die.	Še vedno je pričakoval, da bo umrl.
Better than it was.	Bolje, kot je že bilo.
Because you wouldn't have to say who you are.	Ker ti ne bi bilo treba povedati, kdo si.
I know what you mean.	Vem, kaj misliš.
But they are alive.	Vendar so živi.
I wanted her.	Hotel sem jo.
I will never see you again.	Nikoli več te ne bom videl.
I really liked him.	Res mi je bil všeč.
He wants to talk to me instead.	Namesto tega želi govoriti z mano.
Yesterday was a good day.	Včeraj je bil pravi dan.
It's almost up to me.	Skoraj je že na meni.
I didn't see you coming.	Nisem te videl priti.
Yes, they were.	Da, bili so.
I knew a lot more.	Vedela sem veliko več.
And so it should be.	In tako mora biti.
And maybe some days he really was.	In morda je nekaj dni res bil.
Made for you.	Naredil za vas.
It's not like he's just coming over for dinner.	Ni tako, kot da bi kar prišel na večerjo.
Such a question is out of place.	Tako vprašanje ni na mestu.
I haven't been able to work yet.	Nisem še mogel delati.
My father really wants me to go.	Moj oče res želi, da grem.
He doesn't want to go home.	Noče domov.
He's too busy.	Preveč je zaposlen.
Nobody asked for me.	Nihče ni vprašal po meni.
Maybe that's backwards.	Mogoče je to za nazaj.
I need her today.	Danes jo potrebujem.
He was always here.	Vedno je bil tukaj.
I could do that.	Lahko bi to naredil.
I would die without you.	Brez tebe bi umrl.
It was the right time.	Bila je pravi čas.
Perhaps much more.	Morda veliko več.
This can't be right.	To ne more biti prav.
And this is in the morning.	In to je zjutraj.
It's just not my thing.	To preprosto ni moja stvar.
Nothing wrong with that either.	Tudi tam ni nič narobe.
I won't say more.	Ne bom rekel več.
He did this and the man did not return.	To je storil in človek se ni vrnil.
Nothing wrong with that.	Nič ni narobe s tem.
I think you might like it.	Mislim, da ti bo morda všeč.
I know they are.	Vem, da so.
In fact, we were just a few years ago.	Pravzaprav smo bili le nekaj let nazaj.
Who is there? 	Kdo je tam?
.	.
He was always there.	Vedno je bil tam.
He tried to be.	Poskušal je biti.
Failed.	Ni uspelo.
She didn't mean it.	Tega resno ni rekla.
He knows better.	On ve bolje.
I see you found it.	Vidim, da si našel.
i will stay here.	ostal bom tukaj.
Maybe you're not good either.	Mogoče tudi ti nisi dober.
It never was and never will be.	Nikoli ni bilo in nikoli ne bo.
No, my friend.	Ne, prijatelj moj.
There is .	Obstaja .
He was doing it again.	Spet je to počel.
I think he could do it.	Mislim, da bi mu to lahko uspelo.
And that's what happened.	In to se je zgodilo.
No one knew what happened yet.	Nihče še ni vedel, kaj se je zgodilo.
They really are.	Res so.
That was just a few years ago.	To je bilo le nekaj let nazaj.
I don't know how to do it.	Ne vem, kako to narediti.
I'm not a father.	Nisem oče.
The man said no.	Človek je rekel ne.
Maybe he knows something.	Morda kaj ve.
I still have a hard time believing it.	Težko še verjamem.
It doesn't make me feel any better.	Zaradi tega se ne počutim bolje.
You and him.	Ti in on.
It needs time.	Potrebuje čas.
Not with him either.	Tudi z njim ne.
We were alone all the time.	Ves čas sva bila sama.
We did this and the car started.	To smo storili in avto je začel.
They should be.	Morali bi biti.
They are not together.	Nista skupaj.
That's quite a good man.	To je kar dober človek.
She told me it was for my own good.	Rekla mi je, da je to za moje dobro.
None of us do.	Nihče od nas ne.
And everything is very fast.	In vse je zelo hitro.
But this was not always the case either.	A tudi temu ni bilo vedno tako.
That's not a problem.	To ni problem.
He didn't leave.	Ni odšel.
He had to know then.	Takrat je moral vedeti.
No, better than that.	Ne, bolje kot to.
I think that's true.	Mislim, da je to res.
He sat back.	Sedel je nazaj.
I told him a lot.	Veliko sem mu povedal.
A lot.	Veliko .
What to do?.	Kaj storiti?.
It was fine for me.	Meni je bilo v redu.
He will be home soon and long enough.	Kmalu in dovolj dolgo bo doma.
This is not true.	To ni res.
I don't want this anymore.	Nočem več tako.
I didn't think so.	Nisem mislil.
They are both ahead.	Oba sta naprej.
It was a few years ago.	Bilo je nekaj let nazaj.
No, because so much is already going wrong.	Ne, ker gre že tako veliko narobe.
That's how it was here.	Tako je bilo tukaj.
There's no time for that.	Ni časa za to.
Maybe too much.	Mogoče preveč.
But not for long.	Vendar ne za dolgo časa.
All he wanted was money.	Vse, kar je hotel, je bil denar.
If so, he probably knew everything.	Če je tako, je verjetno vedel vse.
Here, man.	Tukaj, človek.
I didn't talk to him.	Nisem govoril z njim.
It wasn't much.	Ni bilo veliko.
Which is.	Kar je.
But you haven't done it yet.	Vendar tega še niste storili.
Something he never does.	Nekaj, kar nikoli ne počne.
I think they were in this together.	Mislim, da sta bila v tem skupaj.
Here's the thing.	Tukaj je stvar.
This one went pretty well.	Ta je šel kar dobro.
And you are.	In ti si .
It's that simple.	Tako preprosto je.
It was a lot of work.	Bilo je veliko dela.
We can't say enough about it.	O tem ne moremo povedati dovolj.
He couldn't believe he was going to do that.	Ni mogel verjeti, da bo to storil.
It makes him love her all the more.	Zaradi tega jo ima še toliko bolj rad.
That sounds good to me.	To se mi zdi dobro.
If something feels right, it probably is.	Če se nekaj zdi prav, verjetno tudi je.
You probably already know how difficult it was.	Verjetno že veste, kako težko je bilo.
This is simply wrong.	To je preprosto narobe.
I might work tonight.	Nocoj bom morda delal.
And nobody saw anything.	In nihče ni videl ničesar.
There were so many people there.	Tam je bilo toliko ljudi.
He played very well this week.	Ta teden je igral zelo dobro.
You know how to do it.	Veš, kako to narediti.
Nevermind.	Nič za to.
And that is.	In to je.
He knew that he knew that he knew.	Vedel je, da ve, da ve.
But something must be done.	Nekaj ​​pa je treba narediti.
I didn't have to do that.	Tega mi ni bilo treba narediti.
He didn't say where back.	Kam nazaj, ni povedal.
You should see it.	Moral bi videti.
He'll let you know when he's ready.	Povedal vam bo, ko bo pripravljen.
Not when there was still so much to do.	Ne takrat, ko je bilo še toliko dela.
It has to be here.	Tukaj mora biti.
Probably not much going on there.	Verjetno se tam ne dogaja veliko.
That was all a long time ago.	Vse to je bilo že dolgo nazaj.
He is too.	Tudi on je.
I don't feel like this every day.	Ne počutim se tako vsak dan.
Will you at all.	Ali boš sploh.
I have nothing.	Nič nimam.
It just doesn't do anything.	Preprosto nič ne naredi.
He promised himself not to talk about it.	Obljubil si je, da ne bo govoril o tem.
Do you really mean there.	Ali res mislite tam.
I don't understand why this is happening.	Ne razumem, zakaj se to dogaja.
I could do the job.	Lahko bi naredil to delo.
She also liked the car.	Všeč ji je bil tudi avto.
I know you have to do it.	Vem, da moraš to narediti.
Maybe everything was fine with him.	Mogoče je bilo z njim vse v redu.
I thought it was nice.	Zdelo se mi je lepo.
There is no right or wrong.	Ni prav ali narobe.
That's all it ever was.	To je vse, kar je kdaj bilo.
And you should too.	In tudi ti bi moral.
It couldn't be him.	To ni mogel biti on.
He doesn't even know me.	Sploh me ne pozna.
He was there.	Tam je bil.
Too many of us are still there.	Preveč nas je še vedno tam.
Tom loved you.	Tom te je imel rad.
She knew he would come.	Vedela je, da bo prišel.
Now! 	Takoj!
.	.
And very glad to see you.	In zelo vesel, da te vidim.
He never asked me about it.	Nikoli me ni vprašal o tem.
I met everything.	Vse sem spoznal.
I really, really would.	Res, res bi.
It probably was.	Verjetno je bilo.
But that wasn't all.	Vendar to še ni bilo vse.
Really very sorry.	Res zelo žal.
I'll give it back to him.	Vrnil mu ga bom.
He didn't know where he was.	Ni vedel, kje je.
I will never buy it.	Nikoli ga ne bom kupil.
I found you just in time.	Še pravi čas sem te našel.
I am very well.	Jaz sem zelo dobro.
This is not always good.	To ni vedno dobro.
What else would it be.	Kaj bi drugega bilo.
You have to tell me everything.	Vse mi moraš povedati.
He's usually right.	Običajno ima prav.
But you never know.	Vendar nikoli ne veš.
And she's never home.	In nikoli je ni doma.
No one was up to no good.	Nihče ni bil v nič.
He does all this for nothing.	Vse to dela za nič.
It's not long.	Ni dolgo.
That's really hard.	To je res težko.
You just are.	Samo si.
But I am.	Vendar sem.
I did this myself.	To sem naredil sam.
I don't need it anymore.	Ne potrebujem ga več.
And he must be very lucky.	In verjetno ima veliko srečo.
This is for fun.	To je za zabavo.
In fact, it was almost beautiful.	Pravzaprav je bilo skoraj lepo.
You know you will.	Veš, da boš.
Maybe there aren't any at all.	Mogoče jih sploh ni.
Nobody did anything.	Nihče ni naredil ničesar.
I have little or nothing to say about it.	O tem imam malo ali nič za povedati.
Eating, that is.	Jesti, to je.
It wasn't me.	Nisem bil jaz.
And a lot of it.	In veliko tega.
It was very good.	Bilo je zelo dobro.
He was there when you needed him, but only then.	Tam je bil, ko si ga potreboval, a le takrat.
And now we know there is a better way.	In zdaj vemo, da obstaja boljši način.
If it's there, you're fine.	Če je tam, si v redu.
She succeeded.	Uspelo ji je.
You should.	Ti bi moral.
Who was all that.	Kdo je bil vse to.
She said she had nothing to do with it.	Rekla je, da s tem nima nič.
I came forward quickly.	Hitro sem prišel naprej.
That was all he knew.	To je bilo vse, kar je vedel.
Certainly not all.	Zagotovo pa ne vse.
he asked.	je vprašal.
Something is coming.	Pride nekaj.
However, this cannot be done.	Vendar tega ni mogoče storiti.
She moved on.	Šla je naprej.
I wouldn't expect anything else!.	Nič drugega ne bi pričakoval!.
There might be a possibility.	Morda obstaja možnost.
Something would happen soon.	Kmalu bi se nekaj zgodilo.
It happened or it didn't happen.	Zgodilo se je ali pa se ni zgodilo.
I gave it my all.	Dal sem vse.
He is ready for it.	Pripravljen je na to.
I like everything too.	Tudi meni je vse všeč.
So we had her at home.	Tako smo jo imeli doma.
I like that too.	Tudi to mi je všeč.
Now we have it.	Zdaj ga imamo.
I don't need to say that.	Ni mi treba povedati tega.
It's about all of us together.	Gre za vse nas skupaj.
Quite simply, no one does it better.	Preprosto, nihče tega ne počne bolje.
A few days after.	Nekaj ​​dni po.
There is no such thing.	Tega ni.
Surely I would have known sooner.	Zagotovo bi vedel prej.
She would have succeeded.	Uspelo bi ji.
Now I need help.	Zdaj potrebujem pomoč.
There were many children there.	Tam je bilo veliko otrok.
And she never was.	In nikoli ni bila.
Maybe I could talk to him.	Mogoče bi lahko govoril z njim.
Sometimes it's hard.	Včasih je težko.
there is more to say if you will.	več je za povedati, če boš.
You don't have to be.	Ni ti treba biti.
I told him as much.	Povedal sem mu toliko.
There was nothing left to talk about.	Nič ni bilo več za govoriti.
Look just like you too.	Tudi videti tako kot ti.
He knew he could.	Vedel je, da bi lahko.
There's something we all need to know.	Tam je nekaj, kar moramo vsi vedeti.
I would like to meet you.	Rad bi te spoznal.
Hope someone else can help here.	Upam, da lahko še kdo pomaga tukaj.
That would be a first.	To bi bilo prvič.
That wasn't right.	To ni bilo prav.
You make me want to be a better person.	Zaradi tebe želim biti boljši človek.
My father was not happy about it.	Moj oče zaradi tega ni bil vesel.
Nothing seems to go right.	Zdi se, da nič ne gre prav.
She said nothing wrong.	Nič narobe je rekla.
It seemed to be nothing more than that.	Zdelo se je, da ni nič drugega kot to.
And she wanted to be.	In želela je biti.
I wasn't very good.	Nisem bil preveč dober.
It certainly wasn't necessary.	Zagotovo ni bilo treba.
And it was.	In bilo je.
They are above us.	Nad nami so.
She really wanted out, she really did.	Res si je želela ven, res si je.
We know this to be true.	Vemo, da je to res.
I haven't felt well for a long time.	Že dolgo se ne počutim dobro.
I know how to do it.	Vem, kako to narediti.
You did well.	Dobro ti je uspelo.
They are like me.	So kot jaz.
That.	Da je.
It wasn't always like that.	Ni bilo vedno tako.
He never comes home.	Nikoli ne pride domov.
But we had enough time.	Imeli pa smo dovolj časa.
That's not how it works.	To ne gre tako.
Instead, we just got lucky.	Namesto tega smo imeli samo srečo.
That's pretty good.	To je kar dobro.
No, not really.	Ne, res ne.
Just him.	On samo.
I couldn't get out.	Nisem mogel priti ven.
That time should be now.	Ta čas bi moral biti zdaj.
Being all there.	Biti vse tam.
It really isn't.	Res ni.
I haven't heard that before.	Tega še nisem slišal.
But it's hard for him to be with us.	Vendar mu je težko biti z nami.
Even now the time has come.	Tudi zdaj je prišel čas.
You know what happened.	Veš kaj se je zgodilo.
Not everyone is there.	Niso vsi tam.
What he told me.	Kar pa mi je rekel.
That's how you want it, isn't it.	Tako si želiš, kajne.
I'm all yours.	Popolnoma sem tvoj.
It might have happened.	Morda se je zgodilo.
Do you know where it is? 	Veš kje je?
.	.
This is the hotel.	To je hotel.
But nothing came of it.	A od tega ni bilo nič.
That's what I've become.	To sem postal.
I already know how often.	Kako pogosto že vem.
What's in me.	Kaj je v meni.
She failed to do so.	To ji ni uspelo.
There was nothing like that.	Nič takega ni bilo.
It's much better for you.	To je veliko bolje zate.
They had to go back.	Morali so iti nazaj.
I used to think there was.	Včasih sem mislil, da obstaja.
From then on it was him and me.	Od takrat naprej sva on in jaz.
There's something there.	Nekaj ​​je tam.
No one told her.	Nihče ji ni povedal.
He had his say.	Povedal je svoje.
I want to talk.	Želim govoriti.
They had to know that.	To so morali vedeti.
He won't just give it to you.	Ne bo vam ga kar tako dal.
What is wrong.	Kaj je narobe.
When will you come back home?	Kdaj se boš vrnil domov.
We were also without money.	Tudi brez denarja smo bili.
Just for tonight.	Samo za nocoj.
We still all had to get out of this alive.	Še vedno smo morali vsi živi priti iz tega.
No, no, it's fine.	Ne, ne, v redu je.
I will definitely do this again.	Zagotovo bom to še naredil.
That was very nice.	To je bilo zelo lepo.
Nobody died.	Nihče ni umrl.
That's why we're here.	Prav zato smo tukaj.
So, a few more days.	Tako da, še nekaj dni.
You got what you wanted.	Dobil si kar si hotel.
It was a lot of work.	Bilo je veliko dela.
We have to move on.	Moramo iti naprej.
Nobody knows for sure.	Nihče ne ve zagotovo.
Tell me where it is.	Povej mi kje je.
I have something to say.	Imam nekaj za povedati.
The boy was all surprised.	Fant je bil vse presenečen.
And also the way he said it.	In tudi način, kako je to povedal.
This was not the case.	Temu ni bilo tako.
That's right.	Tako je.
They are always together.	Vedno sta skupaj.
I understand why she did it.	Razumem, zakaj je to storila.
I don't know how to proceed.	Ne vem, kako naprej.
The one, the one.	Tisti, tisti.
And this has been evident for quite some time.	In to je očitno že kar nekaj časa.
And so it is with you.	In tako je tudi pri vas.
What's happening.	Kaj se dogaja.
I have a hard time believing it.	Težko verjamem.
I want you to have it.	Želim, da ga imaš.
He didn't want it.	Ni hotel za to.
It's none of my business.	To ni moja stvar.
She knew he wouldn't say anything.	Vedela je, da ne bo rekel ničesar.
But none of that.	Vendar nič od tega.
That was a good way to do it.	To je bil dober način za to.
But what if it isn't.	A kaj, če ni.
I probably shouldn't talk about it.	Verjetno ne bi smel govoriti o tem.
But she knew she had to eat.	Vedela pa je, da mora jesti.
I don't think there's anything you can do.	Mislim, da ne moreš storiti ničesar.
And go ahead.	In povej naprej.
Hope someone could help.	Upam, da bi lahko kdo pomagal.
Please tell him what you told me.	Prosim, povej mu, kar si povedal meni.
Let him be too.	Pa naj bo tudi on.
Not so long ago for you too.	Tudi zate ne tako dolgo nazaj.
I don't think he found many.	Mislim, da jih ni našel veliko.
It was just us.	Bili smo samo mi.
He knew he wouldn't.	Vedel je, da ne bo.
This is a very good thing.	To je zelo dobra stvar.
You should be able to get there.	Moral bi lahko priti tja.
This is what I want to talk about now.	O tem želim govoriti zdaj.
There's still time.	Še je čas.
I don't have anyone in this place.	Na tem mestu nimam nikogar.
I thought you'd be in trouble.	Mislil sem, da boš imel težave.
He didn't say why.	Ni povedal zakaj.
That was not the case here.	Tukaj ni bilo tako.
You had to know.	Moral si vedeti.
He did what he had to do.	Naredil je, kar je moral.
Like you, like it simple.	Kot ti, všeč je preprosto.
We will do.	Bomo naredili.
But again it's not.	A spet ni.
I do not believe.	Ne verjamem.
Sometimes I regret it.	Včasih mi je žal.
She should be home soon.	Kmalu bi morala biti doma.
I need to know you want this.	Moram vedeti, da si to želiš.
Now it's all over town.	Zdaj je po vsem mestu.
He'll be fine.	Z njim bo vse v redu.
I'd really like to know.	Res bi rad vedel.
Maybe it wouldn't.	Morda ne bi.
It will happen no matter what.	Ne glede na vse se bo zgodilo.
I didn't expect it to happen so quickly.	Nisem pričakoval, da se bo to zgodilo tako hitro.
That seems like a long time ago now.	To se zdaj zdi že dolgo nazaj.
I wouldn't go home.	Ne bi šel domov.
I don't think that's true.	Mislim, da to ni res.
They might never have been together if it hadn't been for him.	Morda nikoli ne bi bila skupaj, če se ne bi on.
In fact, everything will be business as usual.	Pravzaprav bo vse kot običajno.
There was some work.	Bilo je nekaj dela.
He didn't know what they were.	Ni vedel, kaj so.
He always called me himself.	Vedno me je sam poklical.
That's the way to go.	Tako je treba iti.
But he was there.	Vendar je bil tam.
She knew he would help her.	Vedela je, da ji bo pomagal.
Which is good.	Kar je dobro.
It could be anything.	Lahko bi bilo vse.
I hope you can do it.	Upam, da vam bo to uspelo.
I had everything and everything wasn't enough.	Imel sem vse in vsega ni bilo dovolj.
It's something, it's everything.	Je nekaj, je vse.
He can neither leave nor stay.	Ne more niti oditi niti ostati.
Everything about everything.	Vse o vsem.
You could have a good life here.	Tukaj bi lahko imeli dobro življenje.
And that's all on me.	In to je vse na meni.
Are you a game?	Si igra?.
There is no one at home.	Nikogar ni doma.
We have to do this.	To moramo narediti.
I never wanted to lose that.	Nikoli nisem želel, da bi to izgubil.
I guess we'll see.	Mislim, da bomo videli.
Timing is everything.	Čas je vse.
Also something else.	Tudi nekaj drugega.
Me, so we know.	Jaz, da vemo.
There is a reason for this.	Za to obstaja razlog.
That's enough, isn't it.	To je dovolj, kajne.
But maybe it was more than that.	A morda je bilo več kot to.
We will not.	Ne bomo.
Both were very good.	Oba sta bila zelo dobra.
We just have to play like we are.	Samo igrati moramo, kot smo.
Someone to look up to.	Nekdo za videti.
And he still looked the same as ever.	In še vedno je bil videti tako kot vedno.
He just came back.	Pravkar se je vrnil.
He really came.	Res je prišel.
It's true.	Res je.
And you really can't.	In res ne moreš.
I am earlier.	sem prej.
It was here.	Bilo je tukaj.
He still goes when he can.	Še vedno gre, ko lahko.
It could be so much more.	Lahko bi bilo veliko več.
He won't hear us either.	Tudi on nas ne bo slišal.
He is no longer angry.	Zdaj ni več jezen.
It's really nice of you.	Res je lepo od tebe.
All this is true.	Vse to je res.
And it's not good.	In ni dobro.
It's not me.	To nisem jaz.
I didn't have to.	Ni mi bilo treba.
No, we didn't.	Ne, nismo imeli.
There wasn't much work in town.	V mestu ni bilo veliko dela.
We will.	Bomo .
They all are.	Vsi so.
I thought it was.	Mislil sem, da je.
Or maybe earlier.	Ali morda prej.
I have a hard time thinking that's true.	Težko mislim, da je to res.
Just forward.	Samo naprej.
He didn't speak at all.	Sploh ni govoril.
I'll be ready.	Pripravljen bom.
I didn't have this problem until yesterday.	Do včeraj nisem imel te težave.
You lost all about it.	Izgubil si vse o tem.
That's not the right way to say it.	To ni pravi način za povedati.
He is all alone here.	Tukaj je popolnoma sam.
Everything would be fine.	Vse bi bilo v redu.
If he said so, it must be true.	Če je tako rekel, mora biti res.
We actually know.	Pravzaprav vemo.
And he didn't do it alone.	In tega ni storil sam.
It looked fine.	Videti je bilo v redu.
He asked for another.	Prosil je za drugega.
Or, or, or.	Ali, ali, ali.
Good day everyone.	Dober dan vsem.
I was no longer my own person.	Nisem bil več svoj človek.
I said good job.	Rekel sem, dobro delo.
But we know that's not the case.	Vemo pa, da ni tako.
But everything is fine.	Vendar je vse v redu.
To even go there.	Da bi sploh šel tja.
I wonder how much.	Zanima me koliko.
She should do something now.	Zdaj bi morala nekaj narediti.
I know you mean well.	Vem, da misliš dobro.
She knew nothing.	Ničesar ni vedela.
Probably something else.	Verjetno kaj drugega.
We cannot tell what could happen today.	Ne moremo povedati, kaj bi se lahko zgodilo že danes.
It's not better, it's just familiar.	Ni bolje, samo pozna se.
He was obviously very angry.	Očitno je bil zelo jezen.
But he wasted no time.	Vendar ni izgubil časa.
It was me, just me.	Bil sem jaz, samo jaz.
I would come, for sure.	Prišel bi, zagotovo.
He's not ready.	Ni pripravljen.
I could do more.	Lahko bi naredil več.
And it's wrong.	In je narobe.
Maybe a lifetime.	Morda vse življenje.
It will get better and everything will be fine.	Bolje bo in vse bo dobro.
No one ever asked about it.	Nihče ni nikoli vprašal o tem.
He said sure.	Rekel je prepričan.
Now it's time for a question.	Zdaj je čas za vprašanje.
You will succeed too.	Tudi vam bo uspelo.
I don't care about money, none of that.	Ne zanima me denar, nič od tega.
She won't go out alone.	Sama ne bo šla ven.
I could have.	Lahko bi imel.
He wanted to leave.	Hotel je oditi.
I was supposed to meet him there.	Tam naj bi ga že srečal.
I've never asked you for anything.	Še nikoli te nisem prosil za nič.
It just seems that way sometimes.	Samo včasih se zdi tako.
I've never seen that before.	Tega še nikoli nisem videl.
And in the morning.	In zjutraj.
She never went out without him.	Nikoli ni šla ven brez njega.
I could have won.	Lahko bi zmagal.
I'm nothing to you.	Jaz ti nisem nič.
I'm here for you.	Tukaj sem zate.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
It should be more.	Moral bi biti več.
You are my teacher.	Ti si moj učitelj.
It was very nice here.	Tukaj je bilo zelo lepo.
And you'd be right.	In imeli bi prav.
I guess someone has to go.	Verjetno mora nekdo iti.
That's nothing.	Tako ni nič.
Everything will be okay.	Vse bo v redu.
But you could be right.	Lahko pa imaš prav.
And that's just not going to happen.	In to se preprosto ne bo zgodilo.
He didn't say that, but he didn't have to.	Tega ni rekel, a mu ni bilo treba.
This could only be possible now.	To bi lahko bilo zdaj le mogoče.
He had to do something else.	Moral je narediti nekaj drugega.
Now you've told everyone.	Zdaj si vsem povedal.
I know this because mine is too.	To vem, ker je tudi moj.
It was all they could do.	To je bilo vse, kar so lahko storili.
I will go and learn it.	Odšel bom in se tega naučil.
That it would be.	Da bi bilo.
We were there for quite some time.	Tam smo bili kar nekaj časa.
It's still there.	Še vedno je tam.
Or the next one.	Ali naslednji.
I made it there.	Tam mi je uspelo.
He didn't mean to buy everything you wanted.	Ni mislil kupiti vsega, kar si želel.
I couldn't speak.	Nisem mogel govoriti.
Maybe that's okay.	Mogoče je to v redu.
I didn't like that.	To mi ni bilo všeč.
I hope you like it.	Upam, da ti je všeč.
Not so again.	Spet ne tako.
I returned home.	Vrnil sem se domov.
He doesn't look very tired at all.	Sploh ni videti zelo utrujen.
I would always ask.	Vedno bi vprašal.
We didn't do that.	Tega nismo storili.
I haven't found how.	Nisem našel, kako.
I know it is.	Vem, da je.
I would like to .	rad bi .
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Vendar se zdi, da temu ni tako.
I thought that seemed like a lot.	Mislil sem, da se to zdi veliko.
Not even a bit good at.	Niti malo dober v.
It's not always so obvious.	Ni vedno tako očitno.
She thought it was good.	Zdelo se ji je dobro.
Here we have it.	Tukaj ga imamo.
It could be something else.	To bi lahko bilo kaj drugega.
He had to do something.	Nekaj ​​je moral narediti.
He said nothing about where he went.	Nič ni povedal o tem, kam je odšel.
You know what you want to do and why.	Veste, kaj želite početi in zakaj.
Everything is good.	Vse je dobro.
It is now.	Zdaj je.
That's all we got.	To je vse, kar imamo.
And it's not difficult.	In to ni težko.
He never needed it.	Nikoli ga ni potreboval.
I won't tell her.	Ne bom ji povedal.
I just want to look like this from now on.	Od zdaj naprej želim samo videti tako.
He is the only one.	On je edini.
She wanted to talk about it.	Želela je govoriti o tem.
But that's not what this is about.	Vendar tukaj ne gre za to.
It's a good thing she did.	Dobro je, da je to storila.
I can't just tell you.	Ne morem ti kar povedati.
That will be all.	To bo vse.
But it could be so many things.	Lahko pa bi bilo toliko stvari.
He likes to talk a lot.	Zelo rad govori.
I won't wait any longer.	Ne bom več čakal.
I would have died sooner.	Prej bi umrl.
There is no more time.	Ni več časa.
He stayed there for a few days.	Tam je ostal nekaj dni.
I was ready to do just about anything.	Pripravljen sem bil narediti prav vse.
They weren't, not really, not alone.	Niso bili, ne res, ne sami.
Again, I don't know why.	Spet ne vem zakaj.
How could you not.	Kako ne bi.
I have to get out of there.	Moram od tam.
There is nothing here.	Tukaj ni ničesar.
He won't lose again.	Ne bo več izgubil.
There was no one else there.	Tam ni bilo nikogar drugega.
Everyone saw it.	Vsi so to videli.
She was there.	Bila je tam.
Actually, more than once.	Pravzaprav več kot enkrat.
You would never know when.	Nikoli ne bi vedel, kdaj.
Not about that.	Ne o tem.
I wanted something else.	Hotel sem še nekaj.
I really liked it.	Bilo mi je zelo všeč.
I would never go back.	Nikoli se ne bi vrnil.
I really like them.	Zelo so mi všeč.
Not without me.	Ne brez mene.
At that time, man had everything he could want.	Človek je takrat imel vse, kar si je lahko želel.
Because that's not me.	Ker to nisem jaz.
I don't see that.	Ne vidim tega.
I could have done it back then.	To bi lahko naredil že takrat.
I saw them.	Videl sem jih.
Not much help from anyone.	Ni veliko pomoči od nikogar.
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
I hope you enjoy staying here.	Upam, da vam je všeč ostati tukaj.
I didn't either.	Tudi jaz nisem.
He told us about it.	Povedal nam je o tem.
You did it again.	Spet si to naredil.
Not like him.	Ne tako kot on.
Everything was right.	Vse je bilo prav.
Or maybe me.	Ali morda jaz.
I want you.	Želim te.
He did what he knows how to do.	Naredil je, kar zna.
Can someone help me please.	Mi lahko kdo pomaga prosim.
It probably is.	Verjetno je.
I see everything that comes out.	Vidim vse, kar pride ven.
This is really happening.	To se res dogaja.
Just see everything.	Samo videti vse.
Everything here would not be too much.	Vsega tukaj ne bi bilo preveč.
He wasn't ready for that.	Na to ni bil pripravljen.
I know it was hard.	Vem, da je bilo težko.
He was so much.	Bil je tako zelo.
And anyone who knows me will tell you that.	In vsak, ki me pozna, vam bo to povedal.
That's not a question.	To ni vprašanje.
No one knows where you are right now.	Nihče ne ve, kje si trenutno.
Everything is very beautiful in its own way.	Vse je na svoj način zelo lepo.
I mean a lot.	Mislim veliko.
It will be there.	Tam bo.
I just want to see her home.	Samo domov bi jo rad videl.
You should know.	Moral bi vedeti.
We did and it worked.	Naredili smo in uspelo je.
And found nothing.	In našel ničesar.
Someone must know something.	Nekdo mora nekaj vedeti.
She said she was afraid to come home.	Rekla je, da se boji priti domov.
She didn't know for a long time.	Dolgo časa ni vedela.
Now is the time.	Zdaj je pravi čas.
He said he didn't.	Rekel je, da ni.
I think this is wrong.	Mislim, da je to narobe.
That would be very obvious.	To bi bilo zelo očitno.
If you're up for it, he's game.	Če ste za to, je on igra.
Tomorrow will be better.	Jutri bo bolje.
I never needed more than that.	Nikoli nisem potreboval več kot to.
If he said he had it, he had it.	Če je rekel, da jo ima, jo je imel.
He's serious.	On misli resno.
Very nice .	Zelo lepo .
I did something with it.	Nekaj ​​sem naredil s tem.
If only we had more time.	Ko bi le imeli več časa.
It was really hard for me.	Bilo mi je res težko.
He will never succeed again.	Nikoli več mu ne bo uspelo.
We have work to do here.	Tukaj imamo delo.
Neither did I, for that matter.	Tudi jaz nisem, glede tega.
You can know.	Lahko veš.
We know more.	Vemo več.
If you were me, if you were me.	Če bi bili jaz, če bi bili jaz.
But there are some.	Nekaj ​​pa jih je.
He knows what's what.	Ve kaj je kaj.
I'm not in .	Nisem v .
I don't know her anymore.	Ne poznam je več.
That's not all.	To še ni vse.
I don't think you've been there yet.	Mislim, da še nisi bil tam.
Actually even better.	Pravzaprav še bolje.
And if so, good for you.	In če je tako, dobro zate.
I'm sure you know that.	Prepričan sem, da to veš.
Not having a good time.	Ne da bi se imel dobro.
All he knows is that it happened.	Ve le, da se je zgodilo.
If anything, he was very good.	Če kaj, je bil zelo dober.
Live or live with it.	Živi ali živi s tem.
Just like you are to her.	Tako kot si ji.
Not soon enough, for sure.	Ne dovolj kmalu, zagotovo.
I didn't even know.	Sploh nisem vedel.
I hope he still has it.	Upam, da jo še ima.
She said it's good for you.	Rekla je, da je dobro zate.
It's really hard work.	To je res težko delo.
This is very serious.	To je zelo resno.
How to be good.	Kako biti dober.
What's more, I wouldn't be alone.	Še več, ne bi bil sam.
But not tonight.	Vendar ne nocoj.
He doesn't care what anyone thinks.	Saj ga ne zanima, kaj si kdo misli.
And certainly not my father.	In zagotovo ne moj oče.
Me more than you, she said.	Jaz bolj kot ti, je rekla.
Regardless of what the person wanted.	Ne glede na to, kaj si je oseba želela.
I met her.	Spoznal sem jo.
Maybe there weren't any.	Morda jih ni bilo.
Or you, obviously.	Ali ti, očitno.
I loved it at the time.	Takrat mi je bilo všeč.
Sometimes she went more than once a day.	Včasih je šla več kot enkrat na dan.
He didn't just play them.	Ni jih preprosto igral.
Not all the time, but it happened.	Ne ves čas, se je pa zgodilo.
I wonder why.	Zanima me zakaj.
She knew what it was.	Vedela je, kaj je.
I wasn't that surprised.	Nisem bil tako presenečen.
I wish they still had it.	Želim si, da bi ga še imeli.
Not immediately and not for a very long time.	Ne takoj in ne zelo dolgo.
It was nice regardless.	Bilo je lepo ne glede na to.
I didn't succeed.	Ni mi uspelo.
He died immediately.	Takoj je umrl.
It's not like that.	Ni tako.
It was never really like that before.	Prej res nikoli ni bilo tako.
We can't do without it.	Brez tega ne moremo.
You have to tell her, and now.	Povedati ji moraš, in to zdaj.
It was obviously good.	Očitno je bilo dobro.
More than he expected or wanted.	Več kot je pričakoval ali želel.
No, that's not happening.	Ne, to se ne dogaja.
I forgot that.	To sem pozabil.
Right now that's it.	Trenutno je to.
It could be someone who died.	Lahko je nekdo, ki je umrl.
And yet we have today.	Pa vendar imamo danes.
Maybe it's something else.	Mogoče je kaj drugega.
And you're in luck.	In imaš srečo.
Neither does my father.	Tudi moj oče ne.
And she was into it.	In bila je v to.
There is nothing, but everything is there.	Ničesar ni, a vse je tam.
He couldn't go on.	Ni mogel naprej.
Unfortunately, this was not the case.	Žal temu ni bilo tako.
There was something else.	Pa še nekaj je bilo.
Serious or not, he spoke well.	Resno ali ne, dobro je govoril.
I have a problem with this.	S tem imam težave.
I didn't do much of anything.	Ničesar nisem naredil veliko.
He's right about that.	To ima prav.
And very very angry.	In zelo zelo jezen.
He loved you all.	Vse vas je imel rad.
There he goes.	Tja gre.
I am alone.	Sam sem.
He wanted her to know.	Hotel je, da ve.
I never did.	Nikoli nisem.
I had a question.	Imel sem vprašanje.
Like everything is going to be okay now.	Kot da bo zdaj vse v redu.
Maybe they knew.	Mogoče so vedeli.
It worked.	Uspelo je.
We can never get together again.	Nikoli več ne moremo priti skupaj.
You almost could.	Skoraj bi lahko.
Maybe more than that.	Mogoče več kot to.
That was then.	To je bilo takrat.
I know this because we did it.	To vem, ker smo to storili.
They were there the whole time.	Tam so bili ves čas.
The whole thing was really quite simple.	Vse skupaj je bilo res precej preprosto.
He probably already knows if he got it.	Verjetno že ve, če ga je dobil.
Nothing like this has ever happened.	Kaj takega se še ni zgodilo.
I'd rather not do that.	Tega raje ne bi naredil.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Noče govoriti o tem.
I never wanted to see him again.	Nikoli več ga nisem hotel videti.
I have a job at this place.	Na tem mestu imam delo.
I would get her back.	Dobil bi jo nazaj.
That's all well and good.	To je vse lepo in prav.
We just love it.	Nam je preprosto všeč.
Neither would any of us.	Pa tudi nihče od nas ne bi.
He didn't expect to stay long.	Ni pričakoval, da bo ostal dolgo.
We could have.	Lahko bi imeli.
Where are my thoughts? 	Kje so moje misli?
I said you won't come.	Rekel sem, da ne boš prišel.
This, this, this one didn't know.	To, to, ta ni vedel.
Maybe we are.	Mogoče smo.
A man who has	Človek, ki ima.
I don't know that we have to be.	Ne vem, da moramo biti.
He wasn't expecting us.	Ni nas pričakoval.
He won't let you.	Ne bo vam pustil.
It's good, he said.	Dobro je, je rekel.
I still loved it.	Še vedno mi je bilo všeč.
I seriously like it.	Resno mi je všeč.
Nice of you to come.	Lepo od tebe, da si prišel.
He used to be when he was a kid.	Včasih je bil, ko je bil otrok.
She will always want to.	Vedno si bo želela.
You'll be fine for now.	Za zdaj boš v redu.
It would be good to be home.	Dobro bi bilo biti doma.
I doubt you ever will.	Dvomim, da boš kdaj.
He's already done that.	To je že naredil.
They are very helpful.	V veliko pomoč so.
It looks like he can come and play today.	Zdi se, da lahko danes pride in igra.
I do not .	Jaz ne .
But none of this was true.	Vendar nič od tega ni bilo res.
He never said it would be easy.	Nikoli ni rekel, da bo lahko.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
He was the only one who came out.	On je bil edini, ki je prišel ven.
But it's always there.	Vendar je vedno tam.
Or, maybe because of that.	Ali pa, morda bi zaradi tega.
They weren't together long.	Nista bila dolgo skupaj.
And tell me what you think.	In povej mi, kaj si misliš.
She will be very good.	Zelo dobra bo.
Because .	Zaradi .
We'll see them again.	Še jih bomo videli.
I found her.	Našel sem jo.
I wouldn't stay.	Ne bi ostal.
I really like it!.	Res mi je všeč!.
But he made up his mind.	Vendar se je odločil.
And he's still doing it now.	In to počne še zdaj.
That's not how it works here.	Tukaj ne gre tako.
Once is enough.	Enkrat je dovolj.
Happy week ahead.	Vesel teden pred nami.
Back, back, back.	Nazaj, nazaj, nazaj.
I only met her once.	Samo enkrat sem jo srečal.
But that's not what it does.	Vendar to ni tisto, kar počne.
Maybe it was simple enough.	Mogoče je bilo dovolj preprosto.
Or maybe just a little right.	Ali morda samo malo prav.
Everything seems fine to me.	Vse se mi zdi v redu.
We have too.	Tudi mi imamo.
I'm sure you're right about that.	Prepričan sem, da imaš glede tega prav.
I hope it was okay.	Upam, da je bilo v redu.
I dare not speak to him.	Ne upam si govoriti z njim.
There is something else.	Nekaj ​​drugega je.
Not really.	Res ne.
Nothing about it was true either.	Prav tako nič v tem ni bilo res.
She would love it.	Bila bi ji všeč.
Live on.	Živi naprej.
I would find someone else.	Našel bi koga drugega.
We have them.	Imamo jih.
I wish we all would.	Želim si, da bi vsi.
I'm sure that will never happen.	Prepričan sem, da se to nikoli ne bo zgodilo.
I'd like to see you there.	Rad bi te videl tam.
There was a lot of that.	Tega je bilo veliko.
So please help if you don't mind.	Tako da prosim za pomoč, če ti ni problem.
I know what you did.	Vem, kaj si naredil.
I'm sure he's with you.	Prepričan sem, da je s tabo.
I thought we were going to have a good time.	Mislil sem, da se bomo imeli lepo.
Either you were right or you weren't.	Ali si bil pravi ali pa nisi bil.
But there is more.	Je pa še več.
You are all he has now.	Ti si vse, kar ima zdaj.
More than that, really.	Še več, res.
He said he would stay.	Rekel je, da bo ostal.
She said ok ok.	Rekla je v redu, v redu.
It works for all of us.	To dela za vse nas.
That's all that's going on right now.	To je vse, kar se trenutno dogaja.
But they are more than that.	Vendar so več kot to.
You didn't have to be there to know.	Ni vam bilo treba biti tam, da bi vedeli.
It's quite difficult.	Precej težko je.
And it's yours.	In tvoj je.
What do we have here? 	Kaj imamo tukaj?
He knows he will have to.	Ve, da bo moral.
They are all here now.	Zdaj so vsi tukaj.
However, this was not the case.	Vendar temu ni bilo tako.
It was quite a lot.	Bilo je kar veliko.
Everyone in town knew it.	Vsi v mestu so to vedeli.
The work was very difficult.	Delo je bilo zelo težko.
It must be a lot.	Mora biti veliko.
But he said he would come.	Vendar je rekel, da bo prišel.
It will look right and it will be right.	Videti bo prav in bo prav.
He never was.	Nikoli ga ni bilo.
He's having a party.	Ima zabavo.
He didn't come to me.	Ni prišel k meni.
I don't like that at all.	To mi sploh ni všeč.
Maybe too serious.	Mogoče preveč resno.
This is a good thing for both of us.	To je dobra stvar za oba.
He really wanted it.	Zelo si je želel.
Something will happen.	Nekaj ​​se bo zgodilo.
And he's right about that.	In glede tega ima prav.
Nothing will ever be right again.	Nikoli več ne bo nič v redu.
Just like life.	Tako kot življenje.
They just are.	Samo so.
Just do it your way.	Samo naredi po svoje.
I won't be allowed to see her.	Ne bom je smel videti.
I'm glad to have you.	Vesel sem, da te imam.
You shouldn't do that.	Tega ne bi smeli storiti.
You should never do that.	Tega nikoli ne bi smeli storiti.
I still believe.	Še vedno verjamem.
Or so he said.	Ali pa je tako povedal.
But he couldn't help it.	Vendar si ni mogel pomagati.
You have to come here.	Moraš priti sem.
And he won.	In zmagal je.
That's why you came here.	Zato si prišel sem.
You always have problems.	Vedno imaš težave.
It's not hard to see.	Tega ni težko videti.
She could have been, but she wasn't.	Lahko bi bila, pa ni bila.
I have no regrets.	Nič mi ni žal.
And good.	In dobro.
That wouldn't be good.	To ne bi bilo dobro.
Sometimes you have to work with what you've got.	Včasih moraš delati s tem, kar imaš.
But I didn't like it.	Vendar mi ni bilo všeč.
I wish that wasn't the case.	Želim si, da temu ne bi bilo tako.
Now say something.	Zdaj pa povej nekaj.
All he says is no.	Vse kar pravi je ne.
This will happen.	To se bo zgodilo.
And now someone wanted to say it again.	In zdaj je nekdo spet hotel povedati.
Or maybe it wasn't that.	Ali pa morda ni bilo to.
Not after what happened here.	Ne po tem, kar se je zgodilo tukaj.
They will probably only have a few.	Verjetno jih bodo imeli le nekaj.
You don't have to do anything.	Nič ti ni treba narediti.
I'm sure you're right.	Prepričan sem, da imaš prav.
You will also need to convince him to help you.	Prav tako ga boste morali prepričati, da vam pomaga.
Once upon a time, this would not be difficult.	Nekoč to ne bi bilo težko.
Which they were.	Kar so bili.
I know it is.	Vem, da je.
I tried.	Poskušal sem.
Alas, almost certainly not.	Žal, skoraj zagotovo ne.
I love these people.	Rad imam te ljudi.
I've played a few.	Igral sem jih nekaj.
I could do it.	Lahko bi naredil.
He won't need it.	Ne bo ga potreboval.
You got me.	Dobil si me.
She wasn't the only one.	Ni bila edina.
Mine won't even get it.	Moj je sploh ne bo dobil.
Because he had money.	Ker je imel denar.
He had no money.	Ni imel denarja.
We are all doing well at home.	Doma nam je vsem dobro.
I mean, if you wanted to.	Mislim, če bi hotel.
You didn't even need me, as you said yourself.	Sploh me nisi potreboval, kot si sam rekel.
I know them, almost all of them.	Poznam jih, skoraj vse.
That's what they did.	To so storili.
You can just be.	Lahko si samo.
Or not immediately.	Ali pa ne takoj.
She probably knows it herself.	Verjetno ve tudi sama.
He had to do something.	Nekaj ​​je moral narediti.
He doesn't want to eat.	Noče jesti.
And so they should.	In tako bi tudi morali.
There's something to be said for that.	Za to je treba nekaj povedati.
I didn't like that.	To mi ni bilo všeč.
He has something to tell you.	Ima ti nekaj povedati.
Something was wrong with him.	Z njim nekaj ni bilo v redu.
I'm afraid for you.	Bojim se zate.
He will come regardless.	Prišel bo ne glede na to.
I have a lot.	Imam veliko.
No, it's much more than that.	Ne, je veliko več kot to.
Just thoughts.	Samo misli.
It's happened to all of us.	Vsem se nam je to zgodilo.
I have to help.	Moram pomagati.
The question is how.	Vprašanje je, kako.
It had to be him.	To je moral biti on.
I wouldn't let anyone do that.	Tega ne bi nikomur dovolil.
Now he knows what he has to do.	Zdaj ve, kaj mora storiti.
I felt	Počutil sem se.
So glad to be here.	Tako vesel, da sem tukaj.
It seemed like it was.	Zdelo se je, kot da je.
It had to be said.	Treba je bilo povedati.
Or you think they are.	Ali pa mislite, da so.
If this were not the case, one would be quite surprised.	Če ne bi bilo tako, bi bil kdo prav presenečen.
Because you know you are.	Ker veš, da si.
He was all there.	Bil je ves tam.
We knew right away.	Takoj smo vedeli.
If you do, we'll see.	Če boš, bomo videli.
Maybe he's right, maybe not.	Morda ima prav, morda ne.
Long time no see.	Že dolgo me ni bilo videti.
He probably knew why he was here.	Verjetno je vedel, zakaj je tukaj.
It just doesn't have to be that way.	Samo ni treba, da je tako.
Or father too.	Ali pa tudi oče.
I'm fine with everything.	Vse mi gre.
It was for someone else.	Bilo je za nekoga drugega.
He always knew that.	Vedno je to vedel.
It would never happen again.	Nikoli več ne bi bilo.
To no one.	Nikomur.
No, no, he says.	Ne, ne, pravi.
Maybe she was, a little.	Morda je bila, malo.
It's true.	Res je.
Nobody told him to do that.	Nihče mu ni rekel, naj to stori.
And he knows it.	In to ve.
I don't know from whom.	Ne vem od koga.
It happened to me very quickly.	Zgodilo se mi je zelo hitro.
Maybe too nice.	Mogoče preveč lepo.
You told me that too.	Tudi to si mi povedal.
He is still here with us.	Še vedno je tukaj z nami.
That's fine with me.	To je v redu z mano.
This is a must see.	To je treba videti.
No, it can't be that.	Ne, to ne more biti to.
She knew it was true, and it was enough.	Vedela je, da je res, in bilo je dovolj.
Maybe because she was at home.	Morda zato, ker je bila doma.
He failed.	Ni mu uspelo.
I mean, it couldn't be.	Mislim, ne bi lahko bilo.
And so beautiful.	In tako lepo.
You must know enough about me by now.	Do zdaj moraš že dovolj vedeti o meni.
I wonder if it is true.	Sprašujem se, če je res.
He said he would.	Rekel je, da bo.
He didn't want to say what it was.	Ni hotel povedati, za kaj gre.
We have too many.	Preveč jih imamo.
You are your own man.	Ti si sam svoj človek.
I'm just me.	Jaz sem samo jaz.
That didn't happen either.	Tudi to se ni zgodilo.
You really could have it all.	Res bi lahko imeli vse.
Yes, just like you.	Da, tako kot ti.
We have a lot of them.	Imamo jih zelo veliko.
She'll know you're there.	Vedela bo, da si tam.
I would never do that.	Nikoli ne bi naredil tega.
Not even that.	Niti tega ne.
Tell her it's okay.	Povej ji, da je v redu.
Me too.	Meni tudi.
Do what you can.	Naredi kar lahko.
It's just what a man does.	To preprosto počne človek.
They are nothing to me.	Zame niso nič.
I can see that it is difficult.	Vidim, da je težko.
Yet many people do.	Pa vendar to počne veliko ljudi.
I like to think we are more or better.	Rad mislim, da smo več ali boljši.
But that wasn't all either.	A tudi to ni bilo vse.
And something about it seems unlikely.	In nekaj o tem se zdi malo verjetno.
How does he know.	Kako ve.
Nothing was right.	Nič ni bilo prav.
Maybe not.	Mogoče ni.
There were more of them now.	Zdaj jih je bilo več.
He came out of it.	Prišel je iz tega.
That's very little.	To je zelo malo.
Everything is simply like that.	Vse je preprosto tako.
He was even more ready to leave than before.	Bil je še bolj pripravljen oditi kot prej.
And him too.	In njega tudi.
I can only go forward.	Lahko grem samo naprej.
You have to go.	Moraš iti.
It can't be any of these.	Ne more biti nič od tega.
If he felt like it.	Če se mu je zdelo.
I don't have much to tell you.	Nimam ti veliko povedati.
I just don't know that.	Samo tega ne vem.
I would never do that now.	Zdaj tega ne bi nikoli naredil.
Something seemed wrong to me.	Nekaj ​​se mi je zdelo narobe.
That's what you think.	Tako si misliš.
It's still a problem.	Še vedno je problem.
If not, no.	Če ne, ne.
I didn't know what to do or believe.	Nisem vedel, kaj naj storim ali verjamem.
And maybe it is.	In morda je.
