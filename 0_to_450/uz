It was another tough call.	Yana qiyin qo'ng'iroq bo'ldi.

He didn't know what to do next.	U bundan keyin nima qilishni bilmas edi.

I'm not him.	Men u emasman.
This is mine though.	Bu mening lekin.

You can never tell.	Hech qachon ayta olmaysiz.
I didn’t want to do it now.	Men buni hozir qilishni xohlamadim.
There was more work to be done for him.	U uchun yana ko'p ish qilish mumkin edi.
But that could not have happened.	Lekin bu sodir bo'lishi mumkin emas edi.
I don't have to do anything.	Men hech narsa qilishim shart emas.
No, he wasn't.	Yo'q, u yo'q edi.

I think he just didn’t know what to do.	Menimcha, u shunchaki nima qilishni bilmas edi.

Very nice girl.	Juda yaxshi qiz.
He wanted to.	U xohlagan edi.
Actually, he had.	Aslida, u bor edi.
Not fast, though.	Tez emas, lekin.
He hadn't considered this possibility.	U bu imkoniyat haqida o'ylamagan edi.
He wouldn't let me.	U menga ruxsat bermadi.
It's just that.	U shunchaki.
But he was.	Lekin u edi.

If anything, what is wrong?	Agar biror narsa bo'lsa, nima noto'g'ri?
This is very true.	Bu juda to'g'ri.
Really hard time.	Haqiqatan ham qiyin vaqt.
Demand and supply.	Talab va taklif.
It seemed so easy.	Bu juda oson tuyuldi.
He was sure of it.	U bunga amin edi.
It wasn't him.	Bu o'zi emas edi.

So that was it.	Shunday qilib, bu shunday edi.
I see him.	Men uni ko'raman.
He didn't have time.	Uning vaqti yo'q edi.
This is definitely not the best idea.	Bu, albatta, eng yaxshi fikr emas.

It's a nice day.	Ajoyib kun.
He's gone.	U ketdi.

He knew what to do.	U nima qilish kerakligini bilar edi.
A lot is clear to me.	Menga ko'p narsa aniq.

I think you will like it too.	O'ylaymanki, sizga ham yoqadi.
Maybe something was wrong with me.	Ehtimol, men bilan nimadir noto'g'ri edi.

He wasn't like that anymore.	U endi bunday emas edi.
I just don’t agree with that.	Men shunchaki bunga rozi emasman.
It was a difficult time for us there.	U erda biz uchun qiyin vaqt edi.

But he is still coming.	Lekin u hali ham keladi.
Someone must have told you.	Kimdir sizga aytgan bo'lsa kerak.
SHE IS.	U.

This is his last day.	Bu uning oxirgi kuni.
Not just for a young man.	Faqat yosh yigit uchun emas.
You can only make the last call.	Siz faqat oxirgi qo'ng'iroq qilishingiz mumkin.

He wanted it.	U buni xohlagan edi.
He was still there.	U hali ham bor edi.
I have a request.	Menga iltimos bor.
I don’t know what they are, though.	Ular nima ekanligini bilmayman, lekin.
Of course he loves it.	Albatta, u buni yaxshi ko'radi.
From this you.	Bundan siz.
There were a lot of people there.	U erda juda ko'p odamlar bor edi.
I think he will be himself tonight.	O'ylaymanki, u bugun kechqurun o'zi bo'ladi.

He looked straight at me.	U to‘g‘ri menga qaradi.

Maybe no one can help you.	Ehtimol, hech kim sizga yordam bera olmaydi.
I hope you like it.	Umid qilamanki, sizga yoqadi.
Great today.	Bugun ajoyib.
It wasn’t work.	Bu ish emas edi.
This is a very good idea.	Bu juda yaxshi fikr.
He certainly would.	U albatta bo'lardi.
It was much better.	Bu ancha yaxshi edi.
In fact, this is none other than him.	Aslida, bu undan boshqa hech kim emas.

Faster, faster.	Tezroq, tezroq.
That sounds wrong, doesn’t it?	Bu noto'g'ri ko'rinadi, shunday emasmi?
He was most surprised.	U eng hayratda qoldi.

I feel the same way.	Men ham xuddi shunday his qilyapman.
That would be nice.	Bu yaxshi bo'lardi.
He wasn’t the first to call either.	U ham birinchi bo'lib qo'ng'iroq qilmagan.
I did it.	Men buni qildim.
That was his job.	Bu uning ishi edi.
And that's not a good thing.	Va bu yaxshi narsa emas.
It was just that.	Bu shunchaki edi.
In fact, no.	Aslida yo'q.
Maybe something really happened tonight.	Ehtimol, bu kecha haqiqatan ham biror narsa sodir bo'ladi.
It is clear that this will be the case.	Bu shunday bo'lishi aniq.
Tell me what you need.	Nima kerakligini ayting.
They are simply.	Ular shunchaki.

They were still very young.	Ular hali juda yosh edi.
It was not hard to do.	Buni qilish qiyin emas edi.
I don't know if the answer is correct or not.	Javob to'g'ri yoki yo'qligini bilmayman.
I know this very well.	Men buni juda yaxshi bilaman.
It turned out very well.	Bu juda yaxshi chiqdi.
Now you don't have such a good day.	Endi sizda bunday yaxshi kun yo'q.

With that guy.	O'sha yigit bilan.
I know these things.	Men bu narsalarni bilaman.
It looks and feels great.	U juda yaxshi ko'rinadi va ko'rinadi.
Then it's not fun.	Keyin qiziq emas.
It wasn’t a big deal.	Bu katta ish emas edi.
This is a lie.	Bu yolg'on.
He didn't know what he was doing.	U nima qilayotganini bilmas edi.
And he doesn't always act like that.	Va u har doim ham shunday harakat qilmaydi.
Let me in, please.	Menga ruxsat bering, iltimos.
I'll let you.	Menga ruxsat beraman.
It can be very difficult.	Bu juda qiyin bo'lishi mumkin.

Here’s something else.	Bu yerda yana nimadir.

But he didn't.	Lekin u buni qilmadi.
He came immediately.	U darhol keldi.
Actually, he didn't.	Aslida, u qilmadi.
Great opportunity!	Katta imkoniyat!
He didn't anymore.	U endi qilmadi.
I think about it a lot.	Men bu haqda ko'p o'ylayman.
I really did.	Men, albatta, qildim.
This is not the case.	Bu shunday emas.
And it will all happen soon.	Va hammasi tez orada sodir bo'ladi.
He still is.	U hali ham.
Of course he thought so.	Albatta, u shunday deb o'yladi.
He makes a fool of himself.	U o'zini ahmoq qiladi.
Or the car could be the problem.	Yoki mashina muammo bo'lishi mumkin.
I knew exactly what was going to happen.	Men nima bo'lishini aniq bilardim.
It is known.	Bu aniq.
It helps solve things.	Bu narsalarni hal qilishga yordam beradi.
I think he's here.	Menimcha, u shu yerda.
It's not like work.	Bu ish kabi emas.
That was it.	Bu shunday edi.
But this is wrong.	Lekin bu noto'g'ri.
I can't remember exactly anymore.	Men endi aniq eslay olmayman.

I was a little surprised.	Men biroz hayron bo'ldim.
I will try to make this clear.	Men buni aniq qilishga harakat qilaman.
I had great doubts.	Menda katta shubha bor edi.

That would be a great job.	Bu ajoyib ish bo'lardi.
I will try to do that.	Men buni qilishga harakat qilaman.
He didn't know what it was and why.	U nima ekanligini va nima uchun ekanligini bilmas edi.
That should be clear.	Bu aniq bo'lishi kerak.

No one knows how to do it.	Buni qanday qilishni hech kim bilmaydi.
No, it's not a problem.	Yo'q, muammo emas.
That's great.	Bu juda yaxshi.
It’s a good move, but I need some work.	Bu yaxshi harakat, lekin menga biroz ish kerak.
He felt bad.	U o'zini yomon his qildi.
And this is very important.	Va bu juda muhim.
Good and good.	Yaxshi va yaxshi.
It can't be.	Bo'lishi ham mumkin emas.
He thought he fell asleep.	U uxlab qoldi deb o'yladi.
Something went wrong.	Nimadir noto‘g‘ri ketdi.
But he accepted the truth.	Lekin haqiqatni qabul qildi.
You can never tell what will happen.	Nima bo'lishini hech qachon ayta olmaysiz.
I have no problem with that.	Menda bu bilan hech qanday muammo yo'q.
He didn’t do much.	U ko'p ish qilgani emas.

Then there were the people.	Keyin u erda odamlar bor edi.
He gets nothing.	U hech narsa olmaydi.
It made me a little upset.	Bu meni biroz xafa qildi.
Or it should be.	Yoki shunday bo'lishi kerak.
Too much.	Juda ko'p.

He was not wrong.	U xato qilmagan.
And then, once again, nothing.	Va keyin, yana bir bor, hech narsa.
It tells you.	Bu sizga aytadi.
But it was just that.	Lekin bu shunchaki edi.
Or they don’t and don’t.	Yoki ular yo'q va yo'q.
I don’t think it’s possible, but it’s an opportunity.	Menimcha, bu ehtimol emas, lekin bu imkoniyat.
I never think of him that way.	Men u haqida hech qachon bunday deb o'ylamayman.
Everything was fine, everything was fine.	Hammasi yaxshi edi, hammasi yaxshi edi.
It was amazing.	Bu ajoyib edi.
Help Wanted.	Yordam kerak.
But he was wrong.	Lekin u noto'g'ri edi.
I'm so sorry.	Men juda afsusdaman.
Where is he 	U qayerda?
Similarly, it just seems to me.	Xuddi shunday, faqat menga ko'rinadi.
This is not for us.	Bu biz uchun emas.

Or maybe with.	Yoki, ehtimol, bilan.
It's not really clear.	Bu aslida aniq emas.
I knew what was going to happen.	Men nima bo'lishini bilardim.
I think so.	Menimcha, shunday.

Just something.	Shunchaki narsa.

That's pretty good.	Bu ancha yaxshi.
I have something important.	Menda muhim narsa bor.

I don't know how to solve this.	Men buni qanday hal qilishni bilmayman.

He asked me.	— deb so‘radi u mendan.
How can I solve this.	Buni qanday hal qila olaman.
It doesn't matter.	Bu muhim emas.

That was too much for us.	Bu biz uchun juda ko'p edi.
It was so scary.	Bu juda qo'rqib ketdi.
What happened.	Nima bo'ldi.
This is not true at all.	Bu hech qanday to'g'ri emas.

We need to do something.	Biz nimadir qilishimiz kerak.
I am sure he made the right decision.	Ishonchim komilki, u to'g'ri qaror qabul qilgan.

I didn’t want the truth.	Men haqiqatni xohlamadim.

He didn't want her to know that yet.	U hali buni bilishini xohlamadi.
This is important.	Bu muhim.
I am not sure.	Ishonchim komil emas.
No one has responded to this, yet.	Buning uchun hech kim javob bermadi, hali yo'q.
It wasn't soon.	Tez orada emas edi.
The answer is no.	Javob yo'q.
He came out.	U chiqdi.
And there is.	Va bor.

Not a lie.	Yolg'on emas.
It seemed easy to him.	Bu unga oson tuyuldi.

It sounded great to me.	Bu menga ajoyib tuyuldi.

He is a car man.	U mashina odam.
It was a mistake anyone could make.	Bu har kim qilish mumkin bo'lgan xato edi.
Not in the evening, never.	Kechqurun emas, hech qachon.
This could be the answer.	Bu javob bo'lishi mumkin.

No one can do it for him.	U uchun hech kim buni qila olmaydi.
He thought he was doing the right thing.	U to'g'ri ish qilyapman deb o'yladi.

Any idiot knows that.	Buni har qanday ahmoq biladi.
Excuse me.	Kechirasiz.

I know there is more to it than that.	Men bundan ham ko'proq borligini bilaman.
He doesn't call back.	U qaytib qo'ng'iroq qilmaydi.
And fell asleep again.	Va yana uxlab qoldi.
I was sick.	Men kasal edim.

You have a good point.	Sizda yaxshi fikr bor.
It's just that he's always with you.	Shunchaki u doim siz bilan.
Alone, it was depressing.	Yolg'iz o'zi, bu tushkunlikka tushdi.
He couldn't either.	U ham qila olmadi.
This is certainly nothing new.	Bu, albatta, yangi narsa emas.

And this book is brand new.	Va bu kitob xuddi yangi.
Just that.	Shunchaki.
Another night and another day.	Yana bir kecha va yana bir kun.
This is clearly a mistake.	Bu aniq xato.
There are many things.	Ko'p narsa bor.
I wanted to ask for some more time.	Men yana bir oz vaqt iltimos qilmoqchi edim.
But you were one.	Lekin siz bir edingiz.
He was a very interesting person.	U juda qiziq odam edi.
No one could tell.	Hech kim ayta olmadi.
They were still good people.	Ular hali ham yaxshi odamlar edi.

They're just not there for that.	Ular shunchaki buning uchun emas.
He probably should have.	U bo'lishi kerak edi, ehtimol.

And of course, everything is fine.	Va, albatta, hamma narsa yaxshi.
He looked at her.	U unga qaradi.

Let me know .	Menga xabar bering .
This is how it should be.	Bu shunday bo'lishi kerak.
I hope not tonight.	Umid qilamanki, bu kecha emas.

It was very, very wrong.	Bu juda, juda noto'g'ri edi.
I didn't know what to do here.	Bu yerda nima qilishni bilmasdim.
He really tried to help.	U haqiqatan ham yordam berishga harakat qildi.
I never thought of such a thing.	Men hech qachon bunday narsa haqida o'ylamagan edim.
The answer is probably no.	Ehtimol, javob yo'q.
I would do that and then I would do something else.	Men buni qilgan bo'lardim va keyin boshqa narsa qilgan bo'lardim.
I think it's very likely.	Menimcha, bu juda katta ehtimol.
It happened very quickly.	Bu juda tez sodir bo'ldi.
He can't feel good alone.	U yolg'iz o'zini yaxshi his qila olmaydi.
No one else.	Boshqa hech kim.
I will not buy again.	Men boshqa sotib olmayman.

I think it is possible.	Menimcha, bu mumkin.

Next year, probably not.	Kelgusi yil, ehtimol, yo'q.
I was confident all along.	Men hamma vaqt ishonchim komil edi.

The answer to that is never.	Bunga javob hech qachon emas.
It was a bit like that.	Bu biroz shunday edi.
It wasn't quite.	Bu unchalik emas edi.
He didn't want to die here.	U bu erda o'lishni xohlamadi.
And he didn't.	Va u buni qilmadi.
It happened.	Bu sodir bo'ldi.
But that's how it should be.	Lekin shunday, shunday bo'lishi kerak.
What a beautiful man.	Qanday chiroyli odam.
He would have accepted.	U qabul qilgan bo'lardi.
And so it will be.	Va shunday bo'ladi.
I'm afraid, but he is.	Men qo'rqaman, lekin u shunday.
It's just what happened.	Bu shunchaki sodir bo'lgan narsa.
Good work.	Yaxshi ish.
But then something.	Lekin keyin nimadir.
But there is a call.	Lekin, bir qo'ng'iroq bor.
It can't be a good thing, that's for sure.	Bu yaxshi narsa bo'lishi mumkin emas, bu aniq.

It would be nice.	Yaxshi bo'lardi.
It's not always bad.	Bu har doim ham yomon emas.

He didn't know why or why.	U nima uchun ekanligini ham, nima uchun ekanligini ham bilmas edi.
They may be wrong.	Ular noto'g'ri bo'lishi mumkin.
Maybe that's not quite right.	Ehtimol, bu unchalik to'g'ri emas.
In fact, it is.	Aslida, bu shunday.
He wants it.	U buni xohlaydi.
I knew better.	Men yaxshiroq bilardim.
No one can do that.	Buni hech kim qila olmaydi.
I could never do it myself.	Men o'zim buni hech qachon qila olmadim.
I love you for it.	Men sizni buning uchun yaxshi ko'raman.
This is his job.	Bu uning ishi.
This is no longer true.	Bu endi to'g'ri emas.
Answer: No.	Javob: “Yo‘q”.
What to do next? 	Keyin nima qilish kerak?
I want to be with him.	Men u bilan birga bo'lishni xohlayman.
I do it myself.	Men buni o'zim qilaman.
Everything about it was great.	Bu haqda hamma narsa ajoyib edi.
It was too bad.	Bu juda yomon edi.
Error.	Xato.

He is an interesting boy.	U qiziq bola.
He would be fine.	U yaxshi bo'lardi.
Everything is fine.	Hammasi yaxshi.
And so it is here.	Va bu erda ham shunday.
It almost was.	Bu deyarli edi.
He was happy.	U baxtli edi.
It was a good time.	Bu yaxshi vaqt edi.
He needed money fast.	Unga tez pul kerak edi.
He left.	U ketdi.
I just wanted to play with him and have fun.	Men u bilan shunchaki o'ynashni va dam olishni xohlardim.

They are very good.	Ular juda yaxshi.
It goes fast.	Tez ketadi.
I don't want anyone to hurt me.	Hech kim meni xafa qilishini xohlamayman.
No one wants to be told what to do.	Hech kim nima qilish kerakligini aytishni xohlamaydi.
You are not stupid either.	Siz ham ahmoq emassiz.
But they are not very interesting.	Lekin ular unchalik qiziq emas.
Not always.	Har doim ham shunday emas.
It wasn't a problem.	Bu muammo emas edi.
And then we could call him.	Va keyin biz unga qo'ng'iroq qilishimiz mumkin edi.

I won't bother you.	Men sizni bezovta qilmayman.
It must have been sickening for him.	Bu uning uchun kasal bo'lishi kerak edi.
There is no other me.	Boshqa men yo'q.
There will be several people.	Bir nechta odam bo'ladi.

I will do it again.	Men buni yana qilaman.
It was not a difficult task.	Bu unchalik qiyin ish emas edi.
And there was a lot of food.	Va juda ko'p ovqat bor edi.

what happened	Nima bo'ldi.
It could be anyone else.	Boshqa har qanday odam bo'lishi mumkin.
Not all, of course.	Hammasi emas, albatta.

Of course it's wrong.	Albatta noto'g'ri.

He left the next week.	U keyingi hafta ketdi.
He doesn't feel it much.	U buni ko'p his qilmaydi.
It's very easy.	Bu juda oson.
He didn't want to do it.	U buni qilishni xohlamadi.

What does he do?	U nima qiladi.
It's very sad.	Bu juda xafa.
He wanted to move.	U harakat qilishni xohladi.
Nobody and everything.	Hech kim va hammasi.
He also married again.	U ham yana turmushga chiqdi.

Now, this year, it certainly promises.	Endi u bu yil, albatta, va'da qiladi.

Like rain, but not.	Yomg'ir kabi, lekin emas.
I think that's all.	Menimcha, bu hammasi.
And you know it well, very well.	Va siz buni yaxshi bilasiz, juda yaxshi.

Now there is nothing.	Endi hech narsa yo'q.
I am very happy.	Men juda xursandman.

He does things and he does them right.	U narsalarni qiladi va u buni to'g'ri qiladi.

That's it.	Bu shunday.
That's what I advise.	Men shunday maslahat beraman.
Well, how about this.	Yaxshi, bu qanday.

And one hopes they are.	Va kimdir ular shunday deb umid qiladi.
