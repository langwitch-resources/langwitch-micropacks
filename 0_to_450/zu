That is a good question.	Umbuzo omuhle lowo.
And it will not be.	Futhi ngeke kube.
And he didn't want to.	Futhi wayengafuni.

And now.	Futhi manje.

You want to come here.	Ufuna ukuza lapha.
I did not want to leave.	Ngangingafuni ukuhamba.
Location, place, place.	Indawo, indawo, indawo.
It's been great.	Kube kuhle kakhulu.
At the hospital.	Esibhedlela.
But that is not the answer.	Kodwa leyo akuyona impendulo.
I know a good place.	Ngiyazi indawo enhle.

And a little bit.	Futhi kancane.
That is not true.	Lokho akulona iqiniso.

Is that really it.	Ingabe yilokho ngempela.
This is good, isn't it?	Kuhle lokhu, akunjalo?
I can't believe you think so.	Angikholwa ukuthi ucabanga kanjalo.
You can't walk.	Awukwazi ukuhamba.
He lives alone.	Uhlala yedwa.
You.	Uwena.
He is a very bad person.	Ungumuntu omubi kakhulu.
I do not really know.	Angazi ngempela.
You know that's true.	Uyazi lokho kuyiqiniso.
Probably not.	Cishe ngeke.
That would be great.	Lokho kungaba kuhle.
Tell me why.	Ngitshele kungani.
And he did not want her to leave again.	Futhi wayengafuni ukuthi aphinde ahambe.
Now that is not true.	Manje lokho akulona iqiniso.
It may be necessary.	Kungase kudingeke.
I could not.	Nami angikwazanga.
I did it wrong.	Ngikwenze kabi.
How can I do this.	Ngingakwenza kanjani lokhu.
Just nothing.	Akukho lutho nje.

She is very beautiful.	Muhle kakhulu.

It is not health for you.	Akuyona impilo kuwe.
And just, you know.	Futhi nje, uyazi.
There really is that.	Impela kukhona lokho.
You have to always be human.	Kufanele uhlale ungumuntu.
And, he says.	Futhi, uthi.
I know it will happen.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
So to speak.	Ngakho ukukhuluma.
You do not need much.	Awudingi okuningi.
Reading or eating.	Ukufunda noma ukudla.

Her mother is there.	Umama wakhe ukhona.
I can't talk about that.	Angikwazi ukukhuluma ngalokho.
I thought he said he wanted to help.	Bengicabanga ukuthi uthe ufuna ukusiza.
So, that's fine.	Ngalokho, kulungile.
I never went to school.	Angizange ngiye esikoleni.
That seems right.	Lokho kubonakala kulungile.
It happened in the evening.	Kwenzeke kusihlwa.
I don't know what else.	Angazi ukuthi yini enye.
.	.
He wants to know why.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuthi kungani.
That can be difficult.	Lokho kungase kube nzima.
Or both.	Noma sobabili.
The sooner you do it, the better.	Lapho ukwenza ngokushesha, kungcono.
She likes to be alone.	Uthanda ukuhlala yedwa.
He said he did not know why.	Uthe akazi ukuthi kungani.
He is a human being.	Ungumuntu.
Now, today, we know that that's not true.	Manje, namuhla, siyazi ukuthi lokho akulona iqiniso.
Money, money, money!	Imali, imali, imali!
he said.	uthe.
It could be me.	Kungaba yimi.
Little by little.	Kancane kancane.
Hopefully it will be in the future.	Ngethemba ukuthi kuzoba ngaphambili.
Or maybe not.	Noma mhlawumbe cha.
That is not true.	Lokho akulona iqiniso.

But he could not.	Kodwa akakwazanga.
Everyone.	Wonke umuntu.
He does not want to talk.	Akafuni ukukhuluma.
Or, well.	Noma, kahle.
Fast, fast.	Ngokushesha, ngokushesha.
That's just true.	Lokho kuyiqiniso nje.
And you need to stop.	Futhi udinga ukuyeka.

It is also possible.	Kungenzeka futhi.
It will be here.	Kuzoba lapha.
It can be difficult.	Kungaba nzima.
And before.	Futhi ngaphambili.
He will never do this again.	Ngeke aphinde akwenze lokhu.

And he did that.	Futhi wakwenza lokho.
That's all.	Yilokho konke.
How did he do it?	Wakwenza kanjani?
That's not me.	Akumina lowo.
This actually happened a lot.	Lokhu empeleni kwenzeka kakhulu.
You can't come.	Awukwazi ukuza.
I really do not believe it will happen.	Angikholwa ngempela ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
And still nothing.	Futhi namanje lutho.
Not at all to me.	Akukhona neze kimi.
And, that's perfectly fine.	Futhi, lokho kulungile ngokuphelele.

I do not know why this happened.	Angazi ukuthi kungani lokhu kwenzeka.
But nothing.	Kodwa lutho.

I wish I could not.	Ngifisa sengathi ngeke.
As it is true.	Njengoba kuyiqiniso.
But he can't.	Kodwa angeke.

And what else.	Futhi yini enye.
Then to me.	Khona kimi.
Lots of money.	Imali eningi.
He's just trying to help.	Uzama nje ukusiza.
He just wanted to eat.	Wayefuna ukudla nje.
Probably not.	Cishe ngeke.
I don't want that to be me.	Angifuni kube yimina lowo.

You should be able to see through it.	Kufanele ukwazi ukubona ngakho.
Let him do this.	Akwenze lokhu.

To be with him.	Ukuba naye.
I think this might be a problem.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kungase kube inkinga.
Now the problem.	Manje inkinga.

You have done this before.	Uke wakwenza lokhu ngaphambili.
How but ?.	Kanjani kodwa?.
That would be okay.	Lokho kungaba kulungile.
It has to be someone else.	Kufanele kube omunye umuntu.
I say no.	Ngisho cha.
You know it well.	Wazi kahle.
Just being there.	Ukuba khona nje.
It's not such a big deal.	Akuyona into enkulu kangaka.
That would be a mistake.	Lokho kungaba iphutha.
He can drive.	Uyakwazi ukushayela.
That's another one.	Lowo omunye.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Angazi kahle ukuthi ukwenza kanjani.
I'm not sure about you.	Angiqiniseki ngawe.
And he didn't know.	Futhi wayengazi.
So, there is no help there.	Ngakho, akukho usizo lapho.
And it doesn't deserve anyone.	Futhi akufanele muntu.
I know this to be true.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso.
You only need to do it once.	Udinga ukukwenza kanye kuphela.
I do not want that to happen to me.	Angifuni lokho kwenzeke kimi.
It will happen soon.	Kuzokwenzeka maduze.
And no one else.	Futhi akekho omunye.
That is not all.	Akukhona lokho kuphela.
That's one thing.	Enye into leyo.
This happened once.	Lokhu kwenzeka kanye.
This is very true.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso impela.
He did not, once.	Akazange, kanye.
Very good, actually.	Kuhle impela, empeleni.
I try hard.	Ngizama kanzima.
He knows all about it.	Wazi konke ngakho.
But that should not be the case.	Kodwa lokho akufanele kube njalo.
You can't say anything.	Awukwazi ukusho lutho.
If this.	Uma lokhu.
He said no, no he would not do that.	Wathi cha, cha angeke akwenze lokho.

And he should not go there.	Futhi akufanele aye lapho.
I need to work fast.	Ngidinga ukusebenza ngokushesha.
I have never had to.	Angikaze kudingeke.
We know about it now though.	Siyazi ngakho manje kodwa.
I need to tell my man.	Ngidinga ukutshela umuntu wami.
I need everyone to do their job.	Ngidinga wonke umuntu enze umsebenzi wakhe.
I never went there.	Angizange ngiye lapho.
I have never been like that.	Angikaze ngibe njalo.
All together.	Sonke ndawonye.
It doesn't have to be this way.	Akufanele kube njalo.
No his.	Cha wakhe.
I do this perfectly.	Ngenza lokhu ngokuphelele.
But I ask for help.	Kodwa ngicela usizo.
He did all these bad things.	Wenza kabi konke lokhu.
He thought that.	Wacabanga lokho.
I don't know why.	Angazi kungani ngempela.
You have to make money.	Kufanele wenze imali.
He's here tonight.	Ukhona namhlanje ebusuku.
Do something.	Enza into.
You think too much.	Ucabanga kakhulu.
He is a great man.	Uyindoda enkulu.
That's fine too.	Kulungile futhi.
What's going on? 	Kwenzakalani?

You do not think well.	Awucabangi kahle.
He does everything perfectly.	Wenza konke ngokuphelele.
Obviously.	Kusobala.
He is here now.	Ukhona manje.
He didn’t really make time.	Akazange ngempela enze isikhathi.
Maybe for you, he might.	Mhlawumbe ngawe, angase.
He wants to talk to you.	Ufuna ukukhuluma nawe.
Just like that again.	Kanjalo nje futhi.
I hope not to you.	Ngethemba ukuthi akunjalo kuwe.

And that was supposed to be that.	Futhi lokho bekufanele kube yilokho.
Now she is beautiful.	Manje muhle.

You will never be able to get a job again.	Ngeke ukwazi ukuthola umsebenzi futhi.
But this is very good.	Kodwa lokhu kuhle kakhulu.
I'm not sure how long this will be.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kuzoba isikhathi esingakanani lokhu.
He did very well.	Wenza kahle kakhulu.
I would like to help.	Ngingathanda ukusiza.
He did a good job with it.	Wenza umsebenzi omuhle ngakho.

You are only human.	Ungumuntu kuphela.
His mother knew.	Umama wakhe wayazi.

But it's better.	Kodwa kungcono.
Where do you live?	Uhlala kuphi?
I mean, you know.	Ngisho, uyazi.
But, it happened.	Kodwa, kwenzeka.

Great.	Enkulu.
Very good !.	Kuhle kakhulu!.
More waiting.	Ukulinda okuningi.
But he could not, yet.	Kodwa akakwazanga, okwamanje.

Very, very good.	Kakhulu, kuhle kakhulu.
I went to work.	Ngiye emsebenzini.
And you did not know.	Futhi ubungazi.

I want to go.	Ngifuna ukuhamba.
It could be anything	Kungaba yini
You know, a very good thing.	Uyazi, into enhle kakhulu.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I'm not that person.	Angiyena lowo muntu.
But that is not true.	Kodwa lokho akulona iqiniso.
Soon he could not.	Ngokushesha akakwazanga.
I think that's my opinion.	Ngicabanga ukuthi umbono wami.
I want to be here.	Ngifuna ukuba lapha.
Not at all.	Akunjalo.
That morning, he told me.	Ngalokho ekuseni, wangitshela.
I do not know how long.	Angazi kuze kube nini.
Or my job.	Noma umsebenzi wami.
This is good enough.	Lokhu kulungile ngokwanele.
And do it again.	Futhi ukwenze futhi.
This is probably the case with time.	Lokhu kungenzeka ukuthi wenza isikhathi.
Maybe he did.	Mhlawumbe wakwenza.
You have to do that.	Kufanele ukwenze lokho.
That should not be the case.	Akufanele kwenzeke kanjalo.
More and less.	Kakhulu futhi kancane.
He did, really.	Wakwenza, ngempela.
I know you exist.	Ngiyazi ukhona.
She is very beautiful.	Muhle kakhulu.
I could not speak.	Angikwazanga ukukhuluma.
You should be the only one there.	Kufanele kube wena kuphela lapho.
But, it would be a mistake.	Kodwa, kungaba iphutha.
Only one of you, you know.	Okunye kwakho kuphela, uyazi.

But here, there is none.	Kodwa lapha, akukho.

You got this.	Uthole lokhu.
Just a little.	Kancane nje.
This he would never do.	Lokhu wayengeke neze akwenze.

But it can actually be.	Kodwa empeleni kungaba.
I mean.	Ngisho.
Maybe, a little.	Mhlawumbe, kancane.
You need to talk to him.	Udinga ukukhuluma naye.
It should too.	Kufanele nathi.
I did not want to see anyone.	Ngangingafuni ukubona muntu.
I would like to know what happened.	Ngingathanda ukwazi ukuthi kwenzakalani.
That's my problem.	Inkinga yami leyo.
I would like to know why.	Ngingathanda ukwazi ukuthi kungani.

Tell me what's going on.	Ngitshele ukuthi kwenzakalani.
It could be something else.	Kungaba okunye.
I've been making a mistake.	Kade ngenza iphutha.
He said.	Uthe .
Fast enough.	Ngokushesha ngokwanele.
I do not like.	Angithandi.
There is not much more down here now.	Akukho okunye okuningi lapha phansi manje.
He can't walk well.	Akakwazi ukuhamba kahle.
In his house.	Endlini yakhe .
That will not happen here.	Lokho ngeke kwenzeke lapha.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Ngangingazi ukuthi kukhona into enjalo.
He will be doing many things today.	Uzobe enza izinto eziningi namuhla.
He thought he knew.	Wayecabanga ukuthi uyazi.
Your departure should have been fine.	Ukuhamba kwakho bekufanele kube kuhle.
Good.	Kuhle.
I hope that's okay.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokho kulungile.

I don't think so.	angicabangi kahle.
I want to know what happened there.	Ngifuna ukwazi ukuthi kwenzekani lapho.
You can do this.	Lokhu ungakwenza.
I don't know what happened.	Angazi ukuthi kwenzakalani.
Obviously he is not human.	Ngokusobala akayena umuntu.
One is obviously a really bad job.	Omunye ngokusobala umsebenzi omubi ngempela.
You would not know anyone here.	Ubungazi muntu lapha.
That is not true.	Lokho akulona iqiniso.
He does not want to talk.	Akafuni ukukhuluma.
No, he was not.	Cha, wayengekho.
It will be difficult.	Kuzoba nzima.
Once a week is good.	Kanye ngesonto kuhle.
He saw now that he did not know what to do with it.	Wabona manje ukuthi akazi enzeni ngakho.
You can't talk to him.	Awukwazi ukukhuluma naye.
It just won't happen.	Ngeke nje kwenzeke.
He started driving.	Waqala ukushayela.
This will not be difficult for me.	Lokhu ngeke kube nzima kimi.
He can't walk right now.	Akakwazi ukuhamba njengamanje.
Or children.	Noma izingane.
And he says.	Futhi uthi.
He must be with her.	Kumele abe naye.
I don't know why but.	Angazi ngani kodwa.
He does not know where you live.	Akazi lapho uhlala khona.
It doesn't have to be this way.	Akumele kube njalo.
I will not do that.	Ngeke ngikwenze lokho.
In this case, everything is fine.	Kulokhu, konke kulungile.
It will not happen.	Ngeke kwenzeke.
I could not eat anything.	Angikwazanga ukudla lutho.
I thought you knew that too.	Bengicabanga ukuthi nawe uyakwazi lokho.
I just won't do it again.	Ngeke nje ngiphinde.
But nothing to do.	Kodwa lutho ukwenza.
I'm just happy, happy, happy.	Ngijabule nje, ngijabule, ngijabule.
I don't know what happened to you.	Angazi ukuthi kwenzekeni kuwe.
Not so here.	Akunjalo lapha.
That is true, as it happens.	Lokho kuyiqiniso, njengoba kwenzeka.
I have never seen anyone.	Angikaze ngibone muntu.
I want to be me.	Ngifuna ukuba yimi.
he said.	uthe.
It will not happen.	Ngeke kwenzeke.
I like that in the morning.	Ngithanda lokho ekuseni.

By doing this.	Ngokwenza lokhu.
Why now ?.	Kungani manje?.
This is very good.	Lokhu kuhle kakhulu.
But it will happen.	Kodwa kuzokwenzeka.
Or my mother.	Noma umama wami.
He said he would like that better.	Wathi angathanda lokho kangcono.
So he finally left.	Ngakho ekugcineni wahamba.
All the time.	Sonke isikhathi.
I thought it might be so.	Ngacabanga ukuthi kungase kube njalo.
He says even with him.	Uthi ngisho naye.
I need to do this.	Ngidinga ukwenza lokhu.
But this time.	Kodwa kulokhu.
Once and maybe.	Kanye futhi mhlawumbe.
He wanted to know the time.	Wayefuna ukwazi isikhathi.
In the morning he said.	Ekuseni uthe.
You did anything.	Wenze noma yini.
I try to help.	Ngizama ukusiza.
I need to do something.	Ngidinga ukwenza okuthile.
You have been beautiful.	Ube muhle.
That seems obvious to me.	Lokho kubonakala kusobala kimi.
I'm not so sure about that.	Angiqiniseki kangako ngalokho.
We certainly did.	Impela senze njalo.
For you.	Kwakho.
But he could not.	Kodwa akakwazanga.
I just need someone here for me.	Ngidinga umuntu nje lapha kimi.
My whole life.	Impilo yami yonke.
I want to know.	Ngifuna ukwazi.
So it seems.	Ngakho kubonakala.
If you are sure.	Uma uqinisekile.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ngempela.
I thought.	Ngangicabanga.
But he knew he wouldn't.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi wayengeke.
Not so in this case.	Akunjalo kulokhu.
So, finally.	Ngakho, ekugcineni.
That much is true.	Lokho okuningi kuyiqiniso.
It may be later today.	Kungase kube kamuva namuhla.
He should have known better.	Bekufanele azi kangcono.
It could be something else.	Kungaba okunye.
Tell me why you want it.	Ngitshele ukuthi kungani ufuna.
Time.	Isikhathi.
It will not be me.	Ngeke kube yimina.
He will not.	Angeke.
But there is a place.	Kodwa kukhona indawo.
She is beautiful.	Muhle.
This is not a good thing, this should never happen.	Lokhu akuyona into enhle, akufanele neze kwenzeke lokhu.
All right.	Kulungile.
He saw.	Wabona.
He did many things for me.	Wenza izinto eziningi kimi.
It might, a little.	Kungase, kancane.
So now we know.	Ngakho manje siyazi.
That's the vision.	Lowo umbono.
And there it is.	Futhi kukhona.
Tell me about yourself.	Ungitshele ngawe.
Everything seems fine to me.	Konke kubonakala kulungile kimi.
Everything seems fine.	Konke kubonakala kulungile.
Really, really good.	Ngempela, kahle ngempela.
I am very happy.	Ngijabule kakhulu.
That's absolutely fine.	Lokho kuhle ngokuphelele.
That will not be necessary.	Lokho angeke kudingeke.
But to me it seems he is doing well so far.	Kodwa kimi kubonakala sengathi wenza kahle kuze kube manje.
My opinion is that it will be so.	Umbono wami ukuthi kuzoba njalo.
I do not know how that is possible.	Angazi ukuthi lokho kungenzeka kanjani.
I hope you will too.	Ngethemba ukuthi nawe uzokwenza.
He did not really know how long.	Wayengazi ngempela ukuthi kuze kube nini.
We know.	Siyazi.
I would like better.	Ngingathanda kangcono.
That should be it.	Kufanele kube yilokho.
But everyone wanted to make that a problem.	Kodwa wonke umuntu wayefuna ukwenza lokho kube inkinga.
Who.	Ubani.
Well done.	Wenze kahle.
If you are happy where you are, it is good for you.	Uma ujabule lapho ukhona, kuhle kuwe.
There is nothing there, either.	Akukho lutho lapho, futhi.
Why he did that.	Kungani enza kanjalo.
He never said that.	Akakaze akhulume kanjalo.
He wants to know how.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuthi kanjani.
And now is the time.	Futhi manje isikhathi.
And he didn't want to be.	Futhi wayengafuni ukuba.
he thought.	wacabanga.
The work began just once.	Umsebenzi waqala kanye nje.
You made a mistake.	Wenze iphutha.
he said.	uthe.
He walked slowly into the house.	Wahamba kancane endlini.
And nothing else.	Futhi akukho okunye.
Obviously, that should be the case.	Ngokusobala, kufanele kube njalo.
She is actually really beautiful.	Empeleni muhle ngempela.
It's up to you.	Kube ngawe.
So tell me the truth.	Ngakho ngitshele iqiniso.
Not so here.	Akunjalo lapha.
I’m not sure if it’s a very good idea or not.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi umqondo omuhle kakhulu noma cha.
Little by little.	Kancane kancane.
I would probably.	Ngingathanda mhlawumbe.
Just a little.	Kancane nje.
You just know.	Uyazi nje.

It shouldn't.	Akufanele.
It needs to be good enough.	Kudingeka kube kuhle ngokwanele.
Not a very good thing.	Akuyona into enhle kakhulu.
In fact, he did not.	Empeleni, akazange.
This he did, however.	Lokhu kodwa wakwenza.

Not so but.	Akunjalo kodwa.
I don't know how he did it.	Angazi ukuthi wenze kanjani.
But some are not.	Kodwa okunye akukho.
No, it's not there.	Cha, akukho lapho.
I think he is.	Ngicabanga ukuthi nguye.
Obviously, there is a big but.	Ngokusobala, kukhona omkhulu kodwa.
He speaks very quickly.	Ukhuluma ngokushesha kakhulu.
He knew it was going to happen.	Wayazi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
He started saying something.	Waqala ukusho okuthile.
I am very happy with him.	Ngijabule kakhulu naye.
He just wouldn't.	Wayengeke nje.
I don't want to do it here.	Angifuni ukukwenza lapha.

Faster, and more.	Ngokushesha, futhi okuningi.

He knows nothing about this.	Akwazi lutho ngalokhu.
But at night.	Kodwa ebusuku.
You may have been there for a long time.	Kungenzeka ube khona isikhathi eside.
It should.	Kufanele.
I'm afraid he might.	Ngesaba ukuthi angase.
He is not a man.	Akayena umuntu.
And it's just fine.	Futhi kuhle nje.
In this.	Kulokhu.
But he could not say that now.	Kodwa wayengeke akwazi ukusho lokho manje.

Not at all.	Akunjalo.
So it happened.	Ngakho kwenzeka lokho.
That would be really nice.	Lokho kungaba kuhle ngempela.
All your performance should be good.	Konke ukwenza kwakho kufanele kube kuhle.
That's all good.	Konke lokho kuhle.
Or maybe not.	Noma mhlawumbe akunjalo.
He did that.	Wakwenza lokho.
He did not know what to do again.	Wayengazi ukuthi enzeni futhi.
You do not think.	Awucabangi.
I think you did too.	Ngicabanga ukuthi nawe wenze kanjalo.
Or he did.	Noma wenza kanjalo.
So much more.	Okuningi okuningi.

And that should not be.	Futhi lokho akufanele.
That's the idea.	Yilokho umbono.
Exactly.	Kanye kanye.
I'm trying to read again.	Ngizama ukufunda futhi.
If you like.	Uma uthanda.
Alone.	Eyedwa.
He immediately asked for food.	Ngokushesha wacela ukudla.
But if he does.	Kodwa uma enza.
He asked me.	Wangibuza.
Always.	Njalo.
He never thought.	Wayengacabangi neze.

He does so now.	Wenza kanjalo manje.
Now? 	Manje?
I was wrong.	Ngenze iphutha.
He is a great man.	Ungumuntu omkhulu.
For the rest of your life.	Impilo yakho yonke.
That's probably okay for now.	Lokho cishe kulungile okwamanje.
You and I both know that this is not the case.	Mina nawe sobabili siyazi ukuthi akunjalo.
Or something like that.	Noma into enjalo.
But there is nothing he can do.	Kodwa akukho angakwenza.

He said he just wanted to talk.	Wathi ufuna ukukhuluma nje.
We did it on time.	Senze ngesikhathi.
But he did not want to.	Kodwa wayengafuni.
I hope he doesn't leave.	Ngethemba ukuthi ngeke ahambe.
He did very well.	Wenza kahle kakhulu.
I never was, not.	Angikaze ngibe, akunjalo.
No, it is not.	Cha, akunjalo.
Everyone knows that too.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi kakhulu.

I'd better go with you.	Kungcono ngihambe nawe.
I know how you feel now.	Ngiyazi ukuthi uzizwa kanjani manje.
There is really nothing more to this.	Akukho okunye ngempela kulokhu.
And there is another place.	Futhi kukhona enye indawo.
You need help right away.	Udinga usizo ngokushesha.
Or maybe he just couldn't.	Noma mhlawumbe akakwazanga.
Talking to you.	Ukukhuluma nawe.
But it should.	Kodwa kufanele.

It will not happen.	Ngeke kwenzeke.

He speaks to himself.	Ukhuluma yedwa.
It could all be a mistake.	Konke kungenzeka kube iphutha.
But you know who's doing it.	Kodwa uyazi ukuthi ubani owenza lokho.
If you think.	Uma ucabanga .
No one does that.	Akekho owenza lokho.
I've been here too long.	Ngibe lapha isikhathi eside kakhulu.
I'm not sure why this is.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kungani lokhu.
Not really a problem.	Akuyona inkinga ngempela.
It's not such a big deal.	Akuyona into enkulu kangaka.
I hope it will happen.	Ngethemba ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
Or something like that.	Noma into enjalo.

By doing this.	Ngokwenza lokhu.
Everyone knows that will never happen.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi lokho ngeke kwenzeke.
And this is not a good thing.	Futhi lokhu akuyona into enhle.
It will be so.	Kuzoba njalo.
You still say no.	Namanje uthi cha.
I did it a little bit.	Ngikwenze kancane.
You obviously did not know what he was doing there.	Ngokusobala ubungazi ukuthi wenzani lapho.
Maybe you should.	Mhlawumbe kufanele.
The problem with all of this is time.	Inkinga ngakho konke lokhu isikhathi.
It should be here.	Kufanele kube lapha.
You have to do it once and for all.	Kufanele ukwenze kanye futhi.

I just didn't.	Angizange nje.
But he did not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwenze lokho.
He should know better.	Kufanele azi kangcono.
I have absolutely no idea how it happened.	Angazi nhlobo ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani.
That's much better.	Lokho kungcono kakhulu.
He did not now.	Akazange manje.
I think about that a lot.	Ngicabanga ngalokho kakhulu.
Little by little.	Kancane kancane.

This is not the case.	Lokhu akunjalo.
Maybe it could be.	Mhlawumbe kungaba.
In the afternoon, he began to see things clearly.	Ntambama, waqala ukubona izinto.

He did it alone.	Wakwenza yedwa.
I think that's it.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yilokho.
I hope that is true.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokho kuyiqiniso.
He did a great job.	Wenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
My question now.	Umbuzo wami manje.
And, sooner or later, you will make a mistake.	Futhi, ngokushesha noma kamuva, uzokwenza iphutha.
And if something happens, that's fine.	Futhi uma kungenzeka okuthile, kulungile.
And he knows everything.	Futhi wazi konke.

Or, in this case, you to me.	Noma, kulokhu, wena kimi.
I really don't want it to happen to you.	Impela angifuni ukuthi kwenzeke kuwe.

But he was not at home for long.	Kodwa wayengekho isikhathi eside ekhaya.
That he can do.	Lokho angakwenza.

Nothing else.	Akukho okunye.
Really.	Ngempela.
Probably not until later.	Mhlawumbe ngeke kuze kube kamuva.

There is nothing there.	Akukho lutho lapho.
I should have made this happen.	Bekufanele ngenze lokhu kwenzeke.
But that is what happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka kanjalo.
In the meantime, and if we should.	Okwamanje, futhi uma kufanele senze.

You need to talk to me.	Udinga ukukhuluma nami.
I know you exist.	Ngiyazi ukuthi ukhona.
But only for now.	Kodwa kuphela okwamanje.
He wanted to be with us.	Wayefuna ukuba nathi.
This is obviously not true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso ngokusobala.
Maybe he will.	Mhlawumbe uzoba.
I can't make sense of it.	Angikwazi ukwenza umqondo ngakho.
He will never speak to you again.	Ngeke aphinde akhulume nawe.
It's not fair.	Akulona iqiniso.
And now there is no food in the house.	Futhi manje ukudla akukho endlini.

So do you.	Ngakho wena.
I can't do it without you	Angeke ngikwazi ukukwenza ngaphandle kwakho
That's great.	Kuhle kakhulu lokho.
I cannot do all this on my own	Angikwazi ukwenza konke lokhu ngedwa
Or to me.	Noma kimi.
I will probably not be able to stay long	Cishe ngeke ngikwazi ukuhlala isikhathi eside
But that is possible.	Kodwa lokho kungenzeka.
It can always happen when it happens.	Kungenzeka njalo uma kwenzeka.
To do all the work.	Ukwenza wonke umsebenzi.

It's just fine.	Kuhle nje.
He lives alone.	Uhlala yedwa.
It really has to be.	Kumelwe kube njalo ngempela .
Hopefully that is not true	Ngethemba ukuthi akulona iqiniso
I should probably go to school	Kufanele mhlawumbe ngiye esikoleni

He knew he looked good.	Wayazi ukuthi wayebukeka kahle.
And, no it is not.	Futhi, cha akunjalo.

This is going to be difficult.	Lokhu kuzoba nzima.
Well, maybe not.	Kulungile, mhlawumbe akunjalo.

How wonderful that would be.	Kungaba kuhle kanjani lokho.

Or maybe always.	Noma mhlawumbe njalo.
It will be so.	Uzoba njalo.
But you can't say.	Kodwa awukwazi ukusho.
He will not go away.	Angeke ahambe.
He must know that.	Kuzomele akwazi lokho.

He speaks ill.	Ukhuluma kabi.
But in reality it is not.	Kodwa empeleni akunjalo.
But my job is to say something, anything.	Kodwa umsebenzi wami ukusho okuthile, noma yini.
Everything is very true.	Konke kuyiqiniso kakhulu.
And he apparently did not.	Futhi kubonakala sengathi akazange.
But it is me.	Kodwa yimina.
He thought a lot.	Wayecabanga kakhulu.
Mom knows.	Umama uyazi.
For help.	Ukuze uthole usizo.
More about it later.	Okuningi ngakho kamuva.
It could be that person.	Kungenzeka ukuthi lowo muntu.
I can't talk to her.	Angikwazi ukukhuluma naye.
He could not walk.	Akakwazanga ukuhamba.
You will know everything.	Uzokwazi konke.

In the morning, he was thinking.	Ekuseni, wayecabanga.
Bad idea.	Umbono omubi.
So far all the work.	Kuze kube manje wonke umsebenzi.
How do you feel about that ?.	Uzizwa kanjani ngalokho?.

So here ?.	Ngakho lapha?.
Very much and obviously.	Kakhulu futhi ngokusobala.

And he will.	Futhi uzokwenza.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni ukukhuluma.

I don't want to talk about it.	Angifuni ukukhuluma ngakho.
Maybe he doesn't think so.	Mhlawumbe akacabangi kanjalo.
So that's all this.	Ngakho yilokho konke lokhu.
I never went to school.	Angizange ngiye esikoleni.
I hope you do not need to do that again.	Ngethemba ukuthi awudingi ukwenza lokho futhi.
Nothing, nothing.	Lutho, lutho.
Take him to prison.	Ahambe naye ejele.
You will get there.	Uzofika lapho.

Neither should we.	Nathi akufanele.
He likes to play.	Uthanda ukudlala.

It all happened so fast.	Konke kwenzeka ngokushesha.
But that is not really the case.	Kodwa lokho akunjalo ngempela.
This seems right.	Lokhu kubonakala kulungile.

Probably a bit.	Kungenzeka kancane.
And this is obvious.	Futhi kusobala lokhu.
And that would be great.	Futhi lokho kungaba kuhle.
No one else.	Akekho omunye.
Just like that, he asked for more money.	Kanjalo nje, wacela enye imali.
One did the other.	Omunye wenza omunye.
I think about this all the time.	Ngicabanga ngalokhu njalo.
That happened so quickly.	Kwenzeka ngokushesha lokho.
I can not.	Angikwazi.
Just tonight.	Ebusuku nje.
I'm trying to find out who she really is.	Ngizama ukuthola ukuthi ubani ngempela.
Probably, he will never.	Mhlawumbe, akasoze.
But there is the problem.	Kodwa lapho inkinga.
A lot is really true.	Okuningi kuyiqiniso impela.
I will not go slow.	Ngeke ngihambe kancane kancane.
That's all, really.	Yilokho kuphela, ngempela.
I can't do that.	Angikwazi ukwenza kanjalo.
But that would be a mistake.	Kodwa lokho kungaba iphutha.
You can or may not do it.	Ungakwenza noma awukwazi.
You know a little bit.	Uyazi kancane.
He did not stop speaking.	Akazange ayeke ukukhuluma.
Here I am again.	Yimi lowo futhi.
Even worse.	Ngisho kabi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ngempela.
But I'm not sure how I did it.	Kodwa angiqiniseki ukuthi ngikwenze kanjani.
But in reality, that is not true.	Kodwa empeleni, lokho akulona iqiniso.
He and I.	Naye kanye nami.
He must be with me.	Kumele abe nami.
But he knew, he knew.	Kodwa wayazi, wayazi.
And it may be.	Futhi kungase kube.
All right though.	Kulungile kodwa.

And that is good too.	Futhi lokho kuhle futhi.
That's where he wants to be.	Khona lapho efuna khona.

We have to do this.	Kufanele sikwenze lokhu.
But that is not true.	Kodwa lokho akulona iqiniso.
You will not tell me.	Ngeke ungitshele.

It can be anyone.	Kungaba noma ubani.
He thought he would do it.	Wayecabanga ukuthi uzokwenza.
Obviously no one is so good.	Ngokusobala akekho umuntu omuhle kakhulu.
You will never know!.	Ngeke wazi!.
I can not.	Angikwazi.
I could not do that now.	Angikwazanga ukwenza lokho manje.

We have to do it now.	Kufanele sikwenze manje.
No one else.	Akekho omunye.

But I could not.	Kodwa angikwazanga.
He did not think he wanted to go home.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi ufuna ukuya ekhaya.
Money, almost.	Imali, cishe.
.	.
Money is not all.	Imali akuyona yonke.
That's really a big problem.	Yilokho ngempela inkinga enkulu.
He did very well.	Wenza kahle kakhulu.
Now he just does.	Manje wenza nje.
He always has.	Uhlale njalo.
But he is very happy alone.	Kodwa ujabule kakhulu yedwa.
There is nothing there, either.	Akukho lutho lapho, futhi.
I've been thinking.	Kade ngicabanga.
Too long.	Isikhathi eside kakhulu.
I want to be alone.	Ngifuna ukuba ngedwa.
In fact he is.	Empeleni nguye.
And he did not.	Futhi akazange.
But no one does such a thing.	Kodwa akekho owenza into enjalo.

You should know.	Kufanele wazi.
It can be a problem.	Kungaba inkinga.
That's you and me.	Mina nawe lowo.

I am happy to do the job.	Ngijabule ukwenza umsebenzi.
Or, you do not need to.	Noma, awudingi.
So far so good.	Kuze kube manje kuhle kakhulu.
Not at all.	Akunjalo neze.
And to go with it.	Futhi ukuya ngakho.
You will never know exactly when.	Ngeke wazi kahle ukuthi nini.
You just have to stay there.	Kufanele nje uhlale lapho.
She is just beautiful.	Muhle nje.
But in this case, that would be impossible.	Kodwa kulokhu kuzoba nzima lokho.
He would never do such a thing.	Akasoze enze into enjalo.
I think a lot.	Ngicabanga kakhulu.

And here.	Futhi lapha.
He will not give up.	Ngeke ayeke.
She is happy.	Ujabule.
But that is not the case today.	Kodwa akunjalo namuhla.
It may be a lie.	Kungase kube amanga.
And there is a problem.	Futhi kukhona inkinga.
Now that.	Manje lokho.
He never spoke to me.	Akakaze akhulume nami.
I hope it doesn't happen.	Ngethemba ukuthi ngeke kwenzeke.
I think that would be a good idea.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungaba umqondo omuhle.

It looks like that to me.	Kubukeka kanjalo kimi.
I do not know why.	Angazi nini.

Or you probably did.	Noma cishe wenza.

Tomorrow morning.	Kusasa kusasa.
Even if you are.	Noma ngabe wena .
He seems to be able to speak.	Kubonakala sengathi uyakwazi ukukhuluma.

Not at all.	Akunjalo neze.
And it is very true too.	Futhi kuyiqiniso kakhulu futhi.
Or you are very happy.	Noma ujabule kakhulu.

There’s not much there, of course.	Akukho okuningi lapho, kusobala.
This is going to be very difficult.	Lokhu kuzoba nzima kakhulu.
That will not be the case.	Ngeke kube yilokho.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbe okuningi kakhulu.
But he cannot do it alone.	Kodwa akakwazi ukukwenza yedwa.
My father could do nothing.	Ubaba akakwazanga ukwenza lutho.

No, that is not true.	Cha, lokho akulona iqiniso.
And you did it alone.	Futhi ukwenze wedwa.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ngempela.
You are my man.	Ungumuntu wami.
He seems to be doing much better.	Ubonakala enza kangcono kakhulu.

Tomorrow very early.	Kusasa ekuseni kakhulu.
This morning it happened again.	Namuhla ekuseni kwenzeke futhi.
The big problem.	Inkinga enkulu.

You probably already know that.	Cishe uyakwazi lokho kakade.
He did that.	Wakwenza lokho.

That would be great.	Lokho kuzoba kuhle impela.
Please make a mistake.	Ngicela ngenze iphutha.
No, you know that.	Cha, uyakwazi lokho.

Almost all of that.	Cishe konke lokho.
Once a week for a while.	Kanye ngesonto isikhashana.

This should not happen.	Lokhu akufanele kwenzeke.
But as you like.	Kodwa njengoba uthanda.
Tom is not at all.	UTom akayena neze.

I know you do not really want to do that.	Ngiyazi ukuthi awufuni ngempela ukwenza lokho.
He said he had to leave.	Wathi kumele ahambe.
Or just knowing.	Noma ukwazi nje.
He just wants to.	Uyafuna nje.
How do you feel about it ?.	Uzizwa kanjani ngakho?.
But it is true.	Kodwa kuyiqiniso.
I did not want anyone to know.	Ngangingafuni muntu azi.
It should not have happened here.	Akufanele ngabe kwenzeka lapha.
But he did.	Kodwa wenza kanjalo.
It will not happen.	Ngeke kwenzeke.
He only loves my mother.	Uthanda umama wami kuphela.
I would really like to stay here.	Ngingathanda ngempela ukuhlala lapha.
Certainly, actually.	Impela, empeleni.
In fact, it should not be so.	Empeleni, akumele kube njalo.
Coming here.	Ukuza lapha.

It's good to eat that '.	Kuhle ukudla lokho'.
Everyone knew about it.	Wonke umuntu wayazi ngakho.
I do not like.	Angithandi.
For a very long time.	Isikhathi eside impela.
And he never did.	Futhi akakaze.
But that is a problem.	Kodwa inkinga leyo.
He did something.	Wenza okuthile.
But he has never been with us.	Kodwa akakaze ahlale nathi.
But this should not be the case.	Kodwa lokhu akufanele kube.
I thought at home.	Ngacabanga ekhaya.

And, you should.	Futhi, kufanele.
If you wish.	Uma ufisa.
So tell me.	Ngakho ungitshele .

Or this.	Noma lokhu.
You always think you are doing the right thing.	Uhlale ucabanga ukuthi wenza okufanele.
There is something here.	Kukhona into lapha.

And you want to do just that.	Futhi ufuna ukwenza lokho kanye.
We just know.	Siyazi nje.

Lots of stuff.	Izinto eziningi.
What are you doing there.	Wenzani lapho .
It is true and it is not true.	Kuyiqiniso futhi akulona iqiniso.

He lives in my house, and that's my car.	Uhlala endlini yami, futhi imoto yami leyo.
It is also necessary.	Kudingeka futhi.

He asked me nicely.	Wangibuza kahle.
You want to do very well.	Ufuna ukwenza kahle kakhulu.

That's all.	Yilokho nje.
I will not be !.	Ngeke ngibe!.
He said this was possible.	Wathi lokhu kungenzeka.
I can't figure out how to do this.	Angikwazi ukuthola ukuthi ngingakwenza kanjani lokhu.
All right, maybe.	Kulungile, mhlawumbe.
He left.	Wahamba.
But he could not find out how.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuthola ukuthi kanjani.

.	.
He just did it.	Ukwenze nje.
But there is more.	Kodwa futhi okunye.

The doctor is there.	Udokotela ukhona.
You talk to him.	Ukhuluma naye.
It's not fair.	Akulona iqiniso.

You need to stay in this for a long time.	Udinga ukuhlala kulokhu isikhathi eside.
He may know something, that's all.	Angase azi okuthile, yilokho kuphela.

You need to talk to him.	Udinga ukukhuluma naye.
I don't think you should be.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele ube.

There is almost no more.	Cishe akukho okuningi.
We both know that this is not true.	Sobabili siyazi ukuthi lokhu akulona iqiniso.
Really, he knew nothing.	Kanjani ngempela, wayengazi lutho.
I like working alone.	Ngithanda ukusebenza ngedwa.

And make money.	Futhi wenze imali.

How long does he not work?	Kuze kube nini akazi.
I will do well.	Ngizokwenza kahle.
I think you know that too.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uyakwazi lokho nathi.

Well, that's his opinion.	Kulungile, lowo umbono wakhe.
She is so beautiful to me.	Muhle kimi kanjalo.

That's about it.	Yilokho ngakho.
He does not know how.	Akazi kanjani.

And he didn't want to.	Futhi wayengafuni.

Or he tried.	Noma wazama .

No one does much.	Akekho owenza okuningi.
This is probably true.	Lokhu cishe kuyiqiniso.

I need to be there.	Ngidinga ukuba lapho.
But that is not true.	Kodwa akulona iqiniso.

Not a place.	Akuyona indawo.
Really good job.	Umsebenzi omuhle ngempela.

No matter what happens to me.	Noma ngabe kwenzekani kimi.
He had better be alone.	Kungcono abe yedwa.
Maybe he just wanted to be alone.	Mhlawumbe wayefuna nje ukuba yedwa.
You better go home.	Kungcono uye ekhaya.
Coming soon.	Uzofika maduze.
And you did a very good job.	Futhi wenze umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.

I don't think anything about it.	Angicabangi lutho ngakho.
You did very well.	Wenze kahle kakhulu.
He knew he had to do something quickly.	Wayazi ukuthi kufanele enze okuthile ngokushesha.
That would be really nice.	Lokho kungaba kuhle ngempela.
He did not really know why.	Wayengazi ngempela ukuthi kungani.
For you.	Ukuze wena.
You have to be there too.	Kufanele ube lapho nawe.

False.	Amanga.
In fact, there is.	Empeleni, kukhona.

Very little.	Kancane kakhulu.
You do what you have to do.	Wenza okufanele ukwenze.
That can be very helpful.	Lokho kungaba usizo kakhulu.
You've done it before.	Uke wakwenza ngaphambili.
You did your job.	Wenze umsebenzi wakho.
At the hospital.	Esibhedlela.

Not at all.	Akunjalo.
That all is possible.	Lokho konke kungenzeka.
No, not at all.	Cha, neze.
Obviously he would not be helpful.	Ngokusobala wayengeke abe usizo.
So he finally left.	Ngakho ekugcineni wahamba.
Soon or something like that.	Ngokushesha noma into enjalo.
But only you.	Kodwa wena kuphela.
This should not have happened.	Lokhu bekungafanele kwenzeke.

He readily agreed.	Wavuma ngokushesha.
I don't want to know anything about it.	Angifuni ukwazi lutho ngakho.
Anyone can do this.	Noma ubani angakwenza lokhu.
This could be something else.	Lokhu kungaba okunye.
To expect and do.	Ukuze ulindele futhi wenze.
True.	Iqiniso .
You just need to go.	Udinga ukuhamba nje.
he thought.	wacabanga.

You can only do that for a long time.	Ungakwenza lokho kuphela isikhathi eside.
Surely everyone will do things about that.	Impela wonke umuntu uzokwenza izinto ngalokho.
He immediately left.	Ngokushesha wahamba.
And you did well.	Futhi wenze kahle.
He left.	Wahamba.
He could not go home.	Akakwazanga ukuya ekhaya.
That is not true.	Lokho akulona iqiniso.

But, it can also be difficult.	Kodwa, kungase futhi kube nzima.
Probably possible.	Mhlawumbe kungenzeka.
Slow movement.	Ukuhamba kancane kancane.

He did not want to do this.	Wayengafuni ukwenza lokhu.
And you can see when someone does that.	Futhi uyakwazi ukubona lapho umuntu enza lokho.
Hopefully, it will not be necessary.	Ngethemba, ngeke kudingeke.
Nothing now.	Akukho lutho manje.
He knew better.	Wayazi kangcono.
He thought so.	Wacabanga kanjalo.
I am happy to help.	Ngiyajabula ukusiza.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbe ngeke kube khona.
I am very happy.	Ngijabule kakhulu.
The mother does not know.	Umama akazi.

Probably a lot of things.	Mhlawumbe izinto eziningi.
I could not.	Angikwazanga.
I can't afford that at all.	Angikwazi nhlobo ukuthenga lokho.
There is no one here.	Akukho muntu lapha.
It just so happened.	Kwenzeka kanjalo nje.
Good job, everyone !.	Umsebenzi omuhle, wonke umuntu!.
We should too.	Nathi kufanele futhi.

But how is this possible.	Kodwa kungenzeka kanjani lokhu.
I can't go to work.	Angikwazi ukuya emsebenzini.

All there, he saw.	Konke lapho, wabona.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akufanele kube njalo.

He tried very hard.	Wazama kakhulu.
If this is possible.	Uma lokhu kungenzeka.
Or almost like that.	Noma cishe kanjalo.

My biggest job.	Umsebenzi wami omkhulu.
She is very happy about it.	Ujabule kakhulu ngakho.

He did nothing.	Akazange enze lutho.
I wish it were tomorrow.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe kusasa.
And very quickly.	Futhi ngokushesha kakhulu.
You should know about that.	Kufanele wazi ngalokho.
That, right there.	Lowo, khona lapho.
But why? 	Kodwa kungani?
He spoke softly.	Akhulume kancane.
He thought nothing of it.	Wayengacabangi lutho.
Only me, alone.	Mina kuphela, ngedwa.
Now you will know.	Manje uzokwazi.
But that's not me.	Kodwa akumina lowo.
I can't talk to her.	Angikwazi ukukhuluma naye.
He would like to talk.	Angathanda ukukhuluma.

He certainly did.	Impela wakwenza.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi lutho.
But that will not happen right now.	Kodwa lokho ngeke kwenzeke njengamanje.

Sure, you know that.	Impela, uyakwazi lokho.
He didn't know better.	Wayengazi kangcono.
I think so.	Ngicabanga kanjalo.
This is not true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso.
But that's perfectly fine.	Kodwa lokho kulungile ngokuphelele.
That's it, and that's all.	Yilokho, futhi yilokho kuphela.
He has been there a long time.	Ukhona isikhathi eside.
We know.	Siyazi .
.	.
It should not happen.	Akufanele kwenzeke.
But he did not want to do that with her.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukwenza lokho naye.
I'm not sure about this.	Angiqiniseki ngalokhu.
That for now.	Lokho okwamanje.
He knows exactly what to do.	Uyazi kahle okumele akwenze.
There is something else I have to do.	Kukhona okunye okumele ngikwenze.
He should be able to read.	Kufanele akwazi ukufunda.
To find out what really happened.	Ukuze uthole ukuthi kwenzekeni ngempela.
That's not it.	Akukhona lokho.
I am very happy about that.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngalokho.
Nothing so far.	Akukho lutho kuze kube manje.
But that is not here yet.	Kodwa lokho akukho lapha okwamanje.
And he did this very well.	Futhi lokhu wakwenza kahle kakhulu.
I want to be.	Ngifuna ukuba.
I love everyone.	Ngithanda wonke umuntu.
And you can do it.	Futhi ungakwenza.
He just said he wouldn't do it.	Wathi nje angeke akwenze.
I wish your mother was there.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe umama wakho ukhona.
It's just better for me.	Kungcono nje kimi.
Or he didn't want to.	Noma wayengafuni.
Not at all here.	Akunjalo neze lapha.
He really thought that.	Ngempela wacabanga lowo.
Eventually a person may be alone.	Ekugcineni umuntu angase abe yedwa yedwa.
You can walk down the aisle.	Ungakwazi ukuhamba phansi.
He could not find out why.	Akakwazanga ukuthola ukuthi kungani.
I think that's good.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuhle lokho.
He wanted to call the police.	Wayefuna ukushayela amaphoyisa ucingo.
Pretend he has never been.	Enza sengathi akakaze abe khona.
But on time.	Kodwa ngesikhathi.
I have never done it before.	Angikaze ngikwenze ngaphambili.
I finally know why.	Ekugcineni ngiyazi ukuthi kungani.
I can't figure out why.	Angikwazi ukuthola ukuthi kungani.
He should not talk to me.	Akufanele akhulume nami.
To do that, you have to be beautiful.	Ukuze wenze lokho, kuzomele ube muhle.
Everyone is trying to make money.	Wonke umuntu uzama ukwenza imali.
But here.	Kodwa lapha.
What's going on here? 	Kwenzakalani lapha?
He did not know that he was there.	Wayengazi ukuthi ukhona.
He looked like he too needed help.	Wayebukeka sengathi naye udinga usizo.
I think that's it.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yilokho.
I wish it were possible.	Ngifisa sengathi kungenzeka.
But in this case, you don't need to.	Kodwa kulokhu, awudingi.
It should not have been so.	Bekungafanele kube njalo.
Last night .	Izolo ebusuku .
More on that later, perhaps.	Okuningi ngalokho kamuva, mhlawumbe.
I really have to go.	Kufanele ngihambe ngempela.
It's just fine.	Kuhle nje.
You can too.	Ungakwazi futhi.
He said a little.	Wathi kancane.
He agreed.	Wavuma.
I have never seen such a beautiful person before.	Angikaze ngibone umuntu omuhle kangaka ngaphambili.
He could not pretend that he was not.	Akakwazanga ukwenza sengathi akunjalo.
And you should know.	Futhi kufanele ukwazi.
You know who you're playing with here.	Uyazi ukuthi udlala nobani lapha.
But he has not told the truth yet.	Kodwa akazange akhulume iqiniso okwamanje.
I doubt it though.	Ngiyangabaza kodwa.
I want more.	Ngifuna okunye.
Good enough for now.	Kuhle ngokwanele okwamanje.
He wanted a dog.	Wayefuna inja.
I will not do that.	Ngeke ngikwenze lokho.
I would just like to.	Ngingathanda kuphela.
It can be too long.	Kungaba isikhathi eside kakhulu.
But he did not want to do it.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukukwenza.
As fast as you like.	Ngokushesha njengoba uthanda.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi yini inkinga.
He never spoke to me.	Akazange akhulume nami.
But he did not do it.	Kodwa akazange akwenze.
You did very well.	Wenze kahle kakhulu.
We know how that happened.	Siyazi ukuthi lokho kwenzeka kanjani.
Absolutely worth it !!!.	Kufanele ngokuphelele !!!.
But also.	Kodwa futhi.
Almost too.	Cishe kakhulu.
And to me.	Futhi ukuba mina.
Me and you, too.	Mina nawe, futhi.
I want him to leave.	Ngifuna ahambe.
That's just my opinion.	Lowo umbono wami nje.
I knew it would be so.	Ngangazi ukuthi kuzoba njalo.
I do not know anyone else.	Angazi omunye.
I am convinced that this is true.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi kulokhu kuyiqiniso.
I am very happy about it.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngakho.
That's another one.	Lowo omunye.
I do everything with him.	Ngenza konke naye.
But he could not.	Kodwa akakwazanga.
He says things.	Uthi izinto.
And it seems to be true.	Futhi kubonakala kuyiqiniso.
And it is very true.	Futhi kuyiqiniso kakhulu.
I would love to do something about that.	Ngingathanda ukwenza okuthile ngalokho.
I have to go too.	Nami kufanele ngihambe.
And a good thing, too.	Futhi into enhle, futhi.
Everyone is happy.	Wonke umuntu ujabule.

We need to do well.	Kudingeka senze kahle.
He was not well.	Wayengekho kahle.
How are u doing? 	Uzokwenza kanjani?
.	.
But you got more.	Kodwa uthole okunye.
Just for the sake of someone.	Ukuze nje kube khona umuntu.
Maybe you too.	Mhlawumbe nawe.
This is not true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso.
I am happy to help.	Ngiyajabula ukusiza.
I want to be here again now.	Ngifuna ukuba lapha futhi manje.
Also, he wanted to be there.	Futhi, wayefuna ukuba lapho.
He thought so.	Wacabanga kanjalo.
It is very obvious.	Kusobala kakhulu.
I will not do anything.	Ngeke ngenze lutho.
That is really true.	Lokho kuyiqiniso ngempela.
I need help with this.	Ngidinga usizo ngalokhu.
That seems right to me.	Lokho kubonakala kulungile kimi.
I did not see anyone.	Angizange ngibone muntu.
And a very nice car.	Futhi imoto enhle kakhulu.
He knew nothing about it.	Wayengazi lutho ngalokhu.
By that we all know.	Ngalokho sonke siyazi.
Great.	Enkulu.
To know where you are.	Ukuze wazi lapho ukhona.
Much is true.	Okuningi kuyiqiniso.
For now.	Okwamanje.
You want to be here again now.	Ufuna ukuba lapha futhi manje.
Alone with him.	Eyedwa naye.
I am not my father.	Angiyena ubaba wami.
He didn't know what else.	Wayengazi ukuthi yini enye.
Great, too.	Enkulu, futhi.
I think there is an idea.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kukhona umbono.
But he did.	Kodwa lowo wakwenza.
We know what to do.	Siyazi okufanele sikwenze.

I was thinking about it.	Bengicabanga ngakho.
He’s a good player.	Ungumdlali omuhle.
I would like to know about it.	Ngifisa ukwazi ngakho.

Obviously, you do not.	Ngokusobala, nawe awukwazi.
It is certainly possible.	Impela kungenzeka.
I really hope you will do this again.	Ngethemba ngempela ukuthi uzokwenza lokhu futhi.
I'm not sure where.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kuphi.
There will be no one else.	Ngeke kube khona omunye.
I have never been alone.	Angikaze ngedwa.
That will be very helpful.	Kuzoba usizo kakhulu lokho.
This is really good.	Lokhu kuhle kakhulu ngempela.
And he never left.	Futhi akazange aphinde ahambe.
He thought so.	Naye wacabanga kanjalo.
He can't wait until tomorrow.	Akakwazi ukulinda kuze kube kusasa.
Now, we know that this is not true.	Manje, siyazi ukuthi lokhu akulona iqiniso.
There is a problem enough.	Kukhona inkinga ngokwanele.
But maybe I mean.	Kodwa mhlawumbe ngisho .
I'm so sorry for that.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu ngalokho.
Everyone would have done that.	Wonke umuntu ngabe wenze njalo.
I'm sure of it.	Ngiqinisekile ngakho.
I do so.	Ngenza njalo.
But perhaps that is the problem.	Kodwa mhlawumbe inkinga leyo.
He too knew nothing.	Naye wayengazi lutho.
I do not know how or why.	Angazi kanjani noma ngani.
He knew he was coming to the end.	Wayazi ukuthi uzofika ekugcineni.
So much for anything else.	Kakhulu noma yini enye.
Right now, today.	Njengamanje, namuhla.
Travel.	Ukuhamba.
I will not be there.	Angeke ngibe lapho.
I know he did not.	Ngiyazi akazange.
Finally he said.	Ekugcineni wathi.
We all know about it.	Sonke siyazi ngakho.
I don't know how I can do this without you.	Angazi ukuthi ngingakwenza kanjani lokhu ngaphandle kwakho.
He should have known.	Bekufanele azi.
And things happen.	Futhi kwenzeka izinto.
But it is not a very good thing.	Kodwa akuyona into enhle kakhulu.
You just need time.	Udinga isikhathi nje.
You have to do that.	Kufanele ukwenze lokho.
I wonder about everything.	Ngiyazibuza ngakho konke.
You want to be someone else.	Ufuna ukuba omunye umuntu.
Everyone knows what's going on in your house.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi kwenzekani endlini yakho.
I want this more.	Ngifuna lokhu okuningi.
If you need to do that.	Uma udinga ukwenza lokho.
He did not want anyone to go with him.	Wayengafuni muntu ahambe naye.
He told me about you.	Wangitshela ngawe.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa lokhu akunjalo.
Or about you.	Noma ngawe.
He just did.	Wenza nje.
He did not go.	Akazange aye.
And he began to speak.	Futhi waqala ukukhuluma.
It only happens once.	Kwenzeka kanye kuphela.
But that is not true.	Kodwa akulona iqiniso.
Even bigger.	Ngisho enkulu.
Or it could be.	Noma kungenzeka.
He couldn't be.	Wayengeke abe.
He looks very good.	Ubukeka kahle kakhulu.
But that is not the case at all.	Kodwa akunjalo ngokuphelele.
Not a very big thing.	Akuyona into enkulu kakhulu.
He should not do this.	Akufanele akwenze lokhu.
And so far it is very good.	Futhi kuze kube manje kuhle kakhulu.
And you know.	Futhi uyazi.
What, he didn't know very well.	Ukuthi yini, wayengazi kahle.
Or he tried to do so.	Noma wazama ukwenza kanjalo.
The only problem is that my father is here.	Inkinga nje ukuthi ubaba lapha .
You know how to do it.	Uyazi ukuthi ukwenza kanjani.
If you like, it's good for you.	Uma uthanda, kuhle kuwe.
I want a place.	Ngifuna indawo.
That is entirely possible.	Lokho kungenzeka ngokuphelele.
This is not true, either.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso, futhi.
I'm not sure.	Angiqiniseki mina.
I never did.	Angikaze .
I do not want to go there.	Angifuni ukuya lapho.
I have to be.	Kufanele ngibe.
Not true at all.	Akulona iqiniso nhlobo.
Or it could be me.	Noma kungaba kimi.
And he is not the only one.	Futhi akuyena kuphela.
I need to buy a big one.	Ngidinga ukuthenga enkulu.
I didn't say that.	Angizange ngisho lokho.
And it is possible.	Futhi kungenzeka.
But we must all do it together.	Kodwa kumele sonke sikwenze ndawonye.
Obviously there is something I need to do.	Ngokusobala kukhona okumele ngikwenze.
But children.	Kodwa izingane.
Therefore.	Ngalokho .
I like it here very much.	Ngithanda lapha kakhulu.
Well, that's better.	Kuhle, lokho kungcono.
He wanted his mother.	Wayefuna umama wakhe.
And it is not.	Futhi akunjalo.
I have to go there.	Kufanele ngiye lapho.
But that is not the answer.	Kodwa leyo akuyona impendulo.
I do that, too.	Ngenza lokho, nami.
He also speaks.	Aphinde akhulume.
He should not have been here.	Bekungafanele abe lapha.
No one should do this alone.	Akekho okufanele akwenze yedwa lokhu.
Again, this is not true.	Futhi, lokhu akulona iqiniso.
She is trying to help.	Uzama ukusiza.
I think it could be.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungaba njalo.
But he was not at home.	Kodwa wayengekho ekhaya.
You can't go with me.	Awukwazi ukuhamba nami.
I know.	Ngiyazi.
What is that? 	Yini leyo?
Just a little.	Kancane nje.
It only happens in the evening.	Kwenzeka kusihlwa kuphela.
All right now.	Kulungile manje.
He said he should.	Wathi kufanele.
That's fine with me.	Kulungile kimi.
You want to be alone.	Ufuna ukuba wedwa.
And all that.	Futhi konke lokho.
But he says, no.	Kodwa uthi, cha.
And he did it very well.	Futhi wakwenza kahle kakhulu.
You will not be able to do this.	Ngeke ukwazi ukwenza lokhu.
So now my question is.	Ngakho manje umbuzo wami uthi.
It just so happens.	Kwenzeka njalo nje.
He started walking.	Waqala ukuhamba.
And that's the one.	Futhi nguye lowo.
You may have tried to do more quickly.	Kungenzeka ukuthi wazama ukwenza okuningi ngokushesha kakhulu.
And some of you are right.	Futhi okunye kwakho kuyiqiniso.
I did not want it to happen.	Ngangingafuni ukuthi kwenzeke.
I do not know who he is.	Angazi ukuthi ubani.
This will not be the case.	Lokhu ngeke kube njalo.
But you are always happy.	Kodwa njalo ujabule.
That's just fine.	Kuhle nje lokho.
I knew it was going to happen.	Ngangazi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
You do not want to go there.	Awufuni ukuya lapho.
This is the best that can be.	Lokhu kungcono kakhulu kungaba.
He didn't want to go home yet.	Wayengafuni ukuya ekhaya okwamanje.

He never really existed.	Akakaze abe khona ngempela.
I want to do this.	Ngifuna ukwenza lokhu.

So, for you at home.	Ngakho, ngawe ekhaya.
She really wanted to be with him.	Wayefuna ngempela ukuba naye.
There is no one but you.	Akekho omunye ngaphandle kwakho.
This is not the case.	Lokhu akunjalo.
And this is true.	Futhi lokhu kuyiqiniso.
I am so excited about this !.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngalokhu!.
He wanted to be me.	Wayefuna ukuba yimi.
You want to make a good impression.	Ufuna ukwenza umbono omuhle.
It's not my life.	Akuyona impilo yami.
Why,.	Kungani, .
Everyone, except you.	Wonke umuntu, ngaphandle kwakho.
I know for a fact that it is not so.	Ngiyazi impela ukuthi akunjalo.
And that's the problem.	Futhi lapho inkinga.
I need help.	Ngidinga usizo.
And in the end you can’t stop.	Futhi ekugcineni awukwazi ukuyeka.
What is this.	Ukuthi yini lokhu.

He walked slowly.	Wahamba kancane kancane.
Right here in the house.	Khona lapha endlini.
But only if you are sure you want to.	Kodwa kuphela uma uqinisekile ukuthi ufuna.
He can.	Angakwazi .
There is plenty of time.	Kukhona isikhathi esiningi.
He is not a bad person.	Akayena umuntu omubi.
The other is that one does not know.	Okunye ukuthi omunye akakwazi.
Travel can be very good.	Ukuhamba kungase kube kuhle kakhulu.
He thought so.	Wacabanga kanjalo.
He said there was nothing he could do.	Wathi akukho angakwenza.
You can't make it look good.	Awukwazi ukukwenza kube kuhle.
But he is always curious.	Kodwa uhlale efuna ukwazi.
But it's better.	Kodwa kungcono.
It is very true.	Kuyiqiniso impela.

But you, once.	Kodwa wena, kanye .
But it did not have to be this way.	Kodwa kwakungadingeki kube khona.
Only money.	Imali kuphela.

Little by little.	Kancane kancane.
You did very well.	Wenze kahle impela.

Anything, anytime.	Noma yini, noma nini.
Really fast.	Ngokushesha ngempela.
It is very true.	Kuyiqiniso impela.
You know he did.	Uyazi wakwenza.
She's very fine, doctor.	Muhle kakhulu, udokotela.

Probably should.	Cishe kufanele.
Shouldn’t it.	Akufanele yini .
Anything else.	Noma yini enye.
.	.
I did well.	Ngenze kahle.
But we probably won't do much.	Kodwa cishe ngeke senze okuningi.
He should never know.	Akumele neze azi.
I need to go.	Ngidinga ukuhamba.
.	.
He is also not human.	Akuyena futhi umuntu.
.	.
That will not happen.	Ngeke kwenzeke lokho.
Alone, always alone.	Ngedwa, njalo wedwa.
You will be late for school.	Uzofika sekwephuzile esikoleni.
You made a mistake here.	Wenze iphutha lapha.
That's my place.	Indawo yami leyo.
Really a place.	Impela indawo.
We have to do something.	Kufanele senze okuthile.
I need to find this.	Ngidinga ukuthola lokhu.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbe ngeke neze.
It's just fine.	Kuhle nje.
It always happens.	Kwenzeka njalo.
But he did not speak.	Kodwa akazange akhulume.
Probably not.	Cishe ngeke .
I think not.	Ngicabanga ukuthi cha.
He was not in the house.	Wayengekho endlini.
That will not happen now.	Lokho ngeke kwenzeke manje.
It is not here and it is not there.	Akukho lapha futhi akukho lapho.
How nice to be here for me.	Kuhle kanjani ukuba lapha kimi.
Gradually he agreed.	Kancane kancane wavuma.
I wanted nothing to do with it.	Ngangingafuni lutho.
You have been very present.	Ube khona kakhulu.
That is what my father did.	Wakwenza lokho ubaba.
We will not do it here.	Ngeke sikwenze lapha.
I can't say yet.	Angikwazi ukusho okwamanje.
It will be a little difficult.	Kuzoba nzima kancane.
You know how.	Uyazi kanjani.
Probably not.	Cishe akunjalo.
And now, we know.	Futhi manje, siyazi.
No, it is not.	Cha, kusobala ukuthi akunjalo.
And there is another problem.	Futhi kukhona enye inkinga.
He did not think so.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi kuzoba njalo.
He doesn't really know what to do with it.	Akazi ngempela ukuthi enzeni ngakho.
It is by no means a good thing.	Akuyona neze into enhle.
I have to be there.	Kufanele ngibe lapho.
And he thought about it.	Futhi wacabanga ngakho.
Nor will it be.	Ngeke futhi kube njalo.
I wonder if you just know.	Kazi ukwazi nje.
We should not have done it.	Bekungafanele sikwenze.
You will know what to do.	Uzokwazi okufanele ukwenze.
But it could be a very good thing.	Kodwa kungaba khona into enhle kakhulu.
All of this is possible.	Konke lokhu kungenzeka.
You have to be your own person.	Kumele ube umuntu wakho.
That was his only reply.	Impendulo yakhe kuphela leyo.
I mean, never.	Ngisho, neze.
It can be difficult to say who he is.	Kungaba nzima ukusho ukuthi ubani.
But whoever that is, you did a good job.	Kodwa noma ngabe ubani lowo, wenze umsebenzi omuhle.
Not only could he, he did it.	Akakwazanga nje kuphela, wakwenza.
But it will not.	Kodwa ngeke.
One has to speak.	Umuntu kumele akhulume.
Even you, I'm sorry.	Ngisho nawe, ngiyaxolisa.
I am very happy about it.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngakho.

You must not tell me anything.	Akumele ungitshele lutho.
And he did a good job.	Futhi wenza umsebenzi omuhle.
She is actually very beautiful.	Empeleni muhle impela.
Nothing, just nothing.	Lutho, lutho nje.
And yet it is not a big problem.	Futhi okwamanje akuyona inkinga enkulu.
But that's fine.	Kodwa lokho kuhle.
Of course there is almost nothing there.	Kuyiqiniso ukuthi cishe akukho lutho lapho.
Learning to read.	Ukufunda ukufunda.
He probably never did.	Cishe akakaze akwenze.
He is not here.	Akekho lapha.
He's talking to me.	Ukhuluma nami.
But now it will not.	Kodwa manje ngeke.
Not at all.	Akunjalo neze.
As you live there.	Njengoba uhlala lapho.
I need to go to work tonight.	Ngidinga ukuya emsebenzini namhlanje ebusuku.
There is more.	Kukhona okunye.
There, he said.	Lapho, wathi.
.	.
But that can be a problem.	Kodwa lokho kungase kube inkinga.
Maybe you can do that.	Mhlawumbe ungakwenza lokho.
I need help.	Ngicela usizo.
I know a little bit.	Ngiyazi kancane.
I'm happy about it.	Ngiyajabula ngakho.
Not a big deal.	Akuyona into enkulu.
I can't believe it.	Angikholwa.
It's really obvious.	Kusobala ngempela.
Good, good.	Kuhle, kuhle.
He thought about time.	Wacabanga ngesikhathi.
I want to do this alone.	Ngifuna ukwenze wedwa lokhu.
Good but !!.	Kuhle kodwa!!.
I am afraid to speak.	Ngesaba ukukhuluma.
I just know how you feel.	Ngiyazi nje ukuthi uzizwa kanjani.
I can't walk.	Angikwazi ukuhamba.
How he wanted.	Wayefuna kanjani.
He did it, too, in the end.	Wakwenza, futhi, ekugcineni.
And again in a week.	Futhi futhi ngesonto.
Worse, it's very obvious.	Kabi, kusobala kakhulu.
And this is what happens.	Futhi lokhu kwenzeka.
He did not think so.	Wayengacabangi kanjalo.
Very, very much.	Kakhulu, ngisho.
He is there.	Ukhona.
Here and now, he knew nothing.	Lapha futhi manje, wayengazi lutho.
That is why it is so obvious.	Yingakho kusobala.
Also, you probably know how to do this.	Futhi, cishe uyazi ukuthi ungakwenza kanjani lokhu.
I am very happy now.	Ngijabule kakhulu manje.

He knew it was him.	Wayazi ukuthi nguye.
And he is a great man.	Futhi uyindoda enkulu.
You have found that this is not really the case.	Uthole ukuthi lokhu akunjalo ngempela.
he asked.	wabuza.
I do better on my own.	Ngenza kangcono ngedwa.
He always makes a big point.	Uhlale wenza umqondo omkhulu.
That is possible.	Lokho kungenzeka.
Nothing to me.	Akukho lutho kimi.
But you have to do something.	Kodwa kufanele wenze okuthile.
He is a human being.	Ungumuntu.
There is something.	Kukhona okuthile.
So, that would be it.	Ngakho, kungaba yilokho.
And it is not.	Futhi akunjalo.
My mother did this for the rest of her life.	Umama wami wakwenza lokhu impilo yakhe yonke.
He can't do it.	Akakwazi ukukwenza.
And he doesn't know about that.	Futhi akazi ngalokho.
So it happened.	Ngakho kwenzeka.
He tried again, a little.	Wazama futhi, kancane.
That is not the case at all.	Akukhona lokho nhlobo.
Why? 	Kungani?
And it did.	Futhi kwenzeka.
I'm sorry about that.	Ngiyaxolisa ngakho.
Waiting, like me.	Ukulinda, njengami.
That's not my mother.	Akuyena umama wami lowo.
But that is good enough.	Kodwa lokho kuhle ngokwanele.
It should be hard to find.	Kufanele kube nzima ukuthola.

To keep you happy.	Ukuze uhlale ujabule.
He tried again.	Wazama futhi.
I am very happy about it.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngakho.
She would love that.	Angathanda lokho.
But it only happened once for a long time.	Kodwa kwenzeka kanye kuphela isikhathi eside.
Now that's the idea.	Manje lowo umqondo.
Right there.	Khona lapho.
Anyone would.	Noma ubani ngabe.
And now and then, just now.	Futhi manje futhi, manje nje.
I did just that.	Ngenza lokho kanye.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
And it will be difficult.	Futhi kuzoba nzima.
He did not know how.	Wayengazi ukuthi kanjani.
He knew.	Wayazi.
You always do such a good job.	Uhlala wenza umsebenzi omuhle kangaka.
I do not know.	Angazi.
But one just did.	Kodwa omunye wenza nje.
He didn't really know.	Wayengazi ngempela.
Anything like that.	Noma yini enjalo.
You made a mistake.	Wenze iphutha.

There, he says.	Lapho, uthi.
I think that's okay.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kulungile.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I'm really sorry.	Ngiyaxolisa ngempela.
He will probably never do it again.	Cishe ngeke aphinde akwenze.
I want to make money.	Ngifuna ukwenza imali.
This will not be difficult for me.	Lokhu ngeke kube nzima kimi.
That will not happen to you.	Lokho ngeke kwenzeke kuwe.
Or at home.	Noma ekhaya.
I want to.	Ngifuna .
He can't walk.	Akakwazi ukuhamba.
He did not know who that was.	Wayengazi ukuthi kungaba ubani lowo.
So he tried to do something about it.	Ngakho wazama ukwenza okuthile ngakho.
All of this is happening openly.	Konke lokhu kwenzeka ngokusobala.
You do not need to say anything.	Awudingi ukusho lutho.
I know you need to buy another place.	Ngiyazi ukuthi udinga ukuthenga enye indawo.
I'm just happy to have him here.	Ngijabule nje ukuba naye lapha.
You should have said no.	Bekufanele uthi cha.

You've been here with him.	Uke waba lapha naye.
That you know.	Ukuthi uyazi.
That is your life.	Impilo yakho leyo.

You have to stay.	Kufanele uhlale.
But we should not do that.	Kodwa akufanele senze kanjalo.
Now you .	Manje wena .
He can't be.	Angeke abe .
He does his job perfectly.	Wenza umsebenzi wakhe ngokuphelele.
He did his job.	Wenze umsebenzi wakhe.
It would be nice though.	Kungaba kuhle kodwa.

All to you.	Konke kuwe.
You can do this.	Ungakwenza lokhu.

This is not entirely true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso ngokuphelele.

Maybe okay.	Mhlawumbe kulungile.
And he also knows.	Futhi naye uyazi.
Just you and me, really.	Mina nawe nje, ngempela.
Or in the morning.	Noma ekuseni.
But it is much better.	Kodwa kungcono kakhulu.

He just wants to do it.	Ufuna nje ukukwenza.
You know how.	Uyazi ukuthi kanjani.
He has to do it, and now.	Kufanele enze, futhi manje.
But, if that should be a big question.	Kodwa, uma kufanele kube umbuzo omkhulu.

That is probably why he did so well.	Kungenzeka ukuthi yingakho enze umsebenzi omuhle kangaka.
Just my opinion.	Umbono wami nje.
That seems to be true.	Lokho kubonakala kuyiqiniso.
Or more recently.	Noma kamuva nje.

Now, he knew.	Manje, wayazi.
He knew everyone.	Wayazi wonke umuntu.
Why should it? 	Kungani kufanele?

It's a bad idea every time that happens.	Umbono omubi njalo uma lokho kwenzeka.
That's a good place.	Indawo enhle leyo.
There is everything great.	Kukhona yonke into enkulu.
He went alone.	Wahamba yedwa.

But that did happen.	Kodwa lokho kwenzeka.
Maybe in the morning it's better.	Mhlawumbe ekuseni kungcono.
I want to stay awhile.	Ngifuna ukuhlala isikhashana.

It may be helpful.	Kungase kube usizo.
Lots of space.	Indawo eningi.

And he is not visible here.	Futhi akabonakali lapha.
He should have been.	Bekufanele abe njalo.
It will happen in the end.	Kuzokwenzeka ekugcineni.
You just know you exist.	Uyazi nje ukuthi ukhona.

You can and will do it.	Ungakwenza futhi uzokwenza.
And he wanted to know the truth.	Futhi wayefuna ukwazi iqiniso.
It's just not very good.	Akuyona nje enhle kakhulu.
I don't think so.	Angicabangi nhlobo.
He left immediately.	Wahamba ngokushesha.
He always has.	Uhlale njalo.
He did not want to eat alone.	Wayengafuni ukudla yedwa.
How fast.	Ngokushesha kangakanani.
So that's great !.	Ngakho kuhle lokho!.
And hopefully, so did he.	Futhi ngethemba, kanjalo naye.
He started down.	Waqala phansi.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
You did the job.	Wenze umsebenzi.
No, no.	Cha, cha.
Tell me something about yourself.	Ngitshele okuthile ngawe.

I think this is probably once a week.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu mhlawumbe kanye ngesonto.
All right, a little.	Kulungile, kancane.
But you can do it.	Kodwa ungakwenza.
It would be a lie.	Kungaba amanga nje.

He must be able to do it.	Kufanele akwazi ukukwenza.
I think you can do that too.	Ngicabanga ukuthi nawe ungakwenza lokho.
.	.
Make us do it.	Senze sikwenze.
I don't think so.	Angicabangi kahle.
Or maybe tomorrow.	Noma mhlawumbe kusasa.

Who did that?!.	Ubani owenza lokho?!.
It will be very good.	Kuzoba kuhle kakhulu.
Want to work with us ?.	Ufuna ukusebenza nathi?.
And he did a bad job.	Futhi wenza umsebenzi omubi.
That should be fine.	Lokho kumele kube kuhle.
But he has to stay in prison.	Kodwa kumele ahlale ejele.
This is not going to be good.	Lokhu ngeke kube kuhle.
Maybe later, finally.	Mhlawumbe kamuva, ekugcineni.
I don't think he should be alone here.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele abe yedwa lapha.
We know that.	Siyazi ukuthi .
You have to do it.	Kufanele ukwenze.
Or it should be.	Noma kufanele kube.
Everyone can read.	Wonke umuntu angakwazi ukufunda.
If anything.	Uma kukhona nhlobo.
It looks a little weird.	Kubukeka kancane.
Most of the time it won’t be.	Isikhathi esiningi ngeke kube njalo.
I need to go now.	Ngidinga ukuhamba manje.
I am very happy about it.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngakho.

I want you to get an idea.	Ngifuna uthole umqondo.
Really good.	Kuhle ngempela.
And this is all happening.	Futhi lokhu kwenzeka konke.
So far, and nothing more.	Kuze kube manje, futhi akukho okunye.
All right, that's better.	Kulungile, lokho kungcono.
Just the truth.	Iqiniso nje.

Maybe that's the best.	Mhlawumbe lokho kungcono kakhulu.
You don't really need any more.	Awudingi ngempela okunye.
Maybe it will happen, maybe it won't.	Mhlawumbe kuzokwenzeka, mhlawumbe ngeke.

He has done so much work.	Wenze umsebenzi omkhulu kangaka.
You should be happy.	Kufanele ujabule.
He became a teacher.	Waba uthisha.
He should stop doing it.	Kufanele ayeke ukukwenza.
That is just my opinion.	Lokho kusobala nje umbono wami.
No one is there.	Akukho muntu lapho.
Why it might be so.	Kungani kungase kube njalo.
He went with us.	Wahamba nathi.
He did not know why.	Wayengazi ukuthi kungani.
I can't do it alone.	Angikwazi ukukwenza ngedwa.
That is indeed a good question.	Empeleni umbuzo omuhle lowo.
Probably not a big deal if there is one.	Cishe akuyona into enkulu uma kukhona.
.	.
No, I know too.	Cha, nami ngiyazi.
Do you feel good, do you feel.	Ingabe uzizwa kahle, ingabe uzizwa.

No matter what happens, you sit down.	Noma ngabe kwenzekani, uhlala phansi.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze lutho.
So he thought.	Ngakho wacabanga.

You play well.	Udlala kahle.
Maybe you can too.	Mhlawumbe nawe ungakwenza.
I need money.	Ngidinga imali.
You want to do something about it.	Ufuna ukwenza okuthile ngakho.
He did.	Waba njalo.
I'm not sure about that.	Angiqiniseki ngalokho.
But it is true.	Kodwa kuyiqiniso.
All of this is true.	Konke lokhu kuyiqiniso.
Not a big deal.	Akuyona into enkulu.
Probably too.	Mhlawumbe naye.

Looks like you did too.	Kubukeka sengathi nawe wenze njalo.

Your mother, however.	Umama wakho, kodwa.
He did very well.	Wenza kahle impela.
Maybe it's better that way.	Mhlawumbe kungcono kanjalo.
He thought.	Wacabanga.
This is not entirely true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso ngokuphelele.

I don't really know why.	Angazi ngempela ukuthi kungani.
But he can't.	Kodwa akakwazi.
.	.
Very little, really.	Kancane kakhulu, empeleni.
It can be very helpful.	Kungaba usizo kakhulu.
Then again it will not.	Khona futhi angeke.
I can make it better.	Ngingakwenza kube kuhle.
It seems like yesterday.	Kubonakala sengathi izolo.
Every call.	Njalo ucingo.
You know, this is just once.	Uyazi, lokhu kanye nje.
Very good.	Kuhle kakhulu.
I never saw a good person.	Angizange ngibone umuntu omuhle.
That's fine with me.	Kulungile kimi.
And maybe we did.	Futhi mhlawumbe senze.
I thought nothing of it.	Ngangingacabangi lutho.
And it can be.	Futhi kungaba njalo.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma ngokushesha.
He just couldn't be.	Wayengeke nje abe.
Very, really.	Kakhulu, ngempela.

But it is not.	Kodwa akuyena.
That would be okay.	Lokho kungaba kulungile.
You know this, and you will not.	Lokhu uyakwazi, futhi ngeke.
And that is not true.	Futhi lokho akulona iqiniso.
Certainly.	Impela.

Maybe longer.	Mhlawumbe eside.
I'm happy about it now.	Ngiyajabula ngakho manje.
Or it should.	Noma kufanele.
It might be, he thought.	Kungase kube njalo, wacabanga.

It is not just money.	Akuyona nje imali.
And it can be.	Futhi kungaba njalo.
That is not a mistake.	Lokho akulona iphutha.
It has to be him.	Kufanele kube nguye.
I mean, really good.	Ngisho ngempela, kuhle ngempela.
And you know, it's not really me.	Futhi uyazi, akukhona ngempela kimi.
It looks absolutely fine.	Kubonakala kuhle ngokuphelele.
I need to go myself.	Ngidinga ukuhamba mina.
But, it should.	Kodwa, kufanele.
Probably the best.	Mhlawumbe kungcono kakhulu.
It will happen.	Kuzokwenzeka.
And that's almost all.	Futhi lokho cishe konke.
He could not come.	Akakwazanga ukuza.

She wanted to talk to him.	Wayefuna ukukhuluma naye.
But he is not here now.	Kodwa akekho lapha manje.
But tell me this.	Kodwa ngitshele lokhu.
This is obviously not the case here.	Lokhu ngokusobala akunjalo lapha.

He must be with her.	Kumele abe naye.
You just think you know, really.	Ucabanga nje ukuthi uyazi, empeleni.
I'm not really.	Angiyena ngempela.
So it should.	Ngakho kufanele.

Not so today.	Akunjalo namuhla.

He'll do it, he'll do it.	Uzokwenza, uzokwenza.
So it is not.	Ngakho akunjalo.
The doctor said it was okay.	Udokotela wathi kulungile.
All right, all right.	Kulungile, kulungile.
That would not be good.	Ngeke kube kuhle lokho.

We did this together.	Lokhu sikwenze ndawonye.
That is why.	Yingakho .
I did very well.	Ngenze kahle impela.
He couldn't do much about it.	Akakwazanga ukwenza okuningi ngakho.
It probably won't last long.	Cishe ngeke ahlale isikhathi eside.
Not a really good thing.	Akuyona into enhle ngempela.
As it will be for you.	Njengoba kuzoba njalo kuwe.
He does not want to leave.	Akafuni ukuhamba.
This afternoon, that happened.	Namuhla ntambama, lokho kwenzeke.

You can't drive too much.	Awukwazi ukushayela kakhulu.
That can happen here.	Lokho kungenzeka lapha.
It was not his fault that he was not there.	Akulona iphutha lakhe ukuthi wayengekho.
What are you doing now.	Wenzani manje.
No one should know today.	Akekho okufanele akwazi namuhla.
Very, very sorry.	Kakhulu, ngiyaxolisa kakhulu.

That is probably the best.	Lokho cishe kungcono kakhulu.
Hard work is real.	Ukusebenza kanzima kuyiqiniso.

Everything seems right here.	Konke kubonakala kulungile lapha.

We know it is possible.	Siyazi ukuthi kungenzeka.
She doesn't know how beautiful she is.	Akazi ukuthi muhle kangakanani.

Or he may not.	Noma angeke.
Right now.	Njengamanje .
I want to know the truth.	Ngifuna ukwazi iqiniso.
It will not happen.	Ngeke kwenzeke.
Everyone wanted to stay.	Wonke umuntu wayefuna ukuhlala.
Being alone with him.	Ukuba naye yedwa.
He certainly knew about it.	Impela wayazi ngakho.
I don't really want to talk about it.	Angifuni ngempela ukukhuluma ngakho.
I thought that was possible.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kungenzeka lokho.
This is not very true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso kakhulu.
It's not me.	Akumina.
I don't like it at all.	Angithandi nhlobo.
He has done so now.	Wenze njalo manje.
Also, her mother.	Futhi, umama wakhe.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngempela.
That is what he should do.	Yilokho okufanele akwenze.

There is only one.	Kukhona kuphela.

Driving almost everywhere.	Ukushayela cishe yonke indawo.
I thought you did very well.	Bengicabanga ukuthi wenze kahle kakhulu.
But in reality it is not.	Kodwa empeleni akunjalo.
He left in the morning.	Wahamba ekuseni.
He did not want me to know that.	Wayengafuni ngikwazi lokho.
We know how.	Siyazi ukuthi kanjani.
That is possible.	Lokho kungenzeka.
He was alone.	Kade eyedwa.
That is probably a good idea.	Cishe umqondo omuhle lowo.
He knew it would be so.	Wayazi ukuthi kuzoba njalo.
It certainly should have been.	Impela bekufanele kube njalo.
I want to see more.	Ngifuna ukubona okuningi.
To do something.	Ukwenza okuthile.
That's all.	Yilokho konke.
I do not know either.	Nami angazi.
No, not at all.	Cha, akukho kulokhu.

Maybe you can too.	Mhlawumbe nawe ungakwenza.
He just did it very, very well.	Wenza nje kakhulu, kahle kakhulu.
Here again.	Lapha futhi.
But, that is not the case here.	Kodwa, akunjalo lapha.
My father is always there.	Ubaba uhlale njalo.
He may be busy for a while.	Angase abe matasa isikhashana.
Probably a lot of things.	Mhlawumbe izinto eziningi.
I want to do something, but I don't know what.	Ngifuna ukwenza okuthile, kodwa angazi ukuthi yini.
When you are human.	Lapho ungumuntu.

Where you want.	Lapho ufuna khona.
You did a very good job.	Wenze umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
Nothing else.	Akukho okunye.
Well, that's not really true.	Kulungile, lokho akulona iqiniso ngempela.
Tell anyone.	Tshela noma ubani.
He thought quickly.	Wacabanga ngokushesha.
No one is always bad.	Akekho omubi njalo.
Previously.	Ngaphambili.
One, indeed, one.	Enye impela, impela.
But it can be.	Kodwa kungaba khona.
I hope it is true.	Ngethemba ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
No, he thought.	Cha, wacabanga.
I love everything about you.	Ngithanda yonke into ngawe.
Or he may remain so.	Noma angase ahlale kanjalo.

You make a mistake, you are human.	Wenza iphutha, ungumuntu.
But it will happen.	Kodwa kuzokwenzeka.
All right.	Kulungile.
The problem is not money.	Inkinga akuyona imali.
If there is such a thing.	Uma kukhona into enjalo.
It seems right to me.	Kubonakala kulungile kimi.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbe kwenzeka kanjalo.
She is very beautiful.	Muhle kakhulu.
You know this is true.	Uyazi ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso.
This is simply not true.	Lokhu akulona neze iqiniso.
I'm so sorry for you.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu ngawe.

Anyone, really.	Noma ubani, ngempela.
As you should know.	Njengoba kufanele wazi.
He doesn't think he can.	Akacabangi ukuthi angakwazi.
It was not worth the time.	Bekungafanele isikhathi.
So the job did well.	Ngakho umsebenzi wenze kahle.
Too much.	Kakhulu kakhulu.
Good, very good.	Kuhle, kakhulu.
Also, he did not have to go to work.	Futhi, kwakungadingeki ukuthi aye emsebenzini.
And what he looked like.	Futhi ukuthi wayebukeka kanjani.
That's all, nothing else.	Yilokho kuphela, akukho okunye.
Currently not available.	Okwamanje akekho.
I need time.	Ngidinga isikhathi.
I mean, fast.	Ngisho, ngokushesha.
He wanted to know now.	Wayefuna ukwazi manje.
He says something.	Ukhuluma okuthile.
It will be very difficult.	Kuzoba nzima kakhulu.
Finally, the answer.	Ekugcineni, impendulo.
If possible.	Uma kungenzeka.
He thought.	Wacabanga.
I'm sure of that.	Ngiyaqiniseka ngalokho.
He started saying something.	Waqala ukusho okuthile.
.	.
But it's better.	Kodwa kungcono.
And you can't.	Futhi awukwazi.

This is not really true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso ngempela.
Without you .	Ngaphandle kwakho .
I do not want to stay here.	Angifuni ukuhlala lapha.
But he didn't want to talk to me.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukukhuluma nami.
But you can do more.	Kodwa ungakwenza okunye.

Everything will be fine.	Konke kuzoba kuhle.
But, it was worth it.	Kodwa, bekufanele.
Performance is available.	Ukusebenza kukhona.
And that! 	Futhi lokho!
I try to stay there.	Ngizama ukuhlala lapho.
He didn't know about it.	Wayengazi ngakho.
Not so with him.	Naye akunjalo.
But today is better.	Kodwa namuhla kungcono.
But he is a human being.	Kodwa ungumuntu.
Today if you can.	Namuhla uma ungakwazi.
But there is nothing wrong.	Kodwa akukho iphutha.
You just need to do it.	Udinga nje ukukwenza.
Maybe it's me.	Mhlawumbe yimina.
But we did well.	Kodwa senze kahle.
This happened.	Kwenzeka lokhu.
I like something like that.	Ngithanda into enjalo.

Slow but smooth.	Ukuhamba kancane kodwa kahle.
And this is what happens.	Futhi kwenzeka lokhu.
It's me.	Yimi.
You're good.	Wenza kahle.
John tried again.	UJohn wazama futhi.
He began to learn something.	Waqala ukufunda okuthile.
There is something here.	Kukhona okuthile lapha.
He nodded slightly.	Wavuma kancane.
It happens at work and it happens at home.	Kwenzeka emsebenzini futhi kwenzeka ekhaya.
All again, alone.	Konke futhi, ngedwa.
Maybe it's true, maybe not.	Mhlawumbe kuyiqiniso, mhlawumbe akunjalo.
Outside there is none.	Ngaphandle akukho.
This has been very difficult for me.	Lokhu kube nzima kakhulu kimi.
It must be difficult.	Kumelwe kube nzima.
But that's okay.	Kodwa lokho kulungile.

The doctor finally.	Udokotela ekugcineni.
And now you know.	Futhi manje uyazi.
Not so either.	Akunjalo futhi.
I could not see that.	Angikwazanga ukubona lokho.

Maybe you know.	Mhlawumbe uyakwazi.
He never did.	Akazange akwenze.
But if it's true, if it's true.	Kodwa uma kuyiqiniso, uma kuyiqiniso.

Everyone did what they could.	Wonke umuntu wenza lokho akwazi ukukwenza.
Sit down.	Ahlale phansi.
Maybe that ??? 	Mhlawumbe lokho???
He thinks it is good.	Ucabanga ukuthi kuhle.

So you can really see that quickly.	Ngakho ungakwazi ngempela ukubona ukuthi ngokushesha.
I hope so much.	Ngethemba kakhulu.
Here, it is not.	Lapha, akunjalo.
He started learning about it.	Waqala ukufunda ngakho.
He speaks his mind.	Ukhuluma umqondo wakhe.
Phone.	Ucingo.
Just for fun.	Ukuze nje ujabule.
This should be very difficult.	Lokhu kumele kube nzima kakhulu.
He also did not have her.	Naye akazange abe naye.
