I have never said anything like that.	Zange ndithethe into enjalo.
Don't talk about it again.	Musa ukuthetha ngayo kwakhona.
He did not speak for long.	Akazange athethe ixesha elide.
All right, so there you are.	Kulungile, ngoko kukho loo nto.

Everyone wants to play.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukudlala.
You think more.	Ucinga ngakumbi.
Shopping here is fine.	Ukuthenga apha kulungile.

It's so much better.	Kungcono kakhulu.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He did not leave.	Akazange ahambe.

So this is something new.	Ngoko le yinto entsha.

To do that, you need to know who that is.	Ukwenza oko, kufuneka wazi ukuba ngubani lowo.
So, don't do this.	Ngoko, musa ukwenza oku.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.

Don't go there.	Musa ukuya apho.
Good enough, not a big deal.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, hayi into enkulu.
However, this is not possible.	Kodwa ke, oku akunakwenzeka.
Nobody says that.	Akukho mntu uthetha loo nto.
At night,	Ebusuku,
No, no, no.	Hayi, hayi, hayi.
He must have known.	Umele ukuba wayesazi.
But, in the end, he had to go to work.	Kodwa, ekugqibeleni, kwafuneka aye emsebenzini.
Clearly, he did not.	Ngokucacileyo, akazange.
I never knew what it was.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba yintoni.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
She really loves to travel.	Uthanda ngokwenene ukuhamba.
He said he didn't even know why.	Wathi akayazi nokuba kutheni.
Doing the work for you.	Ukwenza umsebenzi kuwe.
Or not.	Okanye akunjalo.
I'm not sure what you did with that fact.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wenze ntoni ngaloo nyani.
I didn't know how to do this.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndingayenza njani le nto.
Not you.	Hayi wena.
That's what happened here.	Nantso ke into eyenzekayo apha.
But one more thing.	Kodwa enye into.

I was just thinking.	Ndandicinga nje.
You seem to feel better.	Ubonakala ngathi uziva ngcono.
You just have to be yourself.	Kufuneka nje ube nguwe.
Well not.	Kulungile akunjalo.
I'm not sure how I can do that.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I mean, as good as it gets.	Ndiya kuthetha, kakuhle njengoko.

I hope you will come soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kuza ngokukhawuleza.

So to speak.	Ngoko ukuthetha.
He had to think about why we were coming to him.	Kwafuneka acinge ukuba kutheni siza kuye.
He made you think.	Wakwenza wacinga.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
You have to do it now.	Kufuneka wenze ngoku.
I'm glad it's you and not me.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nguwe hayi mna.
Of course he was not.	Ewe wayengekho.
I'm sure of that.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto.
You have to do something about it. 	Kufuneka wenze into ngayo. 
But tell me about yourself.	Kodwa ndixelele ngawe.
I would really like to see that.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukubona oko.

Something like that.	Into enjalo.
I'm sure of that.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto.
he asked.	wabuza.
If this happens, fine.	Ukuba oku kwenzeka, kulungile.

I can't today.	Andikwazi namhlanje.
He would do it.	Wayeza kuyenza.
I wish to go.	Ndinqwenela ukuhamba.
He will be human again.	Uzakuba ngumntu kwakhona.

He knew nothing about it.	Wayengazi nto ngayo enye into.
I am now.	Ndim ngoku.
You will be in everything.	Uza kuba kuyo yonke into.
Right on.	Oku ngoku.
Everything.	Yonke into.
You just do your job.	Wenza nje umsebenzi wakho.
You really want to.	Ufuna ngokwenene.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
I'm not sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto.
He just looked.	Wajonga nje.
It's the same thing again.	Yinto enye kwakhona.
That seems difficult.	Oko kubonakala kunzima.
You want to be here.	Ufuna ukuba lapha.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
Where are we going?	Apho siya khona?
Today, everyone does everything.	Namhlanje, wonke umntu wenza yonke into.
Even the problem.	Nokuba ingxaki .
That should have been okay.	Oko bekufanele ukuba kulungile.
Or maybe not.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
So it's the same thing.	Ngoko yinto enye.
I know who he is.	Ndiyazi ukuba ngubani.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
But he is not going.	Kodwa akayi.
I will stay with you.	Ndiya kuhlala nawe.
He sat down immediately.	Wahlala phantsi ngoko nangoko.
But now you know.	Kodwa ngoku uyazi.
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
That's another job.	Omnye umsebenzi lowo.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I thought it was you.	Bendicinga ukuba nguwe.
I want to see.	Ndifuna ukubona.
I would like to go.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba.
I can do this.	Ndingayenza le nto.
But, that's what happened.	Kodwa, nantso into eyenzekayo.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
He is invisible.	Akabonakali.
So nobody here.	Ngoko akukho mntu apha.
I am sure you will do well.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uya kwenza kakuhle.
I don't know how to deal with this.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani ngale nto.
This is true.	Le yinyani.
Thus, there is.	Ngaloo ndlela, kukho.
I'm happy to talk about anything.	Ndiyavuya ukuthetha ngayo nantoni na.
Not so in this book.	Akunjalo kule ncwadi.
We have to do it every morning !.	Kufuneka siyenze njalo kusasa!.
To be.	Ukuba.
To do that once again.	Ukwenza oko kube kanye kwakhona.

I don't even know what it is.	Andazi nokuba yintoni na.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
Well, just this.	Ewe, kanye oku.

Something is happening here.	Kukho into eyenzekayo apha.
He did not want to stay.	Wayengafuni ukuhlala.
No problem there.	Akukho ngxaki apho.
Soon now.	Kungekudala ngoku.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
Obviously he did not succeed.	Ngokucacileyo akazange aphumelele.
Only everywhere.	Kuphela kuyo yonke indawo.
I just knew.	Ndandisazi nje.
He looked at his dog.	Wajonga inja yakhe.
One thing in another way.	Into enye ngenye indlela.
He knew better.	Wayesazi ngcono.
He did so.	Wenza njalo.
There are so many things.	Kukho izinto ezininzi.
Supposed to be .	Umele ukuba .
There is no one out here.	Akukho mntu ngaphandle apha.
We will be coming soon for help.	Siza kuza ngokukhawuleza uncedo.

He looks so bad, you know.	Ukhangeleka embi kakhulu, uyazi.
That's the way we do it.	Yiloo ndlela esenza ngayo.
Definitely a dog.	Ngokuqinisekileyo inja.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi.
But you do not want to do this.	Kodwa awufuni ukwenza oku.
He finally did it.	Ekugqibeleni uyenzile.
If you do not want to leave.	Ukuba awufuni ukuhamba.
I don't want to do it.	Andifuni ukuyenza.
I hope so.	Ndiyathemba njalo.
Not really.	Hayi ngokwenene.
I know he only does his job.	Ndiyazi ukuba wenza umsebenzi wakhe kuphela.
Maybe he knew what was coming.	Mhlawumbi wayesazi ukuba kuza ntoni.
We have to do it.	Kufuneka siyenze.
I'm sure, just like me.	Ndiqinisekile, njengam.
We know more about that now.	Siyazi ngakumbi ngaloo nto ngoku.
Now and then.	Ngoku nangoko.
He wanted nothing.	Wayengafuni nto.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokwenene akunjalo.
He had to say something.	Kwafuneka athethe into.
when there is time.	xa kukho ixesha.
He checked the time.	Wajonga ixesha.
Knowing that is a must.	Ukwazi ukuba kufuneka.
You know the way.	Uyayazi indlela.
I'm not really sure.	Andiqinisekanga ngenene.
In everything.	Kuyo yonke into.
You obviously feel bad about this.	Kucacile ukuba uziva kakubi ngale nto.
I want to go to him.	Ndifuna ukuya kuye.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi nokuba uphi na.
He will come to it soon.	Uza kuza kuyo kungekudala.
At last.	Ekugqibeleni.
So very true.	Ngoko yinyani kakhulu.
I had to go to it.	Kwafuneka ndiye kuyo.
This is it.	Nguye lo.
You need to know what it is.	Kufuneka uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
I had no idea what it was.	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni.
Maybe he was thinking about that.	Mhlawumbi wayecinga ngaloo nto.
Whatever.	Nokuba yintoni na.
Obviously you like it.	Kucacile ukuba uyayithanda.
He looked bad, but not my way.	Wajonga kakubi, kodwa hayi indlela yam.
But he can't.	Kodwa akakwazi.
I am well aware of that.	Ndiyazi kakuhle loo nto.
He wanted to leave, but he could not.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, kodwa akazange akwazi.
More, more to me.	Ngakumbi, ngakumbi kum.
But he could not get to her.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuya kuye.
He has to act fast.	Umele enze ngokukhawuleza.
You want to talk to me, you don't show up here.	Ufuna ukuthetha nam, awubonakali apha.
I know who this is.	Ndiyamazi ukuba ngubani lo.
No one knew anything.	Akukho mntu wayesazi nto.
There is no meaning.	Akukho kuthetha.
In spite.	Ngaphandle.
I need help.	Ndicela uncedo.
But he would like one.	Kodwa angathanda enye.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
I didn't, I never thought he would.	Andizange, andizange ndicinge ukuba uya kuba njalo.
He checked the time.	Wajonga ixesha.
He did not know exactly why.	Wayengazi ncam ukuba kutheni.
I can't swim.	Andikwazi ukuqubha.
I'm pretty sure nothing.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akukho nto.
He has to make a decision.	Kufuneka enze isigqibo.
I hope you have understood.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uye waqonda.
But it is probably true.	Kodwa mhlawumbi yinyani.
I really want to talk to her.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuthetha naye.
I had to do it.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze.
Suddenly, he thought.	Ngokukhawuleza, wacinga.
He is here with us.	Ulapha kunye nathi.
The way.	Indlela.
To do things, little by little.	Ukwenza izinto, kancinci kancinci.
If not today, tomorrow, soon.	Ukuba akunjalo namhlanje, ngomso, kungekudala.
Everyone knows everyone.	Wonke umntu wazi wonke umntu.
That really happened.	Oko kwenzeka ngokwenene.
Because you know.	Kuba uyazi.
He never did that.	Akazange akwenze oko.
Not to him.	Hayi kuye.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
Or us, maybe.	Okanye nathi, mhlawumbi.
He is.	Nguye.
This is really difficult.	Oku kunzima ngokwenene.
Living with him.	Ukuhlala naye.
If you want to do that, fine.	Ukuba ufuna ukwenza oko, kulungile.
Travel if possible.	Ukuhamba ukuba kunokwenzeka.
There is a house	Kukho indlu
Not a bit of it.	Hayi kancinci kuyo.
He thought so.	Wacinga njalo.
This is true.	Le yinyani.
Do you want to learn more ???.	Ngaba ufuna ukufunda ngakumbi ???.
To be better.	Ukuba ngcono.
I will do just that.	Ndiya kwenza kanye loo nto.
I am very happy.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu.
And he abode there.	Wahlala ke apho.
He had to talk to her.	Kwafuneka athethe naye.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze into entsha ngokupheleleyo.
I had to go there.	Kwafuneka ndiye apho.
But only later.	Kodwa kuphela kamva.
You will probably have to.	Mhlawumbi kuya kufuneka.
Oh no, no way.	Hayi njani, akukho ndlela.
In the end it will be so.	Ekugqibeleni kuya kuba njalo.
Far from anything.	Kude nantoni na.
I don't really know anything about it.	Andazi nto ngayo ngenene.
Very, very bad.	Kakhulu, kakubi kakhulu.
I did not know then.	Ndandingazi ngoko.
Nobody says that.	Akukho mntu uthetha loo nto.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngaloo nto.
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.
I know that is not the case.	Ndiyazi ukuba akunjalo.
He agreed to talk to me.	Wavuma ukuthetha nam.
That's what he wants more.	Nantso into efuna ngakumbi.
He did just that.	Wenza kanye loo nto.
There is plenty of time.	Kukho ixesha elininzi.
Yes, this is it.	Ewe, yiyo le.
He didn't really want to talk about it.	Wayengafuni nyani ukuthetha ngayo.
One too.	Enye kakhulu.
He was not there yet.	Wayengekho okwangoku.
Because.	Kuba.
Everyone said yes.	Wonke umntu wathi ewe.
You just have to do it.	Kufuneka uyenze nje.
But it will be.	Kodwa kuya kuba njalo.
He wants to stay.	Ufuna ukuhlala.
Do you think we should go there?	Ucinga ukuba kufuneka siye apho?
But not that.	Kodwa hayi loo nto.
Or do you think that you did?	Okanye ucinga ukuba wenza njalo.
Or in it.	Okanye kuyo.
What are you doing tonight?	Ingaba wenza ntoni namhlanje ebusuku?
Maybe he also didn't know that.	Mhlawumbi naye wayengazi ukuba.
What have you done.	Ingaba wenze ntoni.
That's what happened here.	Nantso into eyenzekayo apha.
He did not want one or the other.	Akazange afune enye okanye enye.
It's so much better.	Kungcono kakhulu.
He just doesn't appear.	Akabonakali nje.
So he did not.	Ngoko akazange.
I want that from you.	Ndifuna oko kuwe.
I don't know anything else.	Andazi enye into.
I know how to do that.	Ndiyayazi indlela yokwenza oko.
But maybe not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo.
It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
Now, why are you here.	Ngoku, ukuba kutheni ulapha.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani.
he asked.	wabuza.
So nothing.	Ngoko ke akukho nto.
He stayed there for a long time.	Wahlala apho ixesha elide.
He never did anything big about it.	Akazange enze into enkulu ngayo.
He didn't think, he just did.	Akazange acinge, wenza nje.
He does not have to.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
I knew nothing.	Ndandingazi nto.
He will speak only once.	Uya kuthetha kube kanye nje.
Everyone wants that.	Wonke umntu ufuna oko.
I do not know how.	Andazi ukuba njani.
He did not want to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba.

He started going to it.	Waqalisa ukuya kuyo.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
He did not want to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba.
Walking at night?	Ukuhamba ebusuku?
If not for me.	Ukuba akunjalo kum.
Or you.	Okanye wena.
There is another.	Kukho enye.
Not before, not now.	Hayi ngaphambili, hayi ngoku.
But clearly this is not possible.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo oku akunakwenzeka.
Now and then.	Ngoku nangoko.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
What does he look like?	Ingaba ubonakala njani?
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
Why me? 	Kutheni mna?
he thought.	wacinga.
But you should have known better.	Kodwa bekufanele ukuba uyazi ngcono.
He kept looking.	Wahlala wajonga.
Deep dive drowning.	Wazama wazama wazama.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
There is nothing there.	Akukho nto apho.
I don't think no one did that.	Andiqondi ukuba akukho mntu wenze njalo.
I won't want it any other way.	Andiyi kufuna ngenye indlela.
That's it now.	Yiloo nto ngoku.
I can do all that.	Ndingayenza yonke loo nto.
I don't know what else.	Andazi ukuba yintoni enye.
But she seems to like it.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi uyayithanda.
One thing always.	Into enye rhoqo.
he thought.	wacinga.
he asked.	wabuza.
I just don't want to.	Andifuni nje.
He wanted another one.	Wayefuna enye.
But he wanted to.	Kodwa wayefuna.
Yes, if only.	Ewe, ukuba kuphela.
I never thought it was a big deal.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba yinto enkulu.

He does this regularly.	Wenza oku rhoqo.
Tell me, tell me.	Ndixelele, ndixelele.
It will be easier.	Kuya kuba lula ngakumbi.
He looks bad.	Ukhangeleka embi.

I think he wanted to.	Ndicinga ukuba wayefuna.
As we will now.	Njengoko siza kwenza ngoku.
I don't know how I can do that.	Andazi ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
You have made a decision.	Wenze isigqibo.
A book, perhaps.	Incwadi, mhlawumbi.
Not far from here.	Akukho kude apha.

Maybe you want to talk.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuthetha.

In his own way.	Ngendlela yakhe.
He did not want to tell.	Wayengafuni ukuxelela.
I know him.	Ndiyamazi.
But do nothing.	Kodwa musa ukwenza nto.
He went to it.	Waya kuyo.
Not just you.	Hayi wena wedwa.
There is no place to do anything else.	Akukho ndawo yokwenza enye into.
For me.	Kum nje.
One day, he thought.	Ngenye imini, wacinga.

Do you love money.	Ngaba uyayithanda imali.
Everyone tried to get there.	Wonke umntu wazama ukuya apho.
But no, of course not.	Kodwa hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
He thought this was a good thing.	Wayecinga ukuba le yinto elungileyo.

But it is possible.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka.
He may not go.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba akayi.
Surely that is possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko kunokwenzeka.

As you may know.	Njengoko usenokuba uyazi.
Where he wants to go.	Apho afuna ukuya khona.
When you feel like nothing.	Xa uziva ukuba akukho nto.

Great thing, though.	Into enkulu, nokuba.
Again, play.	Kwakhona, ukudlala.
So, what are you going to do?	Ke, uza kwenza ntoni?
But that is not the case at all.	Kodwa oko akunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
Eventually, it happened.	Ekugqibeleni, kwenzeka.
But he knew too much.	Kodwa wayesazi kakhulu.
But that will not happen.	Kodwa oko akuyi kwenzeka.

You know how to do it now.	Uyazi ukuba ukwenza njani ngoku.

Are you sure you would like to do that?	Ngaba uqinisekile ukuba ungathanda ukwenza oko?

You know it now.	Uyayazi ngoku.
Not now, for sure.	Hayi ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He is doing everything now.	Wenza yonke into ngoku.
Why are you here?	Kutheni ulapha?
I know that and you know it.	Ndiyayazi lonto nawe uyayazi lonto.
It has to be the other way around.	Kufuneka kube ngenye indlela.
Learning to live with me will be difficult.	Ukufunda ukuhlala nam kuya kuba nzima.
Thus.	Ngaloo ndlela.
No matter how much he wanted it.	Nokuba wayefuna kangakanani na.
He tried another approach.	Wazama enye indlela.
I want to tell you about it.	Ndifuna ukuxelela ngayo.
Not now you are here.	Hayi ngoku ulapha.
This is you.	Nguwe lo.

Not at all.	Akunjalo kwaphela.
Nothing but.	Akukho nto kodwa.

There is something wrong with all of this.	Kukho into embi ngayo yonke le nto.
Talk about it.	Ukuthetha ngayo.
Something new is needed.	Kufuneka into entsha.
That's all.	Yonke loo nto.
He will be here.	Uzakuba lapha.
I didn't really want to know.	Ndandingafuni nyani ukwazi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I didn’t think it was just a thing.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba yinto nje.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
There is nothing here for him.	Akukho nto apha kuye.
Not so much here, though.	Hayi kakhulu apha, kodwa.
Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.
But you should know.	Kodwa kufuneka uyazi.
I don't know why exactly.	Andazi ukuba kutheni kanye.

I want to do a lot of things.	Ndifuna ukwenza izinto ezininzi.
He tried again, but failed.	Wazama kwakhona, kodwa akazange aphumelele.
He may not even know you.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba naye akazi ngawe.
I do not know.	Andazi.
I want money.	Ndifuna imali.
I can't stay.	Andikwazi ukuhlala.
Anything.	Nantoni na.

I didn't, no.	Andizange, hayi.
This person is a person.	Lo mntu ngumntu.
One or the other.	Enye okanye enye.
He did not know what he was doing.	Wayengazi ukuba wenza ntoni.
Yeah, everything.	Ewe, yonke into.
But, one day, you go too far.	Kodwa, ngenye imini, uya kude kakhulu.
You do not want to do this.	Awufuni ukwenza oku.

No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
No, no, not me.	Hayi, hayi, hayi mna.

I want you to stay here.	Ndifuna uhlala apha.
He knows many things.	Wazi izinto ezininzi.
He is not here.	Akakho apha.

That's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu leyo.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Ndiqinisekile uyayazi ukuba yintoni leyo.
You need to know this.	Kufuneka uyazi oku.
Ok then.	Kulungile ke.
If you want to go, you will do the same.	Ukuba ufuna ukuhamba, uya kuyenza loo nto nawe.
In my work.	Emsebenzini wam.
Now he knew what this was all about.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba yintoni le nto.
It really was necessary.	Kwafuneka ngokwenene.
I think he can do it.	Ndicinga ukuba angayenza.
Apparently not.	Kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
He does anything.	Wenza nantoni na.
In fact, this is exactly what happened.	Ngokwenene, oku kwenzeka kanye.
I can't seem to make that happen.	Andikwazi kubonakala ngathi yenzeke loo nto.

I know what he wants.	Ndiyayazi into ayifunayo.
I doubt it though.	Ndiyathandabuza kodwa.
What to do?	Ukwenza ntoni?
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
All right.	Kulungile.
It's hard to say.	Kunzima ukuthetha.
I don't understand what the problem is.	Andiqondi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
This, perhaps, is clear.	Oku, mhlawumbi, kucacile.
Yes, it is not easy.	Ewe, akukho lula.
He is.	Nguye.
What's the matter.	Yintoni ingxaki.
But he did not appear there.	Kodwa akazange abonakale apho.

I do not go to school.	Andiyi esikolweni.
Getting there.	Ukuya apho.
Just my thing.	Into yam nje.
I'm glad you're here today.	Ndiyavuya ulapha namhlanje.

Therefore	Ngoko ke
That's him.	Nguye lowo.
But it's okay.	Kodwa kulungile.
Don't buy.	Musa ukuthenga.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
No one knew much about it.	Akukho mntu wayesazi kakhulu ngayo.
Because that will happen.	Kuba kuya kwenzeka loo nto.
I made money.	Ndenze imali.
We'll just stay here.	Siza kuhlala nje apha.
Just having it.	Ukuba nayo nje.
It's me.	Ndim.

It can be difficult, can it?	Kunokuba nzima, akunjalo?
I'm happy though.	Ndiyavuya kodwa.
There are many.	Kukho ezininzi.
At the hospital.	Esibhedlele.
He wanted a job.	Wayefuna umsebenzi.
If it is you.	Ukuba nguye wena.
I wonder what exactly this is.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba yintoni kanye kanye le nto.
But he did not say anything.	Kodwa akazange athethe nto.
I'm going to have to do something.	Kuya kufuneka ndenze into.
I know a beautiful place.	Ndiyayazi indawo entle.
It's a long time.	Lixesha elide.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi.

But now we know why.	Kodwa ngoku siyazi ukuba kutheni.
Tomorrow, for sure, tomorrow.	Ngomso, ngokuqinisekileyo, ngomso.
But it is, probably.	Kodwa yinto, mhlawumbi.
He should go to prison.	Ufanele ukuya entolongweni.
You don't want anything to happen.	Awufuni kwenzeke nantoni na.
Sorry to say that.	Uxolo ukuthetha oko.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
This requires a decision.	Oku kufuna isigqibo.
What's happening.	Kwenzeka ntoni.
It's too far to walk.	Kude kakhulu ukuhamba.
That would be a very big deal.	Oko kuya kuba yinto enkulu kakhulu.
I told him there was no way.	Ndamxelela ukuba akukho ndlela.
But no one.	Kodwa akukho mntu.
I will definitely do that again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
He is no better.	Akakho ngcono.
I can do it if you want.	Ndingayenza ukuba uyafuna.
Is that true.	Ngaba yinyani leyo.
I can't believe you think so.	Andikholelwa ukuba ucinga njalo.
Maybe me too.	Mhlawumbi nam.
I can't really speak.	Andikwazi ngokwenene ukuthetha.
He lives alone.	Uhlala yedwa.
It is impossible to.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba.
That's what happened.	Yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
I do not understand what this is.	Andiqondi ukuba yintoni le.

I do not like to talk.	Andikuthandi ukuthetha.
That's how bad it is.	Nantso indlela embi ngayo.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
Not really, no.	Hayi ngokwenene, hayi.
If nothing, nothing.	Ukuba akukho nto, akukho nto.
Yes you know.	Ewe uyazi.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
He could not say anything else.	Akazange akwazi ukuthetha enye into.
This seems good to me.	Oku kubonakala kulungile kum.
Or I should have.	Okanye bekufanele ndenze.
I can't believe it.	Andikholelwa ukuba yiyo.
He thought it was him.	Wayecinga ukuba nguye.
Even if you feel you have to.	Nokuba uziva kufuneka.
Or whatever, really.	Okanye nantoni na, ngokwenene.
Is that you? 	Ingaba nguwe?
Certainly not for me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi kum.
I want to win.	Ndifuna ukuphumelela.
I do not really know.	Andazi ngenene.
At last.	Ekugqibeleni.
When this is not the case, it is not.	Xa oku akunjalo, akunjalo.
Tell me this.	Ndixelele oku.
Not me, but with him.	Hayi nam, kodwa kunye naye.
Not here.	Hayi apha.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
Nice to see you again.	Ndiyavuya ukubona kwakhona.
He thought it was him.	Wayecinga ukuba nguye.
Well maybe now.	Kulungile mhlawumbi ngoku.
One way.	Enye indlela.
Not my truth.	Hayi inyani yam.
I think it's good for anyone.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile kuye nabani na.
It is difficult to know how you feel.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuba uziva njani.
But he always lives alone.	Kodwa uhlala uhlala yedwa.
I know very well.	Ndiyazi kakhulu.
But one does not want to.	Kodwa umntu akafuni.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But you know it already.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba sele.
He has apologized.	Uye wacela uxolo.
You want to succeed.	Ufuna ukuphumelela.
But maybe there is another way to come.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kukho enye indlela ezayo.
A little bit.	Kancinci.
Yes, that's me.	Ewe ndim lowo.
It just will be.	Kuya kuba nje.
But no, no.	Kodwa hayi, akukho.
You know very well.	Wazi kakhulu.
So no one is going to do it.	Ngoko akukho mntu uya kuyenza.
She would like to know what happened to me.	Angathanda ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kum.
But everything else, too.	Kodwa yonke enye into, nayo.
But he did.	Kodwa uyenzile.
No problem with that.	Akukho ngxaki ngaloo nto.
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka.
Now it is not.	Ngoku akunjalo.
He certainly did not.	Ngenene akazange.
That is definitely possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngokuqinisekileyo.
But he stayed.	Kodwa wahlala.
I thought you knew.	Bendicinga ukuba uyazi.
I know now.	Ndiyazi ngoku.
Anyone can do it.	Nabani na angayenza.
I will be here, whatever happens.	Ndiza kuba lapha, nantoni na eyenzekayo.
Nobody goes there.	Akukho mntu uya apho.
No one is there.	Akukho mntu apho.
Maybe there is.	Mhlawumbi kukho.
I feel things.	Ndiziva izinto.
It seems to be everywhere now.	Kubonakala ngathi kuyo yonke indawo ngoku.
If possible.	Ukuba kunokwenzeka.
'work'.	' umsebenzi'.
But then something else.	Kodwa enye into ke.
Again, it is not.	Kwakhona, akunjalo.
So very, very good.	Ngoko kakhulu, kulungile kakhulu.
Sorry.	Uxolo.
I know nothing about you.	Andazi nto ngawe.
This may be good for you.	Oku kunokuba kulungile kuwe.
No problem there.	Akukho ngxaki apho.
He needs help.	Ufuna uncedo.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
He sat down quickly.	Wahlala phantsi ngokukhawuleza.
This is mine though.	Le yam kodwa.
His car, no.	Imoto yakhe, hayi.
He made peace.	Wenza uxolo.
But, of course, he had to leave.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, kwafuneka ahambe.
He can't walk.	Akakwazi ukuhamba.
Because we will all be here.	Kuba sonke siza kuba lapha.
Do you feel it now?	Ngaba uziva ngoku?
He'll only talk to me, for now.	Uya kuthetha nam kuphela, okwangoku.
There is not much in it.	Akukho nto ingako kuyo.
I do not like swimming.	Andikuthandi ukuqubha.
I hope you are doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza kakuhle.
For now.	Okwangoku.
I need to talk to you.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe.
That means you are human.	Oko kuthetha ukuba ungumntu.
What are you trying to find.	Uzama ukufumana ntoni.
But it is probably not as difficult as it seems.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akukho nzima njengoko kubonakala.
I'm happy with it, for sure.	Ndiyavuya ngayo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I'm going where we're going.	Ndiya apho siya khona.
He started walking.	Waqalisa ukuhamba.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I will do it.	Ndiza kuyenza.
This is clearly not the case.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
I want to be in this.	Ndifuna ukuba kule nto.
There is no way, no way.	Akukho ndlela, akukho ndlela.
He would come to her, at last.	Wayeza kuza kuye, ekugqibeleni.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
That's the thing.	Nantso ke into.
Something else is happening here.	Kukho enye into eyenzekayo apha.
Really, there is nothing to it.	Ngokwenene, akukho nto kuyo.
This is a bad thing.	Yinto embi le.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
Nobody told me that.	Akukho mntu wandixelela loo nto.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
Nobody does anything.	Akukho mntu wenza nto.
Maybe someone else did.	Mhlawumbi omnye umntu wenze njalo.
As required.	Njengoko kufuneka.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
But something happened.	Kodwa ke kukho into eyenzekayo.
Great.	Kakhulu.
I thought it was you.	Bendicinga ukuba nguwe.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
We have to go there.	Kufuneka siye apho.
.	.
I hope you do too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe wenza njalo.
He really wanted to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngokwenene.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Now there is none.	Ngoku akukho.
I'll talk to you about it.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe ngayo.
He did this now.	Oku wakwenza ngoku.
He will come up with this.	Uya kuza ngale nto.
Finally he said.	Ekugqibeleni wathi.
I did not want to.	Ndandingafuni.
Again, you know.	Kwakhona, uyazi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Certainly not me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi mna.
Probably no one knew.	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu wayesazi.
Clearly, it has.	Ngokucacileyo, kuye kwenzeka.
Finally, something wonderful happened!	Ekugqibeleni, kukho into entle eyenzekayo!
But it is possible.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka.
I think that's a good thing to do.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
I would love to have it.	Ndingathanda ukuba nayo.
I'm not sure how you did that.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uyenzile njani loo nto.
He wanted something else, he wanted something else.	Wayefuna enye into, efuna enye into.
Yes, for a long time.	Ewe, ixesha elide.
Now we will do just that.	Ngoku siza kwenza njalo.
Only this.	Kuphela oku.
he asked.	wabuza.
You will do well.	Uya kwenza kakuhle.
He will do it.	Uya kwenza.
There for a long time.	Apho ixesha elide.
I try very hard.	Ndizama kakhulu.
Long ago now.	Kudala ngoku.
If he will do anything good for you.	Ukuba uya kwenza nantoni na elungileyo kuwe.
I can't say why.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba kutheni.
No it isn't.	Hayi akunjalo.
I can't win.	Andikwazi ukuphumelela.
Maybe he didn't really want to know.	Mhlawumbi wayengafuni ngokwenene ukwazi.
We should have done better.	Bekufanele ukuba senze ngcono.
I just don't know what it is.	Andazi nje ukuba yintoni.
Is it possible to be late?	Ngaba ukuhamba ixesha kunokwenzeka?
One way or another.	Enye indlela okanye enye.
No one knows much about it.	Akukho mntu wazi kakhulu ngayo.
He wanted to.	Wayefuna.
So there are a lot of things.	Ngoko kukho izinto ezininzi.
Well, there is work, too.	Ewe, kukho umsebenzi, kwakhona.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto kanye.
You know it.	Uyayazi.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazange.
Not 'immediately.	Hayi' ngokukhawuleza.
Why he went with her, he didn't know.	Kwakutheni ukuze ahambe nayo, wayengazi.
He knows he is not alone.	Uyazi ukuba ayinguye yedwa.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto kanye.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Now there is a problem.	Ngoku kukho ingxaki.
Doing my job.	Ukwenza umsebenzi wam.
That's what this place really is.	Yiloo nto le ndawo ngokwenene.
You will get better, you will get better.	Uya kuba ngcono, uya kuba njalo.
Really great thing.	Into enkulu ngokwenene.
There is another.	Kukho enye.
I have to make a decision.	Kufuneka ndenze isigqibo.
Because he did not.	Kuba akazange.
But it is a thing.	Kodwa yinto.
He certainly was not there before.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengekho ngaphambili.
There is just this.	Kukho nje oku.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
I never thought of it.	Andizange ndicinge nto ngayo.
I'm not going anywhere now.	Andiyi ndawo ngoku.
Where should we go today?	Kufuneka siye phi namhlanje?
Once.	Kanye.
We know how that happened.	Siyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
Certainly.	Ngokuqinisekileyo.
He never told the truth.	Zange athethe inyani.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
As he did not want to talk.	Njengoko wayengafuni ukuthetha.
He did not appear.	Akazange abonakale.
But not now, not really.	Kodwa hayi ngoku, akunjalo.
Now, time is now.	Ngoku, ixesha ngoku.
Or, you know, just in time.	Okanye, uyazi, kwangethuba.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
Everyone wants a car today!	Wonke umntu ufuna imoto namhlanje!
One too much.	Enye eninzi kakhulu.
You will want to go.	Uya kufuna ukuhamba.
I have to tell her.	Kufuneka ndimxelele.
Too long.	Ixesha elide kakhulu.
He never talked about it.	Zange athethe ngayo.
The way you do it.	Indlela owenza ngayo.
I think that's true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani.
Yeah, nothing, really.	Ewe, akukho nto, ngokwenene.
I think there is one thing.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into enye.
Nothing always.	Akukho nto rhoqo.
But there is more to it than that.	Kodwa kukho enye into apho.
It's hard to say.	Kunzima ukuthetha.
Not today though.	Hayi namhlanje kodwa.
Now he knew what it was.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba yintoni na.
I would love to do that again.	Ndingathanda ukuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
Yes, that makes it possible.	Ewe, oko kuyenza ukuba yenzeke.
So, what are you going to do tonight?	Ke, uza kwenza ntoni ngokuhlwanje?
This will cost money.	Oku kuya kufuna imali.
I know it well.	Ndiyazi kakuhle.
He tried again, but failed.	Wazama kwakhona, kodwa akazange aphumelele.
He doesn't want anyone, you know.	Akafuni nabani na, uyazi.
It’s absolutely everything.	Yinto yonke into ngokupheleleyo.
He apologized for it.	Wacela uxolo ngayo.
Or maybe not.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I don't like it very much.	Andiyithandi ncam.
Something or someone.	Into okanye umntu.
I knew better.	Ndandisazi ngcono.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
You can be a man later.	Unokuba yindoda kamva.
Everyone wants it all.	Wonke umntu ufuna yonke loo nto.
Or, really, anyone.	Okanye, ngokwenene, nabani na.
He wanted to do everything.	Wayefuna ukwenza yonke into.
But in it !!.	Kodwa kuyo!!.
I knew it would be so.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
But that's it.	Kodwa loo nto.
So, no problem.	Ngoko, akukho ngxaki.
I think we did.	Ndicinga ukuba senze njalo.
I need to talk to him.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye.
It should have been now.	Bekufanele kube ngoku.
He probably did not know anyone there.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi mntu apho.
He wanted money.	Wayefuna imali.
I want you to know that.	Ndifuna uyazi loo nto.
You know it won't be easy.	Uyazi ukuba akuyi kuba lula.
He started walking.	Waqalisa ukuhamba.
This is possible, even though it will not be easy.	Oku kunokwenzeka, nokuba akuyi kuba lula.
I think this is it.	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo le.
I told him he wanted to go.	Ndamxelela ukuba uyafuna ukuhamba.
With him, obviously.	Naye, ngokucacileyo.
Well, not too much.	Kulungile, hayi kakhulu.
I don't want.	Andifuni.
That's what you need to do.	Nantso ke into ekufuneka uyenzile.
That is exactly what you need to do.	Yiloo nto kanye ekufuneka uyenzile.
She is going to school.	Uza kuya esikolweni.
Only you.	Nguwe kuphela.
But not here or now.	Kodwa hayi apha okanye ngoku.
It's a very new thing.	Yinto entsha kakhulu.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo nje.
I know that for sure.	Ndiyayazi loo nto ngokuqinisekileyo.
He looked at me.	Wajonga kum.
But, you know?	Kodwa, uyazi?
I'm sure this is it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiyo le.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akasayi kuba njalo.
If it seems, yes.	Ukuba kubonakala, ewe.
What you want.	Oko ufuna.
I told her the truth.	Ndamxelela inyani.
Maybe he will.	Mhlawumbi uya kwenza njalo.
He did not leave.	Akazange ahambe.
He said he liked it very much.	Wathi uyayithanda kakhulu.
We are going to be tough. 	Siza kuba nzima. 
He cannot see things clearly.	Akakwazi ukubona izinto kakuhle.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
He told me no.	Wandixelela ukuba hayi.
He wanted to be with her.	Wayefuna kunye naye.
It will be so here.	Kuya kuba njalo apha.
I don't like that.	andiyithandi loo nto.
I have to do something.	Kufuneka ndenze into.
I would like to buy a house.	Ndingathanda ukuthenga indlu.
What a fuck.	Yintoni loo nto.
But no, you know, not always.	Kodwa hayi, uyazi, hayi rhoqo.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
You are the only one now.	Nguwe kuphela ngoku.
I want you to tell me everything.	Ndifuna undixelele yonke into.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu.
But, for now.	Kodwa, okwangoku.
Or something like that.	Okanye into enjalo.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuthetha ngayo.
But when you think about it, it's really big.	Kodwa xa ucinga ngayo, yinto enkulu ngokwenene.
But you know.	Kodwa uyazi.
What happens, it happens.	Kwenzeka ntoni, kwenzeka.
Maybe he didn't know anything.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi nto.
I don't know how, but he is.	Andazi ukuba njani, kodwa nguye.
He did just that.	Wenza ngaloo nto.
Too much trouble.	Ingxaki eninzi kakhulu.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
Not that this makes it easy.	Akunjalo ukuba oku kwenza kube lula.
But you do not want to.	Kodwa awufuni.
Well done!	Wenze kakuhle!
Not for long.	Hayi ixesha elide.
This is a big deal.	Yinto enkulu le.
What are we going to do about this?	Siza kwenza ntoni ngale nto?
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
Do not rush.	Musa ukwenza ngokukhawuleza.
He apologized and sat down.	Wacela uxolo wahlala phantsi.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
Or he will do it.	Okanye uya kwenza kuyo.
He didn't say much to me.	Khange athethe kakhulu kum.
He wanted one but thought better of it.	Wayefuna enye kodwa wacinga ngcono ngayo.
There is such a place.	Kukho indawo enjalo.
But no one knew he had to do anything about it.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba enze nantoni na ngaloo nto.
Presence to me.	Ukuba khona kum.
That's what everybody does here.	Nantso into eyenziwa ngumntu wonke apha.
He went there.	Waya apho.
But tell me this.	Kodwa ndixelele oku.
I don't really want to know.	Andifuni nyani ukwazi.
He started talking.	Waqalisa ukuthetha.
No one really knows what happened.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokwenene ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
That makes for good reading.	Oko kwenza ukufunda kakuhle.
You are only here this week.	Ulapha kuphela kule veki.
It's me.	Ndim.
Don't go too far.	Musa ukuya kude.
He certainly would.	Ngokuqinisekileyo angathanda.
That's you.	Nguwe lowo.
He stayed there.	Wahlala apho.
I'd like to say something here.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha into apha.
So he did.	Ngoko uyenzile.
Everyone wants to succeed.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuphumelela.
You know what it will be like.	Uyazi ukuba kuya kuba njani oko.
You look good, too.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle, nawe.
He will do nothing.	Akayi kwenza nto.
Not just this.	Hayi nje le.
Everyone talks about it.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngayo.
He did not speak for long.	Khange athethe ixesha elide.
Are you sure you want to do that?	Uqinisekile ukuba uyafuna ukuyenza loo nto?
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni.
It will not be difficult.	Akuyi kuba nzima.
I want to talk to her.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye.
We have to do the work.	Kufuneka senze umsebenzi.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
He only wanted to go home.	Wayefuna ukuya ekhaya kuphela.
On the floor.	Phantsi.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Asiyonto embi le.
I want her to leave.	Ndifuna ahambe.
He once said.	Wakhe wathi.
Now he knew why.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
Now then.	Ngoku ke.
It just seems like you did it somewhere.	Kuphela kubonakala ngathi wenze enye indawo.
Not yet.	Hayi ngoku.
Yeah, that's it.	Ewe, yiloo nto.
I did not want to leave.	Ndandingafuni ukuhamba.
I did not go.	Khange ndiye.
Maybe for now.	Mhlawumbi okwangoku.
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze loo nto.
He said he wanted to talk.	Wathi ufuna ukuthetha.
Really, much better in every way.	Ngokwenene, ngcono kakhulu ngayo yonke indlela.
Just do it because.	Ukwenza nje kuba.
I don't think he knows either.	Andiqondi ukuba naye uyazi.
That's it.	Yiyo loo nto.
A long time ago, really.	Kudala, ngokwenene.
He looked, he looked.	Wajonga, wajonga.
He knew her.	Wayesazi kuye.
But no one else.	Kodwa akakho omnye umntu.
I know it will be so.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
.	.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
No one deserves to buy this.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukuthenga oku.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
He went too far.	Waya kude kakhulu.
But nothing.	Kodwa akukho nto.
He knew he had to leave immediately.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
He wanted, yes.	Wayefuna, ewe.
There is no problem at all in this.	Akukho ngxaki kwaphela kule nto.
I want money fast.	Ndifuna imali ngokukhawuleza.
Now tell me more.	Ngoku ndixelele ngakumbi.
Well, obviously not for me.	Ewe, ngokucacileyo hayi kum.
But that is not necessary.	Kodwa oko akuyomfuneko.
He certainly will.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuba njalo.
Not everything.	Hayi yonke into.
Or it will seem to us.	Okanye kuya kubonakala ngathi.
It is clear why.	Kucacile ukuba kutheni.
You will have it tomorrow.	Uzakuba nayo ngomso.
But we will talk.	Kodwa siza kuthetha.
He can't swim.	Akakwazi ukuqubha.
Maybe you want to sit down.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuhlala phantsi.
It's hard to make money.	Kunzima ukwenza imali.
I would not do such a thing.	Andiyi kuyenza into enjalo.
You want to know more.	Ufuna ukwazi ngakumbi.
It is better sooner than later.	Kungcono ngokukhawuleza kunokuba kamva.
I know everyone is telling you this, but it really has to happen.	Ndiyazi ukuba wonke umntu ukuxelela oku, kodwa kufuneka yenzeke ngokwenene.
Yeah, one thing really.	Ewe, into enye ngokwenene.
That sounds good.	Oko kubonakala kulungile.
He'll come here a little bit.	Uza kuza apha kancinci.
He lives here.	Uhlala apha.
This is something new.	Le yinto entsha.
He knows it too.	Naye uyayazi.
I'm sure it could be.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kunokuba njalo.
He knew now what was going to happen.	Wayesazi ngoku ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Yeah, whatever that is.	Ewe, nokuba yintoni na loo nto.
Eventually, it happened.	Ekugqibeleni, kwenzeka.
Don't do it.	Musa ukuyenza.
But it is a thing.	Kodwa yinto.
It is impossible to make a decision.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza isigqibo.
He said nothing.	Zange athethe nto.
He did not appear for long.	Akazange abonakale ixesha elide.
he asked.	wabuza.
He agreed to go.	Wavuma ukuhamba.
No!.	Hayi!.
Where are you.	Uphi.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngenene.
That may not be the case.	Oko kusenokwenzeka ukuba akukho.
But then.	Kodwa ke ngoko.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
I don't want.	Andifuni.
But not for me.	Kodwa hayi kum.
he asked.	wabuza.
This means that.	Oku kuthetha ukuba.
Probably nothing.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto.
I could not.	khange ndikwazi.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
It's just a good thing to do.	Yinto nje elungileyo ukuyenza.
Not new.	Hayi entsha.
That's the big thing.	Nantso ke into enkulu.
Yes you know.	Ewe uyazi.
I do not know.	Andazi.
I will talk to him.	Ndiza kuthetha naye.
If he doesn't know, he won't know.	Ukuba akazi, akayi kukwazi.
It happens all the time.	Kwenzeka rhoqo.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi kuyenza le nto.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
You have to do everything.	Kufuneka wenze yonke into.
I know how to do it.	Ndiyayazi indlela yokwenza.
If not, you stay there.	Ukuba akunjalo, uhlala apho.
I'm glad you like.	Ndiyavuya ungathanda.
I will not.	Andiyi.
So that's fine.	Ngoko ke kulungile.
I do not understand how.	Andiqondi ukuba njani.
It seems to be difficult.	Ubonakala ukuba kunzima.
I never knew that.	Andizange ndiyazi loo nto.
Is that true?	Ngaba yinyani leyo?
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
I do not want her to leave.	Andifuni ahambe.
But really.	Kodwa ngokwenene.
I don't think anyone deserves it.	Andiqondi ukuba umntu ufanele.
It is very difficult to go this way.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuhamba ngale ndlela.
Or something like that.	Okanye into enjalo.
He will have to make a decision.	Kuya kufuneka enze isigqibo.
But soon, because he knew what it was.	Kodwa kungekudala, kuba wayesazi ukuba yintoni na.
That's the problem here.	Nantso ke ingxaki apha.
We did the right thing.	Senze into elungileyo.
He needed time alone to think.	Wayefuna ixesha lokuba yedwa ukuze acinge.
That is not a bad thing at all.	Asiyonto embi kwaphela leyo.
So do i.	Nam.
But only if you want to.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba ufuna.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
I do not want to go.	Andifuni ukuhamba.
This is difficult.	Oku kunzima.
That's your day.	Nantso imini yakho.
You have to be that way too.	Kufuneka ube njalo nawe.

It's been a long time.	Kudala ixesha elide.
Not in this case.	Hayi kule nto.
He lives here.	Uhlala apha.
You told me something.	Undixelele into.
You probably know.	Mhlawumbi uyazi.
Really, really fast.	Ngokwenene, ngokukhawuleza ngokwenene.
Where we need to go.	Apho kufuneka siye khona.
I think you will be able to do it again.	Ndicinga ukuba uya kukwazi kwakhona.
Whatever happens.	Nantoni na eyenzekayo.
You like it.	Uyayithanda.

But, it is not.	Kodwa, akunjalo.
There it is!	Nantso ke!
He wants to talk.	Ufuna ukuthetha.
He told me that.	Wandixelela ukuba.
But where you go.	Kodwa apho uya khona.
He has to leave immediately.	Kufuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
I need to talk to him.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye.
But he felt it.	Kodwa waziva.
I think everyone knows that.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
But that is a good thing.	Kodwa yinto entle leyo.
He just wants to talk.	Ufuna nje ukuthetha.
Not very well.	Hayi kakuhle.
Or whatever.	Okanye nokuba yintoni na.
He has done it now.	Uyenzile ke ngoku.
But maybe not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Time.	Ixesha.
But only time.	Kodwa kuphela ixesha.
He lives alone here.	Uhlala wedwa apha.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Maybe you should.	Mhlawumbi ufanele.
Maybe you will.	Mhlawumbi uya kukwazi.
Now, he knew.	Ngoku, wayesazi.
Maybe yes, maybe not.	Mhlawumbi ewe, mhlawumbi hayi.
I'm not sure what happened to you.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuwe.
No, he had to stay.	Hayi, kwafuneka ahlale.
Not too long ago.	Kungekudala kakhulu.
One of them.	Omnye waba.
Just again.	Kwakhona nje.
Now he looked down.	Ngoku wajonga phantsi.
If you need help.	Ukuba ufuna uncedo.
I'm not sure what else you need to do here.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni enye ekufuneka uyenzile apha.
I can not speak.	Andikwazi ukuthetha.

What a problem no.	Yintoni ingxaki akukho.
Probably not time or place.	Mhlawumbi hayi ixesha okanye indawo.

Certainly you should.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufanele ukuba.
There is no way.	Akukho ndlela.
But no one knew what to do with it.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba enze ntoni ngayo.

When do you want this?	Ufuna nini lento?
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
You probably know that.	Mhlawumbi uyayazi loo nto.
But man.	Kodwa umntu.
I will not go to him.	Andiyi kuye.
I '.	Mna'.
You may have done it the other way.	Usenokuba wenza ngenye indlela.
Just sitting outside.	Ukuhlala nje ngaphandle.
Or maybe it's you.	Okanye mhlawumbi nguwe.
No sorry, nothing.	Hayi uxolo, akukho nto.
That's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu leyo.
One has to do so.	Umntu kufuneka enze njalo.
I'm going to have to think about it.	Kuza kufuneka ndicinge ngayo.
I hope not, because he speaks well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo, kuba uthetha kakuhle.

But now, no.	Kodwa ngoku, hayi.
To me there is nothing.	Kum akukho nto.

He knew, too.	Wayesazi, naye.
He started talking but did not.	Waqalisa ukuthetha kodwa akazange.
All right, then.	Kulungile, ngoko.

He asked about you.	Wabuza ngawe.
He does things.	Wenza izinto.
I do not want to talk to you.	Andifuni kuthetha nawe.
He did not think.	Akazange acinge.
So for now.	Ngoko okwangoku.
There is no way to do that.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza oko.
he thought.	wacinga.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
You know you want one.	Uyazi ukuba ufuna enye.
But he did not say much.	Kodwa akazange athethe kakhulu.
But this is not immediately the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo ngoko nangoko.
You live here, not here.	Uhlala apha, hayi apha.
Maybe, though, more.	Mhlawumbi, nokuba, ngakumbi.
He did just that.	Wenza kanye loo nto.
Or whatever.	Okanye nokuba yintoni na.
There is a new one.	Kukho entsha.
Well, nothing now.	Ewe, akukho nto ngoku.
We will do this.	Siza kuyenza le nto.
I don't want.	Andifuni.
Now is the time to speak up.	Ngoku lixesha lokuba ndithethe.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga kangako.
I'm sure of that.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto.
No, he understood.	Akunjalo, waqonda.
Now no problem.	Ngoku akukho ngxaki.
Don't do that again.	Musa ukuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
What, what.	Yintoni, yintoni.
But a little bit.	Kodwa kancinci.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
I would like to know.	Ndinqwenela ukwazi.
I think we will.	Ndicinga ukuba siza kwenza njalo.
There is certainly no way.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho ndlela.

Please, no.	Nceda, hayi.
You do not have to do anything.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze nto.
This also looks good.	Oku kwakhona kubonakala kulungile.
Doing is my thing.	Ukwenza yinto yam.
It will be difficult for a long time.	Kuza kuba nzima ixesha elide.
She wanted to go with him.	Wayefuna ukuhamba naye.
Only there is something else.	Kuphela kukho enye into.
It did not last long.	Khange ahlale ixesha elide nyani.
It happened one day.	Kwenzeka ngenye imini.
Very good book.	Incwadi entle kakhulu.

I just want one but.	Ndifuna nje enye kodwa.
Don't just walk away.	Musa nje ukuhamba.
But if he only knew.	Kodwa ukuba wayesazi.
He's just talking.	Uthetha nje.

Maybe he should think again, but he won't.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka acinge kwakhona, kodwa akayi.
Or maybe earlier.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngaphambili.
Is that one.	Ngaba enye leyo.
He needs to look better.	Kufuneka afune ngcono.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
I knew everything.	Ndandisazi yonke into.
Except for one.	Ngaphandle nje omnye.
This is a big deal.	Le yinto enkulu.

But this is the way it is.	Kodwa oku ngendlela.
It is such a thing again.	Yinto enjalo kwakhona.
I did not know.	Bendingazi.

Anything else.	Enye into.
It is more difficult, but not impossible.	Kunzima ngakumbi, kodwa akunakwenzeka.

He wanted a job.	Wayefuna umsebenzi.

It happened to me a lot.	Kwenzeka kum kakhulu.
He wants to talk to you.	Ufuna ukuthetha nawe.
That is really very difficult.	Oko ngenene kunzima kakhulu.
Very little.	Kakhulu kancinci.
It will get better.	Kuya kuba ngcono.
If not then it will be so.	Ukuba akunjalo kuya kuba njalo.
I think that's a very good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entle kakhulu.
I just don't know.	Andazi nje.
Nobody looks like us.	Akukho mntu ubonakala ngathi.
I thought maybe.	Ndandicinga ukuba mhlawumbi.

Totally alone.	Ngokupheleleyo ndedwa.

He's here now.	Ulapha ngoku.
He is a very good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo kakhulu.

Or trying to do it.	Okanye uzama ukwenza.
It's out there though.	Kukho ngaphandle kodwa.
No one else.	Akukho mntu omnye.

You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
Not just today.	Hayi nje namhlanje.

Only it is not easy.	Kuphela akukho lula.
I think here.	Ndicinga apha.
Yes, that means today.	Ewe, oko kuthetha ukuba namhlanje.
But rather.	Kodwa kungcono.
Well, he didn't seem to want much.	Kulungile, akazange abonakale efuna into eninzi.
I do not know how long.	Andazi ukuba kude kube nini.
Or my job.	Okanye umsebenzi wam.
He thought he must be happy.	Wayecinga ukuba umele ukuba uyavuya.
Great.	Enkulu.
But he did not succeed completely.	Kodwa akazange aphumelele ngokupheleleyo.
He makes coffee.	Wenza ikofu.
I would like to help.	Ndingathanda ukunceda.
We don't have to do that here.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba senze njalo apha.
Please tell me it isn't.	Nceda undixelele ukuba akunjalo.
I didn't know that, till now.	Andizange ndiyazi loo nto, kude kube ngoku.

I knew nothing.	Ndandingazi nto.
I don't want him to come.	Andifuni ukuba eze.
I want to go.	Ndifuna ukuhamba.
Here it is to stay.	Nantso apha ukuhlala.
He wanted to stay out.	Wayefuna ukuhlala ngaphandle.
You know, a very good thing.	Uyazi, into entle kakhulu.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Soon he could not.	Kungekudala akazange akwazi.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
Not me but.	Hayi mna kodwa.
I want to be here.	Ndifuna ukuba lapha.
That's a very good thing.	Yinto entle kakhulu.
I'm afraid this is it.	Ndiyoyika ukuba yiyo le.
Once there is a problem.	Kanye xa kukho ingxaki.
But here, there is none.	Kodwa apha, akukho.
But that is not possible.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka.
So, that's fine.	Ngoko, kulungile.
This is good enough.	Oku kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
It will be necessary.	Kuya kufuneka.
Very much.	Kakhulu kakhulu.
He is only human.	Ungumntu kuphela.
This one may be making time.	Lo usenokuba wenza ixesha.
The dog is out.	Inja nje.
We will talk about it tomorrow.	Siza kuthetha ngayo ngomso.

I told her.	Ndamxelela.
Where are we going.	Apho siya khona.
I do not like this method.	Andiyithandi le ndlela.
He did not want to.	Akazange afune.
But we do not have to.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba senze njalo.
He feels like us.	Uziva ngathi.
I know.	Ndiyazi.
If not now, when ?.	Ukuba akunjalo ngoku, nini?.
That happens all the time.	Oko kwenzeka rhoqo.
Tell me what happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
That's it again, he thought.	Nantso kwakhona, wacinga.
This is not possible.	Akunakwenzeka oku.
It is simply not possible.	Akunakwenzeka nje.
Probably, a little bit.	Mhlawumbi, kancinci.
He knows nothing, it seems to us.	Akazi nto, kubonakala ngathi.
But he did not think about it.	Kodwa akazange acinge ngale nto.
But do not say or do anything.	Kodwa musa ukuthetha okanye wenze nantoni na.
I didn't tell him much.	Khange ndimxelele kakhulu.
Have you ever been to this place?	Ngaba ukhe waya kule ndawo?
Or he certainly appeared.	Okanye ngokuqinisekileyo wabonakala.
I did not want to see anyone.	Ndandingafuni ukubona mntu.

Not you.	Hayi nawe.
He thought he knew.	Wayecinga ukuba uyazi.
Not long enough.	Kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
Everyone looked at me to make a decision.	Wonke umntu wajonga kum ukuba enze isigqibo.
It's okay with us.	Kulungile nathi.
Nobody goes there today.	Akukho mntu uya apho namhlanje.
He can't walk well.	Akakwazi ukuhamba kakuhle.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Ndandingazi ukuba kukho into enjalo.
Okay, so it looks okay.	Kulungile, ngoko kubonakala kulungile.

It makes the job very difficult.	Kwenza ukuba umsebenzi ube nzima kakhulu.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.	Ndiqinisekile uzakuba lapha kungekudala.
That's a good thing.	Yinto elungileyo.

You need to know this.	Kufuneka uyazi oku.
Everyone has to do their job.	Wonke umntu kufuneka enze umsebenzi wakhe.
I thought it was okay.	Bendicinga ukuba kulungile.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
Do not overeat.	Musa ukutya kakhulu.
It ended badly, but.	Kwaphela kakubi kakhulu, kodwa.
Or something like that.	Okanye into enjalo.
True or false.	Yinyani okanye akunjalo.
By doing this.	Ngokwenza oku.
It doesn't have to be hard.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube nzima.
What's new.	Yintoni entsha.
You know what happened to me.	Uyayazi into eyenzekayo kum.
I think that's it.	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto.
Here it is again.	Nantso kwakhona.
That would be better.	Oko kuya kuba ngcono.
I hope that is true.	Ndiyathemba ukuba yinyani leyo.
In the end he just did.	Ekugqibeleni wenza nje.
I will stay here.	Ndiya kuhlala apha.
I would like to know what it is.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
I'm just glad to be here.	Ndiyavuya nje ukuba lapha.
But it is impossible.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka.
You will want to.	Uya kufuna.
He checked the time.	Wajonga ixesha.
This will happen.	Oku kuya kwenzeka.
He did not want to go there.	Wayengafuni ukuya apho.
I think you are talking to everyone.	Ndicinga ukuba uthetha naye wonke umntu.
But you do not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba ube njalo.
You have made a decision.	Wenze isigqibo.
It's too far away.	Kude kakhulu kuyo.
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
Sounds good to me.	Kubonakala kulungile kum.
It will have to be easier.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba kube lula ngakumbi.
You do not want to help my work.	Awufuni ukunceda umsebenzi wam.
I do not know him.	Andikwazi naye.
that.	leyo.
This is a very big deal.	Le yinto enkulu kakhulu.
I do not know where it is.	Andazi ukuba iphi.
I hope you know that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayazi loo nto.
So, yes, that's fine.	Ke, ewe, kulungile.
If not.	Ukuba akukho.
A little too hard.	Kancinci kunzima kakhulu.
Well, no, no.	Ewe, akunjalo, hayi.
I really want to talk to you.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuthetha nawe.
But, of course, he never said such a thing.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, akazange athethe into enjalo.
But it's hard, it's very hard.	Kodwa kunzima, kunzima kakhulu.
It really is.	Yinto ngokwenene.
He said he would not be far away.	Wathi akayi kuba kude.
But, then.	Kodwa, ngoko.
That is much better.	Oko kungcono kakhulu.
Good thing.	Into entle.
That could happen, he realized.	Oko kunokwenzeka, waqonda.
he said.	uthe.
He just knew he didn't want to be alone.	Wayesazi nje ukuba akafuni ukuba yedwa.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
I don't even know who she is.	Andazi nokuba ngubani.
Or it should be.	Okanye bekufanele ukuba.
It doesn't have to be this way.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba kube ngoku.
I thought he did.	Ndandicinga ukuba wenze njalo.
Or not at all.	Okanye hayi ngokupheleleyo.
What are they doing?	Ingaba wenza ntoni?
But this is really happening.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
Yes, this is it.	Ewe, yiyo le.
I want to be something.	Ndifuna ukuba yinto.
He looked away.	Wajonga kude.
But in the end he is the man.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni yindoda leyo.
He looked at the place.	Wajonga loo ndawo.
Not yet.	Hayi ngoku.
He has become.	Uye waba.
In fact, it is quite impossible.	Ngokwenene, akunakwenzeka ngokwenene.
This, not so much.	Oku, hayi kakhulu.
Maybe a long time ago.	Mhlawumbi kudala.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
It will be very, very much so.	Kuya kuba kakhulu, kakhulu kakhulu.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
I want you to do it.	Ndifuna uyenze.
But only if you want to.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba ufuna.
No one tried.	Akukho mntu wazama.
Yes it is.	Ewe yiyo.
But.	Kodwa.
I don't want.	Andifuni.
Who is this person?	Ngubani lo mntu?
He will come here.	Uza kuza apha.
He asked if she wanted to go with him.	Wabuza ukuba uyafuna na ukuhamba naye.
oh yeah.	ewe.
Now you are here.	Ngoku ulapha.
He does not want to talk.	Akafuni kuthetha.
This is not necessary.	Oku akuyomfuneko.
This happened, in the end.	Oku kwenzeka, ekugqibeleni.
Not yet, not exactly.	Hayi okwangoku, hayi ncam.
To travel.	Ukuhamba.
I did not want to see.	Ndandingafuni ukubona.
But big money no.	Kodwa imali enkulu hayi.
But the police did.	Kodwa amapolisa enjenjalo.
This will be very difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
he asked.	wabuza.
What should you do?	Kufuneka wenze ntoni?
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
We have to do all the work.	Kufuneka senze wonke umsebenzi.
I did not tell anyone.	Khange ndixelele mntu.
You definitely want a job here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufuna umsebenzi apha.
I want to know something else.	Ndifuna ukwazi enye into.
This will be the case.	Oku kuya kuba njalo.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
You are his person.	Ungumntu wakhe.
He really wants to be with her.	Ufuna ngokwenene ukuba kunye naye.
It was not necessary for him to be with her.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba abe kunye naye.
That's it.	Yiloo nto.
Or you might like to do it.	Okanye ungathanda ukwenza.
Or someone else.	Okanye omnye umntu.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
Well, not really.	Ewe, akunjalo ngokwenene.
Yes, something happened.	Ewe, kukho into eyenzekayo.
What yes it is.	Yintoni ewe yiyo.
I think he did.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze njalo.
I need to know.	Kufuneka ndiyazi.
What's the matter? 	Yintoni ingxaki?
he asked.	wabuza.
It never really happened.	Zange yenzeke ncam.
To me, that would be impossible.	Kum, oko akunakwenzeka.
So, there you are.	Ngoko, nantso.
Or anyone.	Okanye nabani na.
I think you did the right thing.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze into elungileyo.
Fast, fast, fast.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza.
It's hard to tell now.	Kunzima ukuxelela ngoku.
I know he did.	Ndiyazi ukuba wenza njalo.
Don't go there.	Musa ukuya apho.
I do not know how.	Andazi ukuba njani.
Sorry but true.	Uxolo kodwa yinyani.
That's cute.	Oko kulungile.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
Maybe a little bit.	Mhlawumbi kancinci.
You did the right thing.	Wenze into elungileyo.
At last.	Ekugqibeleni.
You know, as you like.	Uyazi, njengoko uthanda.
But today we will do just that.	Kodwa namhlanje siza kwenza kanye loo nto.
Clearly, he does not want much.	Ngokucacileyo, akafuni nto ingako.
No one knows why or how.	Akukho mntu uyazi ukuba kutheni okanye njani.
He doesn't look good.	Akabonakali kakuhle.
Would you like to go with me?	Ungathanda ukuhamba nam?
If not, don't.	Ukuba akunjalo, musa.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
It's new to me.	Yinto entsha kum.
Something terrible happened there.	Kwenzeke into embi apho.
Just something.	Into nje.
You will be able to help.	Uya kukwazi ukunceda.
I don't know what time it is.	Andazi ukuba ngubani ixesha.
He did not comment on the matter.	Akazange athethe ngale nto.
For anything really.	Kuba nantoni na ngokwenene.
I said nothing.	Khange ndithethe nto.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
I could not do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza.
I don't want anything.	Andifuni nto.
I do not want to be alone.	Andifuni ukuba ndedwa.
Again, no problem.	Kwakhona, akukho ngxaki.
Not the police, not the police.	Hayi amapolisa, hayi amapolisa.
I want a job.	Ndifuna umsebenzi.
is that a good thing ???.	yinto entle leyo???.
It was as if he didn't want anything.	Ngathi zange afune nto.
I want to stay.	Ndifuna ukuhlala.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
I would like to know that.	Ndingathanda ukwazi oko.
I know it is possible.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
No, no, no.	Hayi, hayi, hayi.
Or, it seems to us.	Okanye, kubonakala ngathi.
I would like to speak with him today.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha naye namhlanje.
He did this.	Oku wakwenza.
I'm not sure now what happened to it.	Andiqinisekanga ngoku ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kuyo.
Well, that's exactly it.	Ewe, kanye loo nto.
Good way.	Indlela elungileyo.
I do not know.	Andazi.
Not exactly.	Akukho ncam.
Not so much, really.	Hayi kakhulu, ngokwenene.
I was just thinking.	Bendicinga nje.
I think so.	Ndicinga ukuba .
This is a good thing.	Yinto entle le.
There is no way to make money.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza imali.
Yeah, a little bit of talking.	Ewe, kancinci ukuthetha kancinci.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
Now he knew.	Ngoku wayesazi.
Not so bad.	Hayi kakhulu ngendlela embi.
Yeah, maybe one.	Ewe, mhlawumbi enye.
He can never do that.	Akanakuze ayenze loo nto.
You should know this.	Ufanele ukwazi oku.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
Being human is good.	Ukuba ngumntu kulungile.
Is it okay ?.	Ngaba kulungile?.
Whether.	Nokuba ngaba.
Sounds like okay.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile.
There is a place everywhere.	Kukho indawo yonke indawo.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
If you will not create.	Ukuba akuyi kudala.
I think this is a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba le yinto elungileyo.
To be with me.	Ukuba nam.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
Yeah, that's it, really.	Ewe, yiloo nto, ngokwenene.
I'm not entirely sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
No one asked why.	Akukho mntu wabuza ukuba kutheni.
I'm not entirely sure.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo.
He did not know who he was.	Wayengazi ukuba ngubani.
I can't find anything.	Andikwazi ukufumana nantoni na into.
He is sure of everything.	Uqinisekile ngayo yonke into.
He had to make a decision.	Kwafuneka enze isigqibo.
Going to it.	Ukuya kuyo.
This can be so.	Oku kunokuba njalo.
What's that? 	Yintoni lo nto?
he asked.	wabuza.
That will do well.	Oko kuya kwenza kakuhle.
It comes in handy.	Uza kakuhle.
This is clear there.	Oku kucacile apho.
I don't know why, but it's true.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, kodwa yinyani.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.
Where did everyone go?	Uye phi wonke umntu?
A little today.	Kancinci namhlanje.
It’s better to play less, but better.	Kungcono ukudlala kancinci, kodwa ngcono.
He looked for a long time.	Wajonga ixesha elide.
No one really.	Akukho mntu ngokwenene.
If you want to talk to us, fine.	Ukuba ufuna ukuthetha nathi, kulungile.
I need help.	Ndicela uncedo.
You will not make much money by doing this.	Awuyi kwenza imali eninzi ngokwenza oku.
I could not do that.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
This is a good thing.	Le yinto entle.
But there is something else, too.	Kodwa kukho enye into, nayo.
A really good book.	Incwadi entle ngokwenene.
I had to think.	Kwafuneka ndicinge.
Or maybe not.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
It seems to us.	Kubonakala ngathi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He said nothing, looked away.	Akazange athethe nto, wajonga kude.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
This is not the case now.	Oku akunjalo ngoku.
Money, one thing.	Imali, into enye.
Well, you don't want one.	Kulungile, awufuni enye.
The big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu.
He thought so too.	Naye wayecinga njalo.
I am a thing.	Ke le nto.
It will be very difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
Certainly,	Ngokuqinisekileyo,
Everyone knows it.	Wonke umntu uyayazi.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
I think he knew.	Ndicinga ukuba wayesazi.
I do not know either.	Andazi nam.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
You go where you want to go.	Uya apho ufuna ukuya khona.
Would you like to go with you?	Ngaba ungathanda ukuhamba nawe?
This is all.	Le nto yonke.
He knew.	Wayesazi.
But not there.	Kodwa hayi apho.
If you can talk about it.	Ukuba uyakwazi ukuthetha ngayo.
No, it seems he did, but he never did.	Hayi, kubonakala ngathi wenza, kodwa akazange.
I don't want him to leave right now.	Andifuni ahambe okwangoku.
Yes, this is it.	Ewe, yiyo le.
You will be here with him.	Uzakuba lapha naye.
He did not know how to make money.	Wayengazi ukuba enze njani imali.
He didn't know there.	Wayengazi apho.
You like it.	Uyayithanda.
You have to be, too.	Ufanele ukuba njalo, nawe.
Well, not to you.	Ewe, hayi kuwe.
He can't drive.	Akakwazi ukuqhuba.
I'm not sure where else.	Andiqinisekanga ngenye indawo.
That happened.	Oko kwenzeka.
I just want to be alone.	Ndifuna nje ukuba ndedwa.
This is not difficult.	Oku akukho nzima.
No it isn't.	Hayi akunjalo.
I'm not going anywhere with you.	Andiyi ndawo nawe.
Good man.	Umntu olungileyo.
What the hell.	Yintoni.
I will do the right thing.	Ndiza kwenza into elungileyo.
We will definitely do this again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kuyenza le nto kwakhona.
He likes that too.	Naye uyayithanda loo nto.
I doubt it will be that easy.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba kuya kuba lula oko.
I thought it was you.	Bendicinga ukuba nguwe.
I hope you are doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza kakuhle.
But he knew.	Kodwa wayesazi.
Yes women.	Ewe akazi.
Yes, you want a new one.	Ewe, ufuna entsha.
I don't like it either.	Nam andiyithandi.
You know you want to.	Uyazi ukuba uyafuna.
If you do.	Ukuba wenza njalo.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga kangako.
But that's me.	Kodwa ndim lowo.
But he could not succeed.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuphumelela.
You know it well there.	Wazi kakuhle apho.
I need to know how this happened.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oku.
I will bring him here.	Ndiza kuza naye apha.
But he wanted to say the same thing.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuthetha into enye.
One, not so much.	Enye, hayi kakhulu.
It's getting harder.	Kuba nzima.
How are you doing.	Wenza njani.
But this seems really good.	Kodwa oku kubonakala kulungile ngokwenene.
I thought this looked good.	Ndandicinga ukuba oku kubonakala kulungile.
He had never been so far before.	Akazange ahambe kangako ngaphambili.
Yes, it seems you have done very well.	Ewe, kubonakala ngathi wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
I've been thinking about you for a long time.	Kudala ndicinga ngawe.
I am glad.	Ndiyavuya.
You never did.	Zange wenze njalo.
As soon as possible.	Ngokukhawuleza.
I was not thinking clearly.	Ndandingacingi ngokucacileyo.
That's the problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki.
It is difficult to know exactly where it is.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuba iphi kanye kanye.
You are not going to the hospital.	Awuyi esibhedlele.
I'm trying to stay here.	Ndizama ukuhlala apha.
Well, tell me about yourself.	Ke, ndixelele ngawe.
I think that's true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani.
Not too much.	Akukho kakhulu.
I want you to talk to me.	Ndifuna uthetha nam.
I hope you will stay here.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala apha.
No one is doing better.	Akukho mntu wenza ngcono.
I just know we will be together.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba siza kuba kunye.
.	.
One has to do something about it.	Umntu kufuneka enze into ngaloo nto.
I think you know what that will mean.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi ukuba kuya kuthetha ntoni oko.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma ngokukhawuleza.
That is what we must do.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka senze.
That, more so.	Oko, ngakumbi.
Maybe there is something bigger at work.	Mhlawumbi kukho into enkulu emsebenzini.
But he did not want to.	Kodwa wayengafuni.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
This is possible today.	Oku kunokwenzeka namhlanje.
You will have to be.	Kuya kufuneka ube.
We did everything well.	Senze yonke into kakuhle.
I'll stay here.	Ndiza kuhlala apha.
She has done a very good job.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu umsebenzi wakhe.
I did not do that well.	khange ndiyenze kakuhle lonto.
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
There is one for you, too.	Kukho enye yakho, nawe.
No one knows for sure.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
But it can be.	Kodwa kunokuba njalo.
I would like to know.	Ndingathanda ukwazi.
I will talk more.	Ndiza kuthetha ngakumbi.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
You need to know how to do it.	Kufuneka uyazi indlela yokwenza.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
I can't read this.	Andikwazi ukufunda oku.
Impossible to tell, really.	Akunakwenzeka ukuxelela, ngokwenene.
I will be here.	Ndiza kuba apha.
You're talking about something else now.	Uthetha ngenye into ngoku.
It will be because he is not here.	Kuya kuba njalo kuba akakho apha.
Don't do that.	Musa ukuyenza loo nto.
He finally understood.	Ekugqibeleni waqonda.
No one should know.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukwazi.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.
He doesn't think about it.	Akacingi ngayo.
He stayed there for a long time.	Wahlala apho ixesha elide.
I didn't want that much.	Ndandingafuni nto ingako.
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
I can't talk to her.	Andikwazi kuthetha naye.
I knew why.	Ndandisazi ukuba kutheni.
But now you know.	Kodwa ngoku uyazi.
Why you.	Kutheni wena.
I didn't do it.	khange ndiyenze.
He wanted to know what he was thinking.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba wayecinga ntoni.
Just before.	Kanye ngaphambili.
Just something happened.	Kanye into eyenzekayo.
I didn't want to talk to her either.	Nam ndandingafuni kuthetha naye.
But he wanted to do just one.	Kodwa wayefuna ukwenza enye kuphela.
None.	Akukho.
he thought.	wacinga.
This should be the case now.	Oku kufuneka kube njalo okwangoku.
But you do not want to be frustrated if you cannot get the right pitch so invest in a good capo.	Kodwa awufuni ukuhamba kuyo yonke loo ngxaki.
I know you well.	Ndikwazi kakuhle.
But it is certainly not necessary.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akuyomfuneko.
I think soon.	Ndicinga ukuba kungekudala.
Well, 'that' away.	Kulungile, 'ukuba' kude.
Not just everyone.	Kuphela ayinguye wonke umntu.
Sorry.	Uxolo.
Or something else.	Okanye enye into.
But he knew he had to go.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ahambe.
All right now.	Kulungile okwangoku.
I never thought anyone would do that.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba nabani na uya kwenza.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
I can't do it.	Andikwazi ukuyenza.
I don't know what's in there.	Andazi ukuba kukho ntoni apho.
I wonder if it's true.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba yinyani na.
I think everyone knows that.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
He never did that.	Zange ayenze loo nto.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga ncam.
He lives alone.	Uhlala yedwa.
Just tell me what you think.	Ndixelele nje ukuba ucinga ntoni.
Nice to have you here !.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nawe apha!.
But not in the right way.	Kodwa hayi ngendlela elungileyo.
Or better, for that matter.	Okanye ngcono, ngaloo nto.
We did that a little bit.	Senze loo nto kancinci.
Not a big deal or anything.	Hayi into enkulu okanye nantoni na.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
There is plenty of time !.	Kukho ixesha elininzi!.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
He wanted to do his job.	Wayefuna ukwenza umsebenzi wakhe.
He will do nothing.	Akayi kwenza nto.
I know you are a good person.	Ndiyazi ukuba ungumntu olungileyo.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga ncam.
I never did that myself.	Zange ndiyenze lonto mna.
Sooner than you think.	Kungekudala kunokuba ucinga.
And he agreed.	Uye wavuma.
But this is exactly what he wanted to know.	Kodwa oku kanye wayefuna ukwazi ngokwenene.
So way more.	Ngoko indlela ngakumbi.
That's fine too.	Kulungile nam.
Well, that's it.	Kulungile, yiloo nto.
And so it happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto ke.
Yes! 	Ewe!
In all that way.	Kuyo yonke loo ndlela.
This is very clear!	Oku kucacile ngokwenene!
I thought you knew.	Bendicinga ukuba uyazi.
No.	Hayi.
This happens often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo.
But, nothing.	Kodwa, akukho nto.
He just wants to be you.	Ufuna nje ukuba nguwe.
The food is good.	Ukutya kulungile.
It seems impossible to get a job there.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka ukufumana umsebenzi apho.
You know that is impossible.	Uyazi ukuba akunakwenzeka.
We'll talk later.	Siza kuthetha kamva.
I thought.	Bendicinga.
He just wanted to see.	Wayefuna nje ukubona.
But he wanted to talk about it.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuthetha ngayo.
Impossible, but possible.	Akunakwenzeka, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
But no one is there.	Kodwa akukho mntu apho.
That is what he wants us to do.	Yiloo nto afuna siyenze.
We did so.	Senze njalo.
He would come.	Wayeza kuza.
If you try to do something, you will do it	Ukuba uzama ukwenza into, uya kuyenza
Whatever your thing.	Nokuba yintoni na into yakho.
No one knew anything.	Akukho mntu wayesazi nto.
I didn't want to do this.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza le nto.
What did you do today at your job ?.	Wenze ntoni namhlanje emsebenzini wakho?.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
But no later, not really.	Kodwa akukho kamva, hayi ngokwenene.
But he could not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukwenza oko.
He told me everything.	Undixelele yonke into.
But he did not have it.	Kodwa akazange abe nayo.
Not until much later.	Hayi kude kube kamva kakhulu.
I never thought much of it.	Andizange ndicinge kakhulu ngayo.
All day long.	Imini yonke.
I'm not sure how I did this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani oku.
You told me that.	Undixelele lonto.
I had to speak.	Kwafuneka ndithethe.
He will not live alone.	Akayi kuhlala yedwa.
Do you think that you are coming to me?	Ucinga ukuba uza kum?
He did not even know what he would do if he did.	Wayengazi nokuba uza kwenza ntoni xa enjenjalo.
So it should be easy.	Ngoko ke kufuneka kube lula.
He says he is not, but.	Uthi uthi ayinguye, kodwa.
As for me.	Njengoko kum.
He wants to tell the truth.	Ufuna ukuthetha inyani.
What's happened.	Kwenzeke ntoni.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
This happens very often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo kakhulu.
I want to know why.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
But, yes, that's all.	Kodwa, ewe, yiyo yonke loo nto.
you say.	uthi.
He wanted nothing.	Wayengafuni nto.
Not out here, not in this place.	Hayi apha ngaphandle, hayi kule ndawo.
But not much is happening.	Kodwa akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo.
I didn't even know how you felt.	Ndandingazi nokuba uziva njani.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
So there is something there.	Ngoko kukho into apho.
I was really thinking about you today.	Bendicinga ngawe namhlanje nyani.
But that is probably a good thing.	Kodwa mhlawumbi yinto entle leyo.
I don't want to be anywhere, to be honest.	Andifuni kuba ndawo, ukuthetha inyani.
I would really like that.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene oko.
But he eventually apologized.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ekugqibeleni wacela uxolo.
And so it happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto ke.
He can never succeed.	Akanakuze aphumelele.
To be with you all day.	Ukuba nawe imini yonke.
Well, maybe not all.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi hayi yonke.
Well, that's a good thing.	Ke, yinto entle leyo.
To me, but you know, not really.	Kum, kodwa uyazi, hayi ngokwenene.
But it really isn't that hard.	Kodwa ngokwenene akukho nzima kangako.
Right then, right there.	Kanye ngoko, kanye apho.
You know this is true.	Uyazi ukuba yinyani le.
But you do not want to.	Kodwa awufuni.
I don’t know how I made it so.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani ukuba kube njalo.
To know more.	Ukwazi ngakumbi.
I know what the problem is.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
Like, one.	Njengoko, enye.
Certainly that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko.
She went to the hospital.	Waya esibhedlele.
We did that.	Senze loo nto.
He knows everything.	Wazi yonke into.
It will not be easy.	Akuyi kuba lula.
There is no place for you here.	Akukho ndawo yakho apha.
But then, for her, it probably happened.	Kodwa ke, kuye, mhlawumbi kwenzeka.
Certainly not me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andizange.
Every so often.	Rhoqo.
It is not as easy as it seems.	Akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
But that is what happened.	Kodwa yinto eyenzekayo.
Or maybe this one.	Okanye mhlawumbi lo.
Not to you, but to you.	Hayi kuwe, kodwa kuwe.
This happens very quickly.	Oku kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
This is very difficult, but possible.	Oku kunzima kakhulu, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
There is no way.	Akukho ndlela.
No one really knows.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokwenene.
We've done it before.	Senze ngaphambili.
This is clearly difficult.	Oku ngokucacileyo kunzima.
Now he lives alone.	Ngoku uhlala yedwa.
I want to know.	Ndifuna ukwazi.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
Absolutely nothing.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho nto ngokupheleleyo.
He wanted to be with her.	Wayefuna ukuba kunye naye.
Anything else.	Enye into.
Nothing to do with time.	Akukho nto yokwenza ixesha.
He knew exactly why.	Wayesazi kakuhle ukuba kutheni.
But it can be.	Kodwa kunokuba njalo.
This one is for sure.	Lo uqinisekile.
You need to tell me something about yourself.	Kufuneka undixelele into ngawe.
I thought you knew.	Bendicinga ukuba uyazi.
What the hell.	Yintoni.
Well, now you have.	Ewe, ngoku wenze njalo.
But that is not possible.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka.
There he stayed.	Apho wahlala.
Nobody lives alone.	Akukho mntu uhlala yedwa.
Tell me what happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
To be better.	Ukuba ngcono.
That's what happened.	Yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
I think it's time.	Ndicinga ukuba lixesha.
You too in it.	Nawe kuyo.
He did not know what he was thinking.	Wayengazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
Help more, more.	Nceda ngakumbi, ngakumbi.
But not about this.	Kodwa hayi ngale nto.
I know it.	Ndiyayazi.
You need to know something.	Kufuneka wazi into.
Because there is something.	Kuba kukho into.
Many things.	Izinto ezininzi.
But just a little bit.	Kodwa nje kancinci.
This is a little difficult.	Oku kunzima kancinci.
He told me he didn't know.	Wandixelela ukuba akazi.
Maybe you say no.	Mhlawumbi uthi hayi.
You have to have it.	Ufanele ube nayo.
I've never been there before.	Andizange ndiye apho ngaphambili.
Now it is impossible.	Ngoku akunakwenzeka.
I know this is good.	Ndiyazi ukuba oku kulungile.
But he could not.	Kodwa akazange akwazi.
Maybe reading.	Mhlawumbi ukufunda.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
I can't say what.	Andikwazi kuthetha ntoni.
So what ?.	Ngoko ke yintoni?.
I would like that too.	Ndingathanda nokuba.
He is not here today.	Akakho namhlanje.
He did not say anything for a long time.	Zange athethe nto ixesha elide.
You should be well aware of that.	Ufanele ukuba uyazi kakuhle loo nto.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
Not a little bit.	Hayi kancinci kancinci.
I have done many things.	Ndenze izinto ezininzi.
Not so for me.	Akunjalo kum.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto ngokwenene.
You will do well in everything.	Uya kwenza kakuhle kuyo yonke into.
I know that's it.	Ndiyazi ukuba yinto leyo.
That's it.	Yiyo loo nto.
Not so much, but a little bit.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa kancinci.
I can't buy this.	Andikwazi ukuthenga oku.
It will be very difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
Does this mean the same thing?	Ngaba oku kuthetha into enye.
I can't do that.	Andikwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
But no one wanted to go.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayefuna ukuya.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
We have to make a decision.	Kufuneka senze isigqibo.
He also did nothing.	Kwakhona akazange enze nto.
Traveling becomes difficult.	Ukuhamba kuba nzima.
It will be very difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
If you want this, fine.	Ukuba ufuna oku, kulungile.
He will not have to.	Akayi kufuneka.
I just want to talk to you.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha nawe.
He wanted to go.	Wayefuna ukuhamba.
Probably nothing.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto.
I knew exactly what had happened, but.	Ndandisazi kakuhle ukuba kwenzeke ntoni, kodwa.
But you do not have to.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze njalo ukuba awufuni.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku.
That's how great it is.	Yiyo indlela enkulu ngayo.
He did a lot with it.	Wenza kakhulu ngayo.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi, akunjalo.
You will stay here.	Uza kuhlala apha.
I would really like.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene.
What would he do with it ?.	Wayeza kwenza ntoni ngayo?.
I know it's hard.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima.
Do you mean he did it.	Ngaba uthetha ukuba wakwenza.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
Yes, you should.	Ewe, ufanele.
But he sat down.	Kodwa wahlala phantsi.
Good thing here.	Into entle apha.
But that's it.	Kodwa yiloo nto.
For a long time, it seems.	Ixesha elide, kubonakala.
But no one is there.	Kodwa akukho mntu apho.
I am the only one here.	Ndim ndedwa apha.
So do i.	Nam.
This is a big deal.	Yinto enkulu le.
Or just talking.	Okanye ukuthetha nje.
He just looked.	Wajonga nje.
Probably, but it is not.	Mhlawumbi, kodwa akunjalo.
I thought we were going to do it.	Ndandicinga ukuba siza kuyenza.
But it is much better.	Kodwa kungcono kakhulu.
We did just that.	Senze kanye loo nto.
I want you so much.	Ndifuna wena kakhulu.
You do not think clearly.	Awucingi ngokucacileyo.
He did not know many things.	Wayengazi izinto ezininzi.
Better no, better no.	Kungcono hayi, ngcono hayi.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
Yes, he went to the hospital.	Ewe, waya esibhedlele.
Again this is good.	Kwakhona oku kulungile.
He did all the work.	Wenza wonke umsebenzi.
She went to the hospital.	Uye esibhedlele.
No one knows for sure, it is impossible to know.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokuqinisekileyo, akunakwenzeka ukwazi.
We will come to you.	Siza kuza kuwe.
That's cute.	Oko kulungile.
Or you like it.	Okanye uyayithanda.

It's a big deal now.	Yinto enkulu ngoku.
Even me.	Nokuba ndim.

Everyone knows everything.	Wonke umntu uyazi yonke into.
A little more.	Kancinci ngakumbi.
He did not leave.	Akazange ahambe.
I can't speak enough.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo.
It just has to be true.	Kufuneka kube yinyani kuphela.
We just know.	Siyazi nje.
This is not necessary.	Oku akuyomfuneko.
I think you did something wrong.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze into embi.

Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacinga.
Sorry about that.	Uxolo ngawe.
Going to work.	Ukuya emsebenzini.
I'm sure you know about it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyazi ngayo.
He won't talk about it.	Akayi kuthetha ngayo.
I'll have to think about it.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngayo.
But tell me what you think !.	Kodwa ndixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni!.
He would be something.	Wayeza kuba yinto.
A really big house.	Indlu enkulu ngokwenene.
I thought you wanted to know.	Bendicinga ukuba uyafuna ukwazi.
You just have to be yourself.	Kufuneka nje ube nguwe.
But there is more to it than that.	Kodwa kukho into eninzi ngakumbi kuyo.
You have to do better.	Kufuneka wenze ngcono.
I can't really talk right now.	Andikwazi nyani ukuthetha ngoku.
This is clearly not possible.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunakwenzeka.
Nothing of yours here.	Akukho nto yakho apha.
The problem is you.	Ingxaki nguwe.
Is true.	Yinyani.
You mean something.	Uthetha into.

For now.	Okwangoku.
I can't tell anyone.	Andikwazi ukuxelela mntu.
We will have to go to him.	Kuya kufuneka siye kuye.
Now you will be.	Ngoku uya kuba.
But maybe you want to go, go home.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ufuna ukuhamba, ukuya ekhaya.
But he did.	Kodwa uyenzile.
He is definitely going to jail.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya entolongweni.
You know.	Uziva .
I would like more.	Ndingathanda ngakumbi.
Well no more.	Kulungile hayi ngakumbi.
He has tried everything.	Uye wazama yonke into.
I hope to do it again for sure.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ndiza kuyenza kwakhona ngokuqinisekileyo.
So why did you do that?	Ngoko kutheni uyenzile loo nto?
Thus,.	Ngaloo ndlela, .
We need to do that.	Kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
But no, it is not.	Kodwa hayi, ayinguye.
At last! 	Ekugqibeleni!
But no.	Kodwa hayi .
I did not speak to him.	Khange ndithethe nam.

Now, he did.	Ngoku, wenze njalo.
Well done !.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu!.
He wanted to go.	Wayefuna ukuhamba.
Or me.	Okanye nam.
Yes, there is.	Ewe, kukho.
Probably not one or the other.	Mhlawumbi hayi enye okanye enye.
But we have to do it.	Kodwa kufuneka senze njalo.
Nobody lives where you want to go.	Akukho mntu uhlala apho ufuna khona.
Why should you know?	Kutheni kufuneka ukwazi?
Not just me.	Hayi mna kuphela.
I knew it would be so.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Maybe it's better this way.	Mhlawumbi kungcono ngale ndlela.
The longer, the better.	Ixesha elide, ngcono.
You have to do one.	Kufuneka wenze enye.
I don't know either.	Andikwazi nam.
I know not much.	Ndiyazi ukuba akukho kakhulu.
I did not know better.	Ndandingazi ngcono.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
So maybe.	Ngoko mhlawumbi.
It has to happen.	Kufuneka kwenzeke.
He lives at home.	Uhlala ekhaya.
Obviously not you.	Ngokucacileyo hayi kuwe.
I had no idea that anyone was doing that.	Ndandingazi ukuba umntu wenza loo nto ngokwenene.
I'm just.	Ndim nje.
Later, he thought.	Kamva, wacinga.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
And to me the other way around.	Ke kum ngenye indlela.
He just didn't want to.	Wayengafuni nje.
There is certainly no way.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho ndlela.
Or something of mine.	Okanye into yam.
Far from it.	Kude ngokuqinisekileyo.
As for? 	Ngoko?
I'm just trying to be myself.	Ndizama nje ukuba ndim.
I do not believe it.	Andikholelwa kodwa.
You know the problem.	Uyayazi ingxaki.
It's the same thing.	Yinto enye kanye.
I just want a home.	Ndifuna nje ekhaya.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
It should be easy.	Kufuneka kube lula.
Not just work, but everything.	Hayi nje umsebenzi, kodwa yonke into.
We need to act immediately.	Kufuneka senze ngoko nangoko.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.

I want him to do it.	Ndifuna ayenze.
You know exactly why.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba kutheni.
Well, not you.	Ewe, hayi wena.

I am well aware of that.	Ndiyazi kakuhle loo nto.
I don’t think it’s going to be that hard.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba nzima kangako.
You like it here.	Uyayithanda apha.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
So why did you do that? 	Ngoko kutheni uyenzile loo nto?
I knew then.	Ndandisazi ngoko.
If you did, you know.	Ukuba uyenzile, uyazi.
You just know what's going on.	Uyazi nje ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Maybe someone knows more.	Mhlawumbi umntu wazi ngakumbi.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Akafuni kuthetha ngayo.
This is a wonderful thing this week.	Yinto entle kakhulu le kule veki.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
It's just a thing.	Yinto nje.
I had no idea what it was.	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni na.
He must have known.	Umele ukuba wayesazi.
No one asked.	Akukho mntu wabuza.
You know.	Waziva.
Once you will have to do it.	Kanye kuya kufuneka wenze.
I doubt this.	Ndiyathandabuza oku.
We did very well.	Senze kakuhle kakhulu.

You know the place.	Uyayazi indawo.
But he has gone.	Kodwa uye.
Something happened to him.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuye.
He has told me that before.	Undixelele oko ngaphambili.
All right.	Kulungile.
I don't want to know.	Andifuni kukwazi.
But did it really.	Kodwa ngaba ngokwenene.
He went too far.	Waya kude kakhulu.
He can't get a job.	Akakwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
I know what he wants.	Ndiyayazi into ayifunayo.
He looked bad.	Wayekhangeleka embi.
I do not know.	Andazi kodwa.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
Great place, great place.	Indawo enkulu, indawo entle.
Well, not so much.	Ewe, hayi kakhulu.
This is until tomorrow today.	Oku kube kude kube kusasa namhlanje.
Another problem.	Enye ingxaki.
But enough to say.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo ukuthetha.
I don't know what my problem is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki yam.
I think this is true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani le.
He was not.	Wayengekho.
She is very happy.	Uyavuya kakhulu.
At this point.	Kule ndawo.
I would like something else.	Ndingathanda enye into.
I do not believe.	Andikholelwa.
He always knows.	Wazi njalo.
With this book.	Ngale ncwadi.
I never did that.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
Not a car.	Hayi imoto.
I just know the place.	Ndiyazi nje indawo.
That will make your job a lot easier.	Oko kuya kwenza umsebenzi wakho ube lula kakhulu.
You will be, too.	Uya kuba, nawe.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
Maybe, maybe.	Mhlawumbi, mhlawumbi.
That is exactly what is happening here.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo apha.
To read.	Ukufunda.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.

To be.	Ukuba.
Well, this is good for me.	Ewe, oku kulungile kum.
It will have to be tonight.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba kube ngokuhlwanje.
So you go to it.	Ngoko uya kuyo.
I would like very much.	Ndingathanda kakhulu.
I do not know when or how or why.	Andazi ukuba nini okanye njani okanye kutheni.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
It is difficult to talk about what you are talking about.	Kunzima ukuthetha ngale nto uthetha ngayo.
Nobody wants this.	Akukho mntu ufuna oku.
It's only here.	Kukho kuphela apha.
It just has to.	Kufuneka nje.
But very well.	Kodwa kakuhle kakhulu.
I can't go far here.	Andikwazi ukuya kude apha.

He thought it was him.	Wayecinga ukuba nguye.
You have to do the work.	Kufuneka wenze umsebenzi.
That morning.	Ngaloo ntsasa.
But soon.	Kodwa kungekudala.
So tell me this.	Ke ndixelele oku.

He did not speak.	Akazange athethe.
But it is true.	Kodwa yinyani.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
He wanted to drive.	Wayefuna ukuqhuba.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
But yes, it is possible.	Kodwa ewe, kunokwenzeka.
Therefore,.	Ngoko ke, .
To do something.	Ukwenza into.
He felt clear.	Waziva ngokucacileyo.
You will stay here a long time.	Uza kuhlala ixesha elide apha.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akukho.
But no one tried to do it.	Kodwa akukho mntu wazama ukuyenza.
He said he wanted more time.	Wathi ufuna ixesha elininzi.
I hope not.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
Have you ever tried this?	Ngaba ukhe wazama oku?
You think.	Ucinga.
I'm scared, please help!	Ndiyoyika, ndicela uncedo!
Whoever it is.	Nokuba ngubani na.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
Not so with him.	Akunjalo nayo.

But only if you want to.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba ufuna.
But today it is not easy.	Kodwa namhlanje akukho lula.
We will do the right thing.	Siza kwenza into elungileyo.
It will happen.	Kuya kwenzeka.
I never did.	Andizange ndiyenze.
I told her everything.	Ndiye ndamxelela yonke into.
Don't just go there.	Musa nje ukuya apho.
He is a good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo.
Too much money.	Imali eninzi kakhulu.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
You will not need anything else.	Awuyi kufuna enye into.
Probably not for long.	Mhlawumbi hayi ixesha elide.
Maybe you don't want to.	Mhlawumbi awufuni.
I know where everyone lives.	Ndiyazi apho kuhlala wonke umntu.
But there it is again.	Kodwa nantso kwakhona.
Whatever you think.	Nokuba ucinga ntoni na.
That does everything.	Oko kwenza yonke into.
I'm glad to be staying.	Ndiyavuya ukuhlala.
Or so he thought.	Okanye ke wayecinga.
Really? 	Ngokwenene?

Not for me.	Hayi kum.
There is something wonderful to know.	Kukho into entle ukwazi.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
I'm really scared.	Ndiyoyika ngokwenene.

He did not stay long then.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide ngoko.
He talks about everything.	Uthetha ngayo yonke into.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi ukuyenza le nto.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
I don't want anything.	Andifuni nto .

This seems to us.	Oku kubonakala ngathi.
I go to him.	Ndiya kuye.
To play .	Ukudlala .
You should know for sure.	Umele ukwazi ngokuqinisekileyo oko.
In this he was not alone.	Kule nto wayengekho yedwa.
Now he doesn't want to play at all.	Ngoku akafuni kwaphela ukudlala.
It is impossible to do that.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza oko.
He did not sit down.	Akazange ahlale phantsi.
I don't want to do that.	Andifuni ukuyenza loo nto.
Please tell me.	Nceda undixelele.
We did both.	Senze sobabini.
There it is again, yes.	Nantso kwakhona, ewe.
I want to go.	Ndifuna ukuhamba.
Now what did I do ?.	Ngoku ndenze ntoni?.

That's all now.	Yinto yonke ngoku.
That's all.	Yiloo nto yonke.
If possible.	Ukuba kunokwenzeka.
It's hard to do everything.	Kunzima ukwenza yonke into.
I can't achieve this.	Andikwazi ukuphumelela oku.
He asked what the problem was.	Wabuza ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
The job should only do one thing.	Umsebenzi kufuneka wenze into enye kuphela.
Please! 	Nceda!
Please! 	Nceda!
Yeah, not me.	Ewe, hayi mna.
I'll talk to you later.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kamva.
I know it's true.	Ndiyazi ukuba yinyani.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
I do not know how this happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oku.
Everyone now agreed.	Wonke umntu ngoku wavuma.
He didn't know what to do with all that.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngayo yonke loo nto.
When we have to do it.	Xa kufuneka senze njalo.
But, you will have to do very well.	Kodwa, kuya kufuneka ukuba wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
For now.	Okwangoku.
Clearly, something happened.	Kucacile ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo.
I do not know what the problem is here.	Andazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki apha.
But he thought better of it.	Kodwa wacinga ngcono ngayo.
Well, we know how that happened.	Kulungile, siyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
You know, it's just a big deal.	Uyazi, yinto nje enkulu.
No, not at all, no.	Hayi, akunjalo, hayi.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni.
Well, what's new there.	Kulungile, yintoni entsha apho.
You said you were sure.	Ubuthe uqinisekile.
It's just me here.	Kum nje apha.
But it is a good thing.	Kodwa yinto entle.
There is no place for him here.	Akukho ndawo yakhe apha.
What do you think of this book?	Ucinga ntoni ngale ncwadi?
For it will certainly happen.	Kuba ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kwenzeka.
If you do not want to do that.	Ukuba awufuni ukwenza oko.
Where did you go?	Uye phi?
He will be here with us.	Uya kuba apha kunye nathi.
Tell me something else.	Ndixelele enye into.
He thought nothing of it.	Akazange acinge nto.
I know again.	Ndiyazi kwakhona.
He thought it was okay.	Wayecinga ukuba kulungile.
Not for me.	Hayi kum.
I will not say.	Andiyi kuthetha.
i can do it.	ndingayenza.
But not this.	Kodwa hayi oku.
It seems like a big deal to me.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu kum.
Your location.	Indawo yakho.
That means there is.	Oko kuthetha ukuba kukho.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
For convenience.	Ukuze kube lula.
It's hard to know.	Kunzima ukwazi.
But, again, it probably isn't.	Kodwa, kwakhona, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
How he knew he didn't know.	Ukuba wayesazi njani ukuba wayengazi.
It's not like you're saying anything about it.	Akukho ngathi uthetha nantoni na ngayo.
No, not you.	Hayi, hayi wena.
That's the way.	Nantso indlela.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ngoku.
And he did so.	Wenze njalo ke.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
At home.	Ekhaya.
I know what you will do.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kwenza ntoni na.
He did not say much.	Khange athethe kakhulu.
You know, like me.	Uyazi, njengam.
So you have to be realistic about that.	Ngoko kufuneka ube yinyani ngaloo nto.
It's a long time.	Lixesha elide.
He didn't, really.	Naye akazange, ngokwenene.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
So, what time is it?	Ngoko ke, yintoni ixesha?
Someone else did that.	Omnye umntu wenze loo nto.
I never thought of it.	Andizange ndicinge nto ngayo.
I do not know.	Andazi.
He did that.	Uyenzile loo nto.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze nto.
You deserve to be.	Ufanele ukuba.
Or maybe there is.	Okanye mhlawumbi kukho.
I know, because that happened to me.	Ndiyazi, kuba oko kwenzeka kum.
We will be far away from you.	Siya kuba kude kuwe.
He will not be.	Akayi kuba.
Yes man.	Ewe umntu.
Because we need someone.	Kuba kufuneka umntu.
No one.	Akukho mntu.
I just need to know what it is.	Kufuneka nje ndiyazi ukuba yintoni.
Why do you think this happened?	Ucinga ukuba kwakutheni ukuze kwenzeke oku?
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
But now he has done nothing.	Kodwa ngoku akazange enze nto.
I want you now.	Ndifuna wena ngoku.
He never did anything like that.	Akazange enze nto ngaloo ndlela.
We've done that before.	Senze loo nto ngaphambili.
No, no, it is not possible.	Hayi, hayi, akunakwenzeka.
You too .	Nawe .
I want to talk about you.	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngawe.
The police will not come here.	Amapolisa akayi kuza apha.
Or better yet.	Okanye kungcono.
He certainly did not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazange enze njalo.
Staying there is not.	Ukuhlala kukho akukho.
I have to go to work.	Kufuneka ndiye emsebenzini.
If you want.	Ukuba uyafuna.
Really, really bad.	Ngokwenene, kakubi ngokwenene.
This is something new.	Le yinto entsha.
He finally understood.	Ekugqibeleni waqonda.
He nodded in agreement.	Wavuma wavuma.
Yes, there you are.	Ewe, kukho wena.
I don't know what happened to him.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
But he did not do it regularly.	Kodwa akazange ayenze rhoqo.
He doesn't know what's going on.	Akayazi into eyenzekayo.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mhlawumbi yinto entle leyo.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kangako.
Great place.	Indawo enkulu.
But no.	Kodwa hayi.
It's so long.	Lixesha elide kangaka.
In practice, perhaps.	Ngokwenza, mhlawumbi.
This can be so.	Oku kunokuba njalo.
I would like to win.	Ndingathanda ukuphumelela.
He told me exactly how he was going to do it.	Undixelele kanye ukuba uya kwenza njani.
I'm not sure how I can do that.	Andazi ncam ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
It's a really good thing.	Yinto entle ngokwenene.
But that can be very far away.	Kodwa oko kunokuba kude kakhulu.
He wondered how far he would go.	Wayecinga ukuba uya kude kangakanani na.
This means now.	Oku kuthetha ngoku.
Yes, money.	Ewe, imali.
That would be a big deal.	Oko kuya kuba yinto enkulu.
But he thought nothing of it.	Kodwa akazange acinge nto.
I made money.	Ndenze imali.
Something terrible happened.	Kwenzeke into embi.
I don't want to go there.	Andifuni ukuya apho.
But don't stay long, now.	Kodwa musa ukuhlala ixesha elide, ngoku.
I can't talk to her.	Andikwazi kuthetha nayo.
He sat down and looked.	Wahlala phantsi wajonga.
Please do it.	Nceda uyenze.
You just told me.	Undixelele nje.
But !!!.	Kodwa !!!.
You can have him.	Usenokuba naye.
He thought for sure.	Wacinga ngokuqinisekileyo.
That is absolutely true.	Yinyani leyo ngokupheleleyo.
I would like to know.	Ndinqwenela ukwazi.
At home, at school.	Ekhaya, esikolweni.
But he was not at home for long.	Kodwa wayengekho ixesha elide ekhaya.
He can be with you.	Unokuba nawe.
He would be with her.	Wayeza kuba naye.
Not that you know much about it.	Hayi ukuba uyazi kakhulu ngayo.
He will surely stay there again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuhlala apho kwakhona.
I will definitely do that more soon.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza ngakumbi loo nto kungekudala.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
This is the same thing.	Le yinto enye kanye.
He wanted to know why.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
Just a little bit, but okay.	Kancinci nje, kodwa kulungile.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
Everyone knows now.	Wonke umntu uyazi ngoku.
Long ago now.	Kudala ngoku.
He did so.	Wenza njalo.
I can't believe you did this to me.	Andikholelwa ukuba uyenzile le nto kum.
That he certainly did not do.	Oko ngokuqinisekileyo akazange akwenze.
Yes that's right.	Ewe oko kulungile.
I have never done that before.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto ngaphambili.
He has done it before.	Uye wakwenza ngaphambili.
I know, but.	Ndiyazi, kodwa .
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
We had to do it again.	Kwafuneka siyenze kwakhona.
I'm sure it is.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiyo.
He looked at the book.	Wajonga incwadi.
I did not tell anyone.	khange ndixelele mntu.
I'm not sure that's true.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yinyani leyo.
Do not drive too fast.	Musa ukuqhuba ngokukhawuleza.
He did that.	Uyenzile loo nto.
Now he wants money.	Ngoku ufuna imali.
Why, he didn't know.	Kutheni, wayengazi.
He also drowned.	Naye wazama.
Here it is again.	Nantso ke kwakhona.
I can't talk to her.	Andikwazi kuthetha naye.
Is it me? 	Ngaba ndim?
It will be a long time.	Kuya kuba lixesha elide.
He has become.	Uye waba .
Big dog.	Inja enkulu.
Please, please.	Nceda, nceda.
All right, by the way.	Kulungile, ngendlela.
Nobody wanted to do that.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwenza loo nto.
That's more.	Yiloo nto ngakumbi.
Everyone needs help.	Wonke umntu ufuna uncedo.
There, now you know.	Apho, ngoku uyazi.
He said he did not.	Wathi akazange.
He will have to do so.	Kuya kufuneka enze njalo.
But something else is happening here.	Kodwa kukho enye into eyenzekayo apha.
He said he never did.	Wathi akazange ayenze.
There is something here.	Kukho into apha.
I want it to be true.	Ndifuna ukuba yinyani.
New car.	Imoto entsha.
He had to stay in prison.	Kwafuneka ahlale entolongweni.
Or anyone.	Okanye nabani na.
Everyone says this.	Wonke umntu uthetha oku.
Well, this is just for you.	Ewe, le yinto nje kuwe.
He went to work.	Waya emsebenzini.
We'll be more on that later.	Siza kuba ngakumbi ngaloo nto kamva.
He became even more difficult.	Waba nzima ngakumbi.
That's it.	Yinto leyo.
Don't learn too much from this.	Musa ukufunda kakhulu kule nto.
There he knew where he was.	Apho wayesazi ukuba uphi.
But we need to do this.	Kodwa kufuneka siyenze le nto.
This is his truth.	Le yinyani yakhe.
I can't do it.	Andikwazi ukuyenza.
On the floor.	Phantsi.
It is all or nothing.	Yiyo yonke okanye akukho nto.
Well, maybe now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi ngoku.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
You know that well.	Uyazi kakuhle loo nto.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Akukho nto, akukho nto, akukho nto.
Just, really immediately.	Nje, ngenene kwangoko.
It's even harder.	Kunzima ngakumbi.
Yeah, that's good enough.	Ewe, kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
That means we will need help.	Oko kuthetha ukuba siya kufuna uncedo.
He agreed to attend.	Wavuma ukuba khona.
Where did he go?	Waya phi?
He just wanted to play with her.	Wayefuna nje ukudlala naye.
I think he is, a little bit.	Ndicinga ukuba nguye, kancinci.
In case.	Mhlawumbi.
You need to know that.	Kufuneka uyazi loo nto.
He likes a lot of things.	Uthanda izinto ezininzi.
Not like anything else out there.	Akunjalo nantoni na enye ngaphandle.
Not a bit anymore.	Hayi kancinci kwakhona.
I think that's a bad thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto embi leyo.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga ncam.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo.
I know nothing about it.	Andazi nto ngayo.
Long time ago.	Kudala kakhulu.
You have to learn.	Ufanele ukufunda.
He will do it again.	Uya kuphinda.
There is a problem.	Kukho ingxaki.
You should know that too.	Ufanele ukwazi oko nawe.

You certainly know.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyazi.
He speaks well.	Uthetha kakuhle.
He tried to say something.	Wazama ukuthetha into.
Not if you don't want to.	Hayi ukuba awufuni.
But he could not do it.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza.
Sitting for too long now.	Ukuhlala phantsi ixesha elide kakhulu ngoku.
He did so.	Wenze njalo.
One down, one to go.	Omnye phantsi, omnye ukuya.
But he didn't, for now.	Kodwa akazange akwazi, okwangoku.
But if he did not.	Kodwa ukuba akazange.
She also goes to school.	Naye uya esikolweni.
Looks like no.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho.
I will not need a car.	Andiyi kufuna imoto.
I do not know what will happen tomorrow.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni ngomso.
All right.	Kulungile.
No one wanted to know anything.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwazi nto.
Everyone was thinking the same thing.	Wonke umntu wayecinga into enye.
It’s everything to him.	Yinto yonke kuye.
We know now.	Siyazi ngoku.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
I need to go and get help.	Kufuneka ndiye kufuna uncedo.
He does not need to say more.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba athethe ngakumbi.
Why you should.	Kutheni ufanele.
Really, there is.	Ngokwenene, kukho.
Doing the right thing.	Ukwenza into elungileyo.
Not a dog, either.	Hayi inja, okanye.
Over again.	Kwakhona kwakhona.
He's just trying to help.	Uzama nje ukunceda.
He went to work.	Waya emsebenzini.
A little bit really.	Kancinci ngokwenene.
I would like you to do that.	Ndingathanda ukuba wenze oko.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku.
How can I do that.	Ndingayenza njani lonto.
Now, everybody knows it.	Ngoku, wonke umntu uyayazi.
I did not know how.	Ndandingazi ukuba njani.
Nice place here.	Indawo entle apha.
A very good person.	Umntu olungileyo kakhulu.
Or pretend he doesn't want to.	Okanye wenze ngathi akafuni.
But nowhere.	Kodwa akukho ndawo.
But there is another way.	Kodwa kukho enye indlela.
I would like to do more of that.	Ndingathanda ukwenza ngakumbi oko.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
He never had it.	Akazange abe nayo.
Have you ever.	Ngaba wakhe.
Only not so fast.	Kuphela hayi ngokukhawuleza.
But there is a problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki.
You have to have it.	Kufuneka ube nayo.
Why, why, why.	Kutheni, kutheni, kutheni.
He wanted to.	Wayefuna.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
No, not yet.	Hayi, hayi okwangoku.
Apparently not much.	Kubonakala ukuba akukho kakhulu.
This way, please.	Ngale ndlela, nceda.
You have to go to work.	Kufuneka uye emsebenzini.
We went to everything.	Siye kuyo yonke into.
So do i.	Nam.
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi.
You just do your job.	Wenza nje umsebenzi wakho.
I don't want it to happen to you.	Andifuni ukuba yenzeke kuwe.
But no, not before.	Kodwa hayi, hayi ngaphambili.
He doesn't want you to know that.	Akafuni ukuba uyazi loo nto.
Just a little.	Nje kancinci.
Time, that's the problem.	Ixesha, nantso ingxaki.
he thought.	wacinga.
He did not speak.	Khange athethe.
He apologized for that.	Wacela uxolo ngaloo nto.
Why, at home you are a good person, too.	Kutheni, ekhaya ungumntu olungileyo, nawe.
But clearly not.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
More to him a little bit.	Ngakumbi kuye kancinci.
Maybe he would be better.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuba ngcono.
He really wanted to go.	Wayefuna kakhulu ukuhamba.
I wonder if.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba.
He could not get to her there well.	Akazange akwazi ukuya kuye apho kakuhle.
I really want this.	Ndifuna ngokwenene oku.
I don't have to make a new one.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndenze entsha.
I'm sure you do too.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba nawe wenza njalo.
This is really happening.	Oku kwenzeka ngokwenene .
I don't like it.	Andiyithandi.
But no one is here.	Kodwa akukho mntu apha.
Is this person ?.	Ngaba lo mntu?.
Can anyone please help.	Ngaba nabani na ndicela uncedo.
So maybe that's what happened.	Ngoko mhlawumbi yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
There is no one else.	Akakho omnye.
But if there is such a thing, then that's it.	Kodwa ukuba kukho into enjalo, yiloo nto ke.
But, yes, I am.	Kodwa, ewe, ndim.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
It is very difficult for me to do.	Kunzima kakhulu kum ukuyenza.
You love one, you love another.	Uthanda enye, uyayithanda enye.
He knew it wouldn't be so.	Wayesazi ukuba akuyi kuba njalo.
I can do this.	Ndingayenza le nto.
It's true for me.	Yinyani kum.
But he did not just talk.	Kodwa akazange athethe nje.
Yeah, not really.	Ewe, hayi ncam.
It never happened.	Zange kube njalo.
Not a good read.	Hayi ukufunda kakuhle.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga kangako.
This is often fine.	Oku ixesha elininzi kulungile.
Not too much to see.	Akukho kakhulu ukubona.
This will seem very difficult.	Oku kuya kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
It can be very difficult.	Kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
That really happened.	Oko kwenzeka ngokwenene.
This is just a new fact.	Le yinyani nje entsha.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
Yes, next week.	Ewe, kwiveki ezayo.
I had no idea about that.	Ndandingazi ngaloo nto.
Everyone knows that.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
Or, you know.	Okanye, uyazi.
All right.	Kulungile.
You will not be alone.	Awuyi kuba wedwa.
Just a little.	Nje kancinci.
No, he thought.	Akunjalo, wacinga.
We know this is difficult.	Siyazi ukuba oku kunzima.
I do not know how.	Andazi ukuba njani.
I don't know what he will do.	Andazi ukuba uya kwenza ntoni na.
You know what it is.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
There is coffee too.	Kukho ikofu kwakhona.
He didn't want to play with me.	Wayengafuni ukudlala nam.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
I'm sure.	Ndiqinisekile.
Everything else, you do well.	Yonke enye into, wenza kakuhle.
He told me where to go.	Undixelele ukuba ndiye phi.
It seems impossible for him to succeed.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka ukuba aphumelele.
But this is exactly it.	Kodwa oku kanye.
Please make your way forward.	Nceda wenze indlela yakho ukuya ngaphambili.
Then I knew who she was.	Ndandisazi ke ukuba ngubani.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.
Don't be hard on yourself!	Musa ukuba nzima kuwe!
There is a car in front.	Kukho imoto ngaphambili.
He wanted to stay there.	Wayefuna ukuhlala apho.
I wonder about that.	Ndiyazibuza ngaloo nto .
But it is a long time.	Kodwa lixesha elide.
Yes, it can be difficult.	Ewe, kunokuba nzima.
No one is there.	Akukho mntu apho.
He has to do it perfectly.	Ufanele akwenze oko ngokupheleleyo.
Sorry about that.	Ngawe uxolo kakhulu.
Now he asked this of her.	Ngoku wabuza oku kuye.
If you have.	Ukuba ukhe.
He thought that maybe he could do that.	Wayecinga ukuba mhlawumbi angayenza loo nto.
There is no way.	Akukho ndlela.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, uyenzile.
I have to do something about it.	Kufuneka ndenze into ngayo.
He talks a lot.	Uthetha kakhulu.
That's a bad thing.	Yinto embi leyo.
Very, really.	Kakhulu, ngokwenene.
I can't stay here.	Andikwazi ukuhlala apha.
How long will we stay.	Siya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
He went ahead.	Waya ngaphambili.
I know.	Ndiyazi.
He would do it.	Wayeza kuyenza.
He wanted to play.	Wayefuna ukudlala.
We did so.	Senze njalo ke.

Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazi.
I know exactly what happened.	Ndiyazi kakuhle into eyenzekayo.
.	.
I hope you will come soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uza kuza ngokukhawuleza.
I don't want to know things.	Andifuni ukwazi izinto.
He looked worse than he thought.	Wayekhangeleka embi kunokuba wayecinga.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
But one has to.	Kodwa umntu kufuneka.
He went to her.	Waya kuye.
I never thought so.	Khange ndicinge njalo.
This is probably.	Le mhlawumbi.
Maybe that's why.	Mhlawumbi yiloo nto.
I want you to know that very quickly.	Ndifuna uyazi ukuba ngokukhawuleza.
You know you're here.	Uyazi ukuba ulapha.
He will not.	Akayi.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
I know why you are here.	Ndiyazi ukuba kutheni ulapha.
This will be my reality.	Oku kuya kuba yinyani yam.
I don't really know.	Andikwazi ngokwenene.
Way, it is very difficult.	Indlela, kunzima kakhulu.
No one.	Akukho mntu.
Until this book.	Kude kube le ncwadi.
The food is good.	Ukutya kulungile.
That's all you need to know.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyazi.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
I am very much.	Mna kakhulu.
That can be difficult.	Oko kunokuba nzima.
Nothing to him.	Akukho nto kuye.
Not here, nowhere.	Hayi apha, akukho ndawo.
There is no reality there.	Akukho nyani apho.
Not so much, but something.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa into.
But then he understood.	Kodwa ke waqonda.
He had to be with her.	Kwafuneka abe naye.
This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
What's this? 	Yintoni le?
he asked.	wabuza.
He speaks well.	Uthetha kakuhle.
I'm sure he'll be with you soon.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uzakuba nawe kungekudala.
He never came home.	Akazange eze ekhaya.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
But he lives with it.	Kodwa uhlala nayo.
This is certainly not the case.	Oku akunjalo ngokuqinisekileyo.
You know who's going to have it.	Uyazi ukuba ngubani oza kuba nayo.
If you will be.	Ukuba uya kuba.
I can't do it now.	Andikwazi ukwenza ngoku.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
I go to work.	Ndiya emsebenzini.
But you do not have to.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze njalo.
All right.	Kulungile.
he asked.	wabuza.
He did well on his own.	Wenza kakuhle yedwa.
That, of course, will not be.	Oko, ngokuqinisekileyo, akayi kuba.
He should go now, he thought.	Kufuneka ahambe ngoku, wacinga.
He did it in the end.	Uyenzile ekugqibeleni.
He thought.	Wayecinga.
Probably everything.	Mhlawumbi yonke into.
He did not know what to do.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
I want to talk to you a little bit.	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe kancinci.
Yeah, really anything.	Ewe, ngokwenene nantoni na.
He finally told me so.	Ekugqibeleni wandixelela njalo.
Not here, not to him.	Hayi apha, hayi kuye.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
I had to make a decision.	Kwafuneka ndenze isigqibo.
That will be very visible.	Oko kuya kubonakala kakhulu.
He told me everything about it.	Wandixelela yonke into ngayo.
But enough to.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo ukuba.
I will do it again.	Ndiza kuphinda kwakhona.
you say.	uthi.
He did not want you to know.	Wayengafuni ukuba wazi.
To do anything with that.	Ukwenza nantoni na ngaloo nto.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
I did not know anyone.	Ndandingazi mntu omnye.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi.
This is difficult.	Oku kunzima.
I was thinking about you.	Bendicinga ngawe.
Someone has to make it happen.	Kufuneka umntu ayenze yenzeke.
We did things.	Senze izinto.
Definitely a place.	Ngokuqinisekileyo indawo.
I want to read a book.	Ndifuna ukufunda incwadi.
He did not want that.	Akazange afune oko.
I know what the problem is!	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki!
I do not know.	Andazi.
Something happened.	Kukho into eyenzekayo.
No one else spoke to him.	Akakho omnye umntu athethe naye.
So you have to tell.	Ngoko kufuneka uxelele.
Very, probably.	Kakhulu, mhlawumbi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
But nobody really.	Kodwa akukho mntu ngokwenene.
Travel is fine.	Ukuhamba kulungile.
It seems really hard.	Kubonakala kunzima ngokwenene.
But no.	Kodwa akukho.
It's so hard that way.	Kunzima kakhulu ngaloo ndlela.
He knew he had done it.	Wayesazi ukuba wenze njalo.
It should be easy.	Kufuneka kube lula.
Maybe I didn't want to know.	Mhlawumbi ndandingafuni ukwazi.
I can't believe he even wanted to do this.	Andikholelwa nokuba wayefuna ukuyenza le nto.
That is the problem.	Ingxaki ke leyo.
Money is needed.	Kufuneka imali.
Do you know that.	Ngaba uyazi loo nto.
I knew exactly where everyone was.	Ndandisazi kakuhle ukuba wonke umntu uphi.
You like it.	Uyayithanda.
You are right.	Uqinisekile.
We have to go there.	Kufuneka siye apho.
It means something is right.	Kuthetha ukuba kukho into elungileyo.
He didn't go very far.	Akazange ahambe kakhulu.
But not with him.	Kodwa hayi naye.
He says it's time.	Uthi lixesha.
He will not come to you.	Akayi kuza kuwe.
We need to do this.	Kufuneka siyenze le nto.
Is this possible.	Ngaba oku kunokwenzeka.
I would not want that.	Andiyi kufuna loo nto.
But there is.	Kodwa kukho.
I will stay.	Ndiza kuhlala.
Only he did not for sure.	Kuphela akazange ngokuqinisekileyo.
Someone did that, of course.	Kukho umntu owenza loo nto, ngokuqinisekileyo.
he thought.	wacinga.
No no no no no.	Hayi hayi hayi hayi hayi.
Whatever it was, he didn't know.	Nokuba yintoni na, wayengazi.
He is a man.	Yindoda.
And then.	Ke ngoku.
But you know what happens.	Kodwa uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
Or otherwise.	Okanye ngenye indlela.
I don't really know.	Andazi nyani.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka uyenze.
He didn't even know if he would be able to do it.	Wayengazi nokuba uya kukwazi na ukwenza.
This will be the case.	Oku kuya kuba njalo.
Long ago.	Kudala ke .
I feel bad.	Ndiziva kakubi.
I just thought you should know.	Ndicinge nje ukuba kufuneka uyazi.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
I want to know how you do it.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba wenza njani.
I just knew.	Ndandisazi nje.
What do you like to eat?	Uthanda ukutya ntoni?
I don't want to be you, either.	Andifuni ukuba nguwe, nam.
But he was not here.	Kodwa wayengekho apha.
Probably a lot more.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu ngakumbi.
In one way or another.	Ngendlela enye okanye enye.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
So I am the only one.	Ngoko ndim kuphela.
Sorry.	Uxolo.
I did so.	Ndenze njalo.
So, way, way, down.	Ngoko ke, indlela, indlela, phantsi.
Tell me it's not.	Ndixelele ukuba akunjalo.
I know my problem.	Ndiyayazi ingxaki yam.
It gets better, obviously.	Kuba ngcono, ngokucacileyo.
Book only.	Incwadi kuphela.
.	.
Now, another thing.	Ngoku, enye into.
Not so fast.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
I told her, nothing.	Ndamxelela, akukho nto.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
No one will stay here.	Akukho mntu uza kuhlala apha.
Or walking.	Okanye ukuhamba.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
So it will be again.	Ngoko kuya kuba njalo kwakhona.
I'm happy for you.	Ndiyavuya ngawe.
I would like to see that.	Ndingathanda ukubona oko.
I don't know what happened to it now.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kuyo ngoku.
Ok then.	Kulungile, ke.
He wants to stay there.	Ufuna ukuhlala apho.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
Very much this.	Kakhulu oku.
I will talk to him.	Ndiza kuthetha naye.
Does that mean.	Ngaba oko kuthetha.
But we know we will.	Kodwa siyazi ukuba siya kwenza njalo.
Not only at home but especially at work.	Hayi kuphela ekhaya kodwa ngakumbi emsebenzini.
Because he knew.	Kuba wayesazi.
I want something else.	Ndifuna enye into.
I will.	Ndiza.
There is something wonderful about that.	Kukho into entle kakhulu ngaloo nto.
Not just if you live there.	Hayi nje ukuba uhlala khona.
I knew it better than I did at school.	Ndandisazi ngcono kunokuba ndithethe ngayo esikolweni.
What the hell.	Yintoni.
Immediately.	Ngoko nangoko.
You need to act fast.	Kufuneka wenze ngokukhawuleza.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
As he wanted it to be.	Njengoko wayefuna ukuba kube njalo.
I did not know things otherwise.	Ndandingazi izinto ngenye indlela.
I do not know.	Andazi.
No, not now.	Hayi, hayi ngoku.
But, in the end, he said nothing.	Kodwa, ekugqibeleni, akazange athethe nto.
He did, too.	Uyenzile, naye.
Maybe there is such a thing.	Mhlawumbi kukho into enjalo.
To me, eating out is a big deal.	Kum, ukutya ngaphandle yinto enkulu.
I do not think he appeared.	Andiqondi ukuba wabonakala.
You do not have to do this now.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uyenze le nto ngoku.
He tried to speak but could not.	Wazama ukuthetha kodwa akakwazi.
However, you already know that.	Kodwa ke, sele uyazi ukuba.
Yes, a good man.	Ewe, umntu olungileyo.
I am again.	Ndim kwakhona.
That's all true.	Yonke loo nto yinyani.
This is not easy to do.	Oku akukho lula ukwenza.
It is not very easy to say.	Akukho lula kakhulu ukuthetha.
So you told me.	Undixelele ke wena.
There, it's better.	Apho, kungcono.
That's 'there'.	Nantso 'apho'.
That is it.	Yiyo le nto.
He did not seek employment.	Akazange afune umsebenzi.
Being alone in everything.	Ukuba wedwa kuyo yonke into.
I was thinking about you.	Bendicinga ngawe.
He wanted to drive, but could not.	Wayefuna ukuqhuba, kodwa akazange akwazi.
To be so.	Ukuze kube njalo.
And now, he thought.	Ke ngoku, wacinga.
I feel that way now.	Ndiziva njalo ngoku.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But not me and him.	Kodwa hayi mna naye.
Great.	Kakhulu.
He told me to do it.	Wandixelela ukuba wenze njalo.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
Well, not so much.	Ewe, hayi kakhulu.
Obviously.	Ngokucacileyo.
I knew something was coming.	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho into ezayo.
I'm afraid to do something.	Ndiyoyika ukwenza into.
I did not think.	Khange ndicinge.
Sorry.	Uxolo.
I don't think it's a bad thing.	Andiqondi ukuba yinto embi.
That's all he has.	Yinto yakhe yonke leyo.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.
I don't want to talk about it.	Andifuni kuthetha ngayo.
I really never thought about it.	Ngokwenene andizange ndicinge ngayo.
He lives at work.	Uhlala emsebenzini.
He had to do so.	Kwafuneka enjenjalo.
I thought it was okay.	Bendicinga ukuba kulungile.
He did not want to do this.	Wayengafuni ukuyenza le nto.
I don't even know why.	Andazi nokuba kutheni.
He wanted to be alone.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa.
I'm sure it isn't.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akunjalo.
Someone else did.	Omnye umntu wenza njalo.
You know what this is.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni le.
I know nothing about that.	Andazi nto ngaloo nto.
Probably a lot of the time.	Mhlawumbi ixesha elininzi.
Well, enough.	Kulungile, ngokwaneleyo.
So, for a long time.	Ngoko, ixesha elide.
I do not know.	Andazi.
I'm so sorry, so sorry.	Uxolo kakhulu, uxolo kakhulu.
I can't talk to you.	Andikwazi kuthetha nawe.
He did not know what to do.	Wayengazi ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
But only in this area.	Kodwa kuphela kule ndawo.
Definitely no problem.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho ngxaki.
Just then,	Nje ngoko,
He didn't have to leave now.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba ahambe ngoku.
I had to think fast.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngokukhawuleza.
Yes, so far.	Ewe, kude kube ngoku.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
That's me.	Ndim ke lowo.
So it will be seen.	Ngoko kuya kubonakala.
He wasn't, but you know.	Wayengekho, kodwa uyazi.
I can't say when.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba nini.
Obviously, one outside.	Ngokucacileyo, enye ngaphandle.
He lives alone now.	Uhlala yedwa ngoku.
He did it in the end.	Uyenzile ekugqibeleni.
But he did not think so.	Kodwa akazange acinge njalo.
Not far away.	Akukho kude.
One tomorrow.	Omnye ngomso.
In the same way.	Ngendlela enye.
One knows it.	Omnye uyayazi.
The more things, the better.	Izinto ezininzi, ngcono.
I don't think so.	Ndicinga ukuba akunjalo.
Again, it is not.	Kwakhona, akunjalo.
I'm sure he didn't.	Ndiqinisekile akazange.
I don't know about this.	Andazi ngale nto.
Too many ways.	Indlela ezininzi kakhulu.
But he knew.	Kodwa wayesazi.
What he wants.	Into ayifunayo.
This?	Le nto?
It's hard to do.	Kunzima ukwenza.
He lives in it.	Uhlala kuyo.
One big problem.	Ingxaki enye enkulu.
Can anyone do that.	Ngaba umntu angayenza loo nto.
He said he knew it.	Wathi uyayazi.
As it will be easier.	Njengoko kuya kuba lula.
If that is it.	Ukuba yiloo nto.
To stay with him.	Ukuze ahlale naye.
He was not.	Wayengekho.
So what.	Ngoko ke yintoni.
That is a fact no one wants to talk about.	Leyo yinyani akukho mntu ufuna ukuthetha ngayo.
I can't do one job.	Andikwazi ukwenza umsebenzi omnye.
He never said that.	Akazange athethe loo nto.
He did not have to.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
he thought.	wacinga.
Or talk about it.	Okanye ukuthetha ngayo.
So why did you do that?	Ngoko kutheni uyenzile loo nto?
Probably him.	Mhlawumbi kuye.
This is good.	Oku kulungile.
He did so immediately.	Wenze njalo kwangoko.
He must stay with us.	Ufanele ahlale nathi.
He did so.	Wenze njalo.
I can't walk.	Andikwazi ukuhamba.
He will be here.	Uzakuba lapha.
You want so much.	Ufuna kakhulu.
He said he did not.	Wathi akazange.
I just know it.	Ndiyayazi nje.
Everyone knows the person.	Wonke umntu uyazi umntu.
Certainly not, he thought.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo, wacinga njalo.
I didn't really want to know.	Ndandingafuni ukwazi nyani.
I can not speak.	Andikwazi ukuthetha.
It is a good thing to do.	Yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
It's hard.	Kunzima.
Ultimately, one has to make a decision.	Ekugqibeleni, umntu kufuneka enze isigqibo.
A little bit.	Kancinci.
I had to do.	Kwafuneka ndenze.
Ready to go.	Le ukuhamba.
One of me probably knows that better.	Omnye wam mhlawumbi uyayazi ngakumbi loo nto.
He did not know anyone.	Wayengazi mntu.
You should be here now.	Bekufanele ukuba ulapha ngoku.
He did not think it was possible.	Wayengacingi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I need to talk to her now.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ngoku.
Just to help.	Ukunceda nje.
There is plenty of room.	Kukho indawo eninzi.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona.
Only.	Kuphela.
I want more.	Ndifuna kakhulu.
You do not really want that to happen.	Awufuni ngokwenene ukuba oko kwenzeke.
I'm not entirely sure.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo.
You should have known better.	Bekufanele ukuba uyazi ngcono.
It had to be that way.	Kwafuneka kube njalo.
you say.	uthi.
Staying with us.	Ukuhlala nathi.
That's it.	Yiyo.
Nobody lives there.	Akukho mntu uhlala apho.
Finally you must say no.	Ekugqibeleni kufuneka uthi hayi.
Slowly, but surely.	Kancinci, kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo.
But tomorrow it will be.	Kodwa ngomso uya kuba.
Not too long ago.	Kungekudala kakhulu.
But it is difficult.	Kodwa kunzima.
I want to find out.	Ndifuna ukufumana.
He had to look for food.	Kwafuneka afune ukutya.
It's one thing or another.	Yinto enye okanye enye.
We'll talk about that later.	Siza kuthetha ngaloo nto kamva.
Sorry about that, then.	Uxolo ngawe, ke.
It is very difficult to talk about it.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuthetha ngayo.
Maybe it should have been.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele ukuba kube njalo.
I did very well.	Ndenze kakuhle kakhulu.
If you think you don’t want to, you are not going.	Ukuba ucinga ukuba awufuni, awuyi.
No, no, no.	Hayi, hayi, hayi.
Tell me again.	Ndixelele kwakhona.
You will talk about it.	Uya kuthetha ngayo.
I would like to stay.	Ndingathanda ukuhlala .
If not.	Ukuba akunjalo.
This happens often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo.
But maybe not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He did much better.	Wenza ngcono kakhulu.
We will be together.	Siya kuba kunye.
Or just me.	Okanye ndim nje.
I just want you to know.	Ndifuna nje ukuba wazi.
Time passed with him.	Kwaphela ixesha naye.
Is he.	Ngaba nguye.
I want to see something.	Ndifuna ukubona into.
But, there seems to be a problem.	Kodwa, kubonakala kukho ingxaki.
I know what's right now.	Ndiyazi into elungileyo ngoku.
He does not need to be rude.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba athethe kakubi.
Not a day.	Hayi imini.
Long, long ago.	Kudala, kudala kakhulu.
Time travel is possible.	Ukuhamba ixesha kunokwenzeka.
Everyone knew.	Wonke umntu wayesazi.
Certainly not!	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo!
if possible.	ukuba kunokuba.
He won't have that.	Akayi kuba nayo loo nto.
He did not do so.	Akazange enze njalo.
He had to come.	Kwafuneka eze.
I can't walk for long.	Andikwazi ukuhamba ixesha elide.
I can't win with him.	Andikwazi ukuphumelela naye.
I don't really know how to do this.	Andazi nyani ukuba ndingayenza njani le nto.
Not with him, that's for sure.	Hayi kunye naye, oko ngokuqinisekileyo.
I thought it was impossible.	Ndandicinga ukuba akunakwenzeka.
Is this okay.	Ngaba oku kulungile.
I can do that place.	Ndingayenza loo ndawo.
He wants to be a man.	Uyafuna ukuba yindoda.
He did not think where he was.	Khange acinge ukuba uphi.
Don't drive too fast!	Musa ukuqhuba ngokukhawuleza!
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka wenze.
You are that person.	Nguwe loo mntu.
He tried to speak, but he could not speak.	Wazama ukuthetha, kodwa akakwazi ukuthetha.
He made a decision.	Wenza isigqibo.
He just doesn't know it.	Akayazi nje.
He wanted to be away from her.	Wayefuna ukuba kude naye.
I just want you.	Ndifuna nje wena.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
No, no dog.	Hayi, hayi inja.
He didn't have her, for that.	Akazange naye, ngaloo nto.
What you need to do.	Into ekufuneka uyenzile.
No, nothing yet.	Hayi, akukho nto okwangoku.
I want to learn from you.	Ndifuna ukufunda kuwe.
He always thought.	Wayecinga njalo.
There is so much to do.	Kukho into eninzi yokwenza.
That is true enough.	Yinyani ngokwaneleyo leyo.
Outside, it is not.	Ngaphandle, akunjalo.
What's wrong.	Yintoni embi.
Not anything.	Hayi nantoni na.
I did not tell him otherwise.	Khange ndimxelele ngenye indlela.
He has done that before.	Uyenzile loo nto ngaphambili.
He did not want to talk any more.	Akazange afune ukuthetha ngakumbi.
Very much.	Kakhulu kakhulu.
Well, there you are.	Kulungile, nantso.
But that is exactly what it is.	Kodwa yiloo nto kanye.
I think soon.	Ndicinga ukuba kungekudala.
He had to make a decision.	Kwafuneka enze isigqibo.
This will make your job easier, even more so.	Oku kuya kwenza umsebenzi wakho ube lula, ngakumbi.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Maybe you're here.	Mhlawumbi ulapha.
But he did not know why.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi.
I just don’t know how to do it.	Andazi nje ukuba ndenze njani.
Maybe that will go a long way.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kude.
I don't think anyone is going to make it a problem.	Andiqondi ukuba kukho umntu oza kuyenza ingxaki.
Definitely human.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngumntu.
So much for that.	Kakhulu ngaloo nto.
I thought he was going to go.	Ndandicinga ukuba uza kuya.
I did not speak to him.	Khange ndithethe naye.
I know that, now.	Ndiyayazi loo nto, ngoku.
What's the matter with you? 	Ingaba yintoni ingxaki nawe?
He has to leave right away.	Kufuneka ahambe kwangoko.

He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
I'm not sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto.
He did not want her to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuba ahambe.

Nobody did that again.	Akukho mntu wenza loo nto kwakhona.
He always thought.	Wayecinga njalo.

Nothing.	Akukho nto.
Please make a good person.	Nceda wenze umntu olungileyo.

With him.	Naye.
He made that happen.	Uyenze ukuba yenzeke loo nto.
I would like.	Ndingathanda.
I don't know if that's a good thing.	Andazi ukuba yinto entle leyo.
Now, he thought.	Ngoku, wacinga.
But he is.	Kodwa nguye.
Now you know.	Ngoku uyazi.
I can't speak right now.	Andikwazi kuthetha okwangoku.
Everyone knows now.	Wonke umntu uyazi ngoku.
I did not want to talk.	Ndandingafuni kuthetha.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akazange acinge njalo.
He certainly did not.	Ngenene akazange.
It will be the same for everyone.	Kuya kuba njalo wonke umntu.
Not for me.	Hayi kum.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo ngayo yonke into.
Or talk about it.	Okanye ukuthetha ngayo.
I'm sure it isn't.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akunjalo.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni kuthetha.
What do you think.	Ucinga ntoni.
He’s here, but, not for long.	Ulapha, kodwa, hayi ixesha elide.
So he has to do it.	Ngoko ufanele ayenze.
Someone is here.	Kukho umntu apha.
He will not come.	Akayi kuza.
He told me why.	Undixelele ukuba kutheni.
We need to make it happen.	Kufuneka siyenze yenzeke.
Really? 	Ngokwenene?
you say.	uthi.
He too is doing well.	Naye wenza kakuhle.
He lives in me.	Uhlala kum.
I can't say anything about that.	Andikwazi ukuthetha nantoni na ngaloo nto.
Not so for me.	Akunjalo kum.
So who ?.	Khona ngubani?.
I want you to do what you want to do.	Ndifuna ukuba wenze le nto ufuna ukuyenza.
I don't know where it is now.	Andazi ukuba iphi ngoku.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
Now, I am.	Ngoku, ndim.
I can't stay.	Andikwazi kuhlala.
I don't know if that's true.	Andazi ukuba yinyani leyo.
He wanted a job.	Wayefuna umsebenzi.
Now you know better.	Ngoku wazi ngcono.
Tomorrow, we will both be better.	Ngomso, sobabini siya kuba ngcono.
It is simply not possible.	Akunakwenzeka nje.
You only have to do it once.	Kufuneka uyenze kube kanye kuphela.
I can't walk.	Andikwazi ukuhamba.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I hope you are doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza kakuhle.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
But in the end.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni.
Slowly, he began to talk.	Kancinci kancinci, waqalisa ukuthetha.
I will do it.	Ndiza kuyenza.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
No! 	Hayi!
I could not do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza.
It's a really big deal.	Yinto enkulu ngokwenene.
Not so much now.	Hayi kakhulu ngoku.
You go far.	Uya kude.
Not so much, though, he thought.	Hayi kakhulu, nokuba, wacinga.
It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
Just one thing.	Into nje enye.
That is true enough.	Yinyani ngokwaneleyo leyo.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
You do not want to know why someone is doing something.	Awufuni ukwazi ukuba kutheni umntu enze into.
he asked.	wabuza.
Where are we going?	Apho siya khona?
Like me.	Njengam.
But you did well.	Kodwa wenze kakuhle.
I certainly hope not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
Would you like this too ?.	Ngaba nawe ungathanda oku?.
He doesn't have to be.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba abe njalo.
To me it is not so much.	Kum akukho nto ingako kangako.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He doesn't want to talk to me.	Akafuni kuthetha nam.
I never really knew.	Andizange ndikwazi ngokwenene.
I did the right thing.	Ndenze into elungileyo.
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
If you want.	Ukuba uyafuna.
But that's okay, he thought.	Kodwa oko kulungile, wacinga.
.	.
No one wanted to.	Akukho mntu wayefuna.
In the end, he did nothing.	Ekugqibeleni, akazange enze nto.
He wanted to know what it was.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
OK OK.	Kulungile kulungile.
You just have to be yourself.	Kufuneka nje ube nguwe.
Yes, it is time.	Ewe, lixesha.
I wish he came here.	Ndinqwenela ukuba eze apha.
You have probably done this before.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyenzile le nto ngaphambili.
I do not know tomorrow.	Andikwazi ngomso.
For today, or.	Kuba namhlanje, okanye.
But it is very difficult to do.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
What will happen to you?	Kuya kwenzeka ntoni kuwe?
He just doesn't want to.	Akafuni nje.
He thought a little.	Wayecinga kancinci.
New.	Entsha.
What you really like.	Oko uthanda ngokwenene.
You want to see everything out there.	Ufuna ukubona yonke into yakho ngaphandle.
But he did not want to think about it again.	Kodwa wayengafuni kuphinda acinge ngayo.
I don't want.	Andifuni.
But it is very difficult to read.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ukufunda.
He did everything well.	Wenza yonke into kakuhle.
I know this now.	Ndiyayazi le nto ngoku.
I don't know what to do.	Andazi ukuba senze ntoni.
Everyone loves it.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda.
That is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko oko.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni kuthetha.
We will be.	Siya kuba.
No no no.	Hayi hayi hayi.
He wanted very much.	Wayefuna kakhulu.
He would do everything.	Wayeza kwenza yonke into.
There is a truth in you.	Kukho inyani kuwe.
He is no better.	Akakho ngcono.
Well, that's exactly what happened.	Ewe, yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
Really very.	Ngokwenene kakhulu.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
I only did the work.	Ndenze umsebenzi kuphela.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto ngokwenene.
I want you to know something.	Ndifuna wazi into.
I'm a little scared of it.	Ndiyoyika kancinci ngayo.
Yes to all of that.	Ewe kuyo yonke loo nto.
It seems like everyone.	Kubonakala ngathi wonke umntu.
I just want to run a business.	Ndifuna nje ukuqhuba umsebenzi.
That was not necessary.	Oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Uqinisekile ukuba ufuna ukwenza oku?
He wanted to leave immediately.	Wayefuna ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
I've never been there before.	Andizange ndiye apho ngaphambili.
Well, that's what it is.	Ke, yiloo nto ke.
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi.
He needs help.	Ufuna uncedo.
His way.	Indlela yakhe.
I want you to do something.	Ndifuna ukuba wenze into.
You have to do this.	Kufuneka wenze oku.
You know it.	Uyakwazi.
If there is, you can have it.	Ukuba kukho, unokuba nayo.
I don't know what the problem is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
But that is not possible out here.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka ngaphandle apha.
No, he thought.	Hayi, wacinga.
But he didn't, he couldn't.	Kodwa akazange, akazange akwazi.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
But that can be very far away.	Kodwa oko kunokuba kude kakhulu.
I am very sure.	Ndiqinisekile kakhulu.
Probably impossible.	Mhlawumbi akunakwenzeka.
But he did.	Kodwa uyenzile.
Cars	Imoto
You are here.	Ulapha.
Someone will come.	Umntu uza kuza.
Very really.	Kakhulu ngokwenene.
He started.	Waqalisa.
No one deserves it.	Akukho mntu ufanele.
Of course no one is going to do this.	Ewe akukho mntu uza kuyenza le nto.
I knew he would do that.	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kuyenza loo nto.
Maybe not too soon.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala nje.
It has to happen fast.	Kufuneka kwenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
Or maybe yes, but not for you.	Okanye mhlawumbi ewe, kodwa hayi kuwe.
I never went there.	Andizange ndiye apho.
Nice place.	Indawo entle.
Maybe you will.	Mhlawumbi uya kuba.
That is good for me.	Oko kulungile kum.
I wondered what the problem was.	Ndandicinga ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
But no one does everything.	Kodwa akukho mntu wenza yonke into.
That's it.	Yiloo nto.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
Can you do it.	Ngaba uyakwazi ukwenza.
He tried that morning.	Wazama ngaloo ntsasa.
Is true.	Yinyani.
I think we did.	Ndicinga ukuba senze njalo.
She likes my coffee.	Uyayithanda ikofu yam.
But he is not.	Kodwa akakho.
Again a little bit.	Kwakhona kancinci.
I have never made one so big before.	Andizange ndenze enye enkulu kangaka ngaphambili.
I know you want to go to work.	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukuya emsebenzini.
Whatever this is.	Nokuba yintoni le.
But no, it's not.	Kodwa hayi, akunjalo.
I don't know why, exactly.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, kanye.
Everyone wants to know about it.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukwazi ngayo.
Now then, tell me.	Ngoku ke, ndixelele.
He looked alone.	Wayekhangeleka eyedwa.
Really.	Ngokwenene.
We did it last night.	Senze phezolo.
There is someone there who would like to talk to you.	Kukho umntu apho angathanda ukuthetha nawe.
He wants forgiveness.	Ufuna uxolo.
I know he knew.	Ndiyazi ukuba wayesazi.
I know that well enough.	Ndiyayazi loo nto ngokwaneleyo.
Not you, obviously.	Hayi wena, ngokucacileyo.
Or anyone, for that matter.	Okanye nabani na, ngaloo nto.
But later.	Kodwa kamva.
He immediately got started.	Ngokukhawuleza waqalisa.
I thought you might like it.	Bendicinga ukuba ungathanda.
He did not just walk away.	Akazange ahambe kuphela.
There is nothing there.	Akukho nto apho.
I had to make this happen.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze le nto yenzeke.
I'll talk to you later.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kamva.
Yeah, you know.	Ewe, uyazi.
No one likes a good person at all.	Akukho mntu uthanda umntu olungileyo kuyo yonke into.
You know exactly why.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba kutheni.
Everything.	Yonke into .
Have you ever been there?	Ngaba ukhe waya apho?
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku.
He wanted to be with us.	Wayefuna ukuba nathi.
Now, there is another way.	Ngoku, kukho enye indlela.
Or not alone.	Okanye hayi wedwa.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
It is not easy before.	Akukho lula ngaphambili.
Time again you have realized.	Ixesha kwakhona uye waqonda.
Maybe, but not soon.	Mhlawumbi, kodwa hayi kungekudala.
I did not tell him anything.	Khange ndimxelele nto.
I had no idea what was going to happen.	Ndandingazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
Sorry, but.	Uxolo, kodwa .
That's another job.	Omnye umsebenzi lowo.
He lives far away.	Uhlala kude.
All right.	Kulungile.
Not enough.	Akukho ngokwaneleyo.
If he ever did.	Ukuba ukhe enze njalo.
He agreed with me.	Wavuma nam.
You know you will.	Uyazi uya kwenza.
Someone or something.	Umntu okanye into leyo.
No one else.	Akukho mntu omnye.
But we will.	Kodwa siza kwenza njalo.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Why do you want that.	Kutheni ufuna lonto.
This can be very difficult.	Oku kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
I went at night.	Ndiye ebusuku.
That's not it.	Asiyonto leyo.
You have to do it now.	Kufuneka wenze ngoku.
He thought of going for help.	Wacinga ukuya kufuna uncedo.
He wanted very much for a long time.	Wayefuna kakhulu ixesha elide.
No one wanted to play.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukudlala.
Or bad for you.	Okanye kakubi kuwe.
He didn't know if he could do it.	Wayengazi ukuba angayenza na loo nto.
He does everything.	Wenza yonke into.
But you have thought about it.	Kodwa uye wacinga ngayo.
Well, you know that.	Ewe, uyayazi loo nto.
I do not know.	Andazi.
I want you to stay here with me.	Ndifuna uhlala apha nam.
In it.	Kuyo.
I did not go there.	Khange ndiye apho.
It's hard to say.	Kunzima ukuthetha.
Not for you and me.	Hayi kuwe nawe.
You have to do it this way.	Kufuneka wenze ngale ndlela.
I think that's him.	Ndicinga ukuba nguye lowo.
No one asked why.	Akukho mntu wabuza ukuba kutheni.
Soon, it will be.	Kungekudala, kuya kuba njalo.
I had no idea what was going on.	Ndandingazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na.
Finding time !.	Ukufumana ixesha!.
But he did.	Kodwa uyenzile.
He looked at this one.	Wajonga lo.
No one is going to do it.	Akukho mntu uya kuyenza.
I doubt anyone will do it.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba nabani na uya kuyenza.
He had done this once before.	Wakhe wakwenza oku kanye ngaphambili.
But he knew.	Kodwa wayesazi.
Something happened to him.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuye.
He talks a lot.	Uthetha kakhulu.
Work is time.	Umsebenzi lixesha.
I had to talk to him.	Kwafuneka ndithethe naye.
I want that now.	Ndifuna oko ngoku.
He stayed a long time.	Wahlala ixesha elide.
He did so.	Wenza njalo.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
All right, tomorrow morning.	Kulungile, ngomso kusasa.
He did it alone.	Uyenze wedwa.
Just now.	Ngoku.
A little bit.	Kancinci.
Everyone knew about it.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ngayo.
He does not want to leave.	Akafuni ukuhamba.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mhlawumbi yinto elungileyo.
Maybe you too.	Mhlawumbi nawe.
I'm scared of it.	Ndiyoyika ngayo.
I know everything.	Ndikwazi yonke into.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
But until then.	Kodwa kude kube ngoko.
I will be human.	Ndiya kuba ngumntu.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi kuyenza le nto.
Certainly there is.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho.
He knew very well.	Wayesazi kakhulu.
He did not come.	Akazange eze.
You know it too.	Nawe uyayazi.
I never did that.	Zange ndiyenze lonto.
I am very happy about it.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ngayo.
I want to do the right thing.	Ndifuna ukwenza into elungileyo.
He did it this morning.	Uyenzile ngale ntsasa.
I never thought of anything else.	Andizange ndicinge enye into.
Or he said he did.	Okanye uthe wenza njalo.
I did it clearly.	Ndenze ngokucacileyo.
But it can be very difficult.	Kodwa kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
I will not say.	Andiyi kuthetha.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
What happened tonight.	Kwenzeka ntoni ngokuhlwanje.
It seems impossible right now.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka okwangoku.
I don't want to do anything about it.	Andifuni kwenza nto ngayo.
He knew.	Wayesazi.
He stayed there all day.	Wahlala khona imini yonke.
But please.	Kodwa nceda.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
Time to do it now.	Ixesha lokwenza ngoku.
He knew everything.	Wayesazi yonke into.
He is talking about us.	Uthetha ngathi.
Great.	Enkulu.
Everyone just stared.	Wonke umntu wajonga nje.
There is not much to do, but something.	Akukho nto ingako yokwenza, kodwa into.
So do you.	Ngoko ke wena.
Soon, very quickly.	Kungekudala, ngokukhawuleza.
Everyone felt it.	Wonke umntu waziva.
Nobody did.	Akukho mntu wenza.
i don't like it.	andiyithandi.
Maybe that's why.	Mhlawumbi yiloo nto.
It's just true.	Yinyani nje.
That's him.	Nguye lowo.
I think so .	Ndicinga njalo .
He said he was not there.	Wathi wayengekho.
But not here, not now.	Kodwa hayi apha, hayi ngoku.
But he did.	Kodwa uyenzile.
Or someone else.	Okanye omnye umntu.
And so it happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto ke.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Not otherwise !!!.	Hayi ngenye indlela !!!.
Or go here.	Okanye ukuhamba apha.
, '.	, '.
Only.	Kuphela.
You too.	Nawe nam.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi ukuba uphi.
Did you do the right thing? 	Ngaba wenze into elungileyo?
I don't know what you think.	Andazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
One thing, really.	Into enye, ngenene.
It's hard to see.	Kunzima ukubona.
Do not make this difficult.	Musa ukuyenza nzima le nto.
I thought about this all day long.	Bendicinga ngale nto imini yonke.
I was thinking about you yesterday.	Bendicinga ngawe izolo.
Not really my thing.	Hayi nyani into yam.
I can't stay home today.	Andikwazi ukuhlala ekhaya namhlanje.
But this is not the case now.	Kodwa oku akunjalo ngoku.
Or even better.	Okanye ngcono ngakumbi.
Not too long now.	Hayi ixesha elide ngoku.
You know it.	Uyakwazi.
I know he is.	Ndiyazi ukuba nguye.
Not when you think about it.	Hayi xa ucinga ngayo.
It has to happen.	Kufuneka kwenzeke.
I did not say that.	Khange ndithethe ngendlela.
I will be ahead.	Ndiza kuba ngaphambili.
It happens all the time.	Kwenzeka rhoqo.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni.
I don't want to be that way.	Andifuni ukuba njalo.
He did not speak on his own.	Zange athethe yedwa.
For now.	Okwangoku.
Well, maybe not at all.	Ewe, mhlawumbi hayi ngokupheleleyo.
Not so with us.	Akunjalo nathi kuphela.
There is nothing he would like better.	Akukho nto angathanda ngcono.
If you feel that way.	Ukuba uziva njalo.
We need to do something about it.	Kufuneka senze into ngaloo nto.
Is a big problem now.	Ngaba ingxaki enkulu ngoku.
That's all right.	Yinyani yonke loo nto.
He did that.	Uyenzile loo nto.
You know it well.	Wazi kakuhle.
I think that's true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani leyo.
However, this is not the case.	Kodwa ke, akunjalo.
But this is not the case here.	Kodwa oku akunjalo apha.
No one, really.	Akukho mntu, ngokwenene.
Not long ago, not now, not later.	Akukho kudala, akukho ngoku, akukho kamva.
Not when he came so far.	Hayi xa eze kude kangaka.
To do that.	Ukwenza oko.
He looked away quickly.	Wajonga kude ngokukhawuleza.
He never did.	Akazange enjenjalo.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona.
That's what it is.	Yiyo ke le nto.
What, he did not know.	Yintoni, wayengazi.
True, it is true.	Yinyani, yinyani.
Maybe better than, you know, anyone who has done it before.	Mhlawumbi ngcono kunokuba, uyazi, nabani na wenze ngaphambili.
I don't like it here.	Andiyithandi apha.
It's hard to see.	Kunzima ukubona.
He's here now.	Ulapha ngoku.
He said, it is you.	Wathi, nguwe.
You just told me.	Undixelele nje.
This you need to know.	Oku kufuneka ukwazi.
There is simply no way.	Akukho ndlela nje.
That's it.	Yiyo loo nto.
Now he knew why.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
You told me that.	Undixelele lonto.
I don't know what will happen.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
This is true.	Le yinyani.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
Yes, it is.	Ewe, yinyani.
he asked.	wabuza.
All right.	Kulungile.
But maybe this is me.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ndim lo.
Where you want to be.	Apho ufuna ukuba khona.
He started talking to me.	Waqalisa ukuthetha nam.
He wanted to stay.	Wayefuna ukuhlala.
He did not want to go there.	Wayengafuni ukuya apho.
I know right.	Ndiyayazi kulungile.
So, it's true.	Ngoko, yinyani.
Why is he doing this?	Kutheni esenza le nto nje?
I have to say something.	Kufuneka ndithethe into.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
I did not tell him anything.	Khange ndimxelele nto.
Are you sure?.	Ingaba uqinisekile?.
I really want to do this.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukwenza oku.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Would he ever appear to her again? 	Ngaba wayeza kuphinda abonakale kuye?
Whatever.	Nokuba yintoni na.
you say.	uthi.
You think badly.	Ucinga kakubi.
Or so everyone thought.	Okanye ke wonke umntu wayecinga.
But not bad.	Kodwa hayi kakubi.
But this is something new.	Kodwa le yinto entsha.
I want you and me.	Ndifuna wena kunye nam.
You did.	Wenze.
This is true.	Le yinyani.
He finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni wavuma.
You.	Wena.
But one thing.	Kodwa into enye.
I hope it is true.	Ndiyathemba ukuba yinyani.
I know you did.	Ndiyazi ukuba wenze njalo.
Or maybe he just couldn't.	Okanye mhlawumbi akazange akwazi.
Not far now.	Akukho kude ngoku.
We go to school tomorrow.	Siya esikolweni kusasa.
That certainly is not the case.	Oko ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
At least.	Kungcono.
I wonder why.	Ingaba kutheni.
I'm trying to find a house.	Ndizama ukufumana indlu.
I thought it was just me.	Bendicinga ukuba ndim nje.
Me, too.	Nam, ngokwenene.
He finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni wavuma.
You will come to me.	Uya kuza kum.
He never said that, but.	Akazange athethe loo nto kanye, kodwa.
I could not find a way to do this.	Andizange ndikwazi ukufumana indlela yokwenza oku.
It will not be so.	Akuyi kuba njalo.
So why.	Ngoko kutheni.
Work, work.	Umsebenzi, umsebenzi.
I don't know how you know, but you know.	Andazi ukuba wazi njani, kodwa uyazi.
You have to tell me the truth.	Kufuneka undixelele inyani.
I really wonder this.	Ndiyazibuza ngokwenene oku.
I'm trying to say something more.	Ndizama ukuthetha enye into ngakumbi.
You want a bad one.	Ufuna enye embi.
.	.
I said nothing the other way around.	Khange ndithethe nto ngenye indlela.
I know that is possible.	Ndiyazi ukuba oko kunokwenzeka.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu.
Food comes quickly.	Ukutya kuza ngokukhawuleza.
I think we did very well with that.	Ndicinga ukuba senze kakuhle kakhulu ngaloo nto.
You want to play.	Ufuna ukudlala.
Of course, this is good enough.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, oku kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
That's all he wants.	Yiloo nto kuphela ayifunayo.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
Beautiful new house.	Indlu entle entsha.
He wanted to run things his own way.	Wayefuna ukuqhuba izinto ngendlela yakhe.
It is clear how you feel.	Kucacile ukuba uziva njani.
Not you.	Hayi nawe.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
Is it okay for you.	Ngaba kulungile ukuba wena .
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Or have it.	Okanye ube nayo.
You know that well.	Uyayazi kakuhle loo nto.
I'm not sure how it happened.	Andazi ncam ukuba kwenzeke njani.
I certainly did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndenze njalo.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
You've done it.	Ukhe wenza.
But I can't.	Kodwa andikwazi.
I'm not going anywhere.	andiyi ndawo.
Saying the right thing.	Ukuthetha into elungileyo.
That can be so.	Oko kunokuba njalo.
I knew it.	Ndandisazi.
I had no idea how to do it.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndenze njani.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
Don't read too much into it.	Musa ukufunda kakhulu kuyo.
He did not want trouble.	Wayengafuni ngxaki.
You better do that.	Kungcono wenze oko.
So he told me.	Undixelele ke.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi lonto.
He said he would like that.	Wathi angathanda oko.
I want to speak clearly.	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngokucacileyo.
He checked the time.	Wajonga ixesha.
The way.	Indlela.
He asked to drive.	Wacela ukuqhuba.
Only that far.	Kuphela ukuba kude.
We did.	Senze.
You really deserve it.	Ufanele ngokwenene.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Someone has to talk.	Kufuneka umntu athethe.
It will be.	Kuya kuba.
You say that.	Uthetha lonto.
I don't have to talk to you.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndithethe nawe.
Yes, that's right!	Ewe, kulungile!
Or someone, by that.	Okanye umntu, ngaloo nto.
I will be with you.	Ndiya kuba nawe.
I do not know who he is.	Andazi ukuba ngubani.
He said no.	Wathi akunjalo.
He certainly never mentioned it to me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazange athethe ngayo kum.
That's the only way to do it.	Yiloo ndlela kuphela yokwenza oko.
Or so he thought.	Okanye wayecinga njalo.
Now, he thought.	Ngoku, wacinga.
I want you to tell me what you think.	Ndifuna undixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
No, no, no.	Hayi, hayi, hayi.
I don't know how that happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oko.
I think he will be here soon.	Ndicinga ukuba uzakuba lapha kungekudala.
And this is what happens.	Yiloo nto ke eyenzekayo.
I'll stay here.	Ndiza kuhlala apha.
I'm not even sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba yintoni na.
But what happens, you want to talk.	Kodwa kwenzeka ntoni, ufuna ukuthetha.
What are you standing here for?	Umele ntoni ke apha?
No one else does that on a regular basis.	Akakho omnye umntu owenza loo nto rhoqo.
I made coffee.	Ndenze ikofu.
Or a car ?.	Okanye imoto?.
No, until later.	Hayi, kude kube kamva.
He says he wants money.	Uthi ufuna imali.
If there is anything to get.	Ukuba kukho nantoni na ukufumana.
And then,	Ke ngoku,
I do not want to stay here.	Andifuni kuhlala apha.
No, no sorry.	Hayi, hayi uxolo.
He said he did probably.	Wathi uyenzile mhlawumbi.
What the hell?.	Yintoni?.
That's a very good thing.	Yinto entle kakhulu.
Or will you want to.	Okanye ngaba uya kufuna.
Well, what could be the problem.	Ewe, ingaba yintoni ingxaki.
Only.	Kuphela.
Now, of course, maybe it could be much better.	Ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo, mhlawumbi kunokuba ngcono kakhulu.
Please help.	Nceda wenze uncedo.
Ability to eat.	Kukwazi ukutya.
This will be even more difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
Everyone seems to be something to you.	Wonke umntu ubonakala ngathi yinto kuwe.
He made a decision.	Wenza isigqibo.
I don’t know what I did, really.	Andazi ukuba ndenze ntoni, ngokwenene.
In fact, he never said a word.	Ukuthetha inyani, akazange athethe nto kwaphela.
I'm sure I do too.	Ndiqinisekile nam.
Now he knew that was not the case.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba akunjalo.
One day it will be very difficult for you.	Ngenye imini kuya kuba nzima kakhulu kuwe.
But something, something.	Kodwa into, into.
He stays with me all day.	Uhlala nam imini yonke.
He had to do this.	Kwafuneka ayenze le nto.
You are sure of this.	Uqinisekile ngale nto.
So it happened.	Ngoko kwenzeka.
He could not say exactly what that was.	Akazange akwazi ukuthetha ukuba yintoni kanye kanye leyo.
I, here I am.	Mna, ndim lo.
He can't be far away.	Akakwazi ukuba kude.
Time.	Ixesha.
I feel that way.	Ndiziva njalo.
You know that too.	Nawe uyayazi lonto.
Is that, yes.	Ngaba oko, ewe.
At last.	Ekugqibeleni.
But this is not the case today.	Kodwa oku akunjalo namhlanje.
Later, he said, but not now.	Kamva, wathi, kodwa hayi ngoku.
For so long.	Ixesha elide kangaka.
Not far from it.	Hayi kude kuyo.
This book is for everyone.	Le ncwadi yakhe wonke umntu.
I don't think so.	Andiqondi ukuba akunjalo.
Now there is.	Ngoku kukho.
He would get better.	Wayeza kuba ngcono.
Now, maybe, he can do it again.	Ngoku, mhlawumbi, angayenza kwakhona.
That's your problem.	Nantso ingxaki yakho.
He said he never went there.	Wathi akazange aye apho.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze nto.
A lot of money.	Imali eninzi.
One knows better.	Umntu wazi ngcono.
I'm glad you feel better.	Ndiyavuya uziva ngcono.
Whatever it means.	Nokuba kuthetha ntoni na.
But it would be better if you knew how to do it.	Kodwa kuya kuba ngcono ukuba uyazi ukuba wenze njani.
I do not know.	Andazi.
Of course not.	Akunjalo ke.
If not, that's fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, kulungile.
It is impossible to find anything.	Akunakwenzeka ukufumana nantoni na.
He did that.	Uyenzile loo nto.
We will definitely stay here again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kuhlala apha kwakhona.
It is better to do the work.	Kungcono ukwenza umsebenzi.
I can't stay.	Andikwazi ukuhlala.
I wonder if this is okay.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba oku kulungile.
Oko.	Oko.
He will not do this to her.	Akayi kuyenza le nto kuye.
What time is it? 	Ngubani ixesha?
All the way.	Yonke indlela.
One day, for sure.	Ngenye imini, ngokuqinisekileyo.
It is impossible to know anything for sure.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba wazi nantoni na ngokuqinisekileyo.
Much more.	Kakhulu ngakumbi.
How are you coming?	Uza kuza njani?
But it certainly is not.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
She is not.	Akakho.
I don't know what that is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na leyo.
What's happening.	Kwenzeka ntoni.
It's hard to walk.	Kunzima ukuhamba.
You like it.	Uyayithanda.
That means it is true.	Oko kuthetha ukuba yinyani.
He can't sit still.	Akakwazi ukuhlala.
Only not today.	Kuphela hayi namhlanje.
I have gone far.	Ndiye kude.
Tell me that again.	Ndixelele lonto kwakhona.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
It has never been so before.	Zange kube njalo ngaphambili.
He stayed then.	Wahlala ke.
Yeah, maybe.	Ewe, mhlawumbi.
He lives alone.	Uhlala yedwa.
This is unlikely to be the case	Oku akunakwenzeka ukuba kube yinyani
Because he is not alone.	Kuba ayinguye yedwa.
That's not it.	Ayinguye lowo.
He looked very bad.	Wayekhangeleka embi kakhulu.
I will be.	Ndiza kuba.
Now you know better.	Ngoku wazi ngcono.
He knew nothing about it.	Wayengazi nto ngale nto.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
It's hard.	Kunzima.
The problem for sure.	Ingxaki ngokuqinisekileyo.
So, it is you.	Ngoko, nguwe.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ncam.
But I wonder.	Kodwa ndiyazibuza.
That makes it easier.	Oko kwenza kube lula.
If we are going to do this together.	Ukuba siza kuyenza kunye le nto.
I did one.	Ndenze enye.
If you are here, fine.	Ukuba ulapha, kulungile.
I would, too.	Ndingathanda, nam.
I never thought of anything else about it.	Khange ndicinge enye into ngayo.
You know now.	Uyazi ngoku.
Me, me, me.	Mna, mna, mna.
I did things.	Ndenze izinto.
He was not very successful.	Akazange aphumelele kakhulu.
But he did not have it.	Kodwa akazange abe nayo.
But I doubt I can do this.	Kodwa ndiyathandabuza ukuba ndingayenza le nto.
Of course I'm not entirely sure about it.	Ewe andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ngayo.
What happened to you ?.	Kwenzeke ntoni kuwe?.
I'm sure of it.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo.
Why did he come here.	Kutheni eze apha.
I don't want to have it.	Andifuni ukuba nayo.
The way.	Indlela.
Not now more.	Hayi ngoku ngakumbi.
This should be the case.	Oku kufuneka kube njalo.
We'll talk later.	Siza kuthetha kamva.
We will do better.	Siza kwenza ngcono.
I'm not sure why.	Andazi ncam ukuba kutheni.
He did not say much.	Akazange athethe kakhulu.
Or if someone is there.	Okanye ukuba kukho umntu apho.
he thought.	wacinga.
Home again, home again.	Ekhaya kwakhona, ekhaya kwakhona.
Not much is happening there.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo apho.
I think that's true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani.
How long it seems.	Kudala kangakanani kubonakala.
No one is talking to her.	Akukho mntu uthetha naye.
But not always.	Kodwa hayi rhoqo.
I do not know when he will be here.	Andazi ukuba uzakuba nini apha.
Clearly you want something from me.	Kucacile ufuna into kum.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
I knew a lot.	Ndandisazi kakhulu.
.	.
Definitely a great deal.	Ngokuqinisekileyo yinto enkulu.
It has to be the other way around.	Kufuneka kube ngenye indlela.
I can't get enough of it.	Andikwazi ukufumana ngokwaneleyo ngayo.
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi.
It is.	Yinto.
He appeared.	Wabonakala.
No one knows for sure.	Akukho mntu uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He said it would not happen.	Wathi akuyi kwenzeka.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
You know you are.	Uyazi ukuba wena.
Just a little.	Nje kancinci.
I'm not sure about anything really.	Andiqinisekanga ngayo nantoni na ngokwenene.
I never went to this place.	Andizange ndiye kule ndawo.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
Everything is bad.	Yonke into embi.
I think you know.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi.
He did not know how or when.	Wayengazi ukuba njani okanye nini.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi loo nto.
It finally happened.	Ekugqibeleni kwenzeka.
But he is not far off.	Kodwa akakho kude.
He must know.	Kufuneka akwazi.
What time is it? 	Ngubani ixesha?
.	.
I will do anything to make it happen.	Ndiza kwenza nantoni na ukwenza ukuba yenzeke.
He seems to be doing very well.	Ubonakala esenza kakuhle kakhulu.
I just want to say this.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha oku.
But in a new way.	Kodwa ngendlela entsha.
Well, one more thing.	Kulungile, into enye kwakhona.
That one is you.	Lowo omnye nguwe.
I want it to be true.	Ndifuna ukuba yinyani.
I can't either.	Nam andikwazi.
Finally he said.	Ekugqibeleni wathi.
That's fine too.	Kulungile nam.
I did not speak to him.	Khange ndithethe naye.
I don't like it very much.	Andiyithandi kakhulu.
Tell me a little bit about yourself.	Ndixelele ke kancinci ngawe.
He would stay.	Wayeza kuhlala.
This is really happening.	Oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
Better yet, perhaps.	Kungcono kakhulu, mhlawumbi.
I can't stay.	Andikwazi ukuhlala.
What do you think of that?	Ucinga ntoni ngaloo nto?
Not for me.	Hayi kum.
I know you want to talk to me.	Ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukuthetha nam.
So something happened.	Ngoko ke kukho into eyenzekayo.
He became a human being.	Waba ngumntu.
I thought you knew.	Bendicinga ukuba uyazi.
He knew he knew.	Wayesazi ukuba wayesazi.
I am going to the hospital.	Ndiya esibhedlele.
You did the right thing	Wenze into elungileyo
You do not think clearly.	Awucingi ngokucacileyo.
Maybe I will.	Mhlawumbi ndiza kwenza njalo.
Ok then.	Kulungile ke.
Or for a long time.	Okanye ixesha elide.
But he will soon speak.	Kodwa kungekudala uza kuthetha.
Or tomorrow night.	Okanye ngomso ebusuku.
So, this is not really possible.	Ngoko ke, oku akunakwenzeka ngokwenene.
I want you to know something.	Ndifuna wazi into.
Now it is impossible.	Ngoku akunakwenzeka.
That will be easier.	Oko kuya kuba lula ngakumbi.
I thought you were the only one.	Bendicinga ukuba nguwe wedwa.
Who is he? 	Ngubani?
he asked.	wabuza.
Just now.	Ngoku.
I thought the same thing.	Ndandicinga into enye.
But he did.	Kodwa wakwenza oko.
Is really your place.	Ngaba ngokwenene indawo yakho.
He didn't want anything else.	Akazange afune enye into.
Don't go too far.	Musa ukuya kude.
You do not want to talk.	Awufuni kuthetha.
Because there is more.	Kuba kukho ngakumbi.
This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
I know a lot about you.	Ndiyazi kakhulu ngawe.
He did not appear.	Akazange abonakale.
He says no.	Uthi hayi.
I could not do the work.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza umsebenzi.
He tried to speak.	Wazama ukuthetha.
Aware of.	Uyazi ukuba.
He agreed.	Wavuma.
I want to win.	Ndifuna ukuphumelela.
So that's fine.	Ngoko ke kulungile.
That's the problem here.	Nantso ke ingxaki apha.
I will do that.	Ndiya kuyenza loo nto.
I don't know how he did it.	Andazi ukuba uyenzile njani loo nto.
He did it again.	Uyenzile kwakhona.
He is very much here.	Ulapha kakhulu.
His work must be very difficult.	Umsebenzi wakhe kufuneka ube nzima kakhulu.
I can't stay.	Andikwazi ukuhlala.
Therefore,	Ngoko ke,
No, in it.	Hayi, kuyo.
It would be hard for him to say anything.	Kuya kuba nzima kuye ukuba athethe nantoni na.
Something happened to him.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuye.
You have to do this.	Kufuneka wenze oku.
So there you have it.	Ngoko kukho loo nto.
But if you are here, you probably know.	Kodwa ukuba ulapha, mhlawumbi uyazi.
He can't stay.	Akakwazi kuhlala.
That will be so.	Oko kuya kuba njalo.
He will have to think of something else.	Kuya kufuneka acinge ngenye into.
I do not want to talk to you.	Andifuni kuthetha nawe.
I could not.	Andizange ndikwazi.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
''.	''.
That's why we go to him together.	Yiyo loo nto siya kuye kunye.
No one will be with us long enough.	Akukho mntu uya kuba nathi ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo.
Yes, until.	Ewe, kude kube.
How it should be.	Kufuneka kube njani.
That happened to him.	Kwenzeka loo nto kuye.
If anything happens.	Ukuba nantoni na eyenzekayo.
No more.	Hayi kwakhona.
Yes, this is difficult.	Ewe, oku kunzima.
Just 'far enough outside.	Nje 'kude ngokwaneleyo ngaphandle.
No, it's true.	Hayi, yinyani.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange akwazi.
I have to do it.	Kufuneka ndiyenze.
Today we did.	Namhlanje senze njalo.
I don't think you should be.	Andiqondi ukuba ufanele ukuba njalo.
I do not know how far.	Andazi ukuba kude kangakanani.
I do not know where you live.	Andazi ukuba uhlala phi.
He looks good.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle.
I do not know how this happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oku.
But he did not think why.	Kodwa akazange acinge ukuba kwakutheni.
In a good way.	Ngendlela elungileyo.
But tell me.	Kodwa ndixelele.
This seems to be really good for you.	Oku kubonakala ngathi kulungile ngokwenene kuwe.
Every morning to go to work.	Rhoqo kusasa ukuya emsebenzini.
No, you want someone there, I don't say.	Hayi, ufuna umntu apho, andithi.
There is no way to make this happen.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza oku kwenzeke.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Now that’s a big deal !.	Ngoku yinto enkulu!.
What to do.	Ukwenza ntoni.
More on that a little bit.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto kancinci.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
That's him.	Nguye lowo.
What is this.	Yintoni lento.
He has to speak.	Kufuneka athethe.
I didn't want to either.	Nam ndandingafuni.
He always does a lot.	Uhlala esenza kakhulu.
Therefore,	Ngoko ke,
I have to say something to her.	Kufuneka ndithethe into kuye.
I want this way.	Ndifuna le ndlela.
I did the right thing.	Ndenze into elungileyo.
This is not just about us.	Oku akukho ngathi kuphela.
I can't make a decision.	Andikwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
Maybe that's true.	Mhlawumbi yinyani leyo.
I hope you did.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyenzile.
But it is not there.	Kodwa akukho apho.
he asked.	wabuza.
But now.	Kodwa ngoku.
You have to go there.	Kufuneka uye apho.

You would not know better.	Ubungazi ngcono.
You will get better.	Uya kuba ngcono.
This could be better.	Oku kunokuba ngcono.
Here I am now.	Ndim lo ke ngoku.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
He did everything.	Wenze yonke into.
Whatever happens, don't.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na, musa.
What do you think of this book?	Ucinga ntoni ngale ncwadi?
I know what happened.	Ndiyayazi into eyenzekayo.
You did very well today.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu namhlanje.
I knew it wasn't.	Ndandisazi ukuba akunjalo.
I know exactly what happened there.	Ndiyazi kakuhle into eyenzekayo apho.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He lives here.	Uhlala apha.
That will go a long way.	Oko kuya kude kakhulu.
That's a big deal for me.	Yinto enkulu leyo kum.
Maybe, but not here.	Mhlawumbi, kodwa hayi apha.
No, not just anyone.	Hayi, hayi nje umntu.
No no.	Hayi hayi.
Not alone.	Akunjalo ndedwa.
Maybe just a little bit.	Mhlawumbi nje kancinci.
He says no.	Uthi hayi.
We will be able to.	Siya kukwazi.

OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
I’ve done that regularly, really.	Ndenze oko rhoqo, ngokwenene.

I do not know why or how this happened.	Andazi ukuba kutheni okanye kwenzeke njani oku.
Of course not.	Ewe akunjalo.
This morning, really.	Ngale ntsasa, ngenene.
He wanted, he thought so.	Wayefuna, wacinga njalo.
No one will talk to him as much as I do.	Akukho mntu uya kuthetha naye njengam.
But he did not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwenze oko.
There is no problem with this.	Akukho ngxaki kule nto.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu.
He wanted something else.	Wayefuna enye into.
Too long.	Ixesha elide kakhulu.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wenza.
Someone said he was.	Omnye umntu wathi nguye.
You know what.	Ubusazi yintoni.
He told me.	Undixelele.
Nice place.	Indawo entle.
But it can be.	Kodwa kunokuba njalo.
Only a car.	Imoto kuphela.
Food is better.	Ukutya kungcono.
He would be out.	Wayeza kuba ngaphandle.
Well not bad.	Kulungile hayi kakubi.
I wish him well.	Ndinqwenela ukuba ahambe.
He will not go far.	Akayi kuya kude.
I try to make it better.	Ndizama ukuyenza ngcono.

Yes, that is what happened.	Ewe, oko kwenzeka.
That's not it.	Asiyonto leyo.
But everyone knows it.	Kodwa wonke umntu uyayazi.
I didn't do it regularly.	Andizange ndiyenze rhoqo.
There is such a thing.	Kukho into enjalo.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
That comes later.	Oko kuza kamva.
Or a car.	Okanye imoto.

It has happened before.	Kuye kwenzeka ngaphambili.

Or not.	Okanye akunjalo.
I don't like it now	Andiyithandi ngoku
He is the only one.	Nguye yedwa.
That's a good thing for me.	Yinto entle le kum.
So he would need the money.	Ngoko wayeza kufuna imali.

I want to know more.	Ndifuna ukwazi ngakumbi.
I told her everything about you	Ndamxelela yonke into ngawe

She plans to go to school.	Uceba ukuya esikolweni.
I can't say anything	Andikwazi kuthetha nto

I need to tell the police about this.	Kufuneka ndixelele amapolisa ngale nto.

I didn't want to be alone with him	Ndandingafuni ukuba ndedwa naye

But if not.	Kodwa ukuba akunjalo.
I feel like I want to get this now.	Ndiziva ndifuna ukufumana oku ngoku.

Maybe this is okay.	Mhlawumbi oku kulungile.

I can't talk to her right now	Andikwazi kuthetha naye ngoku
I did not want to leave.	Ndandingafuni ukuhamba.
I think he would like to	Ndicinga ukuba angathanda
Tell me about it again.	Ndixelele ngayo kwakhona.
But he does not always think so.	Kodwa akacingi njalo.
I'm sure	Ndiqinisekile
I'm not entirely sure	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo
Maybe it should.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele.
Not like you like it.	Hayi ngathi uyayithanda.
This happens often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo.
To be.	Ukuba.
Just money.	Imali nje.
Probably no one.	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.

It's hard to do.	Kunzima ukwenza.
To him.	Kuye.
I knew then.	Ndandisazi ngoko.
I want to talk about us	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngathi

I think about it as everyone does	Ndicinga ngayo njengoko wonke umntu esenza
This will be easier for you.	Oku kuya kuba lula kuwe.
Or too much for me.	Okanye kakhulu kum.
I want to learn more about you	Ndifuna ukufunda ngakumbi ngawe
He has done nothing for you.	Akazange enze nto kuwe.
I'll just say it.	Ndiza kuthetha nje.
Not so much, not immediately.	Hayi kakhulu, hayi kwangoko.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
I did not know then	Ndandingazi ngoko

For too long, he thought.	Ixesha elide kakhulu, wacinga.

But no later.	Kodwa akukho kamva apho.
I know this seems hard for you	Ndiyazi ukuba oku kubonakala kunzima kuwe
It will get better this way.	Kuya kuba ngcono ngale ndlela.
I can't say what it is	Andikwazi ukuthetha ukuba yintoni na
He just looked.	Wajonga nje.
He looked at her and looked at her.	Wajonga wajonga wajonga.
But nobody says that.	Kodwa akukho mntu uthetha loo nto.
This is a big deal for him.	Le yinto enkulu kuye.
He looked at everyone.	Wajonga wonke umntu.
He certainly will not come.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akayi kuza.
I want to find another place now	Ndifuna ukufumana enye indawo ngoku
I just want to be with you	Ndifuna nje ukuba nawe
Is true.	Yinyani.
I know that right away	Ndiyayazi loo nto ngoko nangoko

You will need only you.	Uya kufuna wena kuphela.
I never thought that no one would do anything	Andizange ndicinge ukuba akukho mntu wenza nantoni na

I had no idea about that	Ndandingazi ngaloo nto
Or for me it's okay.	Okanye kum kulungile.
I know everyone wants to know	Ndiyazi ukuba wonke umntu ufuna ukwazi
I want to know why you did this	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni uyenzile le nto
He knew better than to say anything.	Wayesazi ngcono kunokuba athethe nantoni na.
I want a really new one	Ndifuna entsha ngokwenene
Finally, he thought.	Ekugqibeleni, wacinga.
He looked very bad.	Wayekhangeleka embi kakhulu.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
I have no problem with it.	Andikwazi ngxaki kuyo.
So much for it.	Kakhulu kuyo.
I will do this	Ndiza kuyenza le nto

I feel confident here	Ndiziva ndiqinisekile apha
I have spoken to him only once this week	Ndithethe naye kube kanye kuphela kule veki
Certainly not the police.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi amapolisa.
I need to talk to you.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe.
You have to go.	Ufanele ukuhamba.
I can't do that right now.	Andikwazi ukuyenza loo nto okwangoku.
Maybe it's time for you to decide.	Mhlawumbi lixesha lokuba wenze isigqibo.
To go far.	Ukuya kude.
Well, maybe he won't want it now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akasayi kufuna ngoku.
I don't know what happened to him.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
I'm not sure why	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwakutheni ukuze kube njalo
I wish it were, but it is not.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube njalo, kodwa akunjalo.

I do not believe this will ever happen	Andikholelwa ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka
He did not have to think long.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba acinge ixesha elide.
he thought.	wacinga.
He thought it was okay.	Wayecinga ukuba kulungile.
I need help	Ndifuna uncedo
But only so far.	Kodwa kuphela kude.
He had to go.	Kwafuneka ahambe.
Today you mean something, tomorrow you mean something else.	Namhlanje uthetha into, ngomso uthetha enye into.
It's hard.	Kunzima.
I told her all this	Ndamxelela yonke lento
I don't know why, he just did.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, wenza nje.

It's a new thing.	Yinto entsha.
That's the way to do it.	Nantso indlela yokwenza.
I've been thinking about this for a long time.	Kudala ndicinga ngale nto.
He did not speak abusively.	Akazange athethe kakubi.
He did not do so.	Akazange enze njalo.
I can't do it right away	Andikwazi ukuyenza ngokukhawuleza
You don't want to do that.	Awufuni ukuyenza loo nto.
But someone else has to do it.	Kodwa omnye umntu kufuneka ayenze.
With that, as.	Ngaloo nto, njengoko.
I'm not sure it will.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Okay, a little bit.	Kulungile, kancinci.
I will stay with you	Ndiza kuhlala nawe
No one will ever think about it again.	Akukho mntu uya kuphinda acinge ngayo.
That is true for me.	Yinyani leyo kum.
Well, we know why.	Ewe, siyazi ukuba kutheni.
Maybe he had to do so.	Mhlawumbi kwafuneka enjenjalo.
I know what this is.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni le.

It will be much easier.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu.

But it is very difficult to find.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ukufumana.
Probably not immediately.	Mhlawumbi hayi nangoko.
Now there is nothing more.	Ngoku akukho nto kwakhona.

Who did that.	Ngubani owenza loo nto.
I don't think that's what happened.	Andiqondi ukuba yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
No one wanted to.	Akukho mntu wayefuna.
You have to tell me what's coming.	Kufuneka undixelele into ezayo.
Because you told me.	Kuba undixelele.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
He would need time, perhaps for a long time.	Wayeza kufuna ixesha, mhlawumbi ixesha elide.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
He did it perfectly.	Wenza ngokupheleleyo.
That's him.	Nguye lowo.

But he can't.	Kodwa akakwazi.
I can't find a way in it.	Andikwazi ukufumana indlela kuyo.
But just a little bit.	Kodwa nje kancinci.
No one is talking to her.	Akukho mntu uthetha naye.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
He went there.	Waya apho.
You have to tell me one of yours.	Kufuneka undixelele enye yakho.
I will not do that to him	Andiyi kuyenza loo nto kuye

Well done !.	Wenze kakuhle !.
You like that.	Uyayithanda loo nto.
I want to do something great	Ndifuna ukwenza into enkulu
Probably not in a bad way.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngendlela embi.
But no, this is better.	Kodwa hayi, oku kungcono.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I do not really know.	Andazi ngenene.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
I want to see something.	Ndifuna ukubona into.
But then again, probably not.	Kodwa ke kwakhona, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I do not know where it is.	Andazi ukuba iphi.
I'm trying to do just that	Ndizama ukwenza loo nto kanye
I want you with everything I have	Ndifuna wena ngayo yonke into yam
So, it is not.	Ngoko, akunjalo.
I did it the other way	Ndenze ngenye indlela

I did not know why	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni
I don't know what happened to him	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye
He never did this.	Akazange ayenze le nto.
He just did.	Wenza nje.
But in doing so it seems like nothing.	Kodwa ekwenzeni oko kubonakala ngathi akukho nto.
I never thought why	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kutheni
It is very difficult to do.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
Tell me what you think about it.	Ndixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni ngaloo nto.
I know about it.	Ndiyazi ngayo.
But he did not say anything.	Kodwa akazange athethe nto.
It will be easy enough.	Kuya kuba lula ngokwaneleyo.
We need to do the right thing.	Kufuneka senze into elungileyo.
Yes, yes, yes.	Ewe, ewe, ewe.

I know this place	Ndiyayazi le ndawo
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku.
I did not want to talk	Ndandingafuni ukuthetha
It's just time.	Lixesha nje.
I have to think things through	Kufuneka ndicinge kakuhle izinto
Maybe it's true.	Mhlawumbi yinyani.
I had no idea why this was	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni le nto
He looked at me.	Wajonga kum.
It is difficult but impossible.	Kunzima kodwa akunakwenzeka.
Just a little bit.	Kancinci nje kancinci.
Not so with us.	Akunjalo ngathi.
I can't be with you anymore	Andikwazi ukuba nawe kwakhona
I made coffee	Ndenze ikofu
I don't know what's going on here	Andiqondi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni apha
I thought he would be here	Bendicinga ukuba uzakuba lapha

I never thought about it	Andizange ndicinge ngayo

That is hard enough.	Oko kunzima ngokwaneleyo.
I know it completely now.	Ndiyazi ngokupheleleyo ngoku.
I had to make a decision right away.	Kwafuneka ndenze isigqibo ngoko nangoko.

It should be easy.	Kufuneka kube lula.

This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
I will definitely do it again	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza kwakhona
He said he never did.	Wathi akazange ayenze.
You told me who did this.	Undixelele ukuba ngubani lo wenze lento.

Or, okay.	Okanye, kulungile.
He asked for food right away.	Wacela ukutya ngoko nangoko.

Is your place.	Ngaba indawo yakho.

Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kunokuba njalo.
I know where this is	Ndiyayazi ukuba iphi le
That's what you always think.	Yiloo nto uhlala ucinga ngayo.
Not immediately.	Hayi ngoko nangoko.
I don’t know how hard it is to do this	Andazi ukuba kunzima kangakanani na ukwenza oku
But he knew nothing.	Kodwa wayengazi nto.
That person.	Ukuba umntu.
A little bit, maybe.	Kancinci kancinci, mhlawumbi.

I hope you like it too	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe uyayithanda
I did not tell anyone	khange ndixelele mntu

I do not know tomorrow	Andikwazi ngomso
I never did that	Andizange ndiyenze kanye loo nto
There is no place for you here.	Akukho ndawo yakho apha.
I'm afraid he did something bad to you.	Ndiyoyika ukuba wenze into embi kuwe.
It happens very, very often.	Kwenzeka kakhulu kakhulu.
But one.	Kodwa enye.

I had no idea what it was exactly	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye
Me at home.	Mna ekhaya.
I'm not sure how I did this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani oku.
You will probably want to get a dog.	Mhlawumbi uya kufuna ukufumana inja.
He will do it once.	Uya kwenza kanye.
I suspect he is not there	Ndiyarhana ukuba akakho
Everyone wants to go.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuhamba.

It will be difficult to find one.	Kuya kuba nzima ukufumana enye.
I have to go to work	Kufuneka ndiye emsebenzini
I think there is something to this.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into kule nto.
For a very long time indeed.	Ixesha elide kakhulu ngokwenene.

What will this mean.	Kuya kuthetha ntoni oku.
I thought it would be even harder	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi
I feel a little better	Ndiziva ngcono kancinci

I had to tell him more	Kwafuneka ndimxelele ngakumbi
I did the right thing	Ndenze into elungileyo
Really, really hard.	Ngokwenene, kunzima ngokwenene.
This can happen very quickly.	Oku kunokwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.

Maybe something else.	Mhlawumbi enye into.
I want to know how this happened	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oku
But it is possible.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
Well, maybe this won't be too difficult.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi oku akuyi kuba nzima kakhulu.
Or do you think you did that?	Okanye ucinga ukuba wenze njalo.
I would like to achieve this	Ndingathanda ukuphumelela oku

Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.

Someone else did that.	Omnye umntu wenze loo nto .
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.
When you think about it.	Xa ucinga ngayo.
All right.	Kulungile.
He never wanted to see her again.	Akazange afune ukubona kwakhona.
I thought it was just a thing	Bendicinga ukuba yinto nje
She is happy.	Uyavuya.
I thought he would be here	Bendicinga ukuba uzakuba lapha
I can certainly do that	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndingayenza loo nto
I just want to know why you did this	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba kutheni uyenzile le nto

I want to eat something	Ndifuna ukutya into
Or he tried.	Okanye wazama.
I just want to know what happened	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni
I hope you did the right thing	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza into elungileyo

So, he did.	Ngoko, wenza.

This will end.	Oku kuya kuphela.
I didn't want to do anything with it	Ndandingafuni ukwenza nantoni na kuyo
Every night, if you want to.	Rhoqo ebusuku, ukuba ufuna.
But someone else did.	Kodwa omnye umntu wenza.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
The next day, he thought.	Ngomso, wacinga.
She had to go to the hospital.	Kwafuneka aye esibhedlele.

This should be easy.	Oku kufuneka kube lula.
I want this as soon as possible	Ndifuna le nto ngokukhawuleza

She would love to now, too.	Angathanda ngoku, naye.
What happened to it.	Kwenzeka ntoni kuyo.
But you know what it is.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
Not for you.	Hayi kuwe.
Maybe it's true.	Mhlawumbi yinyani.
It could be true.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba yinyani.
Such a beautiful place.	Indawo entle kangaka.
He wants to talk.	Ufuna ukuthetha.
Just once.	Kanye nje ixesha.
Nobody wants to go there again.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuya apho kwakhona.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
Apparently not.	Kubonakala ukuba akunjalo.
He wants to do it.	Ufuna ukwenza.
I do not know who he is.	Andazi ukuba ngubani.
There is something else.	Kukho enye into.
Either way.	Ngenye indlela.

He has done it perfectly.	Uyenzile ngokupheleleyo.

He wants to be better.	Ufuna ukuba ngcono.
I will say this.	Ndiza kuthetha oku.
Nobody told me that.	Akukho mntu wandixelela loo nto.
Someone has to do it.	Kufuneka umntu ayenze.
I know it now.	Ndiyayazi ngoku.
I don't know what happened to him.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
That's all.	Yonke loo nto.
He lives very much alone here.	Uhlala wedwa kakhulu apha.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi, akunjalo.
Now he did not know what was coming.	Ngoku wayengazi ukuba kuza ntoni.
He wanted to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi.
You will do well.	Uza kwenza kakuhle.
Everyone knows what's going on.	Wonke umntu uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona.
But it is only possible.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka kuphela.
Whatever.	Nokuba yintoni na.
I did not know better.	Ndandingazi ngcono.
He would do it alone.	Wayeza kwenza nje yedwa.
Well enough, he thought.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, wacinga.
It just had to.	Kwafuneka nje.
You knew nothing about it.	Ubungazi nto ngayo.
You don't have to do that.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uyenze loo nto.
Nobody goes home.	Akukho mntu uya ekhaya.
He said nothing.	Khange athethe nto.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
You like that.	Uyayithanda loo nto.
Even a little better.	Nokuba ngcono kancinci.

He looked.	Wajonga .
You will do very well.	Uya kwenza kakuhle kakhulu.
I do not understand why this is.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni le nto.

Food at work.	Ukutya emsebenzini.
We will do it.	Siza kwenza.
he thought.	wacinga.
No one.	Akukho nokuba ngubani.
I do not know either.	Andazi nam.
He did the same thing though.	Wenza into enye kodwa.
But not for long.	Kodwa hayi ixesha elide.
This is the place.	Ke le ndawo.
To me this is good.	Kum oku kulungile.
Not just doing something.	Hayi nje ukwenza into.
I want nothing from you.	Andifuni nto kuwe.
Just like me, then.	Kanye nam, ngoko.
Whether, or, or, or.	Nokuba, okanye, nokuba, okanye.
He agreed.	Wavuma.
He had to do something.	Bekufanele enze into.
No it is not possible.	Hayi akunakwenzeka.
I really do not believe.	Andikholelwa ngokwenene.
But he did too.	Kodwa wenza nawe.
Long time.	Ixesha elide.
But that would be hard to do.	Kodwa oko kuya kuba nzima ukwenza.
Not if he thought it would.	Akunjalo ukuba wayecinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Everyone knows that.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.

It is very clear.	Kucacile kakhulu.
He didn't want to do that.	Wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
Yes I do.	Ewe nam.
Please do so.	Nceda wenze njalo.
I never went there.	Andizange ndiye apho.
He will not know.	Akayi kukwazi.
I can do that now.	Ndingayenza loo nto ngoku.
He did not want to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba.
he thought.	wacinga.
Maybe now you want one.	Mhlawumbi ngoku ufuna enye.
I will not have it.	Andiyi kuba nayo.
Who is he? 	Ngubani?
He knew there was a problem.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho ingxaki.
This, of course, is not the case.	Oku, ngokucacileyo, akunjalo.
So don't do that.	Ngoko musa ukuyenza loo nto.
Yes, he asked.	Ewe, wabuza.
i don't want a problem.	andifuni ngxaki.
For something to happen.	Ukuze kwenzeke into.
I just don’t know how I did my job.	Andazi nje ukuba ndenze njani umsebenzi wam.
Great.	Kakhulu.
Is this possible? 	Ngaba oku kunokwenzeka?
No, it is not.	Hayi, akunakwenzeka.
But we will get better.	Kodwa siya kuba ngcono.
I know he is telling the truth.	Ndiyamazi ukuba uthetha inyani.
This does not seem to be the case.	Oku kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
I don't know what happened there.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni apho.
We need to know this.	Kufuneka siyazi oku.
That's why we come.	Yiyo loo nto siza.
Everything you need to know.	Yonke into ekufuneka uyazi.

Or you are trying to.	Okanye uzama ukuba.
All right! 	Kulungile!
A little too fast.	Kancinci ngokukhawuleza.

Just you and me.	Wena nam kuphela.
I don't know if this is true or not.	Andazi nokuba yinyani na le okanye hayi.
He wants to go.	Ufuna ukuhamba.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
I hope you like it here.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayithanda apha.
He has done this before.	Ukhe wakwenza oku ngaphambili.
But not then.	Kodwa hayi ngoko.
He didn't know he knew.	Wayengazi ukuba uyazi.
Even more so.	Ngakumbi.
I'm afraid something bad has happened.	Ndiyoyika ukuba kwenzeke into embi.
That is clear.	Oko kucacile.

Certainly everywhere.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kukho yonke indawo.
One was absent.	Omnye wayengekho.
Looks like nothing.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho nto.
That's what it is.	Yiyo ke le nto.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
Speaking.	Ukuthetha.
That is not the case.	Oko akunjalo.
I know you did.	Ndiyazi ukuba wenze njalo.
If he only knew.	Ukuba nje wayesazi.
You just did the job.	Wenze nje umsebenzi.
It's a very big thing.	Yinto enkulu kakhulu.
No, obviously.	Akunjalo, ngokucacileyo.
It has been necessary.	Kuye kwafuneka.
It is possible that.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba.
I don't think it will be so.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Tell me.	Ndixelele.
But clearly not.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
That's why you're here.	Yiyo loo nto ulapha.
He did not know how.	Wayengazi ukuba njani.
No, you probably won't.	Hayi, mhlawumbi awuyi.
I know I am.	Ndiyazi ukuba ndim.
He looks good, by the way.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle, ngendlela.
He did not know what he was doing.	Wayengazi ukuba wenza ntoni.
He never did that.	Zange ayenze loo nto.
No, that's fine.	Hayi, kulungile.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I have to do better.	Kufuneka ndenze ngcono.
This will end.	Oku kuya kuphela.
Location, place, place !.	Indawo, indawo, indawo!.
But, this is not the case.	Kodwa, oku akunjalo.
She would like to know.	Angathanda ukwazi.
Much better than me.	Ngcono kakhulu kunam.
There is no way to do it.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza.
What a thing.	Yintoni into.
He lives far away.	Uhlala kude.
He wanted to eat.	Wayefuna ukutya.
I had no idea what was going on with it.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuyo.
Now it will be easier.	Ngoku kuya kuba lula.
So it's hard.	Ngoko kunzima.
But no.	Kodwa hayi.
What he was going to do about it, he didn't know.	Wayeza kwenza ntoni ngaloo nto, wayengazi.
I can't help it.	Andikwazi ukunceda.
He says he should talk to me.	Uthi kufuneka athethe nam.
How do you plan to do this?	Uceba ukwenza njani oku.
He will definitely stay.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuhlala.
I would like one.	Ndingathanda enye.
Because of that.	Kuba loo nto.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
Only, not this one.	Kuphela, hayi oku.
Is true.	Yinyani.
I wonder about that.	Ndiyazibuza ngaloo nto.
I have done wrong.	Ndenze kakubi.
I did not tell anyone what had happened.	Khange ndixelele mntu ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
So he did not say much to her.	Ngoko akazange athethe kakhulu kuye.
I'm glad he did well.	Ndiyavuya ukuba enze kakuhle.
He made it impossible.	Wenza ukuba akunakwenzeka.
I want something to do.	Ndifuna into yokwenza.
Just you.	Wena nje.
I do not know this.	Andazi ukuba le.
I know my way there.	Ndiyayazi indlela yam apho.
He told me no.	Wandixelela ukuba hayi.
I don't like it.	Andiyithandi.
I want you to stay with me.	Ndifuna uhlala nam.
But it's hard for me to see at night.	Kodwa kunzima kum ukubona ebusuku.
Maybe it should have been.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele ukuba.
As you well know.	Njengoko uyazi kakuhle.
This is a big deal.	Yinto enkulu le.
What you have to do, what you have to do.	Kufuneka wenze ntoni, wenze ntoni.
She knew he looked good.	Wayesazi ukuba ukhangeleka kakuhle.
Again, no it is not.	Kwakhona, hayi akunjalo.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
And he agreed.	Uye wavuma.
He also knew when.	Wayesazi nokuba nini.
Not here though.	Hayi apha kodwa.
But it is possible.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka.
He was not there at all.	Wayengekho kwaphela apho.
Yes, it is.	Ewe, yinyani.
He will be here soon.	Uzakuba lapha kungekudala.
Your all.	Yakho yonke.
Well, maybe not.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akuyi kuba njalo.
Sounds good to me.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile kum.
I just want to do some work.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza umsebenzi.
Not much to talk about.	Akukho kakhulu ukuthetha ngayo.
He did everything.	Wenze yonke into.
Maybe he didn't want to talk about it.	Mhlawumbi wayengafuni ukuthetha ngayo.
If you have ever done.	Ukuba ukhe wenza.
I am everything.	Ndim yonke into.
I never talked about it.	Khange ndithethe ngayo.
Everything.	Yonke into.
Maybe not tomorrow.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngomso.
But he will stay.	Kodwa uya kuhlala.
That's the problem here.	Nantso ke ingxaki apha.
That's a lot of places today.	Yiyo indawo ezininzi namhlanje.
Not with him.	Hayi naye.
But, it can be difficult.	Kodwa, kunokuba nzima.
You are here.	Ulapha.
I don't know what he did.	Andazi ukuba wenza ntoni.
This would be a bad thing.	Oku kuya kuba yinto embi.
If you know, you know.	Ukuba uyazi, uyazi.
He really does the job.	Wenza umsebenzi ngenene.
I will be.	Ndiza kuba.
Here it is again.	Nantso kwakhona.
Something happened to you.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuwe.
It is very difficult to walk now.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuhamba ngoku.
I wonder why this is.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kutheni le nto.
Tell me now.	Ndixelele ngoku.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
Just as he wanted.	Kanye njengoko wayefuna.
He will be so.	Uya kuba njalo.
He had to think.	Kwafuneka acinge.
I would like to read more.	Ndingathanda ukufunda ngakumbi.
This is really the thing.	Le yinto ngenene.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
I know what.	Ndiyazi yintoni.
I think that's a big deal.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto enkulu leyo.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I want him to talk.	Ndifuna athethe.
Well, tell me.	Ke, ndixelele.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
Making it harder to drive.	Ukwenza ukuba nzima ukuqhuba.
Well, not really, obviously.	Ewe, akunjalo, ngokucacileyo.
But he understood.	Kodwa waqonda.
I know where you are going.	Ndiyazi apho uya khona.
He told me everything about it.	Uye wandixelela yonke into ngayo.
Just now.	Ngoku.
Nobody wanted to do anything.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwenza nantoni na.
Money is time.	Imali lixesha.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
Money, money, money.	Imali, imali, imali.
That's a really good thing.	Yinto entle ngokwenene leyo.
Not so now.	Akunjalo ngoku.
He wanted to stay with you.	Wayefuna ukuhlala nawe.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
Everyone loves money.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda imali.
But no.	Kodwa hayi.
You think too much.	Ucinga kakhulu.
But clearly, this is not possible.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo, oku akunakwenzeka.
If not now, when?	Ukuba akunjalo ngoku, nini?
Just one problem.	Ingxaki enye nje.
You know it.	Uyakwazi.
Away from food.	Kude ukutya.
He can't walk.	Akakwazi ukuhamba.
I had to talk to him.	Kwafuneka ndithethe naye.
It's just true.	Yinyani nje.
This should have been easy.	Oku bekufanele kube lula.
Not here, nowhere.	Hayi apha, akukho ndawo.
In case.	Mhlawumbi.
Or he may be reluctant to talk about it.	Okanye kusenokwenzeka ukuba akafuni kuthetha ngayo.
He also did not.	Naye akazange.
I'm sure.	Ndiqinisekile.
This is true.	Le yinyani.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
It's hard to walk.	Kunzima ukuhamba.
This he must do.	Oku kufuneka akwenze.
As required.	Njengoko kufuneka.
In spite.	Ngaphandle.
He wanted money.	Wayefuna imali.
But not everyone.	Kodwa ayinguye wonke umntu.
He did not want to know.	Wayengafuni ukwazi.
House.	Indlu.
Now you really know.	Ngoku uyazi ngokwenene.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
Finally or otherwise.	Ekugqibeleni okanye ngenye indlela.
I would just like to read.	Ndingathanda nje ukufunda.
I knew now or never.	Ndandisazi ngoku okanye zange.
Everyone knows about this.	Wonke umntu uyazi ngale nto.
He is anyone.	Nguye nabani na.
He began to.	Waqalisa ukuba.
It's hard to walk.	Kunzima ukuhamba.
If not today, then tomorrow.	Ukuba akunjalo namhlanje, ngoko ngomso.
But I think so.	Kodwa ndicinga njalo.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.
I did not really want to go.	Ndandingafuni nyani ukuhamba.
But not immediately.	Kodwa hayi ngokukhawuleza.
Where it seems to be.	Apho kubonakala ngathi kukho.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke loo nto.
There is another.	Kukho enye.
I don't like what's going on here.	Andiyithandi into eyenzekayo apha.
You better know.	Kungcono uyazi.
But it seems that he was not able to do that.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi akazange akwazi ukwenza oko.
I don't think it will be so.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
It's you.	Nguwe.
You won't do it.	Awuyi kuyenza.
That will happen to you.	Oko kuya kwenzeka kuwe.
He did not want to.	Akazange afune.
This is much better.	Oku kungcono kakhulu.
I can't say one thing right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha enye into ngoku.
If you stayed long enough.	Ukuba wahlala ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo.
So what's new.	Ke yintoni entsha.
I know him too.	Nam ndiyamazi.
He didn't, he really didn't.	Akazange, ngokwenene akazange.
It makes it so much easier.	Kwenza kube lula kakhulu.
He looked away.	Wajonga kude.
He wanted to go to work.	Wayefuna ukuya emsebenzini.
All right, tell me.	Kulungile, ndixelele.
You do not have to do this.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze oku.
He did not know why.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
All.	Yonke.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
He never came to her.	Akazange eze kuye.
But if not.	Kodwa ukuba akunjalo.
She is very happy.	Uyavuya kakhulu.
I could not do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza.
You just know it.	Uyayazi nje.
He did not want to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba.
He is here with me.	Ulapha kunye nam.
I want to know what happened.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
How much, it is impossible to say.	Kangakanani na, akunakwenzeka ukuthetha.
He did not give up.	Akazange ayeke.
I'll say something else.	Ndiza kuthetha enye into.
So he would be.	Ngoko wayeza kuba njalo.
But she could not find a job.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
I just know this.	Ndiyazi nje oku.
If not far away.	Ukuba akukho kude.
I just don't want to.	Andifuni nje.
I'm sure of that.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto.
That's it.	Yinto leyo.
He asked what had happened.	Wabuza ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
I would like to talk about you.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha ngawe.
.	.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.
Great.	Kakhulu.
He said he liked that.	Wathi uyayithanda loo nto.
I don't like coffee.	Andiyithandi ikofu.
This may be true.	Oku kunokuba yinyani.
That will be tomorrow.	Oko kuya kuba ngomso.
So he agreed to everything.	Ngoko wavuma yonke into.
One way.	Enye indlela.
But it is not !.	Kodwa akunjalo!.
She had to go to him.	Kwafuneka aye kuye.
What the hell? 	Yintoni?
We have to do it.	Kufuneka senze njalo.
But don't do it again.	Kodwa musa ukuyenza kwakhona.
I don't know what will happen.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni na.
He didn't say what it was.	Akazange athethe ukuba yintoni na.
Making a lot of money.	Ukwenza imali eninzi.
There is a problem.	Kukho ingxaki.
So do not do that alone.	Ngoko musa ukwenza kuphela.
Play with it.	Ukudlala ngayo.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
I think we know why now.	Ndicinga ukuba siyazi ukuba kutheni ngoku.
But I am.	Kodwa ndim.
Yes, it is.	Ewe, yinyani.
That's a good thing.	Nantso ke into entle.
Or do you think you know.	Okanye ucinga ukuba uyazi.
Not hard or nothing.	Hayi nzima okanye akukho nto.
That's just right.	Yinyani nje loo nto.
But, that's me.	Kodwa ke, ndim lowo.
It's time.	Lixesha.
I can't talk to her.	Andikwazi kuthetha naye.
I don't know what exactly happened.	Andiqondi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kanye kanye.
He didn't really know why.	Wayengazi ngokwenene ukuba kutheni.
Yes, very much so.	Ewe, kakhulu.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
I have to do that.	Kufuneka ndiyenze loo nto.
Or help.	Okanye uncedo.
But this happened quite differently.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka ngenye indlela ngokupheleleyo.
Now it is difficult to talk to her.	Ngoku kunzima ukuthetha naye.
Opportunity to make money fast, easy.	Ithuba lokwenza imali ngokukhawuleza, lula.
That's what it is.	Yiloo nto ke.
I don’t know how I did something else.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani enye into.
Together.	Kunye.
You may be now.	Usenokuba ngoku.
He wanted to go.	Wayefuna ukuhamba.
It will be easy.	Kuya kuba lula.
Don't do that again.	Musa ukuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
That's a good thing.	Yinto elungileyo.
Maybe you should.	Mhlawumbi ufanele.
I can't say anything about it.	Andikwazi kuthetha nto ngayo.
I'm sure you know that.	Ndiqinisekile uyayazi loo nto.
Because you should.	Kuba ufanele.
We will do what we will do.	Siza kwenza le nto siza kuyenza.
It's the same thing.	Yinto enye.
Maybe today then.	Mhlawumbi namhlanje ngoko.
Down with whatever.	Phantsi nokuba yintoni na.
I never did.	Andizange ndiyenze.
He wanted to know for sure.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He says yes.	Uthi ewe.
But not in this one.	Kodwa hayi kule.
He is.	Nguye.
I would like that.	Ndingathanda ukuba njalo.
Anything to pass the time.	Nantoni na ukuhamba ixesha.
That's just hard.	Kunzima nje oko.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiyo kanye loo nto.
She went to school.	Waya esikolweni.
Well, that's what you need to do.	Ewe, yiloo nto ekufuneka uyenzile.
We know for sure.	Oko siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Yeah, that's it.	Ewe, yiloo nto.
So, this happens.	Ngoko, oku kwenzeka.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Well, he thought.	Ewe, wacinga.
If this, then.	Ukuba oku, ngoko ke.
.	.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
Or do we.	Okanye senze.
Or you don't want to.	Okanye awufuni.

This is not the case at the moment.	Oku akunjalo okwangoku.
If you do, you will be able to speak.	Ukuba wenze njalo uya kukwazi ukuthetha.

He did not say this.	Akazange athethe oku.
That's the way you do it.	Nantso indlela owenza ngayo.
Therefore, it is not.	Ngoko ke, akunjalo.
I can't do anything alone.	Andikwazi ukwenza nto ndedwa.
It's not your thing.	Asiyonto yakho.
No one.	Akukho mntu.

Is true.	Yinyani.
You certainly don't think !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo awucingi!.
Not only that, everywhere.	Akunjalo nje, kuyo yonke indawo.

Or don't do it.	Okanye musa ukwenza.
If this is possible.	Ukuba oku kunokwenzeka.
So what.	Ngoko yintoni na.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange abe nayo.
It’s hard to really tell.	Kunzima ukuxelela ngokwenene.
Because he did not.	Kuba akazange.
That's it.	Yiyo leyo.
I am with you.	Ndim nawe.
Obviously this is not the case.	Ngokucacileyo oku akunjalo.

Or with us.	Okanye kunye nathi.
And he went there.	Waya apho ke.
I can't say why now.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba kutheni ngoku.

That is happening now.	Oko kwenzeka ngoku.
Well, no, no.	Ewe, akunjalo, hayi.
I think it's just true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani nje.
That's fine too.	Kulungile nam.
He did not do so.	Akazange enze njalo.
He said he knew that.	Wathi uyayazi lonto.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
I know him to be just a man.	Ndiyamazi ukuba ungumntu nje.
He doesn't want to go anywhere or do anything.	Akafuni ukuya ndawo okanye enze nantoni na.
How are you doing.	Wenza njani.

Maybe one day.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini.
He did well for her.	Wenza kakuhle kuye.
It's hard to make money.	Kunzima ukufumana imali.
That's the way we do things.	Yiloo ndlela esenza ngayo izinto.
I said nothing about it.	Khange ndithethe nto ngayo.
That will be a long time ago.	Oko kuya kuba kudala.
How about this.	Njani ngale nto.
But not now.	Kodwa hayi ngoku.
I want to do better.	Ndifuna ukwenza ngcono.
He would do it.	Wayeza kuyenza.
That's his thing.	Nantso into yakhe.
No one really knows everything.	Akukho mntu wazi yonke into ngenene.
We need to get away, quickly.	Kufuneka siye kude, ngokukhawuleza.
Not exactly.	Akunjalo ncam.
Here, no one.	Apha, akukho mntu.
This is a big deal.	Le yinto enkulu.
That is it.	Yiyo lento.
It’s just a thing for me.	Yinto nje into kum.
He didn't want to play at all.	Wayengafuni kwaphela ukudlala.
I don't really want to.	Andifuni ngokwenene.
That's all.	Yonke loo nto.
He immediately got started.	Ngokukhawuleza waqalisa.

I want to do it.	Ndifuna ukuyenza.
Probably nothing.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto.
He made money.	Wenza imali.
He is not going anywhere.	Akayi ndawo.
He certainly will.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuba njalo.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
But you know right away.	Kodwa wazi ngoko nangoko.
That's a bad thing to do.	Yinto embi leyo ukuyenza.
But to be there.	Kodwa ukuba khona.
Nobody goes there.	Akukho mntu uya apho.
He checked the time.	Wajonga ixesha.
Well not.	Kulungile akunjalo.
It's hard to do that now.	Kunzima ukwenza oko ngoku.
Or, more importantly, it is not.	Okanye, ngakumbi, akunjalo.
That's what you did.	Yiyo loo nto uyenzile.
But there is another.	Kodwa kukho enye.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
No one is coming to you.	Akukho mntu uza kuwe.
She can eat.	Uyakwazi ukutya.
That's the same thing.	Yinto enye leyo.
But not in this one.	Kodwa hayi kule.
You do not want to.	Awufuni.
I said nothing to anyone.	Khange ndithethe mntu.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
But he did not show up.	Kodwa akazange abonakale.
This is clearly not possible.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunakwenzeka.
Does it really seem like you think so.	Ngaba ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi ucinga njalo.
? 	?
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I know exactly where you are going with this.	Ndiyazi kakuhle apho uya khona ngale nto.
But only.	Kodwa kuphela.
How much you mean to me.	Uthetha kangakanani kum.
Now or never, he thought.	Ngoku okanye zange, wacinga.
I know nothing.	Andazi nto.
This is for me.	Oku kum.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
Probably that.	Mhlawumbi ukuba .
Soon now, man will do just that.	Kungekudala ngoku, umntu uya kwenza njalo.
I really want to do this.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuyenza le nto.
Please do better.	Nceda wenze ngcono.
Yes, it is possible.	Ewe, kunokwenzeka.
I did not even know where I was going.	Ndandingazi nokuba ndiye phi.
He is not going anywhere.	Akayi ndawo.
So out.	Ngoko ke ngaphandle.
He wants to talk to you.	Ufuna ukuthetha nawe.
Even just a day.	Nokuba nje imini.
I never went anywhere.	Andizange ndiye ndawo.
He never did.	Zange ayenze.
He is here with her.	Ulapha naye.
He wants it to be for you.	Ufuna ukuba kube kuwe.
We know.	Siyazi.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akazange.
I think he should have it.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka abe nayo.
Just now .	Ngoku .
he asked.	wabuza.
To do it.	Ukuyenza.
No one should have to think that.	Akukho mntu kufuneka acinge oko.
It will be difficult.	Kuza kuba nzima.
Right here.	Apha.
But maybe not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo.
It will be very difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
My new book.	Incwadi yam entsha.
She goes to work.	Uya emsebenzini.
I don't really want to talk about it.	Andifuni nyani ukuthetha ngayo.
He lives here.	Uhlala apha.
I'm sure of that now.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto ngoku.
Nothing, nothing.	Akukho nto, akukho nto.
I did not want to do this alone.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza ndedwa le nto.
Everywhere there.	Yonke indawo apho.
But maybe.	Kodwa mhlawumbi.
He only acted like us.	Wenza ngathi kuphela.
I don't think it will be so.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Or say no.	Okanye uthi hayi.
But he has never been able to do this before.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza le nto ngaphambili.
He didn't have to think about it.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba acinge ngayo.
Yeah, that's it.	Ewe, yiloo nto.
He should sit down and talk to us.	Kufuneka ahlale phantsi athethe nathi.
He is not.	Ayinguye.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
I'm afraid.	Ndiyoyika.
But only for you.	Kodwa kuwe kuphela.
This takes time.	Oku kufuna ixesha.
No problem here.	Akukho ngxaki apha.
Or everything.	Okanye yonke into.
A lot of money.	Imali eninzi.
I think it is now.	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo ngoku.
Exactly, now.	Kanye ngokwenene, ngoku.
Well, he thought.	Ewe, wacinga.
Sounds good now.	Kubonakala kulungile ngoku.
No problem with that.	Akukho ngxaki ngaloo nto.
In my own way.	Ngendlela yam.
But not in this one.	Kodwa hayi kule.
He plans to leave soon.	Uceba ukuhamba kungekudala.
I had to think about this.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngale nto.
He knew it well.	Wayesazi kakuhle.
No, not at all.	Hayi, akunjalo kanye.
He said no.	Wathi hayi.
I do not know.	Andazi ke.
Not a big deal.	Hayi into enkulu.
But this is also very difficult to do.	Kodwa oku kwakhona kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
I said nothing to her.	Khange ndithethe enye into kuye.
We will stay here.	Siza kuhlala apha.
I do not know.	Andazi.
Maybe also true.	Mhlawumbi kwakhona yinyani.
I am very skeptical.	Ndiyathandabuza kakhulu.
That's what it is.	Yiloo nto ke.
Is.	Ngaba.
He thought someone knew.	Wayecinga ukuba omnye uyazi.
If everyone did.	Ukuba wonke umntu wenza njalo.
He will speak.	Uya kuthetha.
Everyone is a person.	Wonke umntu ngumntu.
Or anyone.	Okanye nabani na.
He does not have to.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba enjenjalo.
I did that.	Ndenze oko.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa oko akunjalo.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
It has to happen.	Kufuneka yenzeke.
That's what happened.	Yinto eyenzekayo.
So you have probably done the right thing.	Ngoko usenokuba wenze into elungileyo.
But only once.	Kodwa kube kanye kuphela.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
Nobody tells you that.	Akukho mntu ukuxelela loo nto.

No one wanted to make money.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwenza imali.
you say.	uthi.
Again, it is not.	Kwakhona, akunjalo.
I told her that too.	Nam ndamxelela lonto.
He thought nothing of it.	Akazange acinge nto.
At this point.	Kule ndawo.
I don't even know why.	Andazi nokuba kutheni.
I knew nothing about this.	Ndandingazi nto ngale nto.
Nothing about you yet.	Akukho nto ngawe okwangoku.
If only time.	Ukuba kuphela ixesha.
But he did well.	Kodwa wenza kakuhle.
Long time ago.	Kudala kakhulu.
I thought she was going to get better.	Bendicinga ukuba uzakuba ngcono.
Not tomorrow, not next week, but today.	Hayi ngomso, hayi kwiveki ezayo, kodwa namhlanje.
It does not have to happen immediately.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba yenzeke kwangoko.
But this.	Kodwa oku.
This is likely to be simple.	Oku kunokwenzeka ukuba kube lula.
Everything we need to know.	Yonke into ekufuneka siyazi.
Not my thing.	Hayi into yam.
But not quite.	Kodwa hayi ngokupheleleyo.
Obviously he says no.	Ngokucacileyo uthi hayi.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
What's worse.	Into embi ngakumbi.
A little bit, no.	Kancinci kancinci, hayi.
Long time ago.	Kudala kakhulu.
He had to stop talking.	Kwafuneka ayeke ukuthetha.
He wanted to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi.
Is that you?.	Ingaba nguwe?.
So, he is.	Ngoko, nguye.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
So we will do that.	Ngoko ke siya kwenza loo nto.
I just didn't want a book.	Ndandingafuni ncwadi nje.
But he looks good.	Kodwa ukhangeleka kakuhle.
You like it.	Uyayithanda.
This is not difficult.	Oku akukho nzima.
But we will talk about that later.	Kodwa siza kuthetha ngaloo nto kamva.
You like this thing.	Uyayithanda le nto.
I will do it again.	Ndiza kuyenza kwakhona.
That sounds good.	Oko kubonakala kulungile.
I did not tell him.	Khange ndimxelele.
I really doubt it.	Ndiyathandabuza ngokwenene.
You think this is a good thing.	Ucinga ukuba yinto entle le.
For a really long time.	Ixesha elide ngokwenene.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Mhlawumbi ngomso ebusuku.
Maybe you don't want to.	Mhlawumbi awufuni.
I'll have to think about that later.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngaloo nto kamva.
One and only.	Omnye kuphela.
You will have to go to work.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba uye emsebenzini.
Yeah, right away.	Ewe, kwangoko.
You want so much.	Ufuna kakhulu.

You did everything well.	Wenze yonke into kakuhle.
But everywhere there is nothing.	Kodwa kuyo yonke indawo akukho nto.
No one comes to him.	Akukho mntu uza kuye.
I never thought this would happen.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
I know, he thought.	Ndiyazi, wacinga.
He looked at the reading.	Wajonga ukufunda.

There is something else you need to do.	Kukho enye into ekufuneka uyenzile.

He felt completely alone.	Waziva wedwa ngokupheleleyo.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
That's what you need to do.	Yiloo nto ekufuneka uyenzile.
You know where you are going.	Uyazi apho uya khona.
Yes it should.	Ewe bekufanele kwenzeke.
That's it, not more.	Yiyo loo nto, hayi ngakumbi.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I'll do one but I don't know when.	Ndiza kwenza enye kodwa andazi ukuba nini.

I want more.	Ndifuna izinto ezininzi.
It happened so fast.	Kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
In one way or another.	Ngendlela enye okanye enye.

Or so he thought.	Okanye wayecinga njalo.
But my car.	Kodwa imoto yam.

But this means little.	Kodwa oku kuthetha kancinci.
But, of course, nothing.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, akukho nto.

Everyone wants one.	Wonke umntu ufuna enye.
So often.	Ngoko rhoqo.

He knew what it was.	Wayesazi ukuba yintoni na.
Don't read too much into it.	Musa ukufunda kakhulu kuyo.
All right, now is the time.	Kulungile, ngoku lixesha.
He never thought of that.	Akazange acinge nto ngaloo nto.

That sounds good.	Oko kubonakala kulungile.
That seems like a long time.	Oko kubonakala ngathi lixesha elide.

There is no one else.	Akakho omnye umntu.
I had to tell him.	Kwafuneka ndimxelele.
He did not give up.	Akazange ayeke.
He needed time to be alone.	Wayefuna ixesha lokuba yedwa.
I can't !.	Andikwazi!.
Now everyone loves it.	Ngoku wonke umntu uyayithanda.
If you don't want to be yourself.	Ukuba awufuni ukuba nguwe.

He made a decision.	Wenza isigqibo.
It should be very easy for you.	Kufuneka kube lula kakhulu kuwe.
Or maybe not at all.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo kwaphela.
That's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu leyo.
Nobody lives alone.	Akukho mntu uhlala yedwa.
Book, book, book.	Incwadi, incwadi, incwadi.

Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
You know why you are here.	Uyazi ukuba kutheni ulapha.

There is only so much space there.	Kukho indawo eninzi kuphela apho.
That is a terrible thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu leyo.
Impossible.	Akunakwenzeka.
But it will be difficult.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima.
He certainly will not go anywhere now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akasayi kuya ndawo ngoku.
Soon he will sit down.	Kungekudala uza kuhlala phantsi.
Too long, really.	Ixesha elide kakhulu, ngokwenene.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
You know that this is possible.	Uyazi ukuba oku kunokwenzeka.
That should be maybe.	Oko kufuneka kube mhlawumbi.
But that happened later.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka kamva.
You have to do that.	Kufuneka wenze loo nto.
I don't know why there.	Andazi ukuba kutheni na apho.
That is absolutely true.	Yinyani leyo ngokupheleleyo.
My job is here.	Umsebenzi wam ulapha.
It's hard for him.	Kunzima kuye.
So, if it happens, it happens.	Ngoko, ukuba kwenzeka, kwenzeka.
That's what you think.	Yiloo nto ucinga ngayo.
You know the problem here.	Uyayazi ingxaki apha.
He's a really good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo ngenene.

But if you did.	Kodwa ukuba uyenzile.
He wants me to tell him.	Ufuna ndimxelele.
Sorry, no.	Uxolo, akunjalo.
That's what's happening now.	Nantso into eyenzekayo ngoku.

He looked bad.	Wayekhangeleka embi.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo kwaphela.
Why are you here.	Kutheni ulapha.
Anything to help.	Nantoni na ukunceda.

As he knew it would be.	Njengoko wayesazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
He lives with her.	Uhlala naye.
He is here to help.	Ulapha ukunceda.
But that is not the case at all.	Kodwa akunjalo kwaphela.
No problem there for me.	Akukho ngxaki apho kum.
Bad place.	Indawo embi.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.
I had to think it through.	Kwafuneka ndicinge kakuhle.
No problem, for now.	Akukho ngxaki, okwangoku.
Eating slowly.	Ukutya kancinci kancinci.
But it is very difficult.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu.
I really want to do a lot of things.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukwenza izinto ezininzi.
He did not appear.	Zange abonakale.
Where are we going.	Apho siya khona.
But it is not that simple.	Kodwa akukho lula kangako.
But it will be.	Kodwa kuya kuba njalo.
But he did not speak, or he could not speak.	Kodwa akazange athethe, okanye akakwazi ukuthetha.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
He never knew it was time.	Wayengazi kwaphela ukuba lixesha.
You have to do your job.	Kufuneka wenze umsebenzi wakho.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
But not this morning.	Kodwa hayi ngale ntsasa.
He should have stopped there.	Bekufanele ayeke apho.
I think that happened to me last night.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kwenzeka kum phezolo.
Not so much though.	Hayi kakhulu kodwa.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
You think it will be easy, but it is not.	Ucinga ukuba kuya kuba lula, kodwa akunjalo.

But it is true.	Kodwa yinyani.
But there is one problem for him.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki enye kuye.
I wanted nothing from him.	Ndandingafuni nto kuye.
He had to make a decision.	Kwafuneka enze isigqibo.
He was not.	Wayengekho.
That's my place, by the way.	Nantso indawo yam, ngendlela.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.

I had to think about that.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngaloo nto.
I don't think so.	Ndicinga ukuba akunjalo.
Yes, work is a good thing.	Ewe, umsebenzi yinto entle.
Sorry .	Uxolo .
I don't even know if you like it.	Andazi nokuba uyayithanda na.
I don't really like that.	Andiyithandi kakhulu loo nto.
He will be with us soon.	Uza kuba nathi kungekudala.
That can be so.	Oko kunokuba njalo.
I certainly did not want to.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndandingafuni.
He can't speak.	Akakwazi kuthetha.
You have to make a decision.	Kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
It happens everywhere.	Kwenzeka kuyo yonke indawo.
Certainly not possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka.
I never thought about all that.	Khange ndicinge ngayo yonke loo nto.
He knew, he thought.	Wayesazi, wacinga.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
He was visible.	Wayebonakala .
I will do anything.	Ndiya kwenza nantoni na.
He doesn't know what it is.	Akayazi ukuba yintoni na.
He looked at the house.	Wajonga indlu.

Now he did not.	Ngoku akazange.
I'm not entirely sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ngaloo nto.
He said nothing.	Khange athethe nto.
Something happened to me.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kum.
He said it was okay with him.	Wathi kulungile naye.
He just told me that.	Undixelele nje ukuba.
It can be very difficult.	Kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
This problem could have happened.	Kunokuba kwenzeke le ngxaki.
I don't know, but you probably know.	Andazi, kodwa mhlawumbi uyazi.
Eating alone tonight.	Ukutya yedwa ngokuhlwanje.

My work makes it so.	Umsebenzi wam wenza ukuba kube njalo.
But this is good for me.	Kodwa oku kulungile kum.
I would probably.	Ndingathanda mhlawumbi.
Nothing much.	Akukho nto ingako.
We are going to the hospital.	Siya esibhedlele.
Now, maybe that's a good thing.	Ngoku, mhlawumbi yinto entle leyo.
Nobody knows anything about it.	Akukho mntu wazi nto ngayo.
But he also felt it.	Kodwa naye waziva.
This is difficult.	Oku kunzima.
This is possible, but not easy to do.	Oku kunokwenzeka, kodwa akukho lula ukwenza.
I doubt you.	Ndiyathandabuza ngawe.
It's your person.	Ngumntu wakho.
Something big is happening.	Kukho into enkulu eyenzekayo.
But it can be.	Kodwa kunokuba njalo.
He did not speak to her.	Akazange athethe naye.
As we will do so.	Njengoko siza kwenza njalo.
But there is peace now.	Kodwa kukho uxolo ngoku.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
No, not you.	Hayi, hayi nawe.
He did to me.	Wenza kum.
He said he did not know why.	Uye wathi akazi ukuba kutheni.

Maybe not so much though.	Mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu kodwa.
I know you want to help.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyafuna ukunceda.
I'm not going anywhere with him.	Andiyi ndawo naye.
My job is here.	Umsebenzi wam ulapha.
I would love to have it.	Ndingathanda ukuba nayo.
Yeah, for now.	Ewe, okwangoku.
I wonder who that is.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngubani lowo.
.	.
Anything you need to do.	Nantoni na ekufuneka uyenzile.
This can be very difficult.	Oku kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi.
Anyone I ask for help.	Nabani na ndicela uncedo.
I do not know.	Andazi.
But it is clear.	Kodwa kucacile.
he thought.	wacinga.
Something else happened to him.	Kwenzeka enye into kuye.
Maybe not tonight, but finally.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngokuhlwanje, kodwa ekugqibeleni.
That is not the case.	Oko akunjalo.
Maybe soon for me.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala kum.
He wanted to stay longer.	Wayefuna ukuhlala ixesha elide.

You may be.	Usenokuba .
Just saying bad things.	Ukuthetha nje kakubi.
There is no way.	Akukho ndlela.
She did not know how she felt now.	Wayengazi ukuba uziva njani ngoku.

It's hard to find such a thing.	Kunzima ukufumana into enjalo.
Something happened to me.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kum.
You do not have to.	Akuyomfuneko nayo.
It's just this.	Yinto nje le.
Sounds like okay.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile.
A long time there.	Ithuba elide apho.
He never came to me.	Akazange eze kum.
The problem is me.	Ingxaki ndim.
If you are human.	Ukuba ungumntu.
Monkey and you.	Nyani nawe.
I feel exactly the same.	Ndiziva kanye kanye.
I think he can do it.	Ndicinga ukuba angayenza.
Clearly, really.	Ngokucacileyo, ngokwenene.
he thought.	wacinga.
No, you did well.	Hayi, wenze kakuhle.
He doesn't have to have it.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba abe nayo.
That's what happened here.	Nantso into eyenzekayo apha.
This is how you come.	Ngale ndlela uza ngayo.
You talk to me.	Uthetha nam.
I'm glad he is.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nguye.
I should have done that a long time ago.	Bekufanele ukuba kudala ndenze njalo.
Maybe a little bit.	Mhlawumbi kancinci.
There is more to come.	Kukho enye into ezayo.
I'm not really sure.	Andiqinisekanga ngenene.
Not before.	Akunjalo ngaphambili.
This happened to me.	Oku kwenzeka kum.
To tell the truth.	Ukuthetha inyani.
He likes to do outside.	Uthanda ukwenza ngaphandle.
There it is now.	Kukho ke ngoku.
No, really.	Akunjalo, ngokwenene.
But one thing out there.	Kodwa enye into ngaphandle.
I hope you did.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyenzile.
He just stays in the day.	Uhlala nje imini.
You will say nothing to him.	Akuyi kuthetha nto kuye.
Now then.	Ngoku ke .
Or, something like that.	Okanye, into enjalo.
He did everything quickly.	Wenza yonke into ngokukhawuleza.
Yeah, that's why you're here.	Ewe, yiyo loo nto ulapha.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto elungileyo leyo.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
She is very happy.	Uyavuya kakhulu.
That's how bad it is.	Yiloo ndlela embi ngayo.
He stayed then.	Wahlala ke.
Yes, we have to act fast.	Ewe, kufuneka senze ngokukhawuleza.
But he also did not speak.	Kodwa naye akazange athethe.
I hope you live here.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uhlala apha.
He said that sooner or later he knew that this would happen.	Wathi kungekudala okanye kamva wayesazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
But then nothing.	Kodwa ke akukho nto.
This is probably a good thing.	Oku mhlawumbi yinto elungileyo.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
I never really did.	Andizange ndiyenze ngokwenene.
He also did not want to know.	Naye wayengafuni ukwazi.
Okay there.	Kulungile apho.
Maybe you go to work.	Mhlawumbi uya emsebenzini.
I want to leave right away.	Ndifuna ukuhamba ngoko nangoko.
If you don't want this, fine.	Ukuba awufuni oku, kulungile.
Far from here.	Kude apha.
He did not say much about it.	Akazange athethe kakhulu ngayo.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ukwenza njani oku.
Anyone can do that.	Nabani na angayenza loo nto.
But I am the only one.	Kodwa ndim kuphela.
But no one wants to talk about it.	Kodwa akukho mntu ufuna ukuthetha ngale nto.
No, probably.	Akunjalo, mhlawumbi.
Not enough.	Akukho ngokwaneleyo.
I need your help.	Ndicela uncedo kuwe.

But that's why you're here.	Kodwa yiyo loo nto ulapha.

But he could not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukwenza oko.
I don't know enough.	Andazi ngokwaneleyo.

I think that's true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani leyo.
I think you already know that.	Ndicinga ukuba sele uyayazi loo nto.
He did not go with her.	Akazange naye.
It's a bad thing, you know.	Yinto embi, uyazi.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka uyenze.

He knew a little bit.	Wayesazi kancinci.
he thought.	wacinga.
Do you like?.	Ingaba uyayithanda?.
Maybe that's me.	Mhlawumbi ndim lowo.
So, we did just that.	Ngoko, senze kanye loo nto.
It is very difficult, very demanding.	Kunzima kakhulu, kufuna kakhulu.
You want to learn, okay.	Ufuna ukufunda, kulungile.
I will do this.	Ndiza kuyenza le nto.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Is it true.	Ngaba yinyani.

But to me, not to you.	Kodwa kum, hayi kuwe.
Do not speak ill of yourself.	Musa ukuthetha kakubi ngawe.

It will be easy to find.	Kuya kuba lula ukufumana.
That's a good thing.	Nantso into elungileyo.
You want it alone.	Ufuna wedwa.
I think he did that.	Ndicinga ukuba wakwenza oko.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
This will not do.	Oku akuyi kwenza.

He will not be with you.	Akayi kuba nawe.
Now it is not there.	Ngoku akukho apho.
I'm not sure it will.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Or not at all.	Okanye akunjalo kwaphela.
Talking to him.	Ukuthetha naye.
Right there, right then.	Kanye apho, kanye ngoko.
It's a new thing.	Yinto entsha.
As you do.	Njengoko wenza.
But maybe he did something else.	Kodwa mhlawumbi wenza enye into.
He agreed with me.	Wavuma nam.
He also knew.	Naye wayesazi.
He did not want to be here.	Wayengafuni ukuba lapha.
One is no play.	Enye akukho ukudlala.
That's the thing.	Nantso into .
He thinks he does.	Ucinga ukuba wenza.

Something very wrong might have happened.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba kukho into embi eyenzekayo.
There is nothing here.	Akukho nto apha.
It's a big deal for me.	Yinto enkulu kum.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
But he clearly did.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo wakwenza oko.
No, really.	Akunjalo, ngokwenene.
You said we would talk about it.	Ubuthe siza kuthetha ngayo.
We do not have to.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba senze njalo.
But we should have known.	Kodwa bekufanele ukuba siyazi.
That's why he knew he could do this.	Yiyo loo nto wayesazi ukuba angayenza le nto.
I think your place.	Ndicinga indawo yakho.
Everyone had to leave.	Wonke umntu kwafuneka ahambe.
Or he may have thought that he did.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba wenze njalo.
But one day !.	Kodwa ngenye imini!.
Now I am the only one with him.	Ngoku ndim naye kuphela.
I know it will be so.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
It happened the other way around.	Kwenzeka ngenye indlela.
It's hard for me.	Kunzima kum.
I had no idea what it was.	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni.
Well, I hope you like it.	Ewe, ndiyathemba ukuba uyayithanda.
There is a way.	Kukho indlela.
I want you to know that.	Ndifuna uyazi loo nto.
That's his problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki yakhe.
But he did not really.	Kodwa akazange ngokwenene.
That's what it is.	Yiloo nto ke.
If you really want to know.	Ukuba ngokwenene ufuna ukwazi.
We have done a good thing here.	Senze into entle apha.
He did not make anyone.	Akazange enze mntu.
He will have to leave.	Kuya kufuneka ahambe.
He wanted to know what was going to happen.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
But you will soon have to make a decision.	Kodwa kungekudala kuya kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
I would like.	Ndingathanda.
Really successful, really hard.	Ukuphumelela ngokwenene, kunzima ngokwenene.
It's just playing with it now.	Kuphela nje ukudlala ngayo ngoku.
Is.	Ngaba .
But not something else.	Kodwa hayi enye into.
Far away.	Kude kude.
One person.	Umntu omnye.
What a great.	Yintoni enkulu.
He thought he had to be.	Wayecinga ukuba kufuneka abe njalo.
It will not be difficult.	Akuyi kuba nzima.
You will know in the end.	Uya kukwazi ekugqibeleni.
What that will definitely mean.	Oko kuya kuthetha ntoni ngokuqinisekileyo.
I really don't like that.	Andiyithandi ncam lonto mna.
So he did not say much.	Ngoko akazange athethe kakhulu.
He just sat there.	Wahlala nje.
He did not come.	Akazange eze.
Whoever it is.	Nokuba ngubani na.
I hope he is not at work tonight.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akakho emsebenzini ngokuhlwanje.
Not really, no.	Hayi ngokwenene, hayi.
But that really happened this week.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka ngokwenene kule veki.
I know it well.	Ndiyazi kakuhle.
I am with you.	Mna ke nam.
But that is probably a good thing.	Kodwa mhlawumbi yinto entle leyo.
I think you should go to him.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka uye kuye.
What do you want to go that way.	Ufuna ukuya ntoni ngaloo ndlela.
In the end, he did.	Ekugqibeleni, wenza.
So what, he thought.	Ngoko yintoni, wacinga.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
To do this.	Ukwenza oku.
I can't tell right now.	Andikwazi ukuxelela okwangoku.
This happens often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo.
I have never done that before.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto ngaphambili.
It's hard to drive.	Kuba nzima ukuqhuba.
So there you have it.	Ngoko kukho loo nto.
.	.
So, of course, you like it.	Ngoko, ngokuqinisekileyo, uyayithanda.
What you knew.	Oko ubusazi.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entle.
Now tell everyone about it.	Ngoku xelela wonke umntu ngayo.
No one wanted to know anything.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwazi nto.
That's the way it is.	Nantso indlela ke.
Not to him, but to you.	Hayi kuye, kodwa kuwe.
He started walking.	Waqalisa ukuhamba.
To see .	Ukubona .
He will not speak.	Akayi kuthetha.
Playing together.	Ukudlala kunye.
Probably once.	Mhlawumbi kube kanye.
You don't want to, obviously.	Awufuni, ngokucacileyo.
Or no one at all.	Okanye akukho mntu kwaphela.
.	.
He didn't know why, why then.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni, kutheni ngoko.
But it is certainly true in another way.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo yinyani ngenye indlela.
Some money, maybe.	Enye imali, mhlawumbi.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ngawe.
Your car or mine.	Imoto yakho okanye yam.
You know, too.	Uyayazi, naye.
Now you want to talk.	Ngoku ufuna ukuthetha.
But we had better do it right away.	Kodwa kungcono siyenze ngokukhawuleza.
That's what it is.	Yiloo nto ke.
I thought this was a good thing.	Bendicinga ukuba yinto entle le.
I think he thought better of it.	Ndicinga ukuba wayecinga ngcono ngayo.
Anyone can have done it.	Nabani na usenokuba uyenzile.
He doesn't know much.	Akazi nto ingako.
Not so fast.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza.
He thought he was doing the right thing.	Wayecinga ukuba wenza into elungileyo.
I told him about you.	Ndamxelela ngawe.
He had to talk to her.	Kwafuneka athethe naye.
As it should have been.	Njengoko bekufanele ukuba.
I did not want to be here.	Ndandingafuni ukuba lapha.
We will repeat that.	Siza kuphinda loo nto.
I just think of everything.	Ndicinga nje ngayo yonke into.
That's a really good thing.	Yinto entle ngokwenene leyo.
I hope everyone will be like that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wonke umntu uya kuba njalo.
That will be tomorrow.	Oko kuya kuba ngomso.
He did not stay.	Akazange ahlale.
Please do this.	Nceda wenze oku.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
I said nothing to her.	Khange ndithethe enye into kuye.
I want to know why you are here.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni ulapha.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
It seems a long time ago.	Kubonakala kudala.
No matter how much he wanted it.	Nokuba wayefuna kangakanani na.
I knew nothing about it.	Ndandingazi nto ngayo.
So much so.	Ngoko kakhulu.
You will do the right thing.	Uya kwenza into elungileyo.
That's it.	Yiyo nje.
So again.	Ngoko kwakhona.
We did all that.	Senze yonke loo nto.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange.
That way we'll all be together, there.	Ngaloo ndlela sonke siya kuba kunye, apho.
I can't do it.	Andikwazi ukuyenza.
I have to think, think.	Kufuneka ndicinge, ndicinge.
He wanted to.	Wayefuna .
Of course, I can do that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ndingayenza loo nto.
Really, one acted quickly.	Ngokwenene, omnye wenza ngokukhawuleza.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
For me.	Kum nje.
One, one, one.	Enye, enye, enye.
He told me everything.	Uye wandixelela yonke into.
You just told me.	Undixelele nje.
You know, you finally know how to do that.	Uyazi, ekugqibeleni uyayazi indlela yokwenza oko.
Please, please.	Nceda, nceda.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
But he knows it all too well.	Kodwa uyazi kakhulu ngokupheleleyo.
He was looking for a way.	Wayefuna indlela.
Away from me.	Kude kum.
This is not clearly the case here.	Oku akunjalo ngokucacileyo apha.
he thought.	wacinga.
.	.
This means money.	Oku kuthetha imali.
He wants to do it.	Uyafuna ukuyenza.
Everyone loves it.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda.
You need to know.	Kufuneka uyazi.
It happens everywhere.	Kwenzeka kuyo yonke indawo.
It should be easy.	Kufuneka kube lula.
It will get better.	Kuya kuba ngcono.
Or he did it for us.	Okanye wenza ngathi.
He wanted to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi.
He really tried to help.	Wazama ngokwenene ukunceda.
You should, maybe.	Ufanele ukuba, mhlawumbi.
Sorry this is too far.	Uxolo oku kude kakhulu.
I would like to see more.	Ndingathanda ukubona ngakumbi.
But it is impossible.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka.
I think that is possible.	Ndicinga ukuba kunokwenzeka oko.
I can do that, too.	Ndingayenza loo nto, nam.
Nothing, or no one.	Akukho nto, okanye akukho mntu.
Does anyone know if there is a way to do this.	Ngaba umntu uyazi ukuba kukho indlela yokwenza oku.
He just wanted too bad for this to be true.	Wayefuna nje kakubi kakhulu ukuba oku kube yinyani.
What did I do? 	Ndenze ntoni?
It's hard to see the other way around.	Kunzima ukubona enye indlela.
I don't want to be alone now.	Andifuni ukuba ndedwa ngoku.
Nobody wants to stay there.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuhlala apho.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
I wonder if.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba.
Yes, we certainly know about it.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo siyazi ngayo.
All right though.	Kulungile kodwa.
Now he knew for sure.	Ngoku wayesazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa oko akunjalo.
I didn't want to do anything.	Ndandingafuni kwenza nto.
What will I do? 	Ndiza kwenza ntoni?
Probably a book.	Mhlawumbi incwadi.
I can't go to him.	Andikwazi ukuya kuye.
So it happened.	Ngoko kwenzeka.
You want one.	Ufuna enye.
I did not know how to do it.	Bendingazi ukuba ndenze njani.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Well, maybe not so much.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi hayi kangako.
I know him a little bit.	Ndiyamazi kancinci.
This should be the case.	Oku kufuneka kube yiyo.
I hope not that tonight.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo ngokuhlwanje.
I'm coming for you.	Ndiza kuwe.
This is really the thing.	Le yinto ngokwenene.
Is true!.	Yinyani!.
Nice place.	Indawo entle.
He was not far away.	Wayengekho kude.
That's the way, he thought.	Nantso indlela, wacinga.
This happens often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
I'll talk to you later.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kamva.
I talked to him, okay.	Ndithethe naye, kulungile.
We will have to do that.	Kuza kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
I want to do it.	Ndifuna ukwenza.
It means no.	Kuthetha ukuba akukho.
You know the place.	Uyayazi loo ndawo.
You do not have to do anything.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze nto.
He is planning something very wrong.	Uceba into embi kakhulu.
Finding something.	Ukufumana into.
But we all know that is not the case.	Kodwa sonke siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
Yeah, everything.	Ewe, yonke into.
That really is old.	Oko ngenene kudala.
I know, whatever happens.	Ndiyazi, nantoni na eyenzekayo.
I certainly can't speak.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andikwazi kuthetha.
So he did.	Ngoko uyenzile.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
He just can't.	Akakwazi nje.
But you know very well that.	Kodwa uyazi kakuhle loo nto.
This is not possible.	Akunakwenzeka oku.
That's me.	Ndim lowo.
My job, you know.	Umsebenzi wam, uyazi.
This is me .	Ndim lo .
Very, very soon.	Kakhulu, kungekudala.
What, he did not know.	Yintoni, wayengazi.
But he thought he knew.	Kodwa wayecinga ukuba uyazi.
The food ran out.	Kwaphela ukutya.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
Something is happening here.	Kukho into eyenzekayo apha.
If not please tell me.	Ukuba akunjalo nceda undixelele.
He said nothing to her.	Khange athethe nto kuye.
I don’t want to do too much with it.	Andifuni ukwenza kakhulu ngayo.
All too much money.	Yonke imali eninzi kakhulu.
He wasn't too much.	Wayengekho kakhulu.
I hope you know what it is.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
I'm just.	Ndim nje.
You know what you need to do.	Uyayazi into ekufuneka uyenzile.
You've done enough for now.	Wenze ngokwaneleyo okwangoku.
It is not as easy as it seems.	Akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
You will not know.	Awuyi kukwazi.
Anything you need to do.	Nantoni na ekufuneka uyenzile.
It should have been me.	Bekufanele ukuba ndim.
Or even more difficult.	Okanye nokuba kunzima kakhulu.
Work will do that for you.	Umsebenzi uya kwenza oko kuwe.
I want to know what the problem is.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
I wondered what he was going to do.	Ndandicinga ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
Outside, perhaps, for you.	Ngaphandle, mhlawumbi, kuwe.
Everyone wanted to be with him.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukuba naye.
I need someone here.	Ndifuna umntu apha.
I'm not sure how.	Andazi ncam ukuba njani.
Not that.	Akunjalo ukuba.
I wanted nothing.	Ndandingafuni nto.
I wonder if no one lives in it right now.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba akukho mntu uhlala kuyo ngoku.
He did it alone.	Wenza yedwa.
I certainly did not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo khange ndiyenze.
I will come to you.	Ndiya kuza kuwe.
But that will soon end.	Kodwa kungekudala oko kuya kuphela.
He did not know what he was thinking.	Wayengazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
I had no idea what it was.	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni.
We need to know what's going on there.	Kufuneka siyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni apho.
Me, that's fine.	Mna, kulungile.
So no one wanted to talk to us.	Ngoko akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha nathi.
Not someone else.	Hayi omnye umntu.
We did so.	Senze njalo ke.
Or you need help.	Okanye ufuna uncedo.
Where are you?.	Uphi?.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He just didn't know.	Wayengazi nje.
Nobody wants that to happen.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba oko kwenzeke.
It will be you.	Uza kuba nguwe.
Work, work.	Umsebenzi, umsebenzi.
Good man.	Umntu olungileyo.
I think it will be so.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
He does not have to.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
My only problem.	Ingxaki yam kuphela.
There is no way.	Akukho ndlela.
He says yes.	Uthi ewe.
But soon.	Kodwa kungekudala.
I'm trying to walk.	Ndizama ukuhamba.
He did not know why.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
You have to be.	Kufuneka ube njalo.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiyo loo nto ngokwenene.
In prison.	Entolongweni.
No one.	Akukho mntu.
Soon, she realized.	Kungekudala, waqonda.
We will sit down.	Siza kuhlala phantsi.
Well there you told me.	Kulungile apho undixelele.
There is just nothing there.	Akukho nto nje apho.
I would like to know what it is.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.	Siza kuthetha ngale nto kusasa.
As he would later say.	Njengoko wayeza kuthetha kamva.
What the hell? 	Yintoni?
.	.
You, and me.	Wena, kunye nam.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
But that's all.	Kodwa yonke loo nto.
We'll talk about it.	Siza kuthetha ngayo.
This is hard to do.	Oku kunzima ukwenza.
It seems like yesterday to me.	Kubonakala ngathi izolo kum.
He will come.	Uya kuza.
That happened to me.	Kwenzeka loo nto kum.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
I can't find the problem.	Andikwazi ukufumana ingxaki.
The only problem.	Ingxaki kuphela .
In this.	Kule nto.
Only the truth now.	Inyani kuphela ngoku.
He knew he needed help.	Wayesazi ukuba ufuna uncedo.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni.
That's good enough.	Oko kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
I will not stay far away.	Andiyi kuhlala kude.
I'm not sure anyone is doing it right now.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba nabani na wenza ngoku.
So tell me.	Ndixelele ke.
I know one but not the other.	Ndiyazi enye kodwa hayi enye.
So there is another way.	Ngoko kukho enye indlela.
But it doesn't have to be.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba.
But you know the whole thing.	Kodwa uyayazi yonke loo nto.
Maybe, but maybe not.	Mhlawumbi, kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo.
For, of course, he would be alone.	Kuba, ngokuqinisekileyo, wayeza kuba yedwa.
I never thought about it.	Andizange ndicinge ngayo.
He has done it all.	Uyenze yonke.
That's you.	Nguwe lowo.
But I am the only one.	Kodwa ndim kuphela.
I think he will.	Ndicinga ukuba uya kuyenza.
You just want a chance.	Ufuna nje ithuba.
I want to talk to her, too.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye, nam.
Someone else did.	Omnye umntu wenza.
It's gone again.	Kuye kwakhona .
No one else.	Akukho mntu omnye.
I will do this again.	Ndiza kuyenza kwakhona le nto.
A little better.	Kancinci ngcono.
I'm not sure it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yiyo.
I know exactly what it is.	Ndiyazi kakuhle ukuba yintoni na.
You've done enough.	Wenze ngokwaneleyo.
I will do it later.	Ndiza kuyenza kamva.
Too many things.	Izinto ezininzi kakhulu.
So he stays.	Ngoko uhlala.
It's all new.	Yinto yonke into entsha.
He knew very well.	Wayesazi kakhulu.
We will do just that.	Siya kuyenza loo nto kanye.
He stayed with me through it all.	Wahlala nam kuyo yonke loo nto.
He does not want to talk.	Akafuni kuthetha.
Great? 	Enkulu?
You seem to know a lot.	Kubonakala ngathi wazi kakhulu.
I never thought you should, no.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ufanele, hayi.
You are the only one for me.	Nguwe wedwa kum.
I hope today is good for you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba namhlanje kulungile kuwe.
No, obviously.	Akunjalo, ngokucacileyo.
We know what this is.	Siyazi ukuba yintoni le.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni.
A lot of money.	Imali eninzi.
You know it well.	Wazi kakuhle.
Time is of the essence.	Ixesha lixesha.
Maybe he can too.	Mhlawumbi naye unokuba njalo.
Yes, not today, but soon.	Ewe, hayi namhlanje, kodwa kungekudala.
I will tell the truth.	Ndiza kuthetha inyani.
It's too far away.	Kude kakhulu ngokwenene.
He said nothing.	Zange athethe nto.
It really should.	Ngenene kufuneka.
It happened yesterday.	Yenzeke izolo.
Not good, but good.	Hayi kakuhle, kodwa kulungile.
He did not know what he was thinking.	Wayengazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
No, he did not come here.	Hayi, khange eze apha.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na.
It is up to you to decide.	Kuwe ukuba wenze isigqibo.
Probably no problem.	Mhlawumbi akukho ngxaki.
Well, he never did.	Ewe, akazange akwenze oko.
No he wasn't.	Hayi wayengekho.
I hope something new is coming.	Ndiyathemba into entsha ezayo.
He did very well in it.	Wenza kakuhle kakhulu kuyo.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
If you would like to do so.	Ukuba ungathanda ukwenza njalo.
It's a bad thing.	Yinto embi.
That really happened.	Oko kwenzeka ngokwenene.
You love it, the whole thing.	Uyayithanda, yonke loo nto.
He just has to do it.	Kufuneka nje ayenze.
Everyone sat down again.	Wonke umntu wahlala phantsi kwakhona.
No, it is not.	Hayi, akunakwenzeka.
But he tried.	Kodwa wazama.
He kept thinking.	Wahlala wacinga.
Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.
If not, it is not.	Ukuba akunjalo, akunjalo.
It is time for this to happen.	Lixesha lokuba oku kwenzeke.
He'll just do it.	Uya kuyenza nje.
But he really knows what he wants.	Kodwa ngokwenene uyayazi into ayifunayo.
You did your thing.	Uyenzile into yakho.
Well obviously.	Kulungile kucacile.
I know, you know.	Ndiyayazi, nawe uyayazi.
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.
Good thing, too.	Into entle, nayo.
Not my place.	Hayi indawo yam.
Something you need to do more.	Into ekufuneka uyenzile ngakumbi.
So he made a decision.	Ngoko wenza isigqibo.
But it's okay.	Kodwa kulungile.
That's really hard.	Kunzima ngokwenene oko.
No one really knew.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngokwenene.
This had to be very difficult for her.	Oku kwafuneka kube nzima kakhulu kuye.
He did not go anywhere.	Akazange aye ndawo.
He has to be able to do it outside.	Kufuneka akwazi ukuyenza ngaphandle.
He did not want to be here.	Wayengafuni ukuba lapha.
That will be the case with everything.	Kuya kuba njalo ngayo yonke into.
This is something new.	Le yinto entsha.
Or work, really.	Okanye umsebenzi, ngokwenene.
That would be very difficult.	Oko kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
He has to leave until tomorrow.	Ufanele ahambe kude kube kusasa.
But he will soon come.	Kodwa kungekudala uza kuza.
It's hard to do.	Kunzima ukuyenza.
Or maybe it's me.	Okanye mhlawumbi ndim.
I really want to learn.	Ndifuna kakhulu ukufunda.
So help anyone do it beforehand.	Ngoko nceda nabani na wenze ngaphambili.
But that is not possible.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Mhlawumbi, mhlawumbi, mhlawumbi.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
But that is not the case at all.	Kodwa akunjalo kwaphela.
It does not happen overnight.	Asiyonto eyenzekayo ngokukhawuleza.
Not with him.	Hayi naye.
But one exception.	Kodwa enye ngaphandle.
It's hard for me.	Kunzima kum.
Not really.	Akukho nyani.
I don't want to do it.	Andifuni ukuyenza.
He thinks it is impossible.	Ucinga ukuba akunakwenzeka.
I just want to sit down for a bit.	Ndifuna nje ukuhlala phantsi kancinci.
I want you to be with me.	Ndifuna ukuba ube nam.
He only wanted peace.	Wayefuna uxolo kuphela.
One way to do this is to do it.	Enye indlela yokwenza oku.
Sounds good.	Kubonakala kulungile.
No, not at all, no.	Hayi, akunjalo, hayi.
That will be today.	Oko kuya kuba namhlanje.
No, not this morning.	Hayi, hayi ngale ntsasa.
Please do a good job.	Nceda wenze umsebenzi olungileyo.
He finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni wavuma.
He would do something about it.	Wayeza kwenza into ngaloo nto.
He did, you know.	Uyenzile, uyazi.
Because there really is no problem here.	Kuba nyani akukho ngxaki apha.
No one knows everything.	Akukho mntu wazi yonke into.
Everyone wants money.	Wonke umntu ufuna imali.
Play is okay.	Ukudlala kulungile.
No one looked at anyone else.	Akukho mntu wajonga omnye umntu.
But he did not know.	Kodwa ke wayengazi.
This is one person.	Ngumntu omnye lo.
This happened much faster.	Le yenzeke ngokukhawuleza ngakumbi.
Yes, it will.	Ewe, kuya kuba njalo.
Whatever that means.	Nokuba kuthetha ntoni oko.
I am fully aware of this.	Ndiyazi ngokupheleleyo le nto.
I can't have him home anymore.	Andikwazi ukuba naye ekhaya kwakhona.
He looked at me.	Wajonga kum.
That way you don't want to.	Ngaloo ndlela awufuni.
I hope it gets better now.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kungcono ngoku.
I already feel better.	Sele ndiziva ngcono.
It's a long time.	Lixesha elide.
This may be difficult, but it is not possible.	Oku kunokuba nzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
He told me about it.	Wandixelela ngayo.
But you are the only one at home.	Kodwa nguwe wedwa ekhaya.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi ukwenza oku.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
Now she said she liked it.	Ngoku wathi uyayithanda.
I just have to say this.	Kufuneka ndithethe nje oku.
But not immediately.	Kodwa hayi ngoko nangoko.
I knew nothing.	Ndandingazi nto mna.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto kanye.
He did not have to.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
We went there.	Siye apho.
He tried to stay.	Wazama ukuhlala.
Something terrible is happening.	Kukho into embi eyenzekayo.
Nothing, though.	Akukho nto, nokuba.
It was not necessary.	Kwakungeyomfuneko.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza .
He made it happen.	Uyenzile ukuba yenzeke.
So now you know how it happened.	Ngoko ngoku uyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani.
It does not seem easy.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho lula.
Which, of course, is not the case.	Nto leyo, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunjalo.
So, no problem.	Ngoko, akukho ngxaki.
It's too far, that way.	Kude kakhulu, ngaloo ndlela.
But he knew it was true.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba yinyani.
But I am the only one.	Kodwa ndim kuphela.
Nobody at all.	Akukho mntu kwaphela .
You have to do it slowly.	Kufuneka uyenze kancinci.
He looked a little at her.	Wajonga kancinci naye.
I know this.	Ndiyayazi le nto.
Faster better.	Ngokukhawuleza ngcono.
I did not think.	Khange ndicinge.
How do you know? 	Umele ukuba uyazi njani?
I had to make a decision.	Kwafuneka ndenze isigqibo.
That is something new.	Leyo yinto entsha.
I will definitely stay there again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuhlala apho kwakhona.
He did very well there.	Wenza kakuhle kakhulu apho.
I'm just this though.	Ndim nje lo kodwa.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
This can happen very quickly.	Oku kunokwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
But it is impossible.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka.
But nothing, no one.	Kodwa akukho nto, akukho mntu.
But that is not possible for me.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka kum.
I want to know if it is possible.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
So this happened very quickly.	Ngoko, kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza oko.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba njalo.
Where are you right now?.	Ingaba uphi ngoku?.
Nothing too much.	Akukho nto kakhulu.
It will probably happen differently.	Mhlawumbi kuya kwenzeka ngenye indlela.
If you think.	Ukuba ucinga.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi loo nto.
He just wanted to go there.	Wayefuna nje ukuya apho.
It is not easy to find another place.	Akukho lula ukufumana enye indawo.
I think that would look good.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuya kubonakala kulungile.
That's it, all right.	Nantso into, kulungile.
I want forgiveness.	Ndifuna uxolo.
Not at all.	Akunjalo kwaphela.
I hope it's okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kulungile.
He had to do so.	Kwafuneka enjenjalo.
It will be difficult to tell.	Kuya kuba nzima ukuxelela.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku.
It's just true.	Yinyani nje.
Soon we will get better.	Kungekudala siza kuba ngcono.
Doing good work.	Ukwenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
No, you are not.	Hayi, awuyi.
Please, you must.	Siza, kufuneka.
I really want that.	Ndifuna kakhulu loo nto.
Not so fast, there.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza, apho.
He said he did not.	Wathi akazange.
He did not want to talk about it.	Akazange afune ukuthetha ngayo.
It just happened the other day.	Kwenzeka nje ngenye imini.
That's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu leyo.
By the way.	Ngendlela.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
She will have to talk to him about it.	Kuya kufuneka athethe naye ngaloo nto.
You are always thinking.	Uhlala ucinga.
That will be really hard to find.	Oko kuya kuba nzima ngokwenene ukufumana.
Not good, but better.	Hayi kakuhle, kodwa ngcono.
This is a big deal.	Le yinto enkulu.
I never thought why.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kwakutheni.
But eventually that happened.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni kwenzeka loo nto.
This is really possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
I don't know how I can make this happen.	Andazi ukuba ndingayenza njani lento yenzeke.
But not this way.	Kodwa hayi ngale ndlela.
For a long time, really.	Ixesha elide, ngokwenene.
But he knew nothing.	Kodwa wayengazi nto.
It has to be you.	Kufuneka ube nguwe.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
No one knew anything or anyone.	Akukho mntu wayesazi nto okanye nabani na.
Whatever it really is.	Nokuba yintoni na ngokwenene.
He wanted everything.	Wayefuna yonke into.
Please, this way.	Nceda, ngale ndlela.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga ncam.
Now the problem.	Ngoku ingxaki.
Don't go to school.	Musa ukuya esikolweni.
He thought so.	Wacinga njalo.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
He may not know it.	Usenokuba akazi.
It's completely new.	Yinto entsha ngokupheleleyo.
Why this.	Kutheni le nto.
Nowhere.	Akakho ndawo.
He doesn't look good.	Akabonakali kakuhle.
But I do not understand how.	Kodwa andiqondi ukuba njani.
He will do it.	Uza kuyenza.
There, it's better.	Apho, kungcono.
He wanted, he wanted.	Wayefuna, wayefuna.
He wants to be with you.	Ufuna ukuba nawe.
No one knows anything.	Akukho mntu wazi nto.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku .
But where you go.	Kodwa apho uya khona.
How did it happen.	Ingaba yenzeke njani.
He would do all that.	Wayeza kuyenza yonke loo nto.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, waqonda.
He had to think about it.	Kwafuneka acinge ngayo.
I'm not sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
He just looked.	Uye wajonga nje.
If that is what he wanted to be.	Ukuba yiloo nto wayefuna ukuba yiyo.
I never went there.	Andizange ndiye apho.
If not, that would be fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, oko kuya kulungile.
Tell me what you think about it.	Ndixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni ngaloo nto.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
I do not know where.	Andazi apho.
I can't say anything right now.	Andikwazi kuthetha nto ngoku.
There is only one or the other.	Kukho enye kuphela okanye enye.
He lives there.	Uhlala apho.
Maybe a slow move.	Mhlawumbi ukuhamba kancinci.
This is even more difficult.	Oku kunzima ngakumbi.
Maybe help.	Mhlawumbi uncedo.
He will not come.	Akayi kuza.
Talking is not necessary.	Ukuthetha akuyomfuneko.
You have done this before.	Ukhe wenza ngale ndlela ngaphambili.
He has really done something wrong to you.	Wenze kakubi ngenene ngawe.
He did a good job with it, too.	Wenza umsebenzi olungileyo ngayo, naye.
To do that once again.	Ukwenza oko kube kanye kwakhona.
Yes, it will.	Ewe, kuya kuba njalo.
I'm going there now.	Ndiya khona ngoku.
But he knew, he knew.	Kodwa wayesazi, wayesazi.
But it is difficult to remain optimistic.	Kodwa kunzima ukuhlala unethemba.
He thought he would do it.	Wacinga ukuba uya kwenza.
All right though.	Kulungile kodwa.
That is clear.	Oko kucacile.
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
It can be very difficult.	Kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
Lots of space.	Indawo eninzi.
This should be the case, because this is very obvious.	Oku kufuneka kube njalo, kuba oku kubonakala kakhulu.
Now we know.	Ngoku siyazi.
He looked completely out of sight.	Wajonga ngaphandle ngokupheleleyo.
I’m not sure what or what.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni okanye yintoni na.
Maybe that's all.	Mhlawumbi kuphela oko.
But he stayed.	Kodwa wahlala.
We need to go there now.	Kufuneka siye apho ngoku.
Everyone needs help.	Wonke umntu ufuna uncedo.
I know my place.	Ndiyayazi indawo yam.
That's all we need to know.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka siyazi.
I'm not sure what exactly this is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni kanye le.
I don't want to talk about it.	Andifuni kuthetha ngayo.
Maybe he doesn't think so.	Mhlawumbi akacingi njalo.
This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
Now then, tell me.	Ngoku ke, ndixelele.
Yes and you.	Ewe nawe.
I did nothing.	Khange ndenze nto.
He lives there.	Uhlala apho.
But just seeing.	Kodwa ukubona nje.
Or his person.	Okanye umntu wakhe.
But he knew that this was impossible.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
I feel so much better too.	Ndiziva ngcono kakhulu nam.
But, in the end, we will be together.	Kodwa, ekugqibeleni, siya kuba kunye.
She will have to be in him.	Kuya kufuneka abe kuye.
Nothing should happen to you.	Akukho nto kufuneka yenzeke kuwe.
You need to know something.	Kufuneka uyazi into.
Nothing, nothing.	Akukho nto, akukho nto.
I can't be with you.	Andikwazi ukuba nawe.
He did not say much.	Akazange athethe nto ingako.
Or maybe he didn't.	Okanye mhlawumbi akazange.
I want you to do this.	Ndifuna wenze oku.
Even if that means traveling alone.	Nokuba oko kuthetha ukuhamba wedwa.
Everyone should stay together.	Wonke umntu kufuneka ahlale kunye.
That's old.	Oko kudala.
This he will never do here.	Le akanakuze ayenze apha.
What happened, but not always.	Kwenzeke ntoni, kodwa hayi rhoqo.
Maybe that happened to me.	Mhlawumbi oko kwenzeka kum.
Yes she does.	Ewe wenza njalo.
Yes, eating food.	Ewe, ukutya ukutya.
But that is not really the case.	Kodwa oko akunjalo ngenene.
He is here this morning.	Ulapha ngale ntsasa.
I do not want to talk to you.	Andifuni kuthetha nawe.
I wonder how long it will last.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kuya kuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
Maybe more.	Mhlawumbi ngakumbi.
So this is exactly the same thing.	Ngoko le yinto enye ngokupheleleyo.
Or maybe all of them.	Okanye mhlawumbi wonke.
He did it alone.	Wakwenza oko eyedwa.
Really, really down.	Ngokwenene, phantsi ngokwenene.
I think this is good.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kulungile.
This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
He wants to know what you did.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuba wenze ntoni na.
That's all you need to know now.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyazi ngoku.
He did not stay.	Akazange ahlale.
What the heck.	Yintoni le embi.
Now it will be very difficult.	Ngoku kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
Or impossible.	Okanye akunakwenzeka.
He also did not go.	Naye akayi.
You know a little bit.	Uyazi kancinci.
So that's the thing.	Ngoko nantso into.
He did not stop speaking.	Akazange ayeke ukuthetha.
He made it happen.	Wenza ukuba kwenzeke.
I go to work.	Ndiya emsebenzini.
He did much better.	Wenza ngcono kakhulu.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, uyenzile.
I feel like I want to get this now.	Ndiziva ndifuna ukufumana oku ngoku.
Yeah, maybe a little bit.	Ewe, mhlawumbi kancinci.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
I never knew.	Andizange ndiyazi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa oko akunjalo.
You must have done well.	Umele ukuba wenze kakuhle.
If he has done this once, he can do it again.	Ukuba uyenzile le nto kube kanye, angayenza kwakhona.
I did not go to school.	Khange ndiye esikolweni.
I doubt it though.	Ndiyathandabuza kodwa.
Not a bad thing to do.	Hayi into embi ukuyenza.
One did the other.	Omnye wenza enye.
I never thought it would be so hard.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba nzima kangako.
He never said that.	Akazange athethe loo nto.
I will do everything for you.	Ndiza kuyenza yonke into kuwe.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona.
If not, you will do so.	Ukuba akunjalo, uya kwenza njalo.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
It is very difficult to know for sure.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He goes to prison.	Uya entolongweni.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
This one was not.	Lo wayengekho.
That's all, really.	Yiloo nto kuphela, ngokwenene.
I can't do that.	Andikwazi kuyenza loo nto.
That means there is.	Oko kuthetha ukuba kukho.
Maybe you do too.	Mhlawumbi nawe wenza njalo.
I am again.	Ndim kwakhona.
He and I.	Naye kunye nam.
It's time.	Lixesha.
He has to be with me.	Kufuneka abe nam.
But I'm not sure how I did it.	Kodwa andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani.
Well, you just did it.	Ewe, uyenzile nje.
I'm scared of everything.	Ndiyoyika yonke into.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa ngokwenene akunjalo.
Why this, no one knows for sure.	Kutheni le nto, akukho mntu wazi kakuhle.
Driving to work.	Ukuqhuba ukuya emsebenzini.
That is what happened.	Yinto eyenzekayo leyo.
He never did that.	Akazange akwenze oko.
Everything happened so fast.	Yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
There you are alone now.	Kukho wena wedwa ngoku.
Maybe it will be better tomorrow.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba ngcono kusasa.
All right, soon.	Kulungile, kungekudala.
I'll get to you soon.	Ndiza kuza kuwe ngokukhawuleza.
He certainly has to think about everything.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka acinge ngayo yonke into.
He did not appear.	Akazange abonakale.
He started talking.	Waqalisa ukuthetha.
He had to stop.	Kwafuneka ayeke.
He tried to eat.	Wazama ukutya.
Travel is fine.	Ukuhamba kulungile.
You know this place very well.	Uyayazi kakuhle le ndawo.
I decided.	Ndenze isigqibo.
One at the hospital.	Omnye esibhedlele.
What do you think.	Ingaba ucinga ntoni.
I feel more.	Ndiziva ngakumbi.
But you know that.	Kodwa uyayazi loo nto.
I want to stay.	Ndifuna ukuhlala.
Good, good book.	Incwadi entle, entle.
You better be.	Kungcono ube.
But it is difficult.	Kodwa kunzima.
You can be him.	Unokuba nguye.
This is very difficult here.	Oku kunzima kakhulu apha.
Or do anything.	Okanye wenze nantoni na.
We now know why.	Siyazi ngoku ukuba kutheni.
Doing the work.	Ukwenza umsebenzi.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
I don't want to talk too much.	Andifuni kuthetha kakhulu.
You did not know.	Ubungazi.
Not too far away.	Akukho kude kangako.
I want to talk to you about it.	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe ngaloo nto.
You can be anything.	Unokuba nantoni na.
Now he knew better.	Ngoku wayesazi ngcono.
It really happened to me.	Ngokwenene kwenzeka kanye kum.
I think that's true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani.
I am the only one here.	Ndim ndedwa apha.
He pretends not to know.	Wenza ngathi akazi.
He said he wanted to talk to me.	Wathi ufuna ukuthetha nam.
No no, no yes.	Hayi hayi, hayi ewe.
Yes, you should.	Ewe, ufanele.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe yinyani leyo.
But if you want to, that's fine.	Kodwa ukuba uyafuna, kulungile.
One day, but not now.	Ngenye imini, kodwa hayi ngoku.
It's true now.	Yinyani ngoku.
Nobody did anything.	Akukho mntu wenze nto.
I can't talk to anyone.	Andikwazi kuthetha naye nabani na.
You are the one who looks bad.	Nguwe lo ukhangeleka kakubi.
Looks like he can't sit still.	Kubonakala ngathi akakwazi ukuhlala phantsi.
But not before.	Kodwa hayi ngaphambili.
He wanted nothing.	Wayengafuni nto.
It should mean that.	Kufuneka kuthetha ukuba.
He was not hard to see.	Akazange kube nzima ukubona.
To him and to her.	Kuye kunye naye.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange akwazi.
I'm really scared.	Ndiyoyika ngokwenene.
He will definitely be here tonight.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uzakuba lapha ngokuhlwanje.
But it is impossible.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka.
Just you and me.	Wena nam kuphela.
He soon realized.	Ngokukhawuleza waqonda.
Anyone can do it.	Nabani na angayenza.
There you are.	Nawe apho.
That, obviously, is not the case.	Oko, ngokucacileyo, akunjalo.
He started walking.	Waqalisa ukuhamba.
I'm not sure where the problem is right now.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba iphi ingxaki okwangoku.
He did well.	Wenza kakuhle.
Probably not necessarily.	Mhlawumbi akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
I know that's true.	Ndiyazi ukuba yinyani leyo.
Or so he thought.	Okanye ke wayecinga.
But what is that.	Kodwa yintoni na loo nto.
I'm not sure how.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba njani.
But he will do that if he wants to.	Kodwa uya kwenza ukuba uyafuna.
He says nothing.	Uthi akukho nto.
You told me that today.	Undixelele lonto namhlanje.
Everyone wanted to do something.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukwenza into.
Yeah, a little bit.	Ewe, kancinci.
You look like you want one.	Ukhangeleka ngathi ufuna enye.
But he is doing it now.	Kodwa wenza ngoku.
If it is, it is.	Ukuba nguye, nguye.
Well, you should know what this is all about.	Ewe, kufuneka wazi ukuba yintoni na le nto.
But he certainly did not.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akazange.
Not everyone is.	Ayinguye wonke umntu lowo.
Don't just read this book.	Musa nje ukufunda le ncwadi.
It is necessary.	Kufuneka .
Everyone really wants to be with you.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuba nawe ngokwenene.
One was absent.	Omnye wayengekho.
I'm not sure how.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba njani.
I am very happy.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
He knows, knowing his way.	Uyazi, ukwazi indlela yakhe.
Sorry about that, everyone.	Uxolo ngaloo nto, wonke umntu.
No, maybe, more.	Hayi, mhlawumbi, ngakumbi.
Once, once.	Kanye, kube kanye.
I'm not sure how I did it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani.
Or maybe not.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Yeah, okay, okay.	Ewe, kulungile, kulungile.
He never owned another car.	Akazange abe enye imoto.
But seeing something completely different.	Kodwa ukubona enye into ngokupheleleyo.
Good play does.	Ukudlala kakuhle kwenza.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange enjenjalo.
You told me about you.	Undixelele ngawe.
Maybe you talk about it.	Mhlawumbi uthetha ngayo.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
But he asked.	Kodwa wabuza.
He started walking.	Waqalisa ukuhamba.
thinking about you!.	ndicinga ngawe!.
He seemed alone.	Wayebonakala eyedwa.
This can actually be.	Oku kunokuba ngokwenene.
You want something from me.	Ufuna into kum.
This is a really good thing.	Yinto entle ngokwenene le.
He will definitely be here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uzakuba lapha.
He did not go with her.	Akazange naye.
No one goes to him no.	Akukho mntu uya kuye hayi.
And now what.	Ke ngoku ntoni .
Not for me.	Akukho kum.
I'm not sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni kuya kuba njalo.
Not you.	Hayi nawe.
He has to stay that way.	Kufuneka ahlale enjalo.
Something happened to me.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kum.
That's the way to do it.	Nantso indlela yokwenza oko.
But he is not visible.	Kodwa akabonakali.
Yes, yes, yes.	Ewe, ewe, ewe.
Probably immediately.	Mhlawumbi ngoko nangoko.
You feel great.	Uziva kakhulu.
He did not want her to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuba ahambe.
You know the way.	Uyayazi indlela.
Doing this for everyone.	Ukwenza oku kuye wonke umntu.
I will be in it eventually.	Ndiza kuba kuyo ekugqibeleni.
It's hard to say now.	Kunzima ukuthetha ngoku.
If not today, tomorrow.	Ukuba akunjalo namhlanje, ngomso.
You did your job.	Wenze umsebenzi wakho.
I am glad.	Ndiyavuya.
Not a bad place to be.	Hayi indawo embi ukuba ube kuyo.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He knew nothing about it.	Wayengazi nto ngayo.
He always told me.	Wandixelela njalo.
There is nothing here.	Akukho nto apha.
It's a little okay.	Kulungile kancinci.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But that's me.	Kodwa ndim lowo.
But last night.	Kodwa phezolo.
I could not decide.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
I know you feel that way.	Ndiyazi ukuba uziva njalo.
No one is there.	Akukho mntu apho.
Too much time.	Ixesha elininzi kakhulu .
I want to know more about this.	Ndifuna ukwazi ngakumbi ngale nto.
He did not go anywhere.	Akazange aye ndawo.
The way he spoke.	Indlela athethe ngayo .
I'll have to think about that.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngaloo nto.
You will have to do something else.	Kuya kufuneka wenze enye into.
I'm sure that's exactly it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiloo nto kanye.
Really go to him.	Ngenene uye kuye.
he said.	uthe.
I did the same thing today.	Ndenze into enye namhlanje.
This does not have to be.	Oku akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
He stayed with her.	Wahlala naye.
He just did too much.	Wenza nje kakhulu.
But you one day.	Kodwa wena ngenye imini.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga ncam.
Man, you know that.	Mntu, uyayazi loo nto.
But you don't want to do that.	Kodwa awufuni ukwenza loo nto.
I hope you did more.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenze ngakumbi.
I wish that.	Ndinqwenela ukuba .
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
Only you can be.	Nguwe ukuba unokuba.
It's a really big deal.	Yinto enkulu ngokwenene.
You may be telling the truth.	Usenokuba uthetha inyani.
To me.	Kum.
Right where he wants it.	Kanye apho ayifunayo.
If this is not possible.	Ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
Not out yet.	Akukho ngaphandle okwangoku.
He will not be able to get a job.	Akayi kukwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
I know enough that I can do it.	Ndiyazi ngokwaneleyo ukuba ndingayenza.
He also knows a lot.	Naye uyazi kakhulu.
He won't really talk.	Akayi kuthetha ngokwenene.
All work.	Umsebenzi wonke.
But then again.	Kodwa ke kwakhona.
This can be very difficult.	Oku kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
Finding this right is not possible.	Ukufumana oku kulungile akunakwenzeka.
He had to go.	Kwafuneka ahambe.
He did not know why he had come to her.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni eze kuye.
He was not thinking very well.	Wayengacingi kakuhle.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke le nto.
He tried to stay.	Wazama ukuhlala.
You have to have it.	Kufuneka ube nayo.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
I do not know.	Andazi.
You know, walking together.	Uyazi, ukuhamba kunye.
To be in it.	Ukuze ube kuyo.
Of course, there is way too much.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kukho indlela eninzi kakhulu.
So he thought about it further.	Ngoko wacinga ngayo ngakumbi.
Not bad, not at all.	Hayi kakubi, akunjalo kwaphela.
He had to find another place.	Kwafuneka afune enye indawo.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
I'm glad you're here.	Ndiyavuya ulapha.
Not much more, but a little bit.	Hayi kakhulu ngakumbi, kodwa kancinci.
You may be saying that.	Usenokuba uthetha loo nto.
He sat down with him and began to eat.	Wahlala phantsi naye waqalisa ukutya.
But that will not be easy.	Kodwa oko akuyi kuba lula.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
I would love to see you there !.	Ndingathanda ukubona apho!.
That place.	Loo ndawo .
You could be.	Usenokuba njalo.
Obviously I don't want to do this.	Ngokucacileyo andifuni kuyenza le nto.
By the way too.	Ngendlela kakhulu.
He said he was not there.	Wathi wayengekho.
.	.
This happens often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo.
It is possible.	Kusenokwenzeka.
It will be very difficult for me.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu kum.
Only to him.	Kuphela kuye.
We need to do it now.	Kufuneka siyenze ngoku.
Speaking is difficult.	Ukuthetha kunzima.
That's all you need to know.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyazi.
There is only this.	Kukho oku kuphela.
That's better.	Oko kungcono.
I am very happy.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu.
Now you just did.	Ngoku wenze nje.
We will be very visible.	Siza kubonakala kakhulu.
I just want to talk.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha.
As you said.	Njengoko uthe.
He has to do well.	Kufuneka enze kakuhle.
Not immediately.	Hayi ngoko nangoko.
But it is certainly not necessary.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akuyomfuneko.
I just want to be alone.	Ndifuna nje ukuba ndedwa.
But I could not.	Kodwa andizange ndikwazi.
Money, especially.	Imali, ngakumbi.
.	.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
This is exactly it.	Nguye kanye lo.
Not in it, in it.	Hayi kuyo, kuyo.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
I'm sure this is it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiyo le.
I would like to know.	Ndingathanda ukwazi.
I would really like to know more about you.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukwazi ngakumbi ngawe.
I didn't say anything else.	Khange ndithethe enye into.
But maybe it's better this way.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kungcono ngale ndlela.
But he was not in her.	Kodwa wayengekho kuye.
We need to do this.	Kufuneka senze oku.
I'd like to talk to you, please.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha nawe nceda.
He would never do such a thing.	Akanakuze enze into enjalo.
I think a lot.	Ndicinga kakhulu.
He's not there, you know.	Akakho apho, uyazi.
So he did this on the ground.	Ngoko wenza le nto phantsi.
Not so fast.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza.
But that is not the case today.	Kodwa akunjalo namhlanje.
It seems like a long time.	Kubonakala ngathi ixesha elide.
No one should be able to do that.	Akukho mntu ufanele akwazi ukwenza oko.
I enjoy doing work.	Ndiyavuya ukwenza umsebenzi.
He did not come to school today.	Akazange eze namhlanje esikolweni.
He's going to have to do something about it.	Kuya kufuneka enze into ngaloo nto.
Not too early.	Hayi kwangethuba.
Too long.	Ixesha elide kakhulu.
But no one does such a thing.	Kodwa akukho mntu wenza into enjalo.
Right here.	Kanye apha.
He sat down and thought.	Wahlala phantsi wacinga.
He also did not.	Naye akazange.
He lives with me.	Uhlala nam.
All the way.	Indlela yonke.
Okay there.	Kulungile apho.
He says he did.	Uthi wenza njalo.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
That's all.	Yiloo nto nje.
Not much talking.	Akukho ukuthetha kakhulu.
It never happened.	Zange kube njalo.
Me and you then.	Mna nawe ke.
Not that this happened to me.	Hayi ukuba oku kwenzeka kum.
I doubt a little about that.	Ndiyathandabuza kancinci ngaloo nto.
He had to talk to her.	Kwafuneka athethe naye.
But that is not the case today.	Kodwa akunjalo namhlanje.
He just did his thing.	Wenza nje into yakhe.
I did not go to you.	Khange ndiye kuwe.
He can speak.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha.
So everyone.	Ngoko ke wonke umntu.
Yes, not for long.	Ewe, hayi ixesha elide.
He could not help.	Akazange akwazi ukunceda.
Such a beautiful day.	Imini entle kangaka.
Now everyone asked.	Ngoku wonke umntu wabuza.
Don't be hard on yourself.	Musa ukuba nzima kuwe.
But not always.	Kodwa hayi rhoqo.
Nice bike.	Ibhayisekile entle.
Yes, very much so.	Ewe, kakhulu.

I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
Well, if you like something like that.	Kulungile, ukuba uthanda into enjalo.
Not there.	Akukho apho.
It's hard to talk about it now.	Kunzima ukuthetha ngayo ngoku.
Don't talk! 	Musa ukuthetha!
.	.
Is there anyone else there.	Ngaba kukho omnye umntu apho.
You should know too.	Kufuneka uyazi nawe.
He will do that.	Uya kuyenza loo nto.
He wanted to be with her.	Wayefuna ukuba kunye naye.
Is something happening to me?	Ngaba kukho into eyenzekayo kum.
Or a new book.	Okanye incwadi entsha.
It is difficult but where you are going.	Kunzima kodwa apho uya khona.

But there is this little bit.	Kodwa kukho oku kancinci.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
It will make your job a lot easier.	Kuya kwenza umsebenzi wakho ube lula kakhulu.

He seems to be able to speak.	Kubonakala ngathi uyakwazi ukuthetha.
You probably know.	Mhlawumbi uyazi.
Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
He was not completely down.	Wayengekho phantsi ngokupheleleyo.
You do not always think.	Awucingi njalo.
I don't think so.	Ndicinga ukuba akunjalo.
This is possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka.
Something new.	Enye into entsha.
How can I do it.	Ndingayenza njani.
And I'm not so sure.	Mna ke andiqinisekanga kakhulu.
Yes, but not always.	Ewe, kodwa hayi rhoqo.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
This is not easy.	Oku akukho lula.
He didn't know what was coming.	Wayengazi ukuba kuza ntoni.
I am going to the hospital.	Ndiya esibhedlele.
To be .	Ukuba .

But he was not.	Kodwa akazange abe njalo.
It makes walking alone.	Kwenza ukuhamba yedwa.
You feel like it’s not, not anything.	Uziva ngathi akunjalo, hayi nantoni na.
I just want to know what you think.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
Will it be easy, no.	Ngaba kuya kuba lula, hayi.
But you think nothing.	Kodwa awucingi nto.
We did not go to the hospital.	Khange siye esibhedlele.
Who do you want to be?	Ufuna ukuba ngubani.
I'm just asking you.	Ndicela nje wena.
He is here with me.	Ulapha kunye nam.
You think you know.	Ucinga ukuba uyazi.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
Yes, it should.	Ewe, kufuneka kube njalo.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
Right on.	Oku ngoku.
Did you realize that maybe not.	Ngaba waqonda ukuba mhlawumbi akunjalo.
You mean a lot to me.	Uthetha izinto ezininzi kum.
I can do this.	Ndingayenza le nto.
But you know.	Kodwa uyazi.
I will do that.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto.
Will this ever happen?	Ngaba oku kuya kwenzeka?

This may be true of you.	Oku kunokuba yinyani yakho.
I will not do so now.	Andiyi kwenza njalo ngoku.
He is completely absent.	Akakho ngokupheleleyo.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
.	.
Also, only to you.	Kwakhona, kuwe kuphela.
I did not want to do this.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza ke le nto.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wayesazi.
I'll stay here.	Ndiza kuhlala apha.
Only.	Kuphela.
Well, well, there you are.	Ke, kulungile, nantso ke.
Not far away.	Akukho kude.

But this is not very likely.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
Tomorrow morning.	Ngomso ngomso.
Even you.	Nokuba wena .
I just don't know why.	Andazi nje ukuba kutheni.
I never knew who he was.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba ngubani.
It will be more difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
He asked to speak to me.	Wacela ukuthetha nam.
That will come later.	Oko kuya kuza kamva.
But not for long.	Kodwa hayi ixesha elide.
Yes, it is possible.	Ewe, kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
in case.	mhlawumbi.
But you know the whole thing.	Kodwa uyazi yonke loo nto.
Obviously, that is not the case here.	Ngokucacileyo, oko akunjalo apha.
In a good way that.	Ngendlela entle oko.
I hope it's okay to go.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kulungile ukuhamba.
I can do this.	Ndingayenza le nto.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
I told her.	Ndiye ndamxelela.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
It's hard though.	Kunzima kodwa.
But, it is true.	Kodwa, yinyani.
So if you want.	Ngoko ukuba uyafuna.
Nice place.	Indawo entle.
But one day.	Kodwa ngenye imini.
It means everyone.	Kuthetha wonke umntu.
You talk to me a lot.	Uthetha nam kakhulu.
I doubt that.	Ndiyathandabuza ngaloo nto.
I don't understand why exactly.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni kanye.
He wants you to know that.	Ufuna uyazi loo nto.
Living there.	Ukuhlala apho.
Whatever it means.	Nokuba kuthetha ntoni na.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto kanye.
He tried very hard.	Wazama kakhulu.
Impossible.	Akunakwenzeka.
He wanted nothing there.	Wayengafuni nto apho.
That is not necessary.	Oko akuyomfuneko.
Not much is happening outside.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo ngaphandle.
He said he did not know.	Wathi akazi.
Now you want to make it happen.	Ngoku ufuna ukuyenza yenzeke.
You just have to know.	Kufuneka ukwazi kuphela.
That is not all.	Akunjalo yonke loo nto.
Not only here but all day.	Hayi apha kuphela kodwa yonke imini.
He did not give up.	Akazange ayeke.
Please do this.	Nceda wenze oku.
Is true .	Yinyani .
Therefore, we need another way.	Ngoko ke, kufuneka enye indlela.
He did not think so.	Akazange acinge ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
You are here one day, there is another.	Ulapha ngenye imini, kukho enye.
He knew he was human.	Wayesazi ukuba ungumntu.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
Maybe he will come to you.	Mhlawumbi uya kuza kuwe.
Not a day.	Hayi imini.
He wanted to be alone.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa.
I'm glad you did.	Ndiyavuya ukuba uyenzile.
He did not say much about all the work.	Khange athethe kakhulu wonke umsebenzi.
Now, please.	Ngoku, nceda.
That happens all the time.	Oko kwenzeka rhoqo.
Very really.	Kakhulu ngokwenene.
There is no book here.	Akukho ncwadi apha.
You don't have to say it's okay.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uthi kulungile.
But he did not want to help.	Kodwa akazange afune ukunceda.
I should have known by now.	Bekufanele ukuba ndiyazi ngoku.
He said he couldn't.	Wathi akakwazi.
He said he could be.	Wathi unokuba.
But, you may be.	Kodwa, usenokuba.
I'm not sure either.	Nam andiqinisekanga.
Why are you here ?.	Kutheni ulapha nje?.
Not so with you.	Akunjalo nawe.
Food and anything.	Ukutya kunye nantoni na.
I apologize for it.	Ndicela uxolo ngayo.
I never did this.	Andizange ndiyenze le nto.
In this regard.	Ngale ndlela.
Obviously not here.	Ngokucacileyo akunjalo apha.
If he only knew what it was.	Ukuba nje wayesazi ukuba yintoni na.
You must know about it.	Umele ukuba uyazi ngayo.
I think you need time.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna ixesha.
I'm just asking one thing from you.	Ndicela nje into enye kuwe.
I can't do it again.	Andikwazi ukuyenza kwakhona.
Who, why, how.	Ngubani, kutheni, njani.
We will do this together.	Siza kuyenza kunye oku.
Or my dog.	Okanye inja yam.
Not yet.	Hayi ngoku.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
Is it me? 	Ngaba ndim?
You will be with him again.	Uza kuba naye kwakhona.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I will need help here.	Ndiza kufuna uncedo apha.
There is no way.	Akukho ndlela.
But that's it.	Kodwa yiloo nto.
It was too early.	Kwangethuba kakhulu.
But a little bit.	Kodwa kancinci.
He is coming now.	Uza kuza ngoku.
You just have to know how.	Kufuneka nje ukwazi ukuba njani.
Tell me how you feel.	Ndixelele ukuba uziva njani.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
I wonder who it might be.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ingaba ngubani.
That's the thing.	Nantso ke into.
No one says no to him.	Akukho mntu uthi hayi kuye.
This happens a lot.	Oku kwenzeka kakhulu.
I told him in the morning.	Ndimxelele kusasa.
Once, then again.	Kanye, ngoko kwakhona.
He will do so.	Uya kwenza njalo.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
But he did not speak.	Kodwa akazange athethe.
You may be doing wrong.	Usenokuba wenza kakubi.
We need to do this in the end.	Kufuneka siyenze le nto ekugqibeleni.
I just want to know how it happened.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka njani.
I can't talk about this book.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngale ncwadi.
That is clear to me.	Oko kucacile kum.
I thought you liked it.	Bendicinga ukuba uyayithanda.
Or buy a car.	Okanye ukuthenga imoto.
I will not have to do it alone.	Akuyi kufuneka ndiyenze ndedwa.
But he can't do it.	Kodwa akakwazi ukwenza.
That can be a good thing or a bad thing.	Oko kunokuba yinto entle okanye embi.
Even if he doesn't want to do it.	Nokuba akafuni kuyenza.
No matter what happens to you or what you do.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni kuwe okanye wenze ntoni na.
Now that way.	Ngoku ngaloo ndlela.
He will do so.	Uza kwenza njalo.
It's really bad to live with it.	Yinto embi ngokwenene ukuhlala nayo.
I do not want to talk.	Andifuni kuthetha.
He did not want to talk about this.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha ngale nto.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
There is something.	Kukho into.
Something very new for him.	Into entsha kakhulu kuye.
We just know for sure.	Siyazi nje ngokucacileyo.
He will be here soon.	Uza kuba apha kungekudala.
I will talk to him.	Ndiza kuthetha naye.
You want to do something completely new.	Ufuna ukwenza into entsha ngokupheleleyo.
You want to know, now you know.	Ufuna ukwazi, ngoku uyazi.
But not time.	Kodwa hayi ixesha.
Of course not.	Akunjalo ke.
Maybe it's true.	Mhlawumbi yinyani.
You know, finally.	Uyazi, ekugqibeleni.
That will require a book.	Oko kuya kufuna incwadi.
It will have to be that way.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba kube njalo.
This is a big deal for me.	Yinto enkulu le kum.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
What and.	Ntoni na.
Maybe a long time ago.	Mhlawumbi kudala.
I don't have to think about it.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ndicinge ngayo.
I did not want to go there.	Ndandingafuni ukuya apho.
I need to talk to you about something else.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe ngenye into.
That's all he wants now.	Nantso kuphela into ayifunayo ngoku.
I need help.	Ndifuna uncedo.
He should have known better.	Bekufanele ukuba wayesazi ngcono.
He did well.	Wenza kakuhle.
I can't do anything with him.	Andikwazi kwenza nto naye.
But a little bit.	Kodwa kancinci.
I want to go.	Ndifuna ukuhamba.
Well, it's the same thing.	Ewe, yinto enye.
He didn't know better.	Wayengazi ngcono.
Yes, I, too.	Ewe, nam, nam.
Or anyone else for that.	Okanye nabani na ngaloo nto.
But one more thing, too.	Kodwa enye into, nayo.
He will do it with this.	Uya kuyenza ngale nto.
No one knew before.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngaphambili.
Yes Yes.	Ewe, ewe.
In a big way.	Ngendlela enkulu.
Human being.	Ukuba ngumntu.
As you know, man.	Njengoko uyazi, umntu.
I know nothing.	Andazi nto.
Not really long.	Hayi ixesha elide ngokwenene.
He made a lot of money.	Wenza imali eninzi kakhulu.
I do not really know.	Andazi ngenene.
I could not go that far.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuya kude kangako.
I think that's something to do.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto yokwenza.
Or just another one.	Okanye nje enye.
I would love to learn how to do that.	Ndingathanda ukufunda indlela yokwenza oko.
Not bad, really.	Hayi embi, ngokwenene.
As you know now, it is not.	Njengoko uyazi ngoku, akunjalo.
I have to do this.	Kufuneka ndiyenze le nto.
He did not think it was necessary.	Wayengacingi ukuba kufuneka.
Probably nothing at all.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto kwaphela.
Really, really.	Ngokwenene, ngokwenene.
But you have to make a decision.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
He too began to walk.	Naye waqalisa ukuhamba.
This is it.	Nguye lo.
I think you did a very bad thing.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze into embi kakhulu.
He does not want to leave.	Akafuni ukuhamba.
He has been there before.	Ukhe waba khona ngaphambili.
That can be so.	Oko kunokuba njalo.
This happened tonight.	Oku kwenzeke ngokuhlwanje.
It's so much better.	Kungcono kakhulu.
Nothing about it.	Akukho nto ngayo.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
That would be the same thing.	Oko kuya kuba yinto enye.
It is better that he does not know.	Kungcono ukuba akazi.
It's the same thing, but whatever.	Yinto enye kanye, kodwa nokuba yintoni na.
He will come to me then.	Uza kuza kum ngoko.
Certainly not about everything that is happening now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ngayo yonke into eyenzekayo ngoku.
He is, all right.	Nguye, kulungile.
So he certainly thought about it.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo wayecinga ngayo.
You will have to go.	Kuya kufuneka ukuhamba.
He wanted it to happen.	Wayefuna ukuba kwenzeke.
I would, he thought.	Ndingathanda, wacinga.
Definitely one for you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo enye kuwe.
Again, that's fine.	Kwakhona, kulungile.
Really, right there.	Ngokwenene, kanye apho.
Doing the right thing is difficult.	Ukwenza into entle ngayo kunzima.
Not yet.	Hayi ngoku.
I had to think of something.	Kwafuneka ndicinge into.
I know just a little bit.	Ndiyazi nje kancinci.
He stayed with me all day.	Wahlala nam imini yonke.
I would like him to do something.	Ndingathanda ukuba ayenze nto.
This way, please.	Ngale ndlela, nceda.
I do not know .	Andazi .
Alone.	Wedwa.
What's happened.	Kwenzeke ntoni.
So no problem.	Ngoko akukho ngxaki.
But he knew.	Kodwa wayesazi.
Yeah, what to do.	Ewe, ukwenza ntoni.
You are not going anywhere.	Awuyi kuya ndawo.
Finding food.	Ukufumana ukutya.
I did not know why.	Bendingazi ukuba kutheni.
Of course, that is not always the case.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, akunjalo rhoqo.
If you want to go that far.	Ukuba ufuna ukuya kude kangaka.
Many things.	Izinto ezininzi.
Nobody ever talks about it.	Akukho mntu ukhe athethe ngayo.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
He can't do this.	Akakwazi ukuyenza le nto.
Everyone will be better.	Wonke umntu uya kuba ngcono.
If not now, soon.	Ukuba akunjalo ngoku, kungekudala.
He wants to do it alone.	Ufuna ukuyenza yedwa.
He told me everything about it.	Undixelele yonke into ngayo.
What a car.	Yintoni imoto.
Something very great happened.	Kwenzeka into enkulu.
I thought you knew.	Bendicinga ukuba uyazi.
Not good, but good.	Hayi kakuhle, kodwa kulungile.
No no.	Hayi hayi.
I thought you would like to go with me.	Bendicinga ukuba ungathanda ukuhamba nam.
But it can be very difficult.	Kodwa kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
He certainly said yes.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uthe ewe.
That's why he came.	Yiyo loo nto eze.
So he had to go.	Ngoko kwafuneka ahambe.
He did not think.	Akazange acinge.
He knew everything now.	Wayesazi yonke into ngoku.
So that's it.	Ngoko yiloo nto.
He thought fast.	Wayecinga ngokukhawuleza.
Nothing about you.	Akukho nto ngawe.
I just want to know as soon as possible.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ngokukhawuleza.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Now he did.	Ngoku wenza njalo.
But only me.	Kodwa mna kuphela.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange enjenjalo.
Obviously, it is not.	Ngokucacileyo, akunjalo.
all day long.	imini yonke.
We really did.	Senze ngokwenene.
I do not know where.	Andazi apho.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
None.	Akukho .
That has to happen.	Oko kufuneka kwenzeke.
What.	Yintoni na.
Except maybe not so much.	Ngaphandle mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu.
No one is talking to her.	Akukho mntu uthetha naye.
Everyone better go.	Wonke umntu kungcono ahambe.
You know this.	Uyayazi le nto.
He is a good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo.
I just think this is good !.	Ndicinga nje ukuba oku kulungile!.
Yes, it is true, yes.	Ewe, yinyani, ewe.
Well done.	Kulungile ukuba wenze .
Slightly down.	Phantsi kancinci.
I'm sure, of that.	Ndiqinisekile, ngaloo nto.
Of course he knew about it long ago.	Ewe wayesazi ngayo kudala.
What happened to me.	Kwenzeka ntoni kum.
But he knew enough.	Kodwa wayesazi ngokwaneleyo.
Well, you're in trouble right now.	Ewe, wenza ingxaki ngoku.
Or maybe make peace with it.	Okanye mhlawumbi wenze uxolo nayo.
I better talk to her.	Ngcono ndithethe naye.
Well, not really.	Ewe, akunjalo ngokwenene.
Yeah, not again.	Ewe, hayi kwakhona.
He didn't know he was here.	Wayengazi ukuba ulapha.
He could not get there.	Akazange akwazi ukuya apho.
You do not want to leave.	Awufuni ukuhamba.
Here is the book.	Nantso ke le ncwadi.
Obviously it will be difficult to read.	Ngokucacileyo kuya kuba nzima ukufunda.
You want to go fast.	Ufuna ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
I hope you have understood.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uye waqonda.
It's hard to stay here.	Kunzima ukuhlala apha.
That’s it, isn’t it ?.	Yinto leyo, akunjalo?.
But I think there is a problem.	Kodwa ndicinga ukuba kukho ingxaki.
It's so long.	Lixesha elide kangaka.
Because you know.	Kuba uyazi.
Well, not really.	Ewe, akunjalo ngokwenene.
Maybe you like it.	Mhlawumbi uyayithanda.
He looks like he can play.	Ukhangeleka ngathi uyakwazi ukudlala.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Mhlawumbi akafuni.
Yes, but not entirely.	Ewe, kodwa hayi ngokupheleleyo.
Once for me.	Kanye kum.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
He thought he knew what was coming.	Wayecinga ukuba uyayazi into ezayo.
In your own way.	Ngendlela yakho.
He did well for her.	Wenza kakuhle kuye.
I can do it quickly on my own.	Ndingayenza ngokukhawuleza ndedwa.
I could not do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza.
I'm scared, too.	Ndiyoyika, nam.
Just, really good.	Nje, kulungile ngokwenene.
Good enough.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
He can't say what he wants.	Akakwazi ukuthetha into ayifunayo.
Yeah, that's it.	Ewe, nayo leyo.
Because he is.	Kuba nguye.
But he can't do that.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
There is a new one.	Kukho enye entsha.
As required.	Njengoko kufuneka.
Or you may not have to.	Okanye akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze njalo.
Nice place.	Indawo entle.

It will be easier to talk to him.	Kuya kuba lula ukuthetha naye.
There is always something coming up to do.	Kuhlala kukho into ezayo yokwenza.
I can't talk about it.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngayo.

Even if you don't want to.	Nokuba awufuni.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange eze.
But you probably won't.	Kodwa mhlawumbi awuyi kukwazi.
You will not be able to stay long.	Awuyi kukwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide.
Sounds good.	Kubonakala kulungile.
Yes, not for long.	Ewe, hayi ixesha elide.
Or a little later.	Okanye kamva kancinci.
How can I do this ?.	Ndingayenza njani lento?.
That's your thing.	Nantso ke into yakho.
I would like to do that.	Ndingathanda ukwenza oko.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
But he thought that he would probably do well.	Kodwa wayecinga ukuba mhlawumbi uya kwenza kakuhle.
He is.	Nguye.
I'm sure it isn't.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akunjalo.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
But it will be difficult, too.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima, kwakhona.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
You had to do that.	Kwafuneka wenze njalo.
But, of course, it is not really so.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunjalo ngokwenene.
He lives with her.	Uhlala naye.
This can be a little difficult.	Oku kunokuba nzima kancinci.
Maybe that's true.	Mhlawumbi yinyani leyo.
One thing or another.	Into okanye enye into.
No problem there.	Akukho ngxaki apho.
But yes, for sure.	Kodwa ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He needed help.	Wayefuna uncedo.
He is here to stay.	Ulapha ukuhlala.

I did that.	Ndenze oko.
Everyone to me.	Wonke umntu kum.
No, I did not.	Hayi, andizange.
You are coming with me tomorrow.	Uza nam ngomso.
He just thought.	Wacinga nje .
I had to do the same.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze loo nto nam.
.	.
So, very much so.	Ngoko, kakhulu.
So do we.	Ngoko ke nathi.
There is just this.	Kukho nje oku.
I can't speak for long.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ixesha elide.
I never thought of anything.	Andizange ndicinge nto.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
I know one way to do this.	Ndiyayazi indlela enye yokwenza oku.
Not much there, obviously.	Akukho kakhulu apho, ngokucacileyo.
I didn't do it.	Khange ndiyenze.
He didn't think he really wanted to know.	Wayengacingi ukuba ufuna ngokwenene ukwazi.
I wonder how this will happen.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kuya kwenzeka njani oku.
Work, work, work.	Umsebenzi, umsebenzi, umsebenzi.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
Probably a lot more.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu ngakumbi.
Not so soon.	Hayi ngoku kungekudala.
I want to be tough.	Ndifuna ukuba nzima.
Money for convenience.	Imali ukuze kube lula.
But he did not know where.	Kodwa wayengazi apho.
I don't know either.	Nam andazi.
Not a really good thing.	Hayi into entle ngokwenene.
I'm not sure what to do.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
Not later.	Akukho kamva.
But maybe not now.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi ngoku.
I can't say why now.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba kutheni ngoku.
Very much.	Kakhulu, kakhulu.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni.
I go regularly.	Ndiya rhoqo.
Man.	Umntu .
He said nothing about it.	Akazange athethe nto ngaloo nto.
Something bigger than me.	Into enkulu kunam.
I hope you are doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza kakuhle.
Not with him.	Hayi naye.
It can be hard to.	Kunokuba nzima ukuba .
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I did everything.	Ndenze yonke into.
Not only that here.	Akukho ukuba kuphela apha.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni kuthetha.
I feel better.	Ndiziva ngcono.
We will do the same.	Siza kwenza njalo.
Too much trouble, you know.	Ingxaki eninzi kakhulu, uyazi.
He wanted to talk to her.	Wayefuna ukuthetha naye.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Do you really.	Ngaba ngokwenene .
He really tried.	Wazama ngokwenene.
Whatever one wants.	Nokuba umntu ufuna ntoni na.
So much for making peace.	Kakhulu ekwenzeni uxolo.
This person is trying to help.	Lo mntu uzama ukunceda.
So he likes to go.	Ngoko uthanda ukuhamba.
He doesn't look so bad, this way.	Akabonakali embi kangako, ngale ndlela.
I know exactly what this is.	Ndiyazi kakuhle ukuba yintoni le.
For what, he did not speak.	Kuba yintoni, akazange athethe.
He has never been here.	Akazange abe lapha.
You will have to do good work with it.	Kuya kufuneka wenze umsebenzi olungileyo ngayo.
It happens to be true.	Kwenzeka ukuba yinyani.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
You are my person.	Ungumntu wam.
If he does.	Ukuba enjenjalo .
She is happy.	Uyavuya.
He loves everyone and everything.	Uthanda wonke umntu nayo yonke into.
That will be so.	Oko kuya kuba njalo.
I doubt it.	Ndiyathandabuza.
I want everyone to do it with me.	Ndifuna wonke umntu ayenze nam.
I never thought.	Andizange ndicinge.
This is good.	Oku kulungile.
If he can do that.	Ukuba angayenza loo nto.
He does things well.	Wenza izinto kakuhle.
That is why there is such a problem.	Yiyo loo nto kukho loo ngxaki.
To say it.	Ukuya kuthetha.
I think about this a lot.	Ndicinga ngale nto kakhulu.
It is very difficult for me.	Kunzima kakhulu kum.
This can be so.	Oku kunokuba njalo.
He wanted to be alone for a long time.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa ixesha elide.
I think he wanted to talk to me.	Ndicinga ukuba wayefuna ukuthetha nam.
Just a little.	Nje kancinci.
Something very bad is about to happen.	Kukho into embi kakhulu eyenzekayo.
I have him.	Mna naye.
You know you want to make it hard for everyone.	Uyazi ukuba ufuna ukwenza kube nzima kuye wonke umntu.
Sorry, really, really.	Uxolo, ngokwenene, ngokwenene.
I will not do that to you.	Andiyi kuyenza loo nto kuwe.
Maybe there is another way.	Mhlawumbi kukho enye indlela.
He seems to be doing much better.	Ubonakala esenza ngcono kakhulu.
He wanted to be alone.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa.
He thought about it all.	Wacinga ngayo yonke loo nto.
.	.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula.
Maybe you should do that a little bit.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka wenze oko kancinci.
Yes, we will.	Ewe, siza kuyenza.
Not so, but it is possible.	Akunjalo, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
He wants to go.	Ufuna ukuhamba.
He said nothing to me.	Khange athethe nto kum.
You probably know that.	Mhlawumbi uyayazi loo nto.
Yes, he is.	Ewe, nguye.
We have to do it.	Kufuneka siyenze.
Maybe he didn't know.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi.
I think well.	Ndicinga kakuhle.
Everyone knew why.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
Yes, a lot of the time.	Ewe, ixesha elininzi.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
Maybe you want another one to go to him.	Mhlawumbi ufuna enye ukuya kuye.
To do so.	Ukwenza njalo.
He checked the time.	Wajonga ixesha.
This is it.	Nguye lo.
I know about you.	Ndiyazi ngawe .
He was nowhere.	Wayengekho ndawo.
There is another problem.	Kukho enye ingxaki.
oh yeah.	ewe.
Everything is bad.	Yonke into embi.
He said he wanted something else.	Wathi ufuna enye into.
I do not believe much.	Andikholelwa kakhulu.
That will be me soon.	Oko kuya kuba ndim kungekudala.
This is for him.	Oku kuye.
He looks good.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle.
We know how that happened.	Siyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
And now everyone thinks he can do it, too.	Ke ngoku wonke umntu ucinga ukuba angayenza, naye.
I think that's a good thing too.	Nam ndicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
This morning it happened again.	Ngale ntsasa yenzeke kwakhona.
But that means something else.	Kodwa oko kuthetha enye into.
Lots of problem.	Ingxaki eninzi.
I could not say anything.	Khange ndikwazi ukuthetha nto.
If not now.	Ukuba akunjalo ngoku.
There is no place for you.	Akukho ndawo yakho.
I said nothing.	Khange ndithethe nto.
I'm happy with it.	Ndiyavuya ngayo.
He certainly did not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazange enze njalo.
Nobody talks about it.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngayo.
Yeah, that's exactly it.	Ewe, loo nto kanye.
I would like to talk to you.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha nawe.
No, you know that.	Hayi, uyayazi loo nto.
He says yes.	Uthi ewe.
I'm going to have to talk to him about it.	Kuza kufuneka ndithethe naye ngayo.
Sounds like, okay.	Kubonakala ngathi, kulungile.
I know you don't want to do that.	Ndiyazi ukuba awufuni kuyenza loo nto.
I don't like this place.	Andiyithandi le ndawo.
It's been a long time.	Kudala ixesha elide.
But he did.	Kodwa wenza njalo.
That's fine by me.	Kulungile kum.
He really did.	Ngenene uyenzile.
If possible.	Ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I want everything he has.	Ndifuna yonke into yakhe.
He was.	Waba .
I would really like to stay here.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukuhlala apha.
He does things well.	Wenza izinto kakuhle.
It’s not just about staying there.	Akunjalo nje ukuhlala apho.
I'm not saying you should do that.	Andithi kufuneka wenze njalo.
He did not know what to do.	Wayengazi ukuba kufuneka enze ntoni.
I know everyone is here.	Ndiyazi ukuba wonke umntu ulapha.
How do you feel about it ?.	Uziva njani ngayo?.
But it is true.	Kodwa yinyani.
He did not say or do anything.	Zange athethe nto okanye enze nto.
But as you like.	Kodwa njengoko uthanda.
Of course Tom is not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uTom akunjalo.
We will go there.	Siza kuya apho.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
Of course, you like this one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, uyayithanda le nto kanye.
He did something.	Wenza into.
He has to go now.	Kufuneka ahambe ngoku.
Yes, it will.	Ewe, kuya kuba njalo.
Not only that, you know.	Akunjalo kuphela, uyazi.
He doesn't know what to do about it.	Akazi ukuba enze ntoni ngaloo nto.
Now, it's better.	Ngoku, kungcono.
So he finally agreed.	Ngoko ekugqibeleni wavuma.
I can't see why.	Andikwazi kubonakala ukuba kutheni.
This will not be easy.	Oku akuyi kuba lula.
He will do it later.	Uya kuyenza kamva.
He did not stay long.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide.
He stayed, by the way.	Wahlala, ngendlela.
I just wonder about that.	Ndiyazibuza nje ngaloo nto.
Just a house.	Indlu nje.
I'm afraid.	Ndiyoyika.
But, as you know, that is impossible.	Kodwa, njengoko uyazi, oko akunakwenzeka.
I don't like it.	Andiyithandi.
So he told me.	Undixelele ke .
Yeah, sorry about that.	Ewe, uxolo ngaloo nto.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
You always think you are doing the right thing.	Uhlala ucinga ukuba wenza into elungileyo.
That happened again the other day.	Oko kwenzeka kwakhona ngenye imini.
It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
It is also completely impossible.	Kwakhona akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
Or this.	Okanye oku.
Again, no one did anything.	Kwakhona, akukho mntu wenza nto.
I can do this now.	Ndingayenza le nto ngoku.
He did not know where it was.	Wayengazi ukuba iphi.
You probably know that by now.	Usenokuba uyazi ukuba ngoku.
He said he had to leave.	Wathi kufuneka ahambe.
But there is a problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki.
I'm sorry.	Ndicela uxolo.
Yes, all the money.	Ewe, yonke imali.
You will make a lot of money that way, too.	Uya kwenza imali eninzi ngaloo ndlela, nawe.
I never thought of anything else about it.	Khange ndicinge enye into ngayo.
Or you just know.	Okanye uyazi nje.
I will come alone.	Ndiza kuza ndedwa.
Yes, he is really here.	Ewe, ulapha ngenene.
I can just do it.	Ndingayenza nje.
One down, one to go.	Omnye phantsi, omnye ukuya.
Maybe it will be time.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba lixesha.
There is something here.	Kukho into apha.
He will do it.	Uya kuyenza.
Now he wants to talk to both of us.	Ngoku ufuna ukuthetha nathi sobabini.
Certainly not that difficult.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho nzima kangako.
It is better to eat.	Kungcono ukutya.
I don't know what you think.	Andazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
Everyone knew about it.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ngayo.
Clearly he knew.	Ngokucacileyo wayesazi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I don't like it.	Andiyithandi.
He may not be visible.	Usenokuba akabonakali.
We just know.	Siyazi nje.
I did this.	Ndenze oku.
I made my money.	Ndenze imali yam.
So, now you have to be.	Ke, ngoku kufuneka ube njalo.
He wanted to go everywhere.	Wayefuna ukuhamba yonke indawo.
Obviously, it is not easy to talk about it.	Kucacile ukuba akukho lula ukuthetha ngayo.
It certainly will.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba njalo.
Many things.	Izinto ezininzi.
What are you doing there.	Wenza ntoni apho .
He went to prison.	Waya entolongweni.
He understood.	Waqonda.
I'll have to think about that.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngaloo nto.
He looked everywhere.	Wajonga yonke indawo.
This will not happen again.	Oku akuyi kuphinda.
But, more on that later.	Kodwa, ngakumbi ngaloo nto kamva.
really really.	ngokwenene ngokwenene.
It means a lot.	Kuthetha ukuba kakhulu.
Do you and him.	Ngaba wena kunye naye .
You will have it.	Uza kuba nayo.
You want to buy.	Ufuna ukuthenga.
Not now, but someday.	Hayi ngoku, kodwa ngenye imini.
I did not know how to do it.	Bendingazi ukuba ndenze njani.
It's hard for me to say.	Kunzima kum ukuthetha.
But in the end I'm sorry.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni uxolo.
Whatever happened yesterday.	Nokuba kwenzeke ntoni izolo.
He didn't want to play with her.	Wayengafuni ukudlala naye.
This would be a bad thing.	Oku kuya kuba yinto embi.
There is good money in it.	Kukho imali elungileyo kuyo.
Not time.	Hayi ixesha.
Maybe it will happen later.	Mhlawumbi kuya kwenzeka kamva.
Probably not coffee.	Mhlawumbi hayi ikofu.
I want to go, too.	Ndifuna ukuhamba, nam.
At night.	Ebusuku.
You say something to him.	Uthetha into kuye.
There is a way.	Kukho indlela.
Nothing really.	Akukho nto ngokwenene.
But that's the thing.	Kodwa nantso into.
I don't want.	Andifuni.
He must be with us.	Ufanele abe nathi.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
You know what happens when you think.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni xa ucinga.
He went there.	Waya apho.
She loves all of that.	Uyayithanda yonke loo nto.
Or not so much.	Okanye hayi kakhulu.
You need to be able to do this.	Kufuneka ukwazi ukwenza oku.
You have never done such a thing.	Zange wenze into enjalo.
I need someone.	Ndifuna umntu.
Maybe something else.	Mhlawumbi enye into.
We will talk here.	Siza kuthetha apha.
He soon realized what it was.	Ngokukhawuleza waqonda ukuba yintoni na.
Something else happened.	Kukho enye into eyenzekayo.
I want to stay with him.	Ndifuna ukuhlala naye.
Just staying up at night.	Ukuhlala nje ebusuku.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi ukuba uphi.
He said nothing.	Khange athethe nto.
Everyone loves something new.	Wonke umntu uthanda into entsha.
You know that.	Uyakwazi oko.
He is here with me.	Ulapha kunye nam.
I hope you are doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza kakuhle.
He's not going to do it, he thought.	Akayi kuyenza, wacinga.
He stayed there.	Wahlala apho.
But no one is there.	Kodwa akukho mntu apho.
He did not say much.	Akazange athethe kakhulu.
The job should only do one thing.	Umsebenzi kufuneka wenze into enye kuphela.
You are the only one.	Nguwe wedwa.
No one is talking to me here.	Akukho mntu uthetha nam apha.
It's the only thing.	Yinto kuphela.
I only want my new one.	Ndifuna entsha yam kuphela.
I think that means staying.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuthetha ukuhlala.
He also did not go.	Naye akazange ahambe.
This may be true, but it is very difficult.	Oku kunokuba yinyani, kodwa kunzima kakhulu.
He probably knew he wouldn't be.	Usenokuba wayesazi ukuba akayi kuba.
Only better, much better.	Kuphela ngcono, ngcono kakhulu.
Yes, there is another.	Ewe, kukho enye.
I am glad.	Ndiyavuya.
He seems to be doing just that.	Ubonakala esenza kanye loo nto.
Well, maybe not.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
But no one knew.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayesazi.
I would like to know how it happened.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka njani.
Only way, only way.	Indlela kuphela, indlela kuphela.
But way too fast.	Kodwa indlela ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
He never left.	Akazange ahambe kwaphela.
He was not good at it.	Wayengekho kakuhle kuyo.
I will come.	Ndiza kuza.
Getting everything.	Ukufumana yonke into.
Whatever happens.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
I didn't know what to do with it.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndenze ntoni ngayo.
He would say something to her.	Wayeza kuthetha into kuye.
You're talking about it.	Uthetha ngaloo nto.
Maybe soon.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala.
We will all do the same.	Sonke siya kwenza njalo.
This is not really the case.	Oku akunjalo ngokwenene.
He knew he had to succeed.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka aphumelele.
.	.
Later it is better.	Kamva kungcono.
Tell me now what happened.	Ndixelele ngoku ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
However, not the best.	Kodwa ke, hayi ngcono.
It's hard to see how.	Kunzima ukubona ukuba njani.
I hope that is true.	Ndiyathemba ukuba yinyani leyo.
Just walking, though.	Ukuhamba nje, nokuba.
It seems to be true.	Kubonakala ngathi yinyani .
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
But you do not have to.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze oko.
You will not be able to walk in it.	Awuyi kukwazi ukuhamba kuyo.
He would demand money.	Wayeza kufuna imali.
Beautiful.	Entle.
Clearly, he did not.	Ngokucacileyo, akazange.
I'm not sure about that now.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto ngoku.
He did not leave.	Akazange ahambe.
I thought you should know.	Ndicinge ukuba kufuneka uyazi.
So it seems like yes.	Ngoko kubonakala ngathi ewe.
Everything the same.	Yonke into enye.
He can say what he wants.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha into ayifunayo.
But it will be soon.	Kodwa uya kuba kungekudala.
It will be exactly the same.	Kuya kuba njalo kanye.
He tried to speak but could not.	Wazama ukuthetha kodwa akakwazi.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa ke kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
We will talk about it tomorrow.	Siza kuthetha ngayo ngomso.
In everything there is a time.	Kuyo yonke into kukho ixesha.
If he certainly wasn't.	Ukuba ngokuqinisekileyo wayengekho.
I really know him.	Ndiyamazi ngokwenene.
But only today.	Kodwa kuphela namhlanje.
I will definitely be.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuba njalo.
It will happen, too.	Kuya kwenzeka, kwakhona.
.	.
There is just something else.	Kukho nje enye into.
I'm sure there is one.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kukho enye.
Again, it is possible, but not impossible.	Kwakhona, kunokwenzeka, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
This should happen to you.	Oku kufuneka kwenzeke kuwe.
But he knew that was not the case.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba akunjalo.
I don't know about it.	Andazi ngayo.
This happened very quickly.	Oku kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
That's cute.	Oko kulungile.
Then why ?.	Khona kutheni?.
This seems possible.	Oku kubonakala kunokwenzeka.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
He was nowhere.	Wayengekho ndawo.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze nantoni na.
Maybe food.	Mhlawumbi ukutya.
I need to talk to her right away.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye kwangoko.
For now, he wanted nothing more.	Okwangoku, wayengafuni nto.
Just a little bit.	Kuphela nje kancinci.
Or just this.	Okanye oku kuphela.
That's a bad thing.	Yinto embi leyo.
He is here to help.	Ulapha ukunceda.
No one is talking to her.	Akukho mntu uthetha naye.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
He knows it is him.	Uyazi ukuba nguye.
That will do anything good.	Oko kuya kwenza nantoni na elungileyo.
He said .	Uthe .
It's true, really.	Yinyani, ngenene.
Yes, everyone does.	Ewe, wonke umntu wenza njalo.
You are currently trying to access many items.	Okwangoku uzama ukufumana izinto ezininzi.
You are always rich.	Uhlala uceba.
Well, not everywhere.	Ewe, akukho ndawo yonke.
I would like to see more of him.	Ndingathanda ukubona ngakumbi kuye.
You can be very difficult.	Unokuba nzima kakhulu.
That's fine by me.	Kulungile kum.
I do not always believe.	Andikholelwa njalo mna.
I told her not to do it.	Ndamxelela ukuba angayenzi.
But you know what.	Kodwa uyazi yintoni.
He is a good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo.
Again, this is not the case here.	Kwakhona, oku akunjalo apha.
Here, there is none.	Apha, akukho.
I'm not sure how.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba njani.
It will be difficult to decide.	Kuya kuba nzima ukwenza isigqibo.
I do not want to rush.	Andifuni ngokukhawuleza.
You know, to me.	Uyazi, kum.
At last, .	Ekugqibeleni, .
You are not very visible.	Awubonakali kangako.
Clearly, the same thing.	Ngokucacileyo, into enye.
A little bit.	Kancinci.
But there is another exception.	Kodwa kukho enye ngaphandle.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze loo nto.
He did not want to talk too much.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha kakhulu.
Maybe he would come.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuza.
Not at all.	Akunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
What you would like to do.	Oko ungathanda ukwenza.
We're all going there now.	Sonke siya khona ngoku.
He will not come to you.	Akayi kuza kuwe.
There is always another way.	Kuhlala kukho enye indlela.
Sounds good.	Kubonakala kulungile.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni na.
This is perfectly fine.	Oku kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
But he did.	Kodwa uyenzile.
He can do it today if he wants to.	Angayenza namhlanje ukuba uyafuna.
If you want to talk, you will come to me.	Ukuba uyafuna ukuthetha, uya kuza kum.
Or maybe outside.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngaphandle.
He did not.	Akazange .
I mean, completely out.	Ndiya kuthetha, ngaphandle ngokupheleleyo.
But you know that.	Kodwa uyayazi loo nto.
Driving too fast.	Ukuqhuba ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
I think we need to do this now.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka siyenze le nto ngoku.
Now he wanted to know why.	Ngoku wayefuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
You will make this difficult.	Uza kuyenza nzima le nto.
I hope to come here to you soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ndiza apha kuwe kungekudala.
He said nothing.	Akazange athethe nto.
He does not know when that will be, but he knows it will happen.	Akazi ukuba nini, kodwa uyazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I want you to know something.	Ndifuna wazi into.
He never stopped talking about it.	Akazange ayeke ukuthetha ngayo.
Is that right ?.	Ngaba kulungile oko?.
Here, he could not speak.	Apha, akazange akwazi ukuthetha.
But you do not have to be.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba ube nawe.
Or so he thought.	Okanye wayecinga njalo.
But it's hard to say anything.	Kodwa kunzima ukuthetha into.
You talk to me about all that.	Uthetha nam ngayo yonke loo nto.
She is not here yet.	Akakho okwangoku.
But it is impossible.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka.
I did not speak to him.	Khange ndithethe naye.
But that is possible.	Kodwa oko kunokwenzeka.
He will stay with us.	Uya kuhlala nathi .
I'll stay here.	Ndiza kuhlala apha.
Well, then, maybe a little bit.	Kulungile, ke, mhlawumbi kancinci.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu.
Not with him.	Hayi naye.
No one knew what had happened.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na.
I think it will be easier.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba lula.
He must have known then.	Umele ukuba wayesazi ngoko.
I did not think.	Khange ndicinge.
Great .	Kakhulu .
You know, for a long time.	Uyazi, ixesha elide.
It will be easier for you.	Kuya kuba lula kuwe.
I will only say this.	Ndiza kuthetha oku kuphela.
He said no.	Wathi akunjalo.
I'm not sure how I can do that.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
You probably know something.	Usenokuba uyazi into.
You and him.	Wena kunye naye.
I never went there.	Andizange ndiye apho.
Nothing now.	Akukho nto ngoku.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
No, not very much.	Hayi, hayi kakhulu.
It's so much better for you.	Kungcono kakhulu kuwe.
But clearly, no.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo, hayi.
That means a lot.	Oko kuthetha kakhulu.
Yes, we will.	Ewe, siya kuyenza loo nto.
Will you do it again?	Ngaba uza kuphinda?
We will know soon.	Siza kukwazi kungekudala.
But that is not the case here.	Kodwa akunjalo apha.
He said he couldn't tell.	Wathi akakwazi ukuxelela.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Or did you know.	Okanye ngaba uyazi.
That's fine.	Kulungile oko.
You know better.	Wazi ngcono.
It's hard to say anything bad.	Kunzima ukuthetha nantoni na embi.
It's not just my thing.	Asiyonto yam nje.
But there is more to it than that.	Kodwa kukho into eninzi ngakumbi kuyo.
I want to do this.	Ndifuna ukuyenza le nto.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ncam.
I can do that.	Ndingayenza loo nto.
I know this is something new for me.	Ndiyazi ukuba le yinto entsha kum.
I feel confident.	Ndiziva ndiqinisekile .
I thought that was it.	Ndandicinga ukuba yiloo nto.
I thought it was something to come.	Ndandicinga ukuba yinto ezayo.
I definitely want to play with this one more.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndifuna ukudlala ngale nto ngakumbi.
It will not be easy to learn.	Akuyi kuba lula ukufunda.
He checked the time.	Wajonga ixesha.
He knew he was coming.	Wayesazi ukuba uza kuza.
.	.
Really, really.	Ngenene, ngenene.
Immediately, no problem.	Ngoko nangoko, akukho ngxaki.
Everything is new to him.	Yonke into entsha kuye.
Really sorry.	Nyani uxolo kakhulu.
Very quickly.	Kakhulu ngokukhawuleza.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi ukuba uphi.
He knew he knew.	Wayesazi ukuba wayesazi.
This is something new.	Le yinto entsha.
That's not it.	Ayinguye lowo.
You know how to do this.	Uyayazi indlela yokwenza oku.
There is nothing in it.	Akukho nto kuyo.
The problem.	Ingxaki .
I'm sure that's it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiloo nto.
He can't sit still.	Akakwazi ukuhlala.
Don't be hard.	Musa ukuba nzima.
Do you really think there.	Ngaba ngokwenene ucinga apho.
Will you be.	Ngaba uya kuba njalo.
Yesterday, you did just that.	Izolo, wenze kanye loo nto.
This is really new.	Le yinto entsha ngokwenene.
You do not have to tell me that.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba undixelele loo nto.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
he asked.	wabuza.
I know you have to do this.	Ndiyazi ukuba kufuneka uyenze le nto.
No, no, no.	Hayi, hayi, hayi.
You deserve to be.	Ufanele ukuba.
But now, no.	Kodwa ngoku, hayi.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
I really want to stay here.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuhlala apha.
But tell me.	Kodwa ndixelele.
It just happened to me later.	Kuphela kwenzeka kum kamva.
He would do it.	Wayeza kuyenza.
He did not say much.	Khange athethe kakhulu.
You have to tell me everything.	Kufuneka undixelele yonke into .
I did this alone.	Ndiyenze ndedwa lento.
I need help now.	Ndifuna uncedo ngoku.
Nobody does anything.	Akukho mntu wenza nto.
So that's fine.	Ngoko ke kulungile.
.	.
You do not have to do this.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze oku.
There is no such problem.	Akukho ngxaki enjalo.
I'll talk to him now.	Ndiza kuthetha naye ngoku.
He also did not appear.	Kwakhona akazange abonakale.
I know how to do it.	Ndiyayazi indlela yokwenza.
You did well.	Uyenze kakuhle.
Really nice place.	Indawo entle ngokwenene.
You don't have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ube.
Maybe not much is happening there.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo apho.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
He wants to talk.	Ufuna ukuthetha.
She did not know what he wanted from her.	Wayengazi ukuba ufuna ntoni kuye.
Now there is something else.	Ngoku kukho enye into.
If not, that's perfectly fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, oko kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
I can't say why.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba kutheni.
There is something that we all need to know.	Kukho into apho sonke kufuneka siyazi.
But it is hard for him to be with us.	Kodwa kunzima kuye ukuba kunye nathi.
I know he can do it.	Ndiyazi ukuba angayenza loo nto.
You know what happens.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
There is something there.	Kukho into apho.
You have to do the right thing.	Kufuneka wenze into elungileyo.
It certainly was not necessary.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kwakungeyomfuneko.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
Tell me exactly what happened.	Ndixelele kanye kanye ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
Thus.	Ngaloo ndlela.
We know that to be true.	Siyazi ukuba yinyani leyo.
That's it.	Yiyo loo nto.
He did not say what happened.	Khange athethe into eyenzekayo.
But that's another thing.	Kodwa nantso enye into.
Do you know where it is? 	Uyazi ukuba iphi?
.	.
It is very difficult for you.	Kunzima kakhulu kuwe.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
No one knows for sure.	Akukho mntu uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Tell me where you are.	Ndixelele ukuba uphi.
Everyone knows it.	Wonke umntu uyayazi.
You will not do it alone.	Awuyi kuyenza wedwa.
That's exactly what it is.	Nto leyo kanye kanye.
What happened.	Yintoni eyenzekayo.
I want you to have it.	Ndifuna ube nayo.
No, no, that's fine.	Hayi, hayi, kulungile.
I will definitely do this again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza kwakhona le nto.
That's a very good thing.	Yinto entle kakhulu.
I just want to talk about it now.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha ngayo ngoku.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa oko akukho.
A little too much but for sure.	Kancinci kakhulu kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo.
So, you know.	Ngoko, uyazi.
I really want to know.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukwazi.
That is the problem.	Ingxaki ke leyo.
That seems like a long time ago.	Oko kubonakala ngathi kudala ngoku.
But that is a fact.	Kodwa yinyani leyo.
He didn't do this often, he realized.	Akazange akwenze oku rhoqo, waqonda.
Not always, but not always.	Akunjalo rhoqo, kodwa hayi rhoqo.
This is best for you.	Oku kungcono kakhulu kuwe.
It's, it's everything.	Yinto, yinto yonke.
He cannot walk or sit.	Akakwazi ukuhamba okanye ukuhlala.
Lo, lo.	Lowo, lowo.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza.
I need to know if you want to.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba uyafuna.
No one is at home.	Akukho mntu ekhaya.
We need to do this.	Kufuneka siyenze le nto.
Yes or no.	Hayi okanye ewe.
The food is good, too.	Ukutya kulungile, kakhulu.
He knows he has to have it.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka abe nayo.
But it had to be that way.	Kodwa bekufanele ukuba kube njalo.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba njalo.
One more thing, too.	Enye into, nayo.
I know.	Mna siyazi.
I think everyone will have to do that now.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu kuya kufuneka enze oko ngoku.
I know, you might like something else.	Ndiyazi, ungathanda enye into.
We will be.	Siya kuba .
Maybe something else.	Mhlawumbi enye into .
I can't speak enough.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo.
No one else does that.	Akakho omnye umntu owenza loo nto.
I know you speak well.	Ndiyazi ukuba uthetha kakuhle.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
I know you're talking to him.	Ndiyazi ukuba uthetha naye.
Just in case something happened.	Nje ukuba kwenzeke into.
But just a little bit.	Kodwa nje kancinci.
To him or to me.	Kuye okanye kum.
Maybe someone should go.	Mhlawumbi umntu kufuneka ahambe.
Lots of problem.	Ingxaki eninzi.
This way there is nothing.	Ngale ndlela akukho nto.
That's why.	Yiyo ke ngoko.
There is no one way or another.	Akukho ndlela enye okanye enye.
He wanted to talk about it.	Wayefuna ukuthetha ngayo.
There is nothing here.	Akukho nto apha.
But we know that is not the case.	Kodwa siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
A little too hard.	Kancinci kunzima kakhulu.
That's all true.	Yonke loo nto yinyani.
Or maybe earlier.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngaphambili.
Don't be hard on yourself.	Musa ukuba nzima kuwe.
He asked for another.	Wacela enye.
Or, or, or.	Okanye, okanye, okanye.
We're going there now.	Siya khona ngoku.
He said confidently.	Wathi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Maybe that's right.	Mhlawumbi oko kulungile.
Not so, either.	Akunjalo, kwakhona.
And now you have told everyone.	Ke ngoku uxelele wonke umntu.
He said nothing about it.	Akazange athethe nto ngayo.
Not about this.	Hayi ngale nto.
Again, I'm not sure why.	Kwakhona, andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni.
I don't know why this is.	Andazi ukuba kutheni le nto.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi lonto.
Think of me as you would like to know.	Ndicinge njengoko ungathanda ukwazi.
One house.	Indlu enye.
A short stay.	Ukuhlala kancinci.
Ok then.	Kulungile, ke.
That is clearly impossible to know.	Oko ngokucacileyo akunakwenzeka ukwazi.
He is the only one.	Nguye kuphela.
I will be a man.	Ndiya kuba yindoda.
I never did either.	Nam andizange ndiyenze.
I want to talk to her.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye.
Good enough, not a big deal.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, hayi into enkulu.
Sure, he did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, wenza njalo.
He can't talk to her.	Akakwazi ukuthetha naye.
Or maybe me.	Okanye mhlawumbi mna.
You don't want to see what happens the other way around.	Awufuni ukubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni ngenye indlela.
But, this is okay.	Kodwa, oku kulungile.
He did it again.	Uyenzile kwakhona.
He wanted to go.	Wayefuna ukuhamba.
He thought of staying.	Wacinga ukuhlala.
He finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni wavuma.
Just seeing everything.	Ukubona nje yonke into.
Now is the time.	Ngoku lixesha.
He said he was not there.	Wathi wayengekho.
I think you do too.	Ndicinga ukuba nawe wenza njalo.
He looked around the house at once.	Wajonga indlu yonke ngokukhawuleza.
It will be better, one way or the other.	Kuya kuba ngcono, ngenye indlela okanye enye.
He thought.	Wacinga.
But there is another.	Kodwa kukho enye.
I never did that either.	Nam andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
You know what it is.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
I'm sure you know that.	Ndiqinisekile uyayazi loo nto.
Or you plan to buy one.	Okanye uceba ukuthenga enye.
I want this .	Ndifuna lento .
This will be very noticeable.	Oku kuya kubonakala kakhulu.
Tomorrow will be better.	Ngomso kuya kuba ngcono.
As you did to him.	Njengoko wenze kuye.
Soon, for sure.	Kungekudala, ngokuqinisekileyo.
But this seems very difficult.	Kodwa oku kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Akafuni kuthetha ngayo.
That is not the case.	Akunjalo oko.
I did not do much.	Khange ndenze nto ingako.
He did not know anyone.	Wayengazi mntu.
But he can't drive.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuqhuba.
It can be difficult.	Kunokuba nzima.
All of a sudden .	Kungekudala .
Yes he would be here soon.	Ewe wayeza kuba lapha kungekudala.
I think it should.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka.
He just did what he wanted to do.	Wenza nje loo nto wayefuna ukuyenza.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Sooner than later.	Kungekudala kunokuba kamva.
But here you have to be.	Kodwa apha kufuneka ube.
Going your way is not difficult.	Ukuhamba ngendlela yakho akukho nzima.
Yes, you down.	Ewe, wena phantsi.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
How? 	Njani?
All right, better, better.	Kulungile, ngcono, ngcono.
No matter what anyone wanted.	Nokuba umntu wayefuna ntoni na.
You will definitely want to be with her, too.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kufuna ukuba abe naye, naye.
Or you, obviously.	Okanye wena, ngokucacileyo.
He did not stay.	Akazange ahlale.
This can be a very big thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto enkulu kakhulu.
Yeah, nothing right now.	Ewe, akukho nto okwangoku.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto kanye.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ncam.
I'm not sure what it is, exactly.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni, kanye.
This, of course, will be me.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, kuya kuba ndim.
You know that will be needed.	Uyazi ukuba kuya kufuneka.
Now everyone is here.	Ngoku wonke umntu ulapha.
He thought that was his thing.	Wacinga loo nto yakhe.
Yes a little.	Ewe kancinci.
That, that, that man didn't know.	Loo nto, leyo, loo mntu wayengazi.
He said it was okay for you.	Wathi kulungile kuwe.
This is a very big deal.	Le yinto enkulu kakhulu.
But this is not always the case.	Kodwa akunjalo rhoqo.
Not alone.	Akunjalo ndedwa.
He never came to me.	Akazange eze kum.
I ask that he stay with us.	Ndicela ukuba ahlale nathi.
There is plenty of room.	Kukho indawo eninzi.
I want this.	Ndifuna le nto.
Nice to have you.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nawe.
That's your money.	Nantso imali yakho.
If not.	Ukuba akukho.
He said okay, okay.	Uthe kulungile, kulungile.
That's all that's happening now.	Yiloo nto yonke eyenzekayo ngoku.
He thought it would be so.	Wayecinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
He felt his way.	Waziva ngendlela yakhe.
Yeah, maybe a little bit.	Ewe, mhlawumbi kancinci.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
I wish everyone did the same.	Ndinqwenela ukuba wonke umntu enze njalo.
A little bit, now.	Kancinci kancinci, ngoku.
Because we know you like that.	Kuba siyazi ukuba uyayithanda loo nto.
You told me that too.	Nawe undixelele lonto.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
This requires a decision.	Oku kufuna isigqibo.
We will do this together.	Siza kuyenza kunye le nto.
At the hospital.	Esibhedlele.
For now, we just have to do the work.	Okwangoku, kufuneka senze nje umsebenzi.
This means you.	Oku kuthetha wena.
This is happening, really.	Oku kwenzeka, ngokwenene.
Yes that's right.	Ewe kulungile .
No one.	Akukho mntu.
You know you want to.	Uyazi ukuba uyafuna.
Finally he said no.	Ekugqibeleni wathi hayi.
Whether you know it or not.	Nokuba uyazi okanye hayi.
There is nothing you need to do.	Akukho nto kufuneka uyenze.
You can just be.	Unokuba nje.
You just think.	Ucinga nje.
But he could not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
But really.	Kodwa ngokwenene.
He told me nothing.	Akukho nto wandixelela ngayo.
But there is one thing you need to know.	Kodwa kukho into enye ekufuneka uyazi.
I think he is a man.	Ndicinga ukuba yindoda.
But this thing.	Kodwa le nto.
You do not really want to know.	Awufuni ngokwenene ukwazi.
How do you know.	Wazi njani.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
No matter when you are here.	Nokuba ulapha nini.
Anything else.	Enye into.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
You can have everything.	Unokuba nayo yonke into.
It's just me.	Ndim nje mna.
If not, you do not want to.	Ukuba akunjalo, awufuni.
Not in the end.	Hayi ekugqibeleni.
But it happened very quickly.	Kodwa kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
Not this morning.	Hayi ngale ntsasa.
We need to know what it is.	Kufuneka siyazi ukuba yintoni na.
Well, he did that.	Ewe, uyenzile loo nto.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi ukuba uphi.
I do not know .	Andazi .
This is something new to me.	Le yinto entsha kum.
Because you know he did.	Kuba uyazi ukuba wenza.
You look great.	Ukhangeleka kakhulu.
I hope that's okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kulungile.
There is something else.	Kukho enye into.
We will talk to him.	Siza kuthetha naye.
Not just here.	Hayi nje apha.
Surely this is possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku kunokwenzeka.
Or don't do it.	Okanye musa ukwenza.
I've never been there before.	Andizange ndiye apho ngaphambili.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But it is impossible.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka.
There is no way at all.	Akukho ndlela kwaphela.
Just being together.	Ukuba kunye nje.
He has done it now.	Uyenzile ngoku.
All right.	Kulungile.
He started earning money right away.	Waqalisa ukufumana imali ngoko nangoko.
This should be the case.	Oku kufuneka kube yiyo.
Well, he wasn't, then.	Ewe, wayengekho, ngoko.
That's a big deal.	Nantso into enkulu.
I had no idea how to do it.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndenze njani.
I know you have already done that.	Ndiyazi ukuba sele uyenzile loo nto.
But it is unclear what will happen.	Kodwa kucacile ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
That would be a thing.	Oko kuya kuba yinto.
We are here to learn.	Siza apha ukufunda.
One beautiful place.	Indawo enye entle.
I never thought about it.	Andizange ndicinge ngayo.
It will definitely do better at night.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kwenza ngcono ebusuku.
But not for long.	Kodwa hayi ixesha elide.
he thought.	wacinga.
You know this now.	Uyayazi le nto ngoku.
But only one.	Kodwa enye kuphela.
I mean, it's just not possible.	Ndiya kuthetha, akunakwenzeka nje.
I wonder if it's true.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba yinyani na.
Dog, big dog.	Inja, inja enkulu.
He wanted to stay away, he knew.	Wayefuna ukuhlala kude, wayesazi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I suspect he did not.	Ndiyarhana ukuba akazange.
He told me.	Undixelele.
We never went there.	Zange siye apho.
Yeah, you know.	Ewe, uyayazi.
Nobody wants to play with us.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukudlala nathi.
We will stay together.	Siza kuhlala kunye.
Talk to you soon!.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kungekudala!.
I can't speak enough.	Andikwazi kuthetha ngokwaneleyo.
There is so much to it.	Kukho kakhulu kuyo.
Now is the only time.	Ngoku lixesha kuphela.
Not just here.	Akunjalo nje apha.
No one really knew what it was.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngokwenene ukuba yintoni na.
This you have done.	Le nto uyenzile.
To him, to him alone.	Kuye, kuye kuphela.
We've both gone, he thought.	Siye sobabini, wacinga.
There is an opportunity here.	Kukho ithuba apha.
I will be with you.	ndiya kuba nawe.
.	.
Yes, it is very difficult.	Ewe, kunzima kakhulu.
Something like that .	Into enjalo .
Sounds like okay.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile.
No books.	Akukho ncwadi.
He just wanted time to be alone.	Wayefuna nje ixesha lokuba yedwa.
He has never been before.	Akazange abe ngaphambili.
But, there is something else.	Kodwa, kukho enye into.
You are already here.	Sele ulapha.
.	.
We have to do it.	Kufuneka siyenze.
He wanted to be alone.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa .
No place for me.	Akukho ndawo yam.
This is very unlikely.	Oku akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
Tell me what happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Not that you will know for a long time.	Akunjalo ukuba uya kukwazi ixesha elide.
I could not do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza.
But this is not possible.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka.
That would be a very bad thing.	Oko kuya kuba yinto embi kakhulu.
I think of you all the time.	Ndicinga ngawe rhoqo.
I need to talk to you.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe.
I think you did not know.	Ndicinga ukuba ubungazi.
To this day.	Kude kube namhlanje.
This, of course, happens.	Oku, ngokwenene, kwenzeka.
.	.
But he didn't do it tonight.	Kodwa khange ayenze ngokuhlwanje.
I hope it is true.	Ndiyathemba ukuba yinyani.
He can walk slowly.	Uyakwazi ukuhamba kancinci.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
I can't do it.	Andikwazi ukuyenza.
Now he has done that.	Ngoku uyenzile loo nto.
Nowhere did he want to be.	Akukho ndawo wayefuna ukuba kuyo.
I do not want to stay.	Andifuni ukuhlala.
This will happen everywhere.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kuyo yonke indawo.
That happens very often.	Oko kwenzeka rhoqo ngokwenene.
No, no, no.	Akukho, akukho, akukho.
He says he won't go.	Uthi akayi.
You know that now.	Uyayazi loo nto ngoku.
I would like to know what it is.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba yintoni.
He wanted a car.	Wayefuna imoto.
Not much is happening here.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo apha.
Please.	Ndicela nje.
This is even more difficult.	Oku kunzima ngakumbi.
You do not have to.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze njalo.
Now I am the only one.	Ngoku ndim kuphela.
I'll be together soon.	Ndiza kuba kunye kungekudala.
Not much is happening.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo.
You know a lot.	Uyayazi into eninzi.
You know that.	Uyakwazi oko.
But you.	Kodwa wena.
But you know, really.	Kodwa uyazi, ngokwenene.
I'm glad, you know.	Ndiyavuya, uyazi.
and he dwelt there.	wahlala apho.
No, of course not.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo.
That's all.	Yiloo nto kuphela.
Good money.	Imali entle.
He knew he had to make a decision.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka enze isigqibo.
But please.	Kodwa ndicela .
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
But there is everyone!	Kodwa kukho wonke umntu!
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
Anything else .	Enye into .
Yes, that's it.	Ewe, nguye lowo.
He can't speak.	Akakwazi kuthetha.
I just go, you know.	Ndiya nje, uyazi.
There is someone else.	Kukho omnye umntu.
I can't stay away.	Andikwazi ukuhlala kude.
You know together.	Uyazi kunye.
Now, enough talk.	Ngoku, ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo.
But now, here he is.	Kodwa ngoku, ulapha.
I want to be better.	Ndifuna ukuba ngcono.
Here, in his prison.	Apha, entolongweni yakhe.
But he didn't really want to.	Kodwa wayengafuni ngokwenene.
Please tell me more.	Nceda undixelele ngakumbi.
Yes, certainly, yes.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo, ewe.
So just.	Ngoko nje.
Or maybe it's me.	Okanye mhlawumbi ndim.
He won't do that.	Akayi kuyenza loo nto.
Traveling is not easy.	Ukuhamba akukho lula.
We'll talk more later.	Siza kuthetha ngakumbi kamva.
But he will certainly do it.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuyenza.
Or maybe both of us.	Okanye mhlawumbi sobabini.
He did not do well at home.	Akazange enze kakuhle ekhaya.
No but, not that.	Hayi kodwa, hayi ukuba.
He wanted to know everything.	Wayefuna ukwazi yonke into.
Who.	Ngubani na.
No one is talking to her.	Akukho mntu uthetha naye.
But in the end he did just that.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni wakwenza oko.
I had to think of time.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ixesha.
I hope you feel the same way.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe uziva njalo.
He told me everything.	Undixelele yonke into.
That's it.	Yinto leyo.
So he did.	Ngoko wenza.
So he would.	Ngoko wayeza.
He can never do anything about it.	Akanakuze enze nto ngaloo nto.
It so happened that.	Oku kwenzeka ngoko ukuba.
I don't know when.	Andazi ukuba nini.
Not so at home.	Akunjalo ekhaya.
No, not your house.	Hayi, hayi indlu yakho.
But he did not do this.	Kodwa akazange akwenze oku.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze isigqibo.
I feel that way.	Ndiziva njalo .
The problem there.	Ingxaki apho.
He has to stay.	Kufuneka ahlale.
But how to do that.	Kodwa ukwenza njani oko.
Someone had to speak.	Kwafuneka umntu athethe.
This will not be easy.	Oku akuyi kuba lula.
I will definitely be !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuba!.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
You know that now.	Uyayazi loo nto ngoku.
I just wonder.	Ndiyazibuza nje.
Why, he didn't know.	Kutheni, wayengazi.
You just love it.	Uyayithanda nje.
Because he wanted to.	Kuba wayefuna.
I didn’t, I thought this was going to happen.	Andizange, ndicinge ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
There seems to be no problem.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho ngxaki.
He did this.	Uyenzile le nto.
That was not necessary.	Oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
That always seems very special to me.	Oko kuhlala kubonakala kum kakhulu.
I need to talk to you.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe.
So, then, then.	Ngoko, ngoko, ngoko.
Really, everything.	Ngokwenene, yonke into.
He wanted to do everything.	Wayefuna ukwenza yonke into.
One will stay with you for a long time.	Omnye uya kuhlala nawe ixesha elide.
This will be the case.	Oku kuya kuba njalo.
He doesn't want me to know where.	Akafuni ndiyazi apho.
I want to talk about that a little bit.	Ndifuna ukuthetha ngaloo nto kancinci.
He thought more.	Wacinga ngakumbi.
I wonder what else could be.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ingaba yintoni enye into.
I don't know what happened to him.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
Or maybe it's me.	Okanye mhlawumbi ndim.
Well, he didn't.	Ewe, akazange.
You feel bad about it.	Uziva kakubi ngayo.
I do not know.	Andazi.
Just to stop.	Nje ukuba ayeke.
Now you will be able to do it.	Ngoku uya kukwazi ukuyenza.
But he said no.	Kodwa wathi hayi.
A lot of money.	Imali eninzi.
I always want to.	Ndifuna rhoqo .
Or is it.	Okanye ngaba .
Finally, he joined me.	Ekugqibeleni, waba nam.
You probably know what that is.	Mhlawumbi uyazi ukuba yintoni na leyo.
I will, soon.	Ndiza, kungekudala.
That's not my problem.	Hayi' ingxaki yam.
I also know that it will not be so.	Ndiyazi kwakhona ukuba akuyi kuba njalo.
He said he did not know.	Wathi akazi.
What should he do? 	Ufanele enze ntoni?
I'm glad to see that.	Ndiyavuya ukubona oko.
He knows his place.	Lowo uyayazi indawo yakhe.
Everyone knows that.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
It's his person.	Ngumntu wakhe.
But he also said no.	Kodwa naye wathi hayi.
I think there is something there.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho into apho.
But he does not have to.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba abe njalo.
He looked for a long time.	Wajonga ixesha elide.
Down you should know better.	Phantsi kufuneka wazi ngcono.
Sure, if you want to.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ukuba uyafuna.
Maybe you are human.	Mhlawumbi ungumntu.
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
I doubt this.	Ndiyathandabuza kule nto.
He thought.	Wayecinga.
Very little by little.	Kakhulu kancinci kancinci.
It's really hard to say.	Kunzima ngokwenene ukuthetha.
That's fine by me.	Kulungile kum.
That's very good.	Kulungile kakhulu oko.
Someone who will do it.	Umntu oza kuyenza.
So now you know.	Ngoko ngoku uyazi.
I hope you are feeling better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ngcono.
I'll talk about that someday.	Ndiza kuthetha ngaloo nto ngenye imini.
It seems difficult.	Kubonakala kunzima.
Nothing now.	Akukho nto ngoku.
Just out here.	Nje apha ngaphandle.
Do you feel better ?.	Uziva kakuhle?.
But very well.	Kodwa kakuhle kakhulu.
.	.
It has had to be.	Kuye kwafuneka ukuba.
He did not want to be alone again.	Wayengafuni ukuba yedwa kwakhona.
For now it will be better.	Okwangoku kuya kuba ngcono.
Sorry for the coffee this morning.	Uxolo kakhulu ikofu ngale ntsasa.
But maybe not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He thought he was doing the right thing.	Wayecinga ukuba wenza into elungileyo.
But not immediately.	Kodwa hayi ngokukhawuleza.
This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
You know the house.	Uyayazi indlu.
Yes No.	Ewe, hayi.
I know how hard it is here.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima kangakanani apha.
It is difficult, but not impossible.	Kunzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
I'd like to talk about that.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha ngaloo nto.
He didn't know where he was now.	Wayengazi ukuba uphi ngoku.
Or he was not.	Okanye wayengekho.
But not for us, really.	Kodwa hayi ngathi, ngokwenene.
But now maybe he doesn't want to.	Kodwa ngoku mhlawumbi akafuni.
Or big.	Okanye enkulu.
What will it be.	Kuya kuba yintoni na.
Will you?	Ngaba uya kwenza?
He went to school a lot.	Waya esikolweni kakhulu.
Nobody wants to make a decision.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukwenza isigqibo.
I had no idea what it was.	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni.
But it's hard, to be here.	Kodwa kunzima, ukuba lapha.
But then he will appear.	Kodwa ke uya kubonakala.
This is you.	Nguwe lo.
We did this too.	Senze oku nathi.
You just know too many things.	Uyazi nje izinto ezininzi kakhulu.
Or maybe he just didn't think so.	Okanye mhlawumbi wayengacingi kwaphela.
He's just a man.	Ungumntu nje.
But not more.	Kodwa hayi ngakumbi.
He just did.	Wenza nje.
You know, if anything happens.	Uyazi, ukuba kwenzeka nantoni na.
Me? 	Mna?
I know there is nothing.	Ndiyazi ukuba akukho nto.
That obviously is not the case here.	Oko ngokucacileyo akunjalo apha.
I want something.	Ndifuna into.
But this is not clearly the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo ngokucacileyo.
He asked for help.	Wacela uncedo.
But very quickly.	Kodwa ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
No one was coming.	Akukho mntu wayeza kuza.
Later, he said that he probably knew.	Kamva, wathi mhlawumbi uyazi.
Probably possible.	Mhlawumbi kunokwenzeka.
You say .	Uthi .
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
But do not do this.	Kodwa musa ukwenza oku.
I have to say something.	Kufuneka ndithethe into.
He did not know what his problem was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki yakhe.
He told me where the money was.	Wandixelela ukuba iphi imali.
How do you feel about all this?	Uziva njani ngayo yonke lento?.
I mean, not really.	Ndiya kuthetha, akunjalo ngokwenene.
No, he did not.	Hayi, khange athethe.
I never went there.	Andizange ndiye apho.
Or he may have thought that he did.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba wenze njalo.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
Yes you can have a car.	Ewe unokuba nayo imoto.
That can be a very long time.	Oko kunokuba lixesha elide kakhulu.
Low but not too high.	Phantsi kodwa hayi kakhulu.
I want him to stop now.	Ndifuna ayeke ngoku.
Really nothing.	Ngokwenene akukho nto.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
Yes you think well.	Ewe ucinga kakuhle.
Or you, with that.	Okanye wena, ngaloo nto.
I can make this happen.	Ndingayenza le nto yenzeke.
He did it again.	Uyenze kwakhona.
He started going to it.	Waqalisa ukuya kuyo.
Just really fast.	Ngokukhawuleza nje ngokwenene.
So he tried again.	Ngoko wazama kwakhona.
Why.	Kutheni .
But it is hard to make money.	Kodwa kunzima ukufumana imali.
Yes that's right.	Ewe kulungile.
This makes it easier.	Oku kwenza kube lula.
Certainly now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngoku.
Maybe once more.	Mhlawumbi kube kanye kwakhona.
That is exactly what is happening here.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo apha.
Finally, but for now.	Ekugqibeleni, kodwa okwangoku.
He did what he wanted to do.	Wenza into afuna ukuyenza.
Just, right away.	Nje, ngoko nangoko.
You have to be.	Ufanele ukuba njalo.
He thought.	Wayecinga.
I don't want that to happen to you.	Andifuni yenzeke kuwe lonto.
He knows where he went.	Uyazi apho waya khona.
But he would be one person.	Kodwa wayeza kuba ngumntu omnye.
I wish it were so.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube njalo.
All right now.	Kulungile ngoku.
That's what he wants me to know.	Yiloo nto afuna ndiyazi.
Eventually this ended.	Ekugqibeleni oku kuye kwaphela.
I never did that.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
Very, very much more.	Kakhulu, kakhulu ngakumbi.
He wanted, obviously.	Wayefuna, ngokucacileyo.
Not out here.	Akukho ngaphandle apha.
You don't want that to be the case.	Awufuni ukuba kube njalo.
That will be.	Oko kuya kuba .
He knew he didn't.	Wayesazi ukuba akazange.
How so.	Njani ke .
how far.	kude kangakanani.
We have done a lot with it.	Senze kakhulu ngayo.
He told me that.	Wandixelela ukuba.
But then one day something terrible happened.	Kodwa ngenye imini kwenzeka into embi.
But better travel.	Kodwa ukuhamba ngcono.
I had to think about it.	Bekufanele ndicinge ngayo.
It will be a little bit.	Kuya kuba kancinci.
I can't really talk right now.	Andikwazi nyani ukuthetha ngoku.
He is coming now.	Uza kuza ngoku.
Why did he do this?	Kwakutheni ukuze enze le nto.
Yes, it should.	Ewe bekufanele kube njalo.
But really, no.	Kodwa ngokwenene, hayi.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
I wish he did, just once.	Ndinqwenela ukuba enze njalo, kube kanye nje.
I want to do it tonight.	Ndifuna ukuyenza ngokuhlwanje.
I do not like this.	Andiyithandi le nto.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
But in a good way.	Kodwa ngendlela entle.
It's just a person.	Ngumntu nje.
I'm sure of this.	Ndiqinisekile ngale nto.
It happened for a long time.	Kwenzeka ixesha elide.
That can only be a good thing.	Oko kunokuba yinto entle kuphela.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku.
.	.
Really, I hope, I hope.	Ngenene, ndiyathemba, ndiyathemba.
I want to do everything with you.	Ndifuna ukwenza yonke into nawe.
Or it seems to us.	Okanye kubonakala ngathi.
He has.	Ukhe waba .
Well this happened.	Kulungile oku kwenzeke.
I didn't know what to do about it.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndenze ntoni ngaloo nto.
It is very difficult to talk to him.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuthetha naye.
But you will do it.	Kodwa ke uya kuyenza.
I know you think a lot about yourself.	Ndiyazi ukuba ucinga kakhulu ngawe.
That can happen here.	Oko kunokwenzeka apha.
We've done that for a very long time.	Senze loo nto ixesha elide kakhulu.
There is a problem.	Kukho ingxaki.
Impossible to see.	Akunakwenzeka ukubona.
I doubt that will happen.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka.
He did not say time.	Akazange athethe ixesha.
I would like to know how I did this.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba ndenze njani ngale nto.
He just doesn't know how.	Akayazi nje ukuba njani.
I feel so much better too.	Ndiziva ngcono kakhulu nam.
I'm not sure anymore.	Andiqinisekanga kwakhona.
And this is what happens.	Yiloo nto ke eyenzekayo.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula.
Yes I am.	Ewe ndim.
But not this.	Kodwa hayi oku.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
Not at all.	Akunjalo kwaphela.
What should he do? 	Ufanele enze ntoni?
he asked.	wabuza.
Just as quickly.	Kanye ngokukhawuleza.
It's just hard to find.	Kunzima nje ukufumana.
It's in everything.	Kukho kuyo yonke into.
He looked at me.	Uye wajonga kum.
That's you.	Nguwe lowo.
If you like something like that, fine.	Ukuba uthanda into enjalo, kulungile.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi loo nto.
Tell me the truth now.	Ndixelele inyani ngoku.
Not to him.	Hayi kuye.
That is exactly what is happening today.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo namhlanje.
Do not pretend you do not know.	Musa ukwenza ngathi ubungazi.
Really, very bad.	Ngokwenene, embi kakhulu.
We'll just talk about it.	Siza kuthetha nje ngathi.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha.
There is a good dog.	Kukho inja elungileyo.
I would like to read more about this.	Ndingathanda ukufunda ngakumbi oku.
It should only happen once.	Kufuneka kwenzeke kube kanye kuphela.
He cannot read.	Akakwazi ukufunda.
Later, he thought.	Kamva, wacinga.
I think hard.	Ndicinga nzima.
We will do it there.	Siza kuyenza apho.
But he did not succeed.	Kodwa akazange aphumelele.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon enough.	Mhlawumbi hayi namhlanje, mhlawumbi hayi ngomso, kodwa kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
Whatever happens.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
He had to stay.	Kwafuneka ahlale.
That's a good thing.	Yinto elungileyo.
What we need to know is that.	Into ekufuneka siyazi ukuba apho.
Learn more.	Ukufunda ngakumbi.
He asked why he was coming alone.	Wabuza ukuba kutheni eze yedwa.
Finding a job is difficult.	Ukufumana umsebenzi kunzima.
Yes you know.	Ewe uyazi.
But that's it.	Kodwa yiloo nto.
But he did not sit down.	Kodwa akazange ahlale phantsi.
But not quite.	Kodwa hayi ngokupheleleyo.
The food is good.	Ukutya kulungile.
Not today, but soon.	Hayi namhlanje, kodwa kungekudala.
All.	Yonke .
There is only you and me.	Kukho mna nawe kuphela.
That is something new for me.	Yinto entsha leyo kum.
You do not have to do this.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze oku.
This can be.	Oku kunokuba .
He knew now what was going to happen.	Wayesazi ngoku ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
Just another house.	Enye nje indlu.
It will probably not be easy to get that far.	Mhlawumbi akuyi kuba lula ukuya kude kangako.
She's trying to get better.	Uzama ukuba ngcono.
That's why you're here.	Yiyo loo nto ulapha.
He had to make a decision.	Kwafuneka enze isigqibo.
Not at home.	Hayi ekhaya.
I want money very, very much.	Ndifuna imali kakhulu, kakhulu.
It happened so fast.	Kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza oko.

He does not want or need any more money.	Akafuni okanye akafuni enye imali.
He really did that.	Uyenzile loo nto ngenene.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
I never really thought too much.	Andizange ndicinge kakhulu ngokwenene.

This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
You did better.	Wenze ngcono.
He can speak.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha.
Sounds like okay.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile.
Because he is not alone.	Kuba ayinguye yedwa.
He looked at anything but.	Wajonga nantoni na kodwa.
He had to talk to her.	Kwafuneka athethe naye.
Not just talking.	Hayi nje ukuthetha.
I can't do everything alone.	Andikwazi ukwenza yonke into ndedwa.
I want you.	Ndifuna wena.
I would like to go in the morning.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba kusasa.
This is really.	Oku ngokwenene.
Not so clearly.	Akunjalo ngokucacileyo.
He said he could read.	Wathi uyakwazi ukufunda.
I think that is possible.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kunokwenzeka.
So, now.	Ngoko, ngoku.
But no no no.	Kodwa hayi hayi hayi.
About us.	Ngathi.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
.	.
I want you to tell me the truth.	Ndifuna undixelele inyani.
If you feel like it.	Ukuba uziva ufuna.
But there is a problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
That will do.	Oko kuya kwenza.
No one.	Akukho mntu.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
You definitely want a car to go.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufuna imoto ukuhamba.
But he asked if it was all right.	Kodwa wabuza ukuba kulungile na.
Yeah, not a bit.	Ewe, hayi kancinci.

So why.	Ngoko kutheni .
He will speak.	Uza kuthetha.
Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.
Maybe one day.	Mhlawumbi, ngenye imini.
She loves it there.	Uyayithanda apho.
You have to have it.	Kufuneka ube nayo.
I'm so glad it did.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuba kube njalo.

I think we did very well.	Ndicinga ukuba senze kakuhle kakhulu.
But, please.	Kodwa, nceda.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi ukuyenza le nto.
All right.	Kulungile.
This is very unlikely.	Oku akunakwenzeka ncam.
I'm not sure about this.	Andiqinisekanga ngale nto.
You may not.	Usenokuba hayi.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka uyenze.
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
I did not know anyone.	Ndandingazi mntu.
It is difficult, but not impossible.	Kunzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
I know that too.	Nam ndiyayazi lonto.
Now to do this.	Ngoku ukwenza le nto.
But he did not have it.	Kodwa akazange abe nayo.
But what is this.	Kodwa yintoni le.
It could be better.	Kunokuba ngcono.
Everyone talks about it.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngayo.
I can't be here all day.	Andikwazi ukuba lapha imini yonke.

He just says whatever he wants.	Uthetha nje nantoni na ayifunayo.

I know how this will end, you think.	Ndiyazi ukuba oku kuya kuphela njani, ucinga.
If you do.	Ukuba wenza njalo.
This is not far.	Akukho kude le.
You can do it.	Uyakwazi ukuyenza.
I can do a lot.	Ndingayenza kakhulu.
He feels like us.	Uziva ngathi.
Bad thing, bad thing.	Into embi, into embi.

I did it today.	Ndenze namhlanje.
Will you do so? 	Ngaba uza kwenza njalo?
There is that thing out there.	Kukho loo nto ngaphandle.

I just don’t know how I did this.	Andazi nje ukuba ndenze njani oku.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
But there is a problem here.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki apha.
Tomorrow it will be more visible.	Ngomso kuya kubonakala ngakumbi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
You just have to be yourself, be yourself.	Kufuneka nje ube nguwe, ube nguwe.
So I apologize.	Ngoko ndicela uxolo.
He speaks quickly.	Uthetha ngokukhawuleza.
But you know.	Kodwa uyazi.
It's better for you.	Kungcono kuwe.
It is very true.	Yinyani kakhulu.
It's a bad thing.	Yinto embi.
I do not believe it either.	Nam andikholelwa.
Yes, that one.	Ewe, lowo.
But for me.	Kodwa kum.
This is his place.	Le ndawo yakhe.
He also asked why.	Naye wabuza ukuba kutheni.
He really did not know.	Ngokwenene wayengazi.
It's better to go.	Kungcono ukuhamba.
He will be so.	Uya kuba njalo.
You may be.	Usenokuba.
He lives alone.	Uhlala yedwa.
I'm sure he didn't.	Ndiqinisekile akazange.
He is.	Nguye.
He did not know for how long.	Wayengazi ukuba ixesha elide kangakanani na.
This is not mandatory.	Oku akunyanzelekanga.
Or, this morning.	Okanye, ngale ntsasa.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
I will not do that.	andiyi kuyenza loo nto.
I think you like this.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayithanda le nto.

Being him again.	Ukuba nguye kwakhona.
There is not much in it.	Akukho nto ingako kuyo.
He said nothing.	Akazange athethe nto.

That is even more possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngakumbi.
I want you to know that I am.	Ndifuna wazi ukuba ndim.
I will make coffee.	Ndiza kwenza ikofu.
However, perhaps it is not.	Kodwa ke, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
It seems like something new.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto entsha.
He never became an actor.	Akazange abe ngumdlali.
You want to be that way, all right.	Ufuna ukuba njalo, kulungile.
But that will happen.	Kodwa oko kuya kwenzeka.
I will definitely do this again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza le nto kwakhona.
Or he will.	Okanye uya kwenza.
Well, maybe he won't want it now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akasayi kufuna ngoku.
He did anything.	Wenze nantoni na.
I do not know yet.	Andazi okwangoku.
How would he do it.	Wayeza kwenza njani .
Yes, it is possible.	Ewe, kunokwenzeka.
I'll have to think about it.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngayo.
This will be very difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
His work has made that easy.	Umsebenzi wakhe wenze ukuba kube lula oko.
He looked slightly.	Wajonga kancinci.
Play very fast.	Ukudlala ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
That's the way it is.	Yiloo ndlela.
Or he thought it was necessary.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba kufuneka.
I'm scared.	Ndiyoyika mna.
So, there it is.	Ngoko, kukho loo nto.
Tell me something about it.	Ndixelele into ngaloo nto.
I said nothing to her.	Andizange ndithethe nto kuye.
Yes this is possible.	Ewe oku kunokwenzeka.
He did not know how.	Wayengazi ukuba njani.
Then tomorrow.	Kusasa ke.
Or anyone.	Okanye nabani na.
To see.	Ukubona.

Nice to see your place.	Ndiyavuya ukubona indawo yakho.
To be a good man.	Ukuba yindoda elungileyo.
Maybe, maybe not.	Mhlawumbi, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He did a good job.	Wenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
That is not the case.	Oko akunjalo.
I will do something else.	Ndiza kwenza enye into.
I would love to do that again soon.	Ndingathanda ukwenza oko kwakhona kungekudala.
I do not know.	Andazi.
Do you know .	Ingaba uyazi .
He will come alone.	Uya kuza yedwa.
But here.	Kodwa apha.
Someone good did.	Omnye umntu olungileyo wenza.
Now, he clearly did not appear.	Ngoku, ngokucacileyo akazange abonakale.
That means only one thing.	Oko kuthetha into enye kuphela.
Now in it.	Ngoku kuyo.
He finally did it.	Ekugqibeleni uyenzile.
To make.	Ukwenza.
But you know one thing.	Kodwa wazi into enye.
Slightly down.	Phantsi kancinci.
Isn't it?	Ngaba akunjalo.
Now is good.	Ngoku kulungile.
That we do not have to decide.	Oko akuyomfuneko ukuba senze isigqibo.
No, he thought.	Hayi, wacinga.
Certainly, it will be.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kuya kuba njalo.
Or whatever.	Okanye nokuba yintoni na.
I think that's all.	Ndicinga ukuba yiyo yonke into.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wenza loo nto.
I know it will be hard for me.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima kum.
No one really knows what happened.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokwenene ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
But nobody wants that.	Kodwa akukho mntu ufuna loo nto.
But you did well.	Kodwa wenze kakuhle.
I want you to make a decision.	Ndifuna wenze isigqibo.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
But that's the way.	Kodwa nantso indlela.
Sorry about that.	Uxolo ngaloo nto.
All right now, all right.	Kulungile ngoku, kulungile.
The worst thing.	Into embi kakhulu.
Just another thing.	Enye into nje.
You want money.	Ufuna imali.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula.
No one knew why.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
Obviously, this can be difficult.	Ngokucacileyo, oku kunokuba nzima.
Good enough, obviously.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, ngokucacileyo.
Not too far away.	Hayi kude kakhulu.
No, certainly not soon.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo kungekudala.
But he seems a little out of place.	Kodwa ubonakala kancinci.
But no exception.	Kodwa akukho ngaphandle.
He lives there.	Uhlala apho.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
He finally said he would.	Ekugqibeleni wathi uza kwenza njalo.
But he must succeed.	Kodwa kufuneka aphumelele.
I wish it happened regularly.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kwenzeke rhoqo.
Yeah, it's hard for me.	Ewe, kunzima kum.
One in prison.	Omnye entolongweni.
He does everything.	Wenza yonke into.
Everyone knows what's going on.	Wonke umntu uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
You're not going.	Awuyi.
I never did.	Andizange ndiyenze.
I need someone else.	Ndifuna omnye umntu.
But one has to speak.	Kodwa umntu kufuneka athethe.
I just want you to know one thing.	Ndifuna nje ukuba wazi into enye.
I'm not sure what you want.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ufuna ntoni.
I'm glad you're here.	Ndiyavuya ulapha.
I do not really know.	Andazi ngenene.
Play with it.	Ukudlala ngayo.
But this is not as easy as it seems.	Kodwa oku akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
That sounds good to me.	Oko kubonakala kulungile kum.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
I want me and him all.	Ndifuna mna naye wonke.
I do not believe anything.	Andikholelwa nto.
Or going to school or getting a job.	Okanye ukuya esikolweni okanye ukufumana umsebenzi.
Not me then.	Hayi mna ke.
Here this is not the case.	Apha oku akunjalo.
That means big money.	Oko kuthetha imali enkulu.
This really happened a lot.	Oku kwenzeka kakhulu ngokwenene.
If not, no problem.	Ukuba akunjalo, akukho ngxaki.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Yes or no.	Ewe okanye hayi.
She sits down.	Uhlala phantsi.
It is good to continue that way.	Yinto entle ukuqhuba ngaloo ndlela.
Soon he made a decision.	Kungekudala wenza isigqibo.
I am a person.	Ndim umntu.
No one knows the truth now.	Akukho mntu uyazi inyani ngoku.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
I know that well enough.	Ndiyayazi loo nto ngokwaneleyo.
This always happens.	Oku kuhlala kwenzeka.
If anything happens.	Ukuba nantoni na eyenzekayo.
This can be very difficult.	Oku kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
Because again that is possible.	Kuba kwakhona oko kunokwenzeka.
I don't know any other way.	Andazi enye indlela.
He said he knew.	Uthe uyazi.
But again, he did not want to.	Kodwa kwakhona, akazange afune.
He would do it again.	Wayeza kuyenza kwakhona.
He wanted to.	Wayefuna .
But he had to leave.	Kodwa kwafuneka ahambe.
That's the only time problem.	Loo nto ingxaki ixesha kuphela.
He wants you to do that, too.	Ufuna ukuba wenze loo nto, nawe.
He asked that today, too.	Wabuza ukuba namhlanje, kakhulu.
Not far away.	Hayi kude.
I know nothing about that.	Andazi nto ngaloo nto.
Not for me.	Hayi kum.
He wants to help.	Uyafuna ukunceda.
If there is one.	Ukuba kukho enye.
I'm not sure about everything.	Andiqinisekanga ngayo yonke into.
He didn't want to do that.	Wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
That would mean it would be a little difficult.	Oko kuya kuthetha ukuba kuya kuba nzima kancinci.
No matter how hard you try.	Nokuba uzama kangakanani na.
We need both.	Kufuneka sobabini.
All right! 	Kulungile!
A good, good person.	Umntu olungileyo, olungileyo.
Nobody does it this way.	Akukho mntu wenza ngale ndlela.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
But not in this one.	Kodwa hayi kule.
You did very well with this.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu ngale nto.
But I am.	Ndim ke kodwa.
Now I know better.	Ngoku ndiyazi ngcono.
.	.
not sure.	andiqinisekanga.
He lived alone.	Wahlala yedwa ngokupheleleyo.
Why did he do that?	Kwakutheni ukuze enze loo nto.
Maybe next week.	Mhlawumbi kwiveki ezayo.
Sorry everyone.	Uxolo wonke umntu.
I know the way.	Ndiyayazi indlela.
It just so happens, that's all there is to it.	Kwenzeka, yiloo nto kuphela.
He has to think so.	Kufuneka acinge njalo.
Yeah, a little bit of it.	Ewe, kancinci kuyo.
I go to school.	Ndiya esikolweni.
He knew everything.	Wayesazi yonke into.
Well, what were you supposed to do? 	Kulungile, bekufanele wenze ntoni?
he thought.	wacinga.
But he did.	Kodwa wakwenza oko.
He certainly needed help.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayefuna uncedo.
I never said that.	Khange ndithethe njalo.
He didn't know until then.	Wayengazi kude kube ngoko.
Not so now.	Akunjalo ngoku.
I will not go there.	Andiyi kuya apho.
I want him to do something.	Ndifuna ukuba enze into.
With him.	Naye .
No, it is not.	Hayi, akunakwenzeka.
I have never done this before.	Khange ndiyenze le nto ngaphambili.
He also told the police.	Naye waxelela amapolisa.
Everything happened so fast.	Yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
It's very difficult now.	Kunzima kakhulu ngoku.
It will be very difficult to do this.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu ukwenza oku.
He can have it everywhere for you.	Unokuba nayo yonke indawo kuwe.
I know where I am going.	Ndiyazi apho ndiya khona.
He did not know who he was.	Wayengazi ukuba ngubani na.
That's it for now.	Nantso ke okwangoku.
I just thought you should know.	Ndicinge nje ukuba kufuneka uyazi.
Where, or how long, he did not know.	Uphi, okanye ixesha elingakanani, wayengazi.
Maybe not tomorrow, but soon.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngomso, kodwa kungekudala.
Or anything too, about that.	Okanye nantoni na kakhulu, ngaloo nto.
Yes, you should go to him.	Ewe, kufuneka uye kuye.
I did well.	Ndiyenze kakuhle.
And now we know.	Ke ngoku siyazi.
Sorry, but this is true.	Uxolo kodwa yinyani le.
If not.	Ukuba akunjalo.
Eventually that happened.	Ekugqibeleni kwenzeka oko.
But we will be.	Kodwa siya kuba.
Police everywhere.	Amapolisa kuyo yonke indawo.
Now, that happens right away.	Ngoku, oko kwenzeka ngoko nangoko.
It's absolutely something.	Yinto ngokupheleleyo.
One more thing, that.	Enye into, leyo.
You will be.	Uya kuba .
That's his thing.	Nantso into yakhe.
Everyone knows that.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
I know it's hard.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima.
It’s hard to really tell.	Kunzima ukuxelela ngokwenene.
I don't know what you're really thinking here.	Andiqondi ukuba ucinga ntoni kanye kanye apha.
I don't have to do this.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndiyenze le nto.
He is trying another approach.	Uzama enye indlela.
He never talked about it.	Zange athethe ngayo.
I hope you will.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuba njalo.
I didn't talk to her, either.	Khange ndithethe naye, nam.
But more on that later.	Kodwa ngakumbi ngaloo nto kamva.
He is not.	Ayinguye.
You definitely should be.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka ube.
I told the truth.	Ndithethe inyani.
He needed help immediately.	Kwafuneka afune uncedo ngoko nangoko.
That can be so.	Oko kunokuba njalo.
I can't talk enough about it.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo ngayo.
Yes, it is impossible.	Ewe, akunakwenzeka.
I just want to know.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi .
I think you know that.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi loo nto.
We know what the problem is.	Siyazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze loo nto.
Or he was not.	Okanye wayengekho.
We all know exactly what this is.	Sonke siyazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye le nto.
I know how to do what is right.	Ndiyazi ukwenza into elungileyo.
Too much car.	Imoto eninzi kakhulu.
Not for long.	Hayi ixesha elide.
You look better.	Ukhangeleka ngcono.
I feel like I need coffee.	Ndiziva ndifuna ikofu.
Work.	Akazi.
But no.	Kodwa akukho.
It will be much easier.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
That's what we have to do.	Yinto ekufuneka siyenze.
Tell me anything.	Ndixelele nantoni na.
And he agreed with me.	Uye wavuma nam.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
I will do it soon.	Ndiza kwenza ngokukhawuleza.
And he did not want to.	Naye akafuni.
I need to be able to see.	Kufuneka ndikwazi ukubona.
I want everything, you know? 	Ndifuna yonke into, uyazi?
you say.	uthi.
That's not it.	Asiyonto leyo.
I can't stay here.	Andikwazi kuhlala apha.
Does that mean that.	Ngaba oko kuthetha ukuba .
We should both have known that.	Sobabini bekufanele ukuba siyazi loo nto.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
Is that me?	Ngaba ndim lowo.
But you have to do your thing.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze into yakho.
.	.
Well, really.	Kulungile, ngokwenene.
So it's the same thing.	Ngoko yinto enye.
Knowing that no one is coming.	Ukwazi ukuba akukho mntu uza kuza.
Yes, we will.	Ewe, siza kwenza njalo.
Come on in, take a look.	Uza kuza.
But, if he was not there.	Kodwa, ukuba wayengekho.
He wanted to say something else.	Wayefuna ukuthetha enye into.
Yeah, that's why you're here.	Ewe, yiyo loo nto ulapha.
But one has to think differently.	Kodwa umntu kufuneka acinge ngenye indlela.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
Maybe I think a lot about it.	Mhlawumbi ndicinga kakhulu ngayo.
I really am.	Ndim ngokwenene.
It should be easy to see.	Kufuneka kube lula ukubona.
But he did not sit down.	Kodwa akazange ahlale phantsi.
But it will not be a big deal.	Kodwa akuyi kuba yinto enkulu.
That is clear.	Oko kucacile.
He did not have it well.	Akazange abe nayo kakuhle.
Everyone loves this.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda le nto.
No problem for him.	Akukho ngxaki kuye.
He wanted coffee very much.	Wayefuna ikofu kakhulu.
Before, really.	Ngaphambili, ngokwenene.
It's harder than you think.	Kunzima ngakumbi kunokuba ucinga.
Not yet, not yet.	Hayi okwangoku, hayi ngoko.
I think he can do it.	Ndicinga ukuba angayenza.
Not so much with me.	Hayi kakhulu nam.
Nobody is here.	Akukho mntu ulapha.
Very good indeed.	Kakuhle kakhulu ngenene.
No, not more.	Hayi, hayi ngakumbi.
You may want to talk about it.	Mhlawumbi ungathanda ukuthetha ngayo.
In the end he is invisible.	Ekugqibeleni akabonakali.
This is a really big deal.	Le yinto enkulu ngokwenene.
It could be him.	Usenokuba nguye.
Being a man is not necessary.	Ukuba yindoda akuyomfuneko.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
But it is a big deal.	Kodwa yinto enkulu.
Tell me when.	Ndixelele nini.
Next week, or soon.	Kwiveki ezayo, okanye kungekudala.
Sorry, really.	Uxolo, ngokwenene.
He has to think.	Kufuneka acinge.
So there you have it.	Ngoko kukho kuwe.
Not immediately.	Hayi ngoko nangoko.
I never knew.	Andizange ndiyazi.
He wants to go to me.	Ufuna ukuya kum.
I want to go.	Ndifuna ukuhamba .
We'll just do it.	Siza kuyenza nje.
Not all the way.	Hayi yonke indlela.
So there is just one more thing.	Ngoko kukho nje enye into.
I knew this was going to happen, he thought.	Ndandisazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka, wacinga njalo.
He tried very hard.	Wazama kakhulu.
It was not necessary at all.	Kwakungeyomfuneko kwaphela.
No, really.	Akunjalo, ngokwenene.
Here is the problem.	Apha kukho ingxaki.
I don't even know who she is.	Andazi nokuba ngubani.
Surely you would like to know about it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ungathanda ukwazi ngayo.
He knows nothing about it.	Akazi nto ngayo.
He felt like he had to sit down.	Waziva ngathi kufuneka ahlale phantsi.
He tried to walk but could not.	Wazama ukuhamba kodwa akakwazi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
You do not have to do too many things.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze izinto ezininzi kakhulu.
He could not stay in it.	Akazange akwazi ukuhlala kuyo.
He knows it is him.	Uyazi ukuba nguye.
He can read.	Uyakwazi ukufunda.
Tell me what I did.	Ndixelele ukuba ndenze ntoni.
We know about it.	Siyazi ngayo.
You should be here soon.	Ufanele ukuba apha ngokukhawuleza.
He told me it was him.	Wandixelela ukuba nguye.
I can't do it right now.	Andikwazi ukuyenza kakuhle okwangoku.
You know what happens.	Uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
Not just if you live there.	Hayi nje ukuba uhlala khona.
Just one person.	Umntu nje omnye.
I told her so.	Ndamxelela njalo.
He should talk to me.	Kufuneka athethe nam.
Maybe that wasn't necessary.	Mhlawumbi oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
I can do that.	Ndingayenza loo nto.
Please, please do something like that.	Nceda, nceda wenze into enjalo.
Glad you're here !.	Ndiyavuya ulapha!.
Speaking of, nothing else.	Ukuthetha, akukho enye into.
Most day.	Imini eninzi.
Not just you.	Akunjalo nje wena.
I'm sorry.	Ndicela uxolo.
Yes, there is another problem.	Ewe, kukho enye ingxaki.
I can do this too.	Nam ndingayenza lento.
So we'll talk about that later.	Ngoko siza kuthetha ngaloo nto kamva.
No one should be present.	Akukho mntu kufuneka abe khona.
It is not easy at home.	Akukho lula ekhaya.
We went down together.	Siye phantsi kunye.
Certainly not money.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi imali.
Not so everywhere.	Akunjalo kuyo yonke indawo.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
Well, that's what happened.	Ewe, nantso into eyenzekayo.
Not so now.	Akunjalo ngoku.
It did not have to be this way.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
Man knows his own thing.	Umntu uyayazi into yakhe.
But this is okay.	Kodwa oku kulungile.
Playful, but just a little bit.	Ukudlala, kodwa nje kancinci.
I did it once.	Ndenze kanye.
He also understood.	Kwakhona waqonda.
I do not know how this happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oku.
That sounds good.	Oko kubonakala kulungile.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi ukuba uphi.
It's a new thing.	Yinto entsha.
He wanted another way.	Wayefuna enye indlela.
This one needs help.	Lo ufuna uncedo.
I shall certainly come.	ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuza.
He looked at me.	Wajonga kum.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
He stayed that way for a long time.	Wahlala enjalo ixesha elide.
She told me.	Uye wandixelela.
John readily agreed.	UJohn wavuma ngoko nangoko.
I do not know.	Andazi.
Sooner or later you will have to make a decision.	Kungekudala okanye kamva kuya kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
I'm sure there is something.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kukho into.
Yes, he is.	Ewe, nguye ngaphandle.
At last.	Ekugqibeleni.
I try very hard to read.	Ndizama kakhulu ukufunda.
He certainly will.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuba njalo.
Maybe you like that, too.	Mhlawumbi uyayithanda loo nto, nawe.
He was not at home.	Wayengekho ekhaya.
I know, too.	Ndiyazi, nam.
But now you know you know.	Kodwa ngoku uyazi ukuba uyazi.
It’s not like it’s hard.	Akunjalo ngathi kunzima.
Yeah, yeah, we know.	Ewe, ewe, siyazi.
Because that's what.	Kuba yiloo nto.
He sat down, he had to think.	Wahlala phantsi, kwafuneka acinge.
To this day.	Kude kube namhlanje.
He told me everything about it.	Undixelele yonke into ngayo.
But this is not difficult.	Kodwa oku akukho nzima.
As long as you did this.	Nje ukuba uyenzile le nto.
Well, he'll have to go.	Kulungile, kuya kufuneka ahambe.
As he did not want to talk.	Njengoko wayengafuni ukuthetha.
Not so much tonight.	Hayi kakhulu ngokuhlwanje.
I want to talk to her.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye.
But this is not the case everywhere.	Kodwa oku akunjalo kuyo yonke indawo.
No one knew better.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngcono.
He started walking.	Waqalisa ukuhamba.
There he stayed for a long time.	Apho wahlala ixesha elide.
The big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu.
He did not.	Akazange.
.	.
It's really hard.	Kunzima ngenene.
But you know.	Kodwa uyazi.
You just want to see something good about it.	Ufuna nje ukubona into entle ngayo.
Alone alone.	Eyedwa yedwa.
I would like to go now too.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba ngoku kakhulu.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
But he did.	Kodwa uyenzile.
But really everything.	Kodwa ngokwenene yonke into.
You are telling the truth.	Uthetha inyani.
I hope you like it too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe uyayithanda.
All of a sudden.	Kungekudala.
This is really.	Oku ngokwenene .
Something is coming.	Kukho into ezayo.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Not always.	Akunjalo rhoqo.
And now tell me.	Ke ngoku ndixelele.
All right, then.	Kulungile, ngoko.
I thought you knew that.	Bendicinga ukuba uyayazi lonto.
I'm not sure how long.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ixesha elingakanani.
It's a very good thing that.	Yinto entle kakhulu ukuba.
This is not entirely the case.	Oku akunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
We will get better.	Siya kuba ngcono.
We will stay here.	Siza kuhlala apha.
But you did something wrong.	Kodwa wenze into embi.
Not a big problem, no.	Hayi ingxaki enkulu, hayi.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
You think about it every night.	Ucinga ngayo rhoqo ebusuku.
Tomorrow, for sure.	Ngomso, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Not far from here.	Akukho kude apha.
He can do it now, do it here.	Angayenza ngoku, ayenze apha.
There is another.	Kukho enye.
I don't think so.	Ndicinga ukuba akunjalo.
He would speak.	Wayeza kuthetha.
He asked for help from me.	Wacela uncedo kum.
Just a little bit.	Kancinci nje.
Yes, that's it.	Ewe, nantso ke.
He knew.	Wayesazi .
He'll be here now.	Uzakuba lapha ngoku.
That will mean a great way.	Oko kuya kuthetha indlela enkulu.
Yes it is possible.	Ewe kunokwenzeka.
You have to do a lot of things.	Kufuneka wenze izinto ezininzi.
And more.	Kwakhona ngakumbi.
There is something very wrong with this.	Kukho into embi kakhulu ngale nto.
You totally, you don't.	Wena ngokupheleleyo, awuyi.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
He doesn't think anything at all.	Akacingi nto kwaphela.
So you just stay, you know.	Ngoko uhlala nje, uyazi.
Not to him.	Hayi kuye.
He thought so.	Wacinga njalo.
And he did so.	Wenza njalo ke.
But something happened.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo.
But he probably didn't.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akazange.
Finally, he said.	Ekugqibeleni, wathi.
He did a lot.	Wenza kakhulu.
I desperately want to go to him.	Ndifuna kakubi ukuya kuye.
Yes I am happy.	Ewe ndiyavuya.
He is not visible to you.	Akabonakali kuwe.
But it is certainly not possible now.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka ngoku.
Yes, you do too.	Ewe, nawe wenza njalo.
But he was thinking.	Kodwa wayecinga.
Clearly not.	Kucacile ukuba akazange.
He did not know anyone.	Wayengazi mntu.
What happened.	Yintoni eyenzekayo.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
Well, it's not.	Kulungile, akunjalo.
This is perfectly fine.	Oku kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
Yes, no problem.	Ewe, akukho ngxaki.
This is good.	Oku kulungile.
You just have to be able to do that.	Kufuneka nje ukwazi ukwenza oko.
I had to think it was possible.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ukuba kunokwenzeka.
But also .	Kodwa kwakhona .
He makes my job easier.	Wenza umsebenzi wam ube lula.
I think you want to talk to me alone.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna ukuthetha nam ndedwa.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
I don't want to do it right away.	Andifuni ukuyenza kwangoko.
We will stay.	Siza kuhlala.
But you know, you have to.	Kodwa uyazi, kufuneka ngokuqinisekileyo.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
This will not happen.	Oku akuyi kwenzeka.
I want to go to the hospital.	Ndifuna ukuya esibhedlele.
Not a job.	Hayi umsebenzi.
But he did this.	Kodwa uyenzile le nto.
It's hard though.	Kunzima kodwa.
We did that a little bit.	Senze loo nto kancinci.
You have to tell me about it.	Kufuneka undixelele ngayo.
Or maybe not even true.	Okanye mhlawumbi hayi nokuba yinyani.
But he was not thinking.	Kodwa wayengacingi.
Not much of it.	Akukho kakhulu kuyo.
He asked where she was.	Wabuza ukuba uphi.
But now he knew why.	Kodwa ngoku wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
Maybe you should do it.	Mhlawumbi kufuneka uyenzile.
That's the exception.	Yiloo nto ngaphandle.
There is only you.	Kukho wena kuphela.
He sat down quickly.	Wahlala ngokukhawuleza.
But now we know better.	Kodwa ngoku siyazi ngcono.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
I think you want something like that.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna into enjalo.
He thought that maybe he could do that.	Wayecinga ukuba mhlawumbi angayenza loo nto.
yes maybe.	ewe mhlawumbi.
Well, here it is.	Kulungile, yiyo le.
You know the way.	Uyayazi indlela.
Nobody did anything about it.	Akukho mntu wenze nto ngayo.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze nto.
In a good way.	Ngendlela elungileyo.
He went to work.	Waya emsebenzini.
But no, not too much.	Kodwa hayi, hayi kakhulu.
Today should be easier.	Namhlanje kufuneka kube lula.
But it happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka.
I will come to you.	Ndiya kuza kuwe.
He is all.	Nguye wonke.
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka.
And so it happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto ke.
I do not know where.	Andazi apho.
You know how to do this.	Uyayazi indlela yokwenza oku.
He did this.	Wenza oku.
It seems a long time ago.	Kubonakala kudala.
Or there was nothing he wanted to do.	Okanye akukho nto wayefuna ukuyenza.
That would be a good thing.	Oko kunokuba yinto entle.
Here, we have done something else.	Apha, senze enye into.
he thought.	wacinga.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
No one really knows.	Akukho mntu uyazi ngokwenene.
Now she loves it.	Ngoku uyayithanda.
He will always be that way.	Uya kuhlala enjalo.
Today, you know better.	Namhlanje, wazi ngcono.
But, you know.	Kodwa, uyazi.
Not that he tried.	Hayi ukuba wazama.
Not much is happening.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo.
I don't know enough.	Andazi ngokwaneleyo.
So, it's even harder.	Ngoko ke, kunzima ngakumbi.
But it is not at all easy.	Kodwa akukho lula ngokupheleleyo.
He did this for a long time.	Wakwenza oku ixesha elide.
I have done a very bad thing.	Ndenze into embi kakhulu.
No one really wants to know.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukwazi ngokwenene.
So much so.	Ngoko kakhulu.
It is impossible to know if it is true.	Akunakwenzeka ukwazi ukuba yinyani.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
Nice place though.	Indawo entle kodwa.
Not this week.	Hayi kule veki.
Maybe maybe.	Mhlawumbi mhlawumbi.
But not tomorrow.	Kodwa hayi ngomso.
Me and you, and everyone.	Mna nawe, naye wonke umntu.
That's the problem here.	Nantso ke ingxaki apha.
Well then, not then.	Hayi ke, hayi ngoko.
Or you will have it soon.	Okanye uya kuba nayo kungekudala.
Or why, with that.	Okanye kutheni, ngaloo nto.
This happened to me this week.	Oku kwenzeke kum kule veki.
He is the only employee.	Nguye kuphela umsebenzi.
What, not who.	Yintoni, hayi ngubani.
I will not say more.	Andiyi kuthetha ngakumbi.
That goes to everyone, not just you.	Oko kuya kuye wonke umntu, hayi wena kuphela.
So, that is not really the case.	Ngoko, akunjalo ngokwenene.
But it is not, it is not.	Kodwa akunjalo, hayi.
He doesn't know what it is.	Akayazi ukuba yintoni na.
If something happens to you.	Ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kuwe.
Well, everyone knows everything here.	Ewe, wonke umntu uyazi yonke into apha.
He lives alone.	Uhlala yedwa.
He did not want to do anything.	Wayengafuni kwenza nto.
This simplifies the problem.	Oku kuyenza lula ingxaki.
I will not be all day.	Andiyi kuba imini yonke.
Something like that.	Into enjalo.
Now we know what he wanted.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba wayefuna ntoni.
But it will be.	Kodwa kuya kuba njalo.
It has to be fast.	Kufuneka kube ngokukhawuleza.
If you want .	Ukuba uyafuna .
Very, really.	Kakhulu, ngokwenene.
Whatever this is.	Nokuba yintoni le.
Now you want to talk.	Ngoku ufuna ukuthetha.
Finally, finally.	Ekugqibeleni, ekugqibeleni.
I never thought it would be possible.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kunokwenzeka.
You need to make this a lot easier.	Kufuneka wenze oku kube lula kakhulu.
We will need to do this as soon as possible.	Kuza kufuneka siyenze ngokukhawuleza oku.
But tomorrow he would do better.	Kodwa kusasa wayeza kwenza ngcono.
I will have to think about this more.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngale nto ngakumbi.
I think that's a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
This is not the case at all.	Oku akunjalo kwaphela.
I never thought much of it.	Andizange ndicinge kakhulu ngayo.
Nobody goes to prison.	Akukho mntu uya entolongweni.
I don't want to be that way.	Andifuni ukuba njalo.
he said.	uthe.
I think I am alone.	Ndicinga ukuba ndedwa.
He looks very, very good.	Ukhangeleka kakhulu kakhulu.
It is impossible to talk to him.	Akunakwenzeka ukuthetha naye.
I wish it were so.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube njalo.
I told her, too.	Ndamxelela, nam.
Maybe he is.	Mhlawumbi nguye.
He is.	Nguye.
So he said nothing.	Ngoko ke akazange athethe nto.
I want you to do this so that you can be yourself again.	Ndifuna ukuba wenze oku ukuze ube nguwe kwakhona.
I don't want another one.	Andifuni enye.
I really don't like this.	Andiyithandi ncam le nto.
There is always time.	Kuhlala kukho ixesha.
This is obvious.	Oku kucacile.
I want to find my way.	Ndifuna ukufumana indlela yam.
But it only happened once.	Kodwa kwenzeka kanye kuphela.
He does not want to.	Akafuni.
It's better in the hospital.	Kungcono esibhedlele.
I hope to talk to you soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ndiza kuthetha nawe kungekudala.
This book too.	Le ncwadi nayo.
I finally feel better.	Ekugqibeleni ndiziva ngcono.
Please do more.	Nceda wenze ngakumbi.
This one is not out.	Lo akakho ngaphandle.
That is good for you.	Oko kulungile kuwe.
I don't like it.	Andiyithandi.
It's not one thing or another.	Asiyonto enye okanye enye.
I'm not sure now.	Andiqinisekanga ngoku.
He had to go alone.	Bekufanele ahambe yedwa.
But too much money.	Kodwa imali eninzi kakhulu.
I told him no.	Ndamxelela ukuba hayi.
I'm happy.	Ndiyavuya mna.
He did not stay long.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide.
I do not fully understand.	Andiqondi ngokupheleleyo.
He looked down.	Uye wajonga phantsi.
I don't know about this.	Andazi ngale nto.
Yes it is.	Ewe, yiyo.
But yes, that did happen.	Kodwa ewe, oko kwenzeka.
.	.
Sure, it's hard.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kunzima.
He said, what do you want.	Wathi, ufuna ntoni.
He is going home.	Uya ekhaya.
What are you going to do now?	Uza kwenza ntoni ngoku.
Well, no, it's not.	Ewe, hayi, akunjalo.
he asked.	wabuza.
So he went to prison.	Ngoko waya entolongweni.
But you know better now.	Kodwa uyazi ngcono ngoku.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
I will make peace.	ndiya kwenza uxolo.
Now we know how that happened.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
I never thought this could really happen.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
I think you should have it.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka ube nayo.
Maybe I'm the only one.	Mhlawumbi ndim kuphela.
Finding a way.	Ukufumana indlela.
It gets easier.	Kuba lula.
I will be with you.	Ndiza kuba nawe.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula.
That's all you need to know.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyazi.
I can't say for sure right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokuqinisekileyo ngoku.
But then he would be.	Kodwa ke wayeza kuba njalo.
All that out.	Yonke loo nto ngaphandle.
I want you now.	Ndifuna wena ngoku.
That's it for me.	Yiloo nto kum.
But no one knew.	Kodwa akukho mntu wayesazi.
Don't do that.	Musa ukuyenza loo nto.
You know how he does it.	Uyazi ukuba wenza njani.
Not exactly.	Akunjalo ncam.
I'm sure of that.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto.
Not so this week.	Akunjalo kule veki.
Sooner or later it will happen.	Kungekudala okanye kamva kuya kwenzeka.
Now it is impossible.	Ngoku akunakwenzeka.
Traveling alone is difficult.	Ukuhamba wedwa kunzima.
Anything else.	Enye into.
It seems to us, perhaps.	Kubonakala ngathi, mhlawumbi.
Or with it.	Okanye ngayo.
Please tell me more !.	Ndicela undixelele ngakumbi!.
There is no way to do it.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza.
I know it is impossible.	Ndiyazi ukuba akunakwenzeka.
He told me that.	Wandixelela ukuba .
He is not.	Ayinguye.
Maybe this is a big deal.	Mhlawumbi le yinto enkulu.
He said he would be down.	Wathi uzakuba phantsi.
Again, obviously not.	Kwakhona, ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
He did not want her to come.	Wayengafuni ukuba eze.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngokwenene.
Finally he began to speak.	Ekugqibeleni waqalisa ukuthetha.
We are going home.	Siya ekhaya.
I will talk to him.	Ndiza kuthetha naye.
You have to do it alone.	Kufuneka uyenze wedwa.
He knew nothing about it.	Wayengazi nto ngale nto.
We will do that.	Siza kuyenza loo nto.
I feel like myself again.	Ndiziva njengam kwakhona.
It's better this way.	Kungcono ngale ndlela.
He did not want to be alone.	Wayengafuni nokuba yedwa.
You think too much.	Ucinga kakhulu.
But you do not want to be here.	Kodwa awufuni ukuba lapha.
It really seems like a big deal to me.	Ngokwenene kubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu kum.
Or, maybe I'm the only one.	Okanye, mhlawumbi ndim kuphela.
But perhaps that was not necessary.	Kodwa mhlawumbi oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
What's the matter with me? 	Yintoni ingxaki kum?
he said.	uthe.
We have to do something.	Kufuneka senze into.
No, far away.	Hayi, kude.
Everyone knows everything.	Wonke umntu wazi yonke into.
This is certainly not possible.	Oku ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka.
I do not want to see.	Andifuni ukubona.
That will make it harder.	Oko kuya kwenza kube nzima.
But he did not want to stay.	Kodwa akazange afune ukuhlala.
I can't find a job.	Andikwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
In the end he did not succeed.	Ekugqibeleni akazange aphumelele.
That is the only thing that happened.	Yiloo nto kuphela eyenzekayo.
Now that would be a big deal.	Ngoku oko kuya kuba yinto enkulu.
I will really do that.	Ndiza kwenza njalo ngokwenene.
He didn't think much of it.	Akazange acinge kakhulu ngayo.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula.
Just because you have to.	Kuba nje kufuneka.
But you know better.	Kodwa wazi ngcono.
He said yes.	Uye wathi ewe.
You really are.	Wena ngokwenene .
Really, very.	Ngokwenene, kakhulu.
I have done too much.	Ndenze kakhulu kakhulu.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe, yinyani leyo.
He will do anything to succeed.	Uya kwenza nantoni na ukuze aphumelele.
But it is you.	Kodwa nguwe.
It certainly is not a problem to do so.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho ngxaki ukwenza oko.
No, not really.	Hayi, akunjalo, ngokwenene.
That's hard.	Oko kunzima.
He said it was impossible.	Wathi akunakwenzeka.
I wish it were true.	Ndinqwenela ukuba yinyani.
What you need to do.	Yintoni ekufuneka uyenzile.
I want you to tell me what happened.	Ndifuna undixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
But you need to know this.	Kodwa kufuneka ukwazi oku.
I'm not sure how I can do that.	Andiqinisekanga ncam ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
Succeeding is not easy.	Ukuphumelela akukho lula.
Sorry, but it 's true.	Uxolo, kodwa yinyani.
He has to go to work.	Kufuneka aye emsebenzini.
But there is something.	Kodwa kukho into.
Please tell me.	Nceda undixelele.
So that is possible.	Ngoko oko kunokwenzeka.
But always for me.	Kodwa rhoqo kum.
Do not go alone.	Musa ukuhamba wedwa.
You should have known better.	Bekufanele ukuba uyazi ngcono.
You talk to him.	Uthetha naye.
Sitting down.	Ukuhlala phantsi.
This is my place.	Indawo yam ke.
We'll talk about that again later.	Siza kuthetha ngayo kwakhona kamva.
But he is.	Kodwa nguye.
I want to talk to you.	Ndifuna ukuthetha nawe.
I'm not sure that would be better.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba oko kuya kuba ngcono.
Very, very alone.	Kakhulu, wedwa kakhulu.
You want something else.	Ufuna enye into.
But what.	Kodwa yintoni na.
Yes, why, yes.	Ewe, kutheni, ewe.
He needed time.	Wayefuna ixesha.
I know you would like that.	Ndiyazi ukuba ungathanda oko.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I hope you like it too.	Ndiyathemba ukuba nawe uyayithanda.
This is a big man.	Yindoda enkulu le.
But the police want to talk to you.	Kodwa amapolisa afuna ukuthetha nawe.
Why, you already know.	Kutheni, sele uyazi.
I hope you stay long enough to do that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uhlala ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo ukwenza oko.
Please tell me what I did.	Nceda undixelele ukuba ndenze ntoni.
He had to go.	Kwafuneka ahambe.
Not even that hard.	Hayi nokuba kunzima kakhulu.
But not only that.	Kodwa hayi kuphela.
he asked.	wabuza.
But it is difficult.	Kodwa kunzima.
Just something about you.	Into nje ngawe.
Sorry, but that's true.	Uxolo kodwa yinyani leyo.
He never thought about it.	Khange acinge ngayo.
I have never been able to do that before.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza loo nto ngaphambili.
You know it's true.	Uyazi ukuba yinyani.
But not for him.	Kodwa hayi kuye.
You want to do well.	Ufuna ukwenza kakuhle.
You do not really want to do this.	Awufuni ngokwenene ukwenza oku.
He is definitely going to jail, as it should be.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya entolongweni, njengoko kufuneka.
He certainly did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyenzile.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
You have to be in this for a long time.	Kufuneka ube kule nto ixesha elide.
I'm not sure what to do.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze ntoni.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
You know, that's not all.	Uyazi, ayinguye kwaphela lowo.
He tried but could not.	Wazama kodwa akakwazi.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto kanye.
I will not be !.	Andiyi kuba!.
One day you have to go to prison.	Ngenye imini kufuneka uye entolongweni.
I don't know what you really want to do.	Andazi ukuba ufuna ukwenza ntoni kanye kanye.
I have to make it easy.	Kufuneka ndiyenze lula.
Going with him.	Ukuhamba naye.
Someone wants to do that.	Umntu ufuna ukwenza oko.
I never did that.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
I think this is impossible.	Ndicinga ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
Well, maybe.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi.
Well, that's the problem.	Ewe, nantso ingxaki.
But no one will do it.	Kodwa akukho mntu uya kuyenza.
Traveling becomes difficult.	Ukuhamba kuba nzima.
Exactly how, he did not know.	Kanye ukuba njani, wayengazi.
We did things right.	Senze izinto kakuhle.
My work here has done it.	Umsebenzi wam apha uyenzile.
But something is needed.	Kodwa kufuneka into.
But he did not know how.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuba njani.
You just have to do it really well.	Kufuneka nje wenze kakuhle ngokwenene.
.	.
As you want.	Njengoko ufuna.
I knew it was impossible.	Ndandisazi ukuba akunakwenzeka.
I don't think you should be.	Andiqondi ukuba ufanele ukuba njalo.
How long, he does not know.	Ixesha elingakanani, akazi.
I will do well.	Ndiza kuyenza kakuhle.
Well that's not exactly the case.	Kulungile oko akunjalo ncam.
I can't swim.	Andikwazi ukuqubha.
No one does this.	Akukho mntu wenza oku.
I do not know how.	Andazi ukuba njani.
Or maybe now.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngoku.
No one thought it would happen.	Akukho mntu wayecinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
Driving here is very difficult.	Ukuqhuba apha kunzima kakhulu.
You know you did too.	Uyazi nawe uyenzile.
I just want to be with you.	Ndifuna nje ukuba nawe.
I want to know what happened.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
This is not necessary.	Oku akuyomfuneko.
I hope you like it.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayithanda.
But then he started.	Kodwa ke waqalisa.
But I'm not sure how I can do that.	Kodwa andiqinisekanga ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
Sounds good.	Kubonakala kulungile.
Someone is making this happen.	Kukho umntu owenza oku kwenzeke.
I don't like that at all.	Andiyithandi loo nto kwaphela.
But not for me.	Kodwa hayi kum.
Lots of stuff, really.	Izinto ezininzi, ngokwenene.
I wonder why.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kutheni.
What is happening now.	Kwenzeka ntoni ngoku.
You know, here, with me.	Uyazi, apha, kunye nam.
But that is not necessary.	Kodwa oko akuyomfuneko.
I will do it soon.	Ndiza kuyenza ngokukhawuleza.
It just so happens that the problem is you.	Kwenzeka nje ukuba ingxaki nguwe.
I am very aware of this.	Ndiyazi kakhulu le nto.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
I'm glad you are.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nguwe.
He also said nothing.	Naye akazange athethe nto.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe ngomso.
There is no one in it.	Akukho mntu kuyo.
I never did.	Andizange ndiyenze.
He knew now.	Wayesazi ngoku.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga kakhulu.
he said.	uthe.
Me, not so much.	Mna, hayi kakhulu.
We know that happens very often.	Siyazi ukuba oko kwenzeka rhoqo kakhulu.
It is very difficult for me.	Kunzima kakhulu kum.
This is difficult.	Oku kunzima.
It can also be more difficult.	Kwakhona kunokuba nzima ngakumbi.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku.
I just want to do everything.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza yonke into.
He looked up again.	Wajonga kwakhona.
So you will definitely never do it again.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo awuyi kuphinda.
I talked a lot, a lot.	Ndithethe kakhulu, kakhulu.
I'm sure of it.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo.
No, probably.	Akunjalo, mhlawumbi.
So he says it's okay.	Ngoko uthi kulungile.
No one thinks about this.	Akukho mntu ucinga ngale nto.
I can't do all that myself.	Andikwazi kuyenza yonke lonto mna.
Everyone agreed.	Wonke umntu wavuma.
Mary sat for a while.	UMariya wahlala kancinci.
You just told me.	Undixelele nje.
He would do it alone.	Wayeza kuyenza loo nto yedwa.
I'm not sure how I did this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani oku.
You want one.	Ufuna enye.
I'm sure you did.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba wenze njalo.
No one has done much.	Akukho mntu wenze into eninzi.
This is always difficult.	Oku kuhlala kunzima.
I feel so much better.	Ndiziva ngcono kakhulu.
Is it so hard ?.	Ngaba kunzima kangaka?.
he asked.	wabuza.
You know the truth.	Uyayazi inyani.
He cannot speak.	Akakwazi ukuthetha.
However, he does not have to.	Kodwa ke, akuyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
I now .	Mna ngoku .
I will certainly not do that.	ngokuqinisekileyo andiyi kuyenza loo nto.
This can be difficult.	Oku kunokuba nzima.
Nothing much.	Akukho nto ingako.
He would do anything.	Wayeza kwenza nantoni na.
But, he must succeed.	Kodwa, kufuneka aphumelele.
In this, he did not succeed.	Kule nto, akazange aphumelele.
But not me and him.	Kodwa hayi mna naye.
.	.
He said he knew about it, too.	Uthe uyazi ngayo, nawe.
Please drive.	Nceda ukuqhuba.
Maybe she likes it too.	Mhlawumbi naye uyayithanda.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Only when more money is needed immediately.	Kuphela xa kufuneka imali eninzi ngokukhawuleza.
That's all.	Yonke ke loo nto.
I do not want you to be alone.	Andifuni ube wedwa.
He does everything.	Wenza yonke into.
So much for me.	Kakhulu kum.
He really knew.	Wayesazi ngokwenene.
He did not come alone.	Akazange eze yedwa.
You're not thinking right now.	Awucingi kakuhle ngoku.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
What will happen, will happen.	Kuya kwenzeka ntoni, kuya kwenzeka.
Just don’t know enough to do the job well.	Musa nje ukwazi ngokwaneleyo ukwenza umsebenzi kakuhle.
I do not believe anything.	Andikholelwa nto.
He lives right there.	Uhlala kanye apho.
Maybe that's true now.	Mhlawumbi yinyani leyo ngoku.
I don't really want to.	Andifuni ngokwenene.
For something to happen.	Ukuze kwenzeke into.
I told her all this.	Ndamxelela yonke lento.
It's hard to eat.	Kunzima ukutya.
It is very difficult to tell.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuxelela.
So much for everything.	Kakhulu kuyo yonke into.
That's just yours.	Yinto yakho nje leyo.
I think that will happen.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka.
There is always something going on.	Kuhlala kukho into eyenzekayo.
But he did not want to do that.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
Everyone knows about it.	Wonke umntu uyazi ngayo.
he did not go to work.	khange aye emsebenzini.
I don't want it to happen.	Andifuni ukuba yenzeke.
This creates a problem.	Oku kudala ingxaki.
Yeah, me, no.	Ewe, mna, hayi.
Not for you.	Hayi kuwe.
Everything and everything.	Yonke into kunye nantoni na.
So for me, this is not the case.	Ke kum, oku akunjalo.
Therefore, it takes a lot of time.	Ngoko ke, kufuna ixesha elininzi.
I was wondering what it was.	Bendicinga nokuba yintoni na.
Like me, once.	Njengam, kanye.
He had better be alone.	Kungcono abe yedwa.
Maybe he wanted to be alone.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna ukuba yedwa.
Whatever happens to me.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni kum.
We will do the same.	Siza kwenza njalo ke.
Doing a lot of things there.	Ukwenza izinto ezininzi apho.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akayi.
That could be the same thing.	Oko kunokuba yinto enye.
Now everyone does.	Ngoku wonke umntu wenza njalo.
Not yesterday, for a long time.	Hayi izolo, ixesha elide.
Tell me the truth.	Ndixelele inyani.
I never thought of that.	Andizange ndicinge nto ngaloo nto.
You really deserve it.	Ufanele ngokwenene.
It's hard, for me, to see how it happens.	Kunzima, kum, ukubona ukuba kwenzeka njani.
We know this is you.	Siyazi ukuba nguwe lo.
He would do the same with her.	Wayeza kwenza njalo naye.
Or maybe.	Okanye mhlawumbi .
He is coming soon.	Uza ngokukhawuleza.
Maybe he didn't want to.	Mhlawumbi wayengafuni.
So what's the big deal.	Ngoko yintoni into enkulu.
Impossible, but possible.	Akunakwenzeka, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
Of course it is not easy.	Ewe akukho lula.
Nothing much.	Akukho nto ingako.
I know nothing about you.	Andazi nto ngawe.
He knew he had to do something fast.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka enze into ngokukhawuleza.
He did not know why.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
I'm sure of this.	Ndiqinisekile ngale nto.
I hope you like it a little bit.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayithanda kancinci.
.	.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
I want to be me.	Ndifuna ukuba ndim.
You know the problem there.	Uyayazi ingxaki apho.
That's a very good thing.	Yinto entle kakhulu.
He would stay.	Wayeza kuhlala.
For you.	Ukuze kuwe.
That's fine too.	Kulungile nam.
He did just that the other day.	Wenza loo nto kanye ngenye imini.
You did your job.	Wenze umsebenzi wakho.
At the hospital.	Esibhedlele.
Okay, it looks okay.	Kulungile, kubonakala kulungile.
Yes, it is possible.	Ewe, kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
You will need to know what this means for me.	Kuya kufuneka uyazi ukuba oku kuthetha ntoni kum.
I am absolutely convinced.	Ndiqinisekile ngokupheleleyo.
I know for a fact that I did.	Ndiyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba ndenze njalo.
We need to go for help.	Kufuneka siye kufuna uncedo.
Yes, this is really possible.	Ewe, oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
Probably not for long.	Mhlawumbi hayi ixesha elide.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
You know something.	Uyayazi into.
Maybe you're here.	Mhlawumbi ulapha.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I think you do too.	Ndicinga ukuba nawe wenza njalo.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga kangako.
It just has to.	Kufuneka nje.
We need to do that.	Kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
That's all he wants to do.	Yinto yonke afuna ukuyenza.
There is no one in it.	Akukho mntu kuyo.
But not quite.	Kodwa hayi ngokupheleleyo.
I thought you knew.	Bendicinga ukuba uyazi.
Everything.	Yonke into.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
I knew how, yes.	Ndandisazi ukuba njani, ewe.
But only you.	Kodwa wena kuphela.
If not today, soon.	Ukuba akunjalo namhlanje, kungekudala.
Just now .	Ngoku .
He wanted to succeed quickly.	Wayefuna ukuphumelela ngokukhawuleza.
That's not my thing.	Asiyonto yam leyo.
But it is not necessary at all.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
Nice to see you here.	Ndiyavuya ukubona apha.
So much for everything.	Kakhulu yonke into.
It is not necessary here.	Akuyomfuneko apha.
But I did not.	Kodwa andizange.
Something happened to him.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuye.
I do not know.	Andikwazi ukwazi.
If you did, you know.	Ukuba uyenzile, uyazi.
I never really knew.	Andizange ndiyazi ngokwenene.
I don't like him.	Andiyithandi kuye.
So you know.	Ngoko uyazi.
Just great.	Enkulu nje.
I don’t think it will get better, not immediately.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba ngcono, hayi ngoko nangoko.
Sorry about that.	Uxolo ngawe.
It can also be easy to be hard on you.	Kwakhona kunokuba lula ukuba nzima kuwe.
You deserve to be.	Ufanele ukuba.
Whatever.	Nokuba yintoni na.
he thought.	wacinga.
The problem is time.	Ingxaki lixesha.
Now that.	Ngoku ukuba.
I did not speak to him.	khange ndithethe naye.
It will need someone else.	Kuya kufuneka omnye umntu.
All right.	Kulungile.
So no.	Ngoko ke akukho.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi nokuba uphi na.
I'm not going anywhere.	andiyi ndawo.
Anyone can do this.	Nabani na angayenza le nto.
I don't really like that.	Andiyithandi kakhulu loo nto.
He says yes to her.	Uthi ewe kuye.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
A book, perhaps.	Incwadi, mhlawumbi.
I thought you liked it too.	Bendicinga ukuba nawe uyayithanda.
But until then.	Kodwa kude kube ngoko.
So much for anyone.	Kakhulu nabani na.
Yes! 	Ewe!
Surely everyone will do things about it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wonke umntu uya kwenza izinto ngaloo nto.
She has done well.	Uye wenza kakuhle.
I never did, of course.	Andizange ndiyenze, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Is true .	Yinyani .
He will have to be.	Kuya kufuneka abe.
It's hard.	Kuba kunzima.
You will be.	Uya kuba.
Well, it's the same thing.	Ewe, yinto enye.
I don't know if that's true.	Andazi ukuba yinyani leyo.
I don't want to buy now.	Andifuni ukuthenga ngoku.
I have known this for a long time.	Kudala ndikwazi oku.
I will not do it.	Andiyi kwenza .
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
It's just true.	Yinyani nje.
It's, it's your thing.	Yinto, into yakho.
I hope you find help here.	Ndiyathemba ukufumana uncedo apha.
you say.	uthi.
But one has to.	Kodwa umntu kufuneka.
I need to know.	Kufuneka ndiyazi.
He did not want to see it.	Wayengafuni ukubona.
No one is there.	Akukho mntu apho.
Obviously yes.	Ngokucacileyo ewe.
But not this thing.	Kodwa hayi le nto.
For a very long time.	Kuba ixesha elide kakhulu.
That sounds good.	Oko kubonakala kulungile.
Nobody wants to be here.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba lapha.
I knew you would do nothing.	Ndandisazi ukuba akuyi kwenza nto.
Suddenly, he thought.	Ngokukhawuleza, wacinga.
We need to do better.	Kufuneka senze ngcono.
Probably not now.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo ngoku.
He did not make anyone.	Akazange enze mntu.
I know that .	Ndiyayazi lo nto .
I'm scared.	Ndiyoyika ke.
Not a little, but a lot.	Hayi kancinci, kodwa kakhulu.
That means very little.	Oko kuthetha kancinci kakhulu.
But this is not really the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo ngokwenene.
No not yet.	Hayi, okwangoku.
It's his thing.	Yinto yakhe.
It is not difficult at all.	Akukho nzima kwaphela.
I think you know.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi.
If nothing, nothing.	Ukuba akukho nto, akukho nto.
This seems to me.	Oku kubonakala ngathi kum.
Everyone is a person.	Wonke umntu ngumntu.
But maybe he can't.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akakwazi.
But he is your husband.	Kodwa yindoda yakho.
To be so.	Ukuze kube njalo.
But there is one major problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki enkulu enye.
He has to do that.	Ufanele ukuba enze njalo.
It is impossible to know for sure.	Akunakwenzeka ukwazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
That is very true.	Yinyani leyo kakhulu.
No! 	Hayi!
But he didn't know what it was.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
You know, just saying things really.	Uyazi, ukuthetha nje izinto ngenene.
Yes, this does happen.	Ewe, oku kwenzeka.
He did not really want to go.	Wayengafuni nyani ukuhamba.
So, you.	Ngoko ke, wena.
Maybe eating something.	Mhlawumbi ukutya into.
Why would anyone do that ?.	Kutheni umntu esenza lonto?.
He needed help.	Wayefuna uncedo.
Yes, not always.	Ewe, hayi rhoqo.
Sounds like okay.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile.
But he did not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwenze oko.
Definitely very fast.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
He has looked my way.	Uye wajonga indlela yam.
It seems that you do too.	Kubonakala ngathi nawe wenza njalo.
I did the same.	Nam ndenze njalo.
I do not know.	Andazi.
But this one.	Kodwa lo .
You can too.	Nawe unokuba kuyo.
But not much to see.	Kodwa akukho kakhulu ukubona.
Maybe we'll go there.	Mhlawumbi siya kuya apho.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
That will be so.	Oko kuya kuba njalo.
He wants to make you better.	Ufuna ukwenza ngcono wena.
Not bad.	Hayi kakubi.
More on that later.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto kamva.
Nothing in it! 	Akukho nto kuyo!
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I am glad.	Ndiyavuya.
Maybe it should.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele.
No one is talking about anything else.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngenye into.
Success means everything.	Ukuphumelela kuthetha yonke into.
I know.	Ndiyazi mna.
Not even far away.	Akukho nokuba kunokwenzeka kude.
This you hope for.	Oku unethemba.
He does things well.	Wenza izinto kakuhle.
He was not.	Wayengekho.
I don't want to do that.	Andifuni ukuyenza loo nto.
I will definitely do it again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza kwakhona.
He wanted to succeed.	Wayefuna ukuphumelela.
I know you're not going.	Ndiyazi ukuba awuyi.
You have to do this.	Kufuneka wenze oku.
Not there, then.	Hayi apho, ngoko.
I can't today.	Andikwazi namhlanje.
Maybe not for you.	Mhlawumbi hayi kuwe.
Not so much, really.	Akunjalo kakhulu, ngokwenene.
He became difficult.	Waba nzima.
Where do you live.	Uhlala phi.
All right.	Kulungile.
I hope you are feeling better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ngcono.
Or what are you really trying to do here.	Okanye ngenene uzama ukwenza ntoni apha.
I can't see how I can do that.	Andikwazi kubonakala ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
Here, for you.	Apha, kuwe.
Everyone at work.	Wonke umntu emsebenzini.
Maybe, maybe.	Mhlawumbi, mhlawumbi.
You know where this thing is.	Uyayazi ukuba iphi le nto.
He also did not think.	Naye akazange acinge.
We'll talk about that later.	Siza kuthetha ngaloo nto kamva.
Or something like that.	Okanye into enjalo.
I did not speak well to him.	Khange ndithethe kakuhle naye.
Because he wanted to go to school.	Kuba wayefuna ukuya esikolweni.
I will do that.	Ndiya kuyenza loo nto.
That was not necessary.	Oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
But I really know that is not the case.	Kodwa ngokwenene ndiyazi ukuba akunjalo.
I need your car.	Ndifuna imoto yakho.
I know it well.	Ndiyazi kakuhle.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
It just happened there.	Kwenzeka nje apho.
Or it should be.	Okanye bekufanele ukuba.
No no no.	Hayi hayi hayi.
Now, we know better.	Ngoku, siyazi ngcono.
Alone alone.	Eyedwa yedwa.
But nothing.	Kodwa akukho nto.
Thus.	Ngaloo ndlela.
I'm not sure how.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba njani.
He wanted to know everything about us.	Wayefuna ukwazi yonke into ngathi.
He didn't really want to have it.	Wayengafuni ngokwenene ukuba nayo.
This is just one thing.	Yinto enye nje le.
You probably already know this.	Mhlawumbi sele uyazi le nto.
He can have all the money he wants.	Unokuba nayo yonke imali ayifunayo.
But he did not come.	Kodwa akazange eze.
Maybe that's true.	Mhlawumbi yinyani leyo.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
At home all day.	Ekhaya imini yonke.
I want nothing from you.	Andifuni nto kuwe.
He can't, he can never do that.	Akakwazi, akanakuze enze njalo.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
That's what he had to do.	Nto leyo kwafuneka ayenze.
I'm going there.	Ndiya khona mna.
He made a decision.	Wenza isigqibo.
You will be.	Uya kuba.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.
He wants to know everything.	Ufuna ukwazi yonke into.
I just want to know if it is possible.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
he said.	uthe.
Will you do it again.	Ngaba uya kuphinda.
He didn't want her to do that.	Wayengafuni ukuba enze loo nto.
I did so.	Ndenze njalo.
This, it seems, is hard to do.	Oku, kubonakala, kunzima ukwenza.
Do not do such a thing.	Musa ukwenza into enjalo.
Not so clearly.	Akunjalo ngokucacileyo.
But, you are also human.	Kodwa, nawe ungumntu.
Not a job.	Hayi umsebenzi.
And this is what happens.	Yiloo nto ke eyenzekayo.
He did not say much.	Khange athethe kakhulu.
But he could not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
He could not decide for himself what to do.	Akazange akwazi ukwenza isigqibo ngaloo nto.
It has to happen now.	Kufuneka yenzeke ngoku.
I will not go to him.	Andiyi kuye.
I can do it quickly.	Ndingayenza ngokukhawuleza.
But, that's it.	Kodwa, yiloo nto.
As we will do so.	Njengoko siza kwenza njalo.
He did everything else.	Uyenzile yonke enye into.
This can be very far.	Oku kunokuba kude kakhulu.
That will make it harder.	Oko kuya kwenza kube nzima.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Everyone wanted money.	Wonke umntu wayefuna imali.
Probably in it.	Mhlawumbi kuyo.
Whether it is you or anyone.	Nokuba ngawe okanye nabani na.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
All right.	Kulungile.
This is unlikely to happen.	Oku akunakwenzeka ukuba kube njalo.
Soon you will be with him, one way or another.	Kungekudala uza kuba naye, ngenye indlela okanye enye.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze isigqibo.
He will have to think more.	Kuya kufuneka acinge ngakumbi.
He wanted to do it.	Wayefuna ukuyenza.
Also, a lot of money.	Kwakhona, imali eninzi.
Not just me.	Hayi mna kuphela.
But again a little bit.	Kodwa kwakhona kancinci.
Good thing here.	Into entle apha.
He doesn't know what it is.	Akazi ukuba yintoni na.
Everyone else.	Wonke omnye umntu.
I don't know how anyone can do that.	Andiqondi ukuba umntu angayenza njani loo nto.
Well, everyone knows that.	Ewe, wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
It will be easy.	Kuya kuba lula.
Of course not!	Ewe akunjalo kwaphela.
Great place.	Indawo enkulu.
But something happened to me.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo kum.
He said he really wanted to talk to me.	Wathi nyani ufuna ukuthetha nam.
He would like to be the only dog.	Angathanda ukuba yedwa inja.
Because you did the right thing.	Kuba kanye wenze into elungileyo.
No, really.	Hayi, ngokwenene.
Or okay, really.	Okanye kulungile, ngokwenene.
It is impossible to.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba.
So he sat down to think.	Ngoko wahlala phantsi ukuze acinge.
That's why you've agreed.	Yiyo loo nto uye wavuma.
What a bad !.	Yintoni embi!.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
Everyone looked at him.	Wonke umntu wajonga kuye.
He knows what he wants.	Uyayazi into ayifunayo.
Not exactly.	Hayi kanye.
One has to be.	Omnye kufuneka abe.
I did not know how.	Bendingazi ukuba njani.
All of this happened very quickly.	Yonke le nto yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
It certainly will.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba njalo.
But he did well.	Kodwa wenza kakuhle.
This is a very bad thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu le.
I think everyone knows that.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
But it is not easy.	Kodwa akukho lula.
That's one very thing.	Yinto enye kakhulu leyo.
But he knew better.	Kodwa wayesazi ngcono.
We need to do that again.	Kufuneka siyenze loo nto kwakhona.
Don't play house if you don't want to play house.	Musa ukudlala indlu ukuba awufuni ukudlala indlu.
But tonight, nobody.	Kodwa ngokuhlwanje, akukho mntu.
He did not do so either.	Naye akazange enze njalo.
He looks great.	Ubonakala kakhulu .
Nobody does anything.	Akukho mntu wenza nantoni na.
He did not come.	Akazange eze.
He did not know how.	Wayengazi ukuba njani.
I just can't sit still.	Andikwazi ukuhlala nje.
He will certainly come.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuza.
This is a very bad thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu le.
Is it time now.	Ngaba lixesha ngoku.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
To me this is good.	Kum oku kulungile.
That happens all the time.	Oko kwenzeka rhoqo.
One has to think about that.	Umntu kufuneka acinge ngaloo nto.
Not so for me.	Akunjalo kum.
He admitted that.	Wavuma ukuba.
I do not believe anything.	Andikholelwa nto.
But that was not necessary.	Kodwa oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
This is hard to do.	Oku kunzima ukwenza.
If something is wrong.	Ukuba kukho into embi.
He will be back soon.	Uza kuza kwakhona kungekudala.
I just can't do that.	Andikwazi nje ukuyenza loo nto.
I'm not sure how that happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yenzeke njani loo nto.
But he did not say anything.	Kodwa akazange athethe nto.
Wherever you go, you go.	Apho uya khona, uya.
This is clearly not the case.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
No one asked why.	Akukho mntu wabuza ukuba kutheni.
He doesn't know where he is now.	Akayazi ukuba uphi ngoku.
I hope you know how to do that by now.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayazi indlela yokwenza oko ngoku.
He will be the one.	Uya kuba nguye.
This is very unlikely.	Oku akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
He started talking to her.	Waqalisa ukuthetha nayo.
He would come.	Wayeza kuza.
But there is something else there, too.	Kodwa kukho enye into apho, nayo.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi lonto.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
This seems like a big deal.	Oku kubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu.
I would definitely like to stay there.	Ndingathanda ngokuqinisekileyo ukuhlala apho.
No one will ever know.	Akukho mntu uya kukwazi.
Maybe you will be able to do it.	Mhlawumbi uya kukwazi ukuyenza.
I want you here too.	Ndifuna nawe apha.
Now we both know why.	Ngoku sobabini siyazi ukuba kutheni.
But now that's it.	Kodwa ngoku yiloo nto.
But not only that.	Kodwa hayi nje.
Definitely a lot of coffee.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ikofu eninzi.
Glad you're here !.	Ndiyavuya ulapha!.
I'm sure of this.	Ndiqinisekile ngale nto.
He said nothing.	Khange athethe nto.
How do you think it happened?	Ucinga ukuba kwenzeke njani.
Tomorrow, perhaps, a little walk outside.	Ngomso, mhlawumbi, ukuhamba kancinci ngaphandle.
That is hard enough.	Oko kunzima ngokwaneleyo.
There is a way to do that.	Kukho indlela yokwenza oko.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
He thought he knew.	Wayecinga ukuba uyazi.
It's a very big thing.	Yinto enkulu kakhulu.
But one did.	Kodwa omnye uyenzile.
Not that way.	Hayi ngaloo ndlela.
He did not go anywhere.	Akazange aye ndawo.
But, it can be difficult.	Kodwa, kunokuba nzima.
He stayed there for a long time.	Wahlala apho ixesha elide.
He just loves to find his way.	Uthanda nje ukufumana indlela yakhe.
You should have done it.	Bekufanele uyenzile.
Staying alone at home all day.	Ukuhlala wedwa ekhaya imini yonke.
You probably already know that.	Mhlawumbi sele uyayazi loo nto.
He would like to.	Angathanda.
It seems impossible.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka.
I knew better.	Ndandisazi ngcono.
You talk about it.	Uthetha ngayo.
Not with him.	Hayi naye.
True, very true.	Yinyani, inyani kakhulu.
Just here for convenience.	Apha nje ukuze kube lula.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wonke umntu wenza kakuhle.
You want it easy.	Ufuna lula.
This he probably did.	Oku kusenokwenzeka ukuba wakwenza.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka wenze njalo.
I will do that again.	Ndiya kuyenza loo nto kwakhona.
Impossible.	Akunakwenzeka.
I just want to talk to him.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha naye.
Well, that's exactly it.	Ewe, yiloo nto kanye.
He agreed to go with me.	Wavuma ukuhamba nam.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
He also knew he knew.	Naye wayesazi ukuba uyayazi.
What, then, should a person do? 	Kufuneka enze ntoni ke umntu?
I want to be with her.	Ndifuna ukuba naye.
Now, tell me this.	Ngoku, ndixelele oku.
Absolutely true.	Yinyani ngokupheleleyo.
Everything is bad.	Yonke into embi.
He also did not.	Naye akazange.
But nothing.	Kodwa akukho nto.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Uthetha ukuba ucinga .
I have to tell someone.	Kufuneka ndixelele umntu.
It will be very difficult.	Kuza kuba nzima kakhulu.
Nobody told me anything.	Akukho mntu undixelele nto.
For he said.	Kuba wathi .
One is here.	Omnye ulapha.
But then something.	Kodwa ke into .
No, time.	Akunjalo, ixesha.
That way there is no problem.	Ngaloo ndlela akukho ngxaki.
He said he would be there.	Wathi uzakuba khona.
He was nowhere.	Wayengekho ndawo.
So, it will be difficult.	Ngoko, kuya kuba nzima.
I suspect it is not.	Ndiyakrokrela ukuba akunjalo.
I would like to help.	Ndingathanda ukunceda.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He will always be that way.	Uya kuhlala enjalo.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
Not enough.	Akukho ngokwaneleyo.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
Something else happened.	Kukho enye into eyenzekayo.
Now you can do many things.	Ngoku uyakwazi ukwenza izinto ezininzi.
I'm afraid.	Ndiyoyika.
Definitely a must.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka.
You will not have to.	Akuyi kufuneka.
I never told anyone or talked about it.	Andizange ndixelele mntu okanye ndithethe ngayo.
That's a bad thing.	Yinto embi leyo.
He wanted to see.	Wayefuna ukubona.
It had to be hard.	Kwafuneka kube nzima.
.	.
Are you ?.	Ngaba nawe?.
But I was not alone.	Kodwa andizange ndedwa.
One thing, really.	Into enye, ngenene.
He did not want to do this.	Wayengafuni ukuyenza le nto.
He acted quickly.	Wenza ngokukhawuleza.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
It happens all the time.	Kwenzeka rhoqo.
I hope that is good for you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kulungile kuwe.
you say.	uthi.
Maybe you do too.	Mhlawumbi nawe wenza njalo.
Far farther than you think.	Kude kakhulu kunokuba ucinga.
This will do.	Oku kuya kwenza.
Happy to help.	Ndiyavuya ukunceda.
I am very happy.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu.
Nothing now.	Akukho nto ngoku.
Thus, making it difficult to see.	Ngaloo ndlela, ukwenza kube nzima ukubona.
Of course, no one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, akukho mntu.
It will always be there.	Kuya kuhlala kukho.
We have done too much or too little.	Senze kakhulu okanye kancinci kakhulu.
Anyone.	Nabani na.
He did not stay that long.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide kangaka nyani.
He knows the whole thing.	Uyayazi yonke loo nto.
I would like to stay there.	Ndingathanda ukuhlala apho.
If it will end.	Ukuba kuya kuphela.
Not so with you, no.	Akunjalo nawe, akunjalo.
We will definitely do another soon.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siza kwenza enye kungekudala.
Not really at home.	Hayi ngokwenene ekhaya.
Not long enough.	Kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
He just wants to talk.	Ufuna nje ukuthetha.
He became even more difficult.	Waba nzima ngakumbi.
I want a job.	Ndifuna umsebenzi.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
I have to go to the hospital.	Kufuneka ndiye esibhedlele.
You told me yes.	Undixelele ewe.
You have to tell.	Kufuneka uxelele.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
That would be very difficult.	Oko kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
He will do it my way.	Uza kuyenza ngendlela yam.
I did not want to know more.	Ndandingafuni ukwazi ngakumbi.
This once, please.	Oku kube kanye, nceda.
I have to go to work.	Kufuneka ndiye emsebenzini.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
Or not really.	Okanye akunjalo ngokwenene.
I hope you like it.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayithanda.
He made it hard for me to do better.	Wenze ukuba kube nzima ukwenza ngcono mna.
He really did.	Ngokwenene wenza njalo.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
We'll talk about that soon.	Siza kuthetha ngaloo nto kungekudala.
I feel very bad.	Ndiziva kakubi kakhulu.
He says he doesn't know, so he doesn't know.	Uthi akazi, ngoko akazi.
I was thinking of something else.	Bendicinga ngenye into.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nceda undixelele ukuba ndenze njani.
A book? 	Incwadi?
.	.
That's all.	Yiloo nto yonke.
But one day you know.	Kodwa ngenye imini uyazi.
He should have spoken earlier now.	Bekufanele athethe ngaphambili ngoku.
It will be easier for you.	Kuya kuba lula kuwe.
Sorry more.	Uxolo ngakumbi.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
I can't buy that at all.	Andikwazi ukuthenga oko kwaphela.
But that can be difficult.	Kodwa oko kunokuba nzima.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
For a very long time, as it seems now.	Ixesha elide kakhulu, njengoko kubonakala ngoku.
No one really knew.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ncam.
I thought it was time.	Ndandicinga ukuba lixesha.
But why? 	Kodwa kutheni?
He just wants you.	Ufuna nje wena.
But not the next.	Kodwa hayi ezayo.
I know it isn't.	Ndiyazi ukuba ayinguye.
So it would be better to stay this one out.	Ngoko kuya kuba ngcono ukuhlala lo ngaphandle.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza.
I can't go to work.	Andikwazi ukuya emsebenzini.
It seems to us.	Kubonakala ngathi .
He knew it well.	Wayesazi kakuhle.
That's just the way it is.	Yiloo ndlela nje.
He had to stay here.	Kwafuneka ahlale apha.
Really, this is going to be very real.	Ngokwenene, oku kuya kuba yinyani kakhulu.
One day he says he didn't.	Ngenye imini uthi akazange.
I am the only one.	Ndim kuphela, ndedwa.
Now you know.	Ngoku uyazi.
It's a long time ago.	Kudala kudala.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
You need to know about that.	Kufuneka uyazi ngaloo nto.
Surely, it is clear why.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kucacile ukuba kutheni.
I would like to do it again.	Ndingathanda ukuyenza kwakhona.
You can be.	Unokuba .
I only did my job.	Ndenze umsebenzi wam kuphela.
But here's what you need to know.	Kodwa yinto ekufuneka uyazi.
Or you know someone.	Okanye wazi umntu.
Impossible.	Akunakwenzeka.
If this is possible.	Ukuba oku kunokwenzeka.
We both know that this is not the case.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
Here it is again.	Nantso kwakhona.
Maybe he didn't know anything.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi nto.
I can't say for how long exactly.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba ixesha elingakanani kanye kanye.
I can't talk to her.	Andikwazi ukuthetha naye.
He would like to talk.	Angathanda ukuthetha.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
But what .	Kodwa ntoni .
I do not know how.	Andazi ukuba njani.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
If not, I don't know what to do.	Ukuba akunjalo, andazi ukuba ndenze ntoni.
I won't have that.	Andiyi kuba nayo loo nto.
I hope we do.	Ndiyathemba ukuba siza kuyenza.
He knew he had to say something.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka athethe into.
It had to.	Kwafuneka .
He never came here.	Zange eze apha.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
He says he loves it.	Uthi uyayithanda.
I have to be honest.	Kufuneka ndithethe inyani.
Now is the time !.	Ngoku lixesha!.
If you will be there.	Ukuba uya kuba khona.
Doing the right thing.	Ukwenza into elungileyo.
He was not there either.	Naye wayengekho.
He really is.	Nguye ngenene.
All of us here.	Nathi sonke apha.
But, he did not do this.	Kodwa, akazange akwenze oku.
He says he would like to go.	Uthi angathanda ukuhamba.
I can't say what will happen.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
He tried very hard.	Wazama kakhulu.
Also very fast.	Kwakhona ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
So, we have to do it.	Ngoko ke, kufuneka senze.
That one, right there.	Lowo, kanye apho.
I think so.	Ndicinga njalo.
But this is not here yet.	Kodwa oku akukho apha okwangoku.
Last night .	Izolo ebusuku .
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka.
I want to be.	Ndifuna ukuba.
This will be very necessary.	Oku kuya kufuneka kakhulu.
That for now.	Oko okwangoku.
That sounds good to me.	Oko kubonakala kulungile kum.
I'm not entirely sure how I did this.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ukuba ndenze njani oku.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze nto.
Sure, you know that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, uyayazi loo nto.
How far away from home.	Kude kangakanani ekhaya .
He didn't know better.	Wayengazi ngcono.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
We will be together again.	Siza kuba kunye kwakhona.
Yes, it should.	Ewe kufuneka kube njalo.
But that's perfectly fine.	Kodwa oko kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
Everyone stayed together.	Wonke umntu wahlala kunye.
.	.
He wants to know everything that happens.	Ufuna ukwazi yonke into eyenzekayo.
But he didn't want to do it with her.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto naye.
Yeah, yeah, it seems.	Ewe, ewe, kubonakala ngathi.
I'm not sure about this.	Andiqinisekanga ngale nto.
It's just one thing.	Yinto nje enye.
He must be able to read.	Ufanele akwazi ukufunda.
But it is hard to tell.	Kodwa kunzima ukuxelela.
Again, that was not necessary.	Kwakhona, oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
It's just better for me.	Kungcono nje kum.
He is not in it.	Akakho kuyo.
This person is not there.	Akakho lo mntu.
I don’t understand why, really.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni, ngokwenene.
He is the only way.	Nguye kuphela indlela.
Or he did not want to.	Okanye wayengafuni.
Certainly not here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo apha.
I've never done it before.	Andizange ndiyenze ngaphambili.
Finally I know why.	Ekugqibeleni ndiyazi ukuba kutheni.
Maybe something bad happened.	Mhlawumbi kukho into embi eyenzekayo.
It did not last long.	Khange ahlale ixesha elide nyani.
Everyone is trying to make money.	Wonke umntu uzama ukufumana imali.
This is definitely me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndim lo.
But here.	Kodwa apha.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
But not so much right now.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu okwangoku.
You just want to succeed.	Ufuna nje ukuphumelela.
It's that simple.	Lula ngaloo ndlela.
You want to succeed.	Ufuna ukuphumelela.
Next week is no better.	Kwiveki ezayo akukho ngcono.
I don't want to go anywhere.	Andifuni kuya ndawo.
But it could also be better.	Kodwa kwakhona kunokuba ngcono.
If not, you probably won't.	Ukuba akunjalo, mhlawumbi akuyi kuba njalo.
What is happening here? 	Kwenzeka ntoni apha?
He seemed to need help with her.	Wayekhangeleka efuna uncedo naye.
I think that's it.	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto.
Not his job.	Hayi umsebenzi wakhe.
This, of course, is not very possible.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
And he agreed.	Uye wavuma.
I could not speak.	Khange ndikwazi ukuthetha.
He wanted to learn more.	Wayefuna ukufunda ngakumbi.
He does things his own way.	Wenza izinto ngendlela yakhe.
I would just like to.	Ndingathanda kuphela.
I know that place.	Ndiyayazi loo ndawo.
Nowhere.	Akakho ndawo.
I'd like to do something about it.	Ndingathanda ukwenza into ngaloo nto.
That happened later, for sure.	Oko kwenzeka kamva, ngokuqinisekileyo.
You do a little bit.	Wenza kancinci.
Not you again.	Hayi wena kwakhona.
But not quite.	Kodwa hayi ngokupheleleyo.
But he did not want to do that.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
Probably the only one.	Mhlawumbi nguye kuphela.
I'm not sure where it is now.	Andazi ncam ukuba iphi ngoku.
If it is.	Ukuba yiyo.
No one knew why, or even if it was true.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kutheni, okanye nokuba yinyani.
He finally did it.	Ekugqibeleni uyenzile.
This is no problem.	Oku akukho ngxaki.
Not only now.	Akunjalo kuphela ngoku.
Definitely a must !!!.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka !!!.
He's a really good man, you know.	Ungumntu olungileyo ngenene, uyazi.
Yes, it is difficult to earn money.	Ewe, kunzima ukufumana imali.
Again, really sorry.	Kwakhona, uxolo ngokwenene.
Or maybe go to her.	Okanye mhlawumbi uye kuye.
But he did not do it.	Kodwa akazange ayenze.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
Well, we know how that happened.	Kulungile, siyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
But also.	Kodwa kwakhona.
But not for long.	Kodwa hayi ixesha elide.
Now or never, then, he thought.	Ngoku okanye zange, ngoko, wacinga.
Help someone out.	Nceda umntu ngaphandle.
I'm really scared, you know.	Ndiyoyika ngokwenene, uyazi.
Me and you, too.	Mna nawe, kwakhona.
I'm not sure though.	Andiqinisekanga kodwa.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
He wanted a dog.	Wayefuna inja.
I will not do that.	Andiyi kuyenza loo nto.
This can only be a good thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto entle kuphela.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
As soon as you like.	Kwangoko uthanda.
He had to do it.	Kwafuneka ayenze.
Here's another one.	Nantso ke enye.
No one told me anything before.	Akukho mntu wandixelela nto ngaphambili.
Or he may have thought that you did.	Okanye wacinga ukuba wenze njalo.
You do not have to decide right away.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze isigqibo ngoko nangoko.
Not you, not here, not now.	Hayi wena, hayi apha, hayi ngoku.
Happy to help.	Ndiyavuya ukunceda.
Now this is something new.	Ngoku le yinto entsha.
Great.	Enkulu.
That sounds good to me.	Oko kubonakala kulungile kum.
I'm scared too.	Nam ndiyoyika.
How are you going to do that? 	Uza kuyenza njani loo nto?
.	.
It seems impossible.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka.
It really will be.	Ngokwenene kuya kuba njalo.
For now.	Okwangoku.
Just because someone is there.	Kuba nje umntu abe khona.
Maybe you, too.	Mhlawumbi nawe, nawe.
I did not think.	Khange ndicinge.
Now, it seems you would like to be alone.	Ngoku, kubonakala ngathi ungathanda ukuba wedwa.
It will have to be okay.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba kulungile.
It should be easy.	Kufuneka kube lula.
That's all.	Yiloo nto nje.
That's exactly right.	Yinyani leyo ngenene.
He sat down and looked.	Wahlala phantsi wajonga.
I knew it would be so.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
But he could not.	Kodwa akazange akwazi.
I was thinking about it.	Bendicinga ngayo.
But that happened later.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka kamva.
We don't have to do all the work, either.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba senze wonke umsebenzi, nathi.
If not.	Ukuba akunjalo.
He knows what he needs to do.	Uyayazi into ekufuneka ayenze.
That is probably true.	Nto leyo mhlawumbi yinyani.
Sure he will now, but he never did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kwenza ngoku, kodwa akazange.
Well, he thought.	Ewe, wacinga.
But somehow, he did not know.	Kodwa ngenye indlela, wayengazi.
That is a new thing.	Yinto entsha leyo.
Everyone wants to succeed.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuphumelela.
What is this.	Yintoni le nto.
He didn't want me to talk about it.	Wayengafuni ndithethe ngayo.
Again, the same thing.	Kwakhona, into enye.
He didn't know what else it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni enye.
Great, too.	Enkulu, nayo.
I just wonder where you are here.	Ndiyazibuza nje ukuba uphi apha.
You better do something about it.	Kungcono wenze into ngayo.
It will be better than nothing.	Kuya kuba ngcono kunokuba akukho nto.
But he did.	Kodwa lowo wenza.
What the hell?.	Yintoni?.
He wanted to go, he told me.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, wandixelela.
Do not pretend to be someone else.	Musa ukwenza ngathi ngenye indlela.
He has sat there, unable to walk.	Uye wahlala apho, akakwazi ukuhamba.
I never thought it would be easy.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba lula.
I thought you probably knew.	Bendicinga ukuba mhlawumbi uyazi.
he said.	uthe.
I did not know how.	Ndandingazi ukuba njani.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
But tell me about it.	Kodwa ndixelele ngayo.
He can do it, too.	Angayenza, naye.
He would come here.	Wayeza kuza apha.
But not if you want to.	Kodwa akunjalo ukuba ufuna.
It seems impossible.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka.
This was not necessary.	Oku kwakungeyomfuneko.
No problem there.	Akukho ngxaki apho.
That is exactly what happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto kanye.
I need to know.	Kufuneka ndikwazi.
He doesn't want her to leave now.	Akafuni ahambe ngoku.
Everyone needs to know this.	Wonke umntu kufuneka akwazi oku.
But it is hard to say.	Kodwa kunzima ukuthetha.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wonke umntu wenza kakuhle.
Maybe that's why you're here.	Mhlawumbi yiloo nto ulapha.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
Because he did everything he wanted to do.	Kuba wenza yonke into ayifunayo.
So what's the problem ?.	Khona yintoni ingxaki?.
But you told me enough.	Kodwa undixelele ngokwaneleyo.
He never had this problem.	Akazange abe nayo le ngxaki.
He can play.	Uyakwazi ukudlala .
We help you.	Siza kuwe .
.	.
I have to do it.	Kufuneka ndiyenze.
I'm afraid.	Ndiyoyika.
Playing now.	Ukudlala ngoku.
Everyone started talking.	Wonke umntu waqalisa ukuthetha.
We know this is not the case.	Siyazi ukuba oku akunjalo.
But there is one problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki enye.
With that, he will do it.	Ngaloo nto, uya kuyenza.
He seems to be always looking for food.	Ubonakala ngathi uhlala efuna ukutya.
You know, then.	Uyazi, ngoko.
Maybe I can do this.	Mhlawumbi ndingayenza le nto.
He's just a man.	Ungumntu nje.
You just have hope.	Unethemba nje.
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
Because, well, it's the same thing.	Kuba, ke, yinto enye.
But that's it.	Kodwa loo nto.
But here we are both.	Kodwa apha sobabini.
Maybe he really did.	Mhlawumbi wenza ngokwenene.
He did not stay.	Zange ahlale.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo.
He will say anything.	Uya kuthetha nantoni na.
You just love it.	Uyayithanda nje.
Food is very difficult.	Ukutya kunzima kakhulu.
Yes, this will do well.	Ewe, oku kuya kwenza kakuhle.
If you go.	Ukuba uya .
I'm sure of it.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo.
He is not going anywhere.	Akayi ndawo.
New problem.	Ingxaki entsha.
I know you did.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyenzile.
He did not stop speaking.	Akazange ayeke ukuthetha.
It's true, that way.	Yinyani, ngaloo ndlela.
Everyone knew something.	Wonke umntu wayesazi into.
I have never done that before.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto ngaphambili.
I think it will happen for a long time.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka ixesha elide.
I want to see what you think.	Ndifuna ukubona ukuba ucinga ntoni.
I'm so glad to have you here.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuba nawe apha.
He will stay with me now.	Uza kuhlala nam ngoku.
She loves the way he made you feel.	Uyayithanda indlela akwenze waziva ngayo.
We need to do it regularly.	Kufuneka siyenze rhoqo.
But not for him.	Kodwa hayi kuye.
No one speaks.	Akukho mntu uthetha.
I have to think of something else.	Kufuneka ndicinge ngenye into.
I want to talk to her now.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye ngoku.
It's completely over.	Kwaphela ngokupheleleyo.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
He didn't think he would be far away for long.	Wayengacingi ukuba uza kuba kude ixesha elide.
It's a really good thing.	Yinto entle ngokwenene.
But that seems possible.	Kodwa oko kubonakala kunokwenzeka.
It is unlikely that this will happen.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba yenzeke.
But, he had to leave.	Kodwa, kwafuneka ahambe.
One day, maybe.	Ngenye imini, mhlawumbi.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele.
This will go a long way.	Oku kuya kude kakhulu.
Very, very quickly.	Kakhulu, ngokukhawuleza.
I can do it quickly.	Ndingayenza ngokukhawuleza.
But not here, not now.	Kodwa hayi apha, hayi ngoku.
One you probably know, one maybe not.	Enye mhlawumbi uyazi, enye mhlawumbi hayi.
He has to do it regularly.	Kufuneka ayenze rhoqo.
I hope so.	Ndiyathemba loo nto.
You don't want to do too many things.	Awufuni ukwenza izinto ezininzi.
He looks very bad.	Ukhangeleka embi kakhulu.
Maybe he wanted to eat.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna ukutya.
I didn't want to do it either.	Nam ndandingafuni ukwenza.
No it isn't.	Hayi akunjalo.
I know how bad that is.	Ndiyazi indlela embi ngayo loo nto.
I did not know.	Bendingazi.
I'm trying to find another job.	Ndizama ukufumana omnye umsebenzi.
It just has to.	Kufuneka nje.
It is clear that you are here for him.	Kucacile ukuba ulapha kuye.
But he did not succeed.	Kodwa akazange aphumelele.
Maybe better.	Mhlawumbi ngcono.
I didn't do it yesterday.	Khange ndiyenze izolo.
She is happy.	Uyavuya.
He has to think.	Kufuneka acinge.
At this point.	Kule ndawo.
Now he also knew.	Ngoku naye wayesazi.
Very much this.	Kakhulu oku.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Don't do too much, too fast.	Musa ukwenza kakhulu, ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
Well, tell me it isn't.	Ke, ndixelele ukuba akunjalo.
He looked up quickly.	Wajonga ngokukhawuleza.
I don't want you to tell anyone.	Andifuni uxelele mntu.
You can be, too.	Unokuba njalo, nawe.
You will not want that to happen.	Awuyi kufuna ukuba oko kwenzeke.
She is not.	Akakho.
It does not have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
I am glad.	Ndiyavuya.

I want you to know this.	Ndifuna uyazi lento.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
.	.
Tell me how this happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke njani oku.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke le nto.
I want no problem here.	Andifuni ngxaki apha.
No problem, obviously.	Akukho ngxaki, ngokucacileyo.
Maybe now is the time.	Mhlawumbi ngoku lixesha.
Really, there is no problem.	Ngokwenene, akukho ngxaki enye.

Nobody wants that.	Akukho mntu ufuna loo nto.
But it will happen now.	Kodwa kuya kwenzeka ngoku.

We need to know.	Kufuneka siyazi.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
I would very much like someone to do that.	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukuba umntu enze loo nto.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga kangako.
Something about you.	Into ngawe.
He said yes, he did.	Wathi ewe, uyenzile.
He really didn't know.	Ngenene wayengazi.
I'm happy too.	Ndiyavuya nam.
There, always.	Kukho, rhoqo.
You will have to do one or the other.	Kuya kufuneka wenze enye okanye enye.
There is no one way.	Akukho ndlela enye.
I don't want too much.	Andifuni kakhulu.
You are here.	Ulapha.

Very much.	Kakhulu kakhulu.
No problem at all.	Akukho ngxaki kwaphela.
He did not speak.	Akazange athethe.
Well, not everything.	Ewe, hayi yonke into.
He wanted her to stay.	Wayefuna ukuba ahlale.
Whether he wanted to or not.	Nokuba wayefuna okanye akafuni.
I think I am really with you.	Ndicinga ukuba ndim nawe ngokwenene.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
He told me he wanted money.	Wandixelela ukuba ufuna imali.
Maybe you don't want to talk.	Mhlawumbi awufuni kuthetha.
He loves everyone.	Uthanda wonke umntu.
I want it to be my thing.	Ndifuna ukuba yinto yam.
But he did not do that.	Kodwa akazange ayenze loo nto.
Maybe you did too.	Mhlawumbi nawe wenze njalo.
He wanted it to happen.	Wayefuna ukuba kwenzeke.
Surely that is possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko kunokwenzeka.
You only have to do one.	Kufuneka wenze enye kuphela.
A very good person.	Umntu olungileyo kakhulu.
He is happy too.	Naye uyavuya.
Lots of coffee.	Ikofu eninzi.

Now we come to it.	Ngoku siza kuyo.
One too much.	Enye eninzi kakhulu.
But really.	Kodwa ngokwenene.
I did not go.	Andizange ndiye.
Now it's much better.	Ngoku kungcono kakhulu.
He knew immediately who he was.	Wayesazi ngoko nangoko ukuba ngubani.
I have known this for a long time.	Kudala ndiyazi le nto.
Obviously very quickly.	Ngokucacileyo ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.

We will definitely do that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kuyenza loo nto.
I had no idea what he wanted.	Ndandingazi ukuba ufuna ntoni.
Man, and so on.	Umntu, njalo njalo.
Nobody lives there now.	Akukho mntu uhlala apho ngoku.
Maybe he wanted it too fast.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna kakhulu ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
You want money with it.	Ufuna imali ngayo.

So it seems to us.	Ngoko kubonakala ngathi.
That's the place.	Nantso indawo.

He didn't, either.	Akazange, naye.
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.
he thought.	wacinga.
The man did not think straight.	Umntu khange acinge kakuhle.
Or it could be very bad.	Okanye kunokwenzeka kakhulu ngendlela embi.
It should be easy to do.	Kufuneka kube lula ukwenza.
More, more, more.	Ngakumbi, ngakumbi, ngakumbi.
But, what.	Kodwa, yintoni na.
I would like to see that.	Ndingathanda ukubona oko.
To me, you are telling the truth.	Kum, uthetha inyani.
Until tomorrow for sure.	Kude kube ngomso ngokuqinisekileyo.
But this is not entirely possible.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
No, please no.	Hayi, ndicela hayi.
Soon, he thought.	Kungekudala, wacinga.
No, not at all.	Akunjalo, kwaphela.
Don't do something big.	Musa ukwenza into enkulu.
He wanted to do it.	Wayefuna ukuyenza.
I never thought about it before.	Andizange ndicinge ngayo ngaphambili.
But he did not succeed.	Kodwa akazange aphumelele.
Anyone can do this.	Nabani na angayenza le nto.
Really, it is impossible.	Ngokwenene, akunakwenzeka.
You do not have to decide right away.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze isigqibo ngoko nangoko.
But then again.	Kodwa ke kwakhona.
We will do that now.	Siza kuyenza loo nto ngoku.
This happened to me.	Oku kwenzeka kum.
.	.
Maybe that's true.	Mhlawumbi yinyani leyo.
That is much better.	Oko kungcono kakhulu.
This is clearly not the case.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
I hope you feel better soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ngcono kungekudala.
But for me.	Kodwa kum.
Every morning.	Rhoqo kusasa.
He lives here.	Uhlala apha.
Everything in the end.	Yonke into ekugqibeleni.
You know how that happened.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
But that will not last.	Kodwa oko akuyi kuhlala.

He said he wanted his place.	Wathi ufuna indawo yakhe.
So he can't walk.	Ngoko akakwazi ukuhamba.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
I wonder why?.	Ingaba kutheni?.
Not far away.	Akukho kude.
He did not do it alone.	Akazange ayenze yedwa.
I'm not sure if it's a good thing.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yinto entle na.
I want to go with you.	Ndifuna ukuhamba nawe.
He lives with us here.	Uhlala nathi apha.
Something else happened.	Kukho enye into eyenzekayo.
No, that's fine.	Hayi, kulungile.
Certainly more so today.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ngakumbi namhlanje.
But that certainly does not have to be.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
But he didn't know much.	Kodwa wayengazi kangako.
I don't think this will happen anytime soon.	Andiqondi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka kungekudala.
Well, nothing.	Ewe, akukho nto.
I told her, no.	Ndamxelela, hayi.
That is why he was not at home.	Yiyo loo nto wayengekho ekhaya.
I do not know.	Andazi.
I think very yes.	Ndicinga kakhulu ewe.
How to do it.	Indlela yokwenza.
As together.	Njengoko kunye.
This seems very difficult.	Oku kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
And then! 	Ke ngoku!
I want to be in this.	Ndifuna ukuba kule.
Slightly hard to find.	Kancinci kunzima ukufumana.
I do not want to read.	Andifuni ukufunda.
I think that's really it.	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto ngokwenene.
We'll talk about that again later.	Siza kuthetha ngayo kwakhona kamva.
It seems like one way or another.	Kubonakala ngathi enye indlela enye.
I could not.	Andizange ndikwazi.
He said, all right.	Wathi, kulungile.
Everyone knows about it, everyone.	Wonke umntu uyazi ngayo, wonke umntu.
But we know that this is not the case.	Kodwa siyazi ukuba oku akunjalo.
He will have to think about it.	Kuya kufuneka acinge ngayo.
It's just a bad thing.	Yinto embi nje.
No one talks too much.	Akukho mntu uthetha kakhulu.
I was thinking about it.	Bendicinga ngayo.
But it looks the other way.	Kodwa kubonakala ngenye indlela.
At present it is not.	Okwangoku akunjalo.
Because if you do.	Kuba ukuba wenza.

Tell me why again.	Ndixelele ukuba kutheni kwakhona.
He really wants to help.	Ufuna ngokwenene ukunceda.
He asked for time.	Wabuza ixesha.
Nobody is going to do that.	Akukho mntu uya kuyenza loo nto.

You are not going either.	Nawe awuyi.
.	.
It's out there though.	Kukho ngaphandle kodwa.
He also did not.	Naye akazange.
Talking is good.	Ukuthetha kulungile.
Maybe for you.	Mhlawumbi kuwe.
Not the way.	Hayi indlela.
Well, not just that.	Ewe, akunjalo nje.
Soon though.	Kungekudala kodwa.

You won't do it.	Awuyi kuyenza.
He really wanted to know.	Wayefuna ngokwenene ukwazi.
But with us.	Kodwa kunye nathi.
Everything and everything.	Yonke into nayo yonke into.
It will happen but slowly.	Kuya kwenzeka kodwa kancinci.
That's just one thing.	Oko kanye kuphela.
I'm thinking of leaving.	Ndicinga ukuhamba.
Just, really immediately.	Nje, ngenene kwangoko.
I told her, no.	Ndamxelela, akukho.
That will be very visible.	Oko kuya kubonakala kakhulu.
I never did, you know.	Andizange ndiyenze, uyazi.
that's it.	yiyo leyo.
I think you know.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi.
It is difficult or impossible.	Kunzima ke okanye nokuba.

You need to know that.	Kufuneka uyazi loo nto.
Really, really.	Ngokwenene, ngokwenene.
This is exactly what he did.	Lo wenza kanye loo nto.
It's been a long time.	Kudala ixesha elide.
Bad place.	Indawo embi.
He did not want to be alone.	Wayengafuni ukuba yedwa.
One will speak at the end.	Umntu uya kuthetha ekugqibeleni.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
There is nothing here for you.	Akukho nto apha kuwe.
Musa, Musa, Musa.	Musa, musa, musa.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
One day, maybe, but not now.	Ngenye imini, mhlawumbi, kodwa hayi ngoku.
I would love to have it.	Ndingathanda ukuba nayo.
He tried to speak.	Wazama ukuthetha.

Or not to me.	Okanye hayi kum.
Or anything else.	Okanye nantoni na enye.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
Because what, it's hard to say.	Kuba yintoni na, kunzima ukuthetha.
I thought this was impossible.	Ndandicinga ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze nto.
Someone there.	Umntu apho.
Maybe not with him, not yet.	Mhlawumbi hayi naye, hayi okwangoku.
I can't do better.	Andikwazi ukwenza ngcono.

Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
He did that.	Uyenzile loo nto.
But there is definitely no one there.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akukho mntu apho.
Or not at all.	Okanye hayi kwaphela.
Don't play.	Musa ukudlala.
He'll have to think about that.	Kuya kufuneka acinge ngaloo nto.

One day later.	Ngenye imini kamva.

Probably, he said at last.	Mhlawumbi, wathi ekugqibeleni.
He looks bad.	Ukhangeleka kakubi.
Tell me, tell me.	Ndixelele, ndixelele.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
This is for me.	Oku kum.

Or he may have thought that he did.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba wenze njalo.
Or not alone.	Okanye hayi wedwa.

He was gone for a long time.	Wayengekho ixesha elide.
Yes, very much so.	Ewe, kakhulu.

Well, that is much better.	Ewe, oko kungcono kakhulu.
That's why you're here.	Yiyo loo nto ulapha.
Going to it.	Ukuya kuyo.
There is no one here for this.	Akukho mntu apha kule nto.
This means that there is another.	Oku kuthetha ukuba kukho enye.

Is there any work here.	Ngaba kukho umsebenzi apha.
I didn't want to do that.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
It's even harder now.	Kunzima ngakumbi ngoku.
But you are only one person.	Kodwa ungumntu omnye kuphela.
But this is not possible.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka.
He looked at her, he looked at her.	Wajonga kuye, wajonga kuye.
He will have to do so.	Kuya kufuneka enze njalo.
This will be the case.	Oku kuya kuba njalo.
It should have been far enough.	Bekufanele ukuba kude ngokwaneleyo.
I did not want to be alone.	Ndandingafuni ukuba ndedwa.
Yes I am.	Ewe, ndim.
So you certainly do not want too much.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo awufuni kakhulu.
He's not going to me.	Akayi kum.
Someone else will have to do it.	Omnye umntu kuya kufuneka ayenze.
Or one, or the other.	Okanye enye, okanye enye.
He loves money but not work.	Uthanda imali kodwa hayi umsebenzi.
Whatever it is, it's time.	Nokuba yintoni na, lixesha.

You will have to tell.	Kuya kufuneka uxelele.
So he must have asked.	Ngoko umele ukuba wabuza.
I think he knew.	Ndicinga ukuba wayesazi.
But he did not know what would happen next.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni ngoku.
But it is very true.	Kodwa yinyani kakhulu.
All the way.	Yonke indlela.
I go to him.	Ndiya kuye.
You like it here.	Uyayithanda apha.
But it is impossible.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka.

He looked at me.	Uye wajonga kum.
I do not want this to happen.	Andifuni ukuba kwenzeke oku.
That's him.	Nguye ke lowo.
But that would be a good thing.	Kodwa oko kunokuba yinto entle.
There he was.	Apho waba khona .
Yes, it is.	Ewe, yinyani.
Not because you want to succeed.	Hayi kuba ufuna ukuphumelela.
But he sat down.	Kodwa wahlala phantsi.
No sooner.	Hayi kwangoko.
Not to him.	Hayi kuye.
You like this place.	Uyayithanda le ndawo.
He never talked to us about it.	Zange athethe nathi ngayo.
He just knew.	Wayesazi nje.
Nobody goes there.	Akukho mntu uya apho.
He felt like leaving.	Waziva efuna ukuhamba.
I hope not.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
But he had to make a decision.	Kodwa kwafuneka enze isigqibo.
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi.
One day he did.	Ngenye imini wenza.
Why, he didn't know.	Kutheni, wayengazi.
He has done this now.	Uyenzile lento ngoku.
So this will only be one thing.	Ngoko oku kuya kuba yinto enye kuphela.
But we all know he won't do it.	Kodwa sonke siyazi ukuba akayi kuyenza.
Or anyone else for that.	Okanye nabani na ngaloo nto.
Not just me, too.	Hayi mna kuphela, naye.
He said he did not know.	Wathi akazi.
I think you know that.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi loo nto.
I told her all this.	Ndamxelela yonke lento.
But he was also thinking.	Kodwa naye wayecinga.
Yeah, it's hard.	Ewe, kunzima.
No, that's true.	Hayi, yinyani leyo.
It will not be easy.	Akuyi kuba lula.
I do not know.	Andazi.
I did it very well this morning.	Ndiyenze ngendlela kakhulu ngale ntsasa.
He thought.	Wayecinga.
He didn't want to do that.	Wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
We need to do this.	Kufuneka siyenze le nto.
I know right away what it is.	Ndiyazi ngoko nangoko ukuba yintoni na.
One, and one and the same.	Enye, kunye kunye.
This has been a good thing.	Oku kube yinto entle.
He admitted that he did not.	Wavuma ukuba akazange.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wenza loo nto.
I'm glad you're here.	Ndiyavuya ukuba ulapha.
John, suddenly.	UJohn, ngokukhawuleza.
You did the right thing.	Wenze into elungileyo.
You like this thing.	Uyayithanda le nto.
I think this is good.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kulungile.
He had to go now.	Kwafuneka ahambe ngoku.
He doesn't want to do that.	Akafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wenze oko.
I'm not sure what time it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ngubani ixesha.
He did what he wanted to do.	Wenza into ayifunayo.
Not well, that's fine.	Hayi kakuhle, kulungile.
Also outside.	Kwakhona ngaphandle.
It's time again.	Lixesha kwakhona.
He was not there either.	Naye wayengekho.
That will make everything difficult.	Oko kuya kuyenza nzima yonke into.
This is obvious.	Oku kucacile.
We'll talk.	Siza kuthetha.
Of course, certainly not.	Ngokwenene, ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
We will go everywhere together.	Siza kuya kuyo yonke indawo kunye.
Good or bad.	Into entle okanye embi kakhulu.
Improvement.	Ukwenza ngcono.
He said yes, in the end.	Wathi ewe, ekugqibeleni.
This is you.	Nguwe lo.
I want to win.	Ndifuna ukuphumelela.
Obviously, he knows nothing about this.	Ngokucacileyo, akazi nto ngale nto.
Definitely my book.	Ngokuqinisekileyo incwadi yam.
But it is very possible.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
You want to succeed right away.	Ufuna ukuphumelela ngoko nangoko.
He started talking.	Waqalisa ukuthetha.
Is that it.	Ngaba oko .
It is very difficult there.	Kunzima kakhulu apho.
I can't do it tomorrow.	Andikwazi ukwenza ngomso.
It just seems that way.	Kubonakala ngaloo ndlela kuphela.
But no one outside knows about it.	Kodwa akukho mntu ngaphandle uyazi ngayo.
I think of you all the time.	Ndicinga ngawe rhoqo.
He knew he knew.	Wayesazi ukuba wayesazi.
To be with you.	Ukuba nawe.
That is even more true here.	Leyo yinyani ngakumbi apha.
He likes to walk alone a little bit.	Uthanda ukuhamba eyedwa kancinci.
That seems to be the case.	Kubonakala ngathi yiloo nto.
But not just another one.	Kodwa hayi nje enye.
It will mean talking.	Kuya kuthetha ukuthetha.
He stayed with me, too.	Wahlala nam, naye.
So, sorry.	Ngoko, uxolo.
You did really well.	Wenze kakuhle ngokwenene.
He asked for help.	Wacela uncedo.
Great way.	Indlela enkulu.
I don't really know.	Andikwazi ngokwenene.
Yeah, that's all.	Ewe, yiyo yonke le nto.
But then again, much more.	Kodwa kwakhona, kakhulu ngakumbi.
Not at all.	Akunjalo kwaphela.
Or anything else.	Okanye nantoni na enye.
So maybe we can talk to him.	Ngoko mhlawumbi siza kuthetha naye.
It will be better to stay longer.	Kuya kuba ngcono ukuhlala ixesha elide.
Really, it will be better.	Ngenene, kuya kuba ngcono.
He just wanted to see.	Wayefuna nje ukubona.
You do not really want to do that.	Awufuni ngokwenene ukwenza loo nto.
I just know what it is now.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba yintoni ngoku.
Really bad place !.	Indawo embi nyani!.
Only that will not be the case.	Kuphela oko akuyi kuba njalo.
Or one or the other.	Okanye enye okanye enye.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But now.	Kodwa ngoku.
But to him.	Kodwa kuye.
But he wanted to know.	Kodwa wayefuna ukwazi.
Here I am.	Ndim apha.
If there is no other way.	Ukuba akukho enye indlela.
This is possible, but not impossible.	Oku kunokwenzeka, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
He will not get better.	Akayi kuba ngcono.
But he too failed.	Kodwa naye akazange aphumelele.
It seems impossible.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka.
I try to stay.	Ndizama ukuhlala.
But this is not possible.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka.
he thought.	wacinga.
Yeah, okay, okay.	Ewe, kulungile, kulungile.
I'm really glad to be here.	Ndiyavuya ngokwenene ukuba lapha.
I don't know how that happened.	Andazi ukuba yenzeke njani loo nto.
I said nothing.	Andizange ndithethe nto.
Maybe you did.	Mhlawumbi uyenzile.
He would be human again.	Wayeza kuba ngumntu kwakhona.
All of this happened very quickly.	Yonke le nto yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
So, that's really good.	Ngoko, oko kulungile ngenene.
I will stay on this.	Ndiza kuhlala kule nto.
There seems to be no one at home.	Kubonakala ukuba akukho mntu ekhaya.
But no.	Kodwa akukho.
Yes, but it's okay.	Ewe, kodwa kulungile.
You too.	Nawe.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa oko akunjalo ngokwenene.
It just had to.	Kwafuneka nje.
Or about you.	Okanye ngawe.
It's time to.	Lixesha lokuba .
You will be able to talk to anyone.	Uya kukwazi ukuthetha nabani na.
As much as you like.	Kakhulu njengoko uthanda.
But not exactly.	Kodwa hayi ncam.
I told him no.	Ndamxelela ukuba hayi.
He wanted to know everything.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngayo yonke into.
It's so much better.	Kungcono kakhulu.
No, not another.	Hayi, hayi enye.
Of course not, either.	Akunjalo, okanye.
He didn't want to be with her.	Wayengafuni ukuba naye.
Is true.	Yinyani.
You know, dog.	Uyazi, inja.
But you know the whole thing.	Kodwa uyazi yonke loo nto.
Not a bad thing.	Hayi into embi.
You know what you need to do.	Uyayazi into ekufuneka uyenzile.
But clearly, something happened.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo, kukho into eyenzekayo.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto ngokwenene.
It's hard to walk.	Kunzima ukuhamba.
Really, you should.	Ngokwenene, ufanele.
I think a lot of all this.	Ndicinga kakhulu ngayo yonke le nto.
He would do nothing.	Wayeza kwenza nto.
Because that's the thing.	Kuba nantso into.
That is what happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto.
I did not speak to him.	Andizange ndithethe naye.
I don't know how I can do that.	Andazi ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
No it isn't.	Hayi akunjalo.
Tell me this.	Ndixelele oku.
As required.	Njengoko kufuneka.
I thought you were.	Bendicinga ukuba wena .
But there is far more to it than that.	Kodwa kukho kude ngakumbi ukuba akunjalo.
I never thought of anything else.	Andizange ndicinge enye into.
Just going.	Ukuya nje.
But, now, he was not.	Kodwa, ngoku, wayengekho.
I'm glad to know that.	Ndiyavuya ukwazi oko.
He makes it harder than it should be.	Wenza kube nzima kunokuba kufuneka.
I do not know how long it lasted.	Andazi ukuba kudala kangakanani.
He knew he would never leave now.	Wayesazi ukuba akanakuze ahambe ngoku.
Not just as we know it.	Akunjalo nje njengoko siyazi.
He will stay with me.	Uza kuhlala nam.
That is good for me.	Oko kulungile kum.
He told me once.	Undixelele kanye.
I never knew this.	Andizange ndiyazi le nto.
You know what that is.	Uyayazi ukuba yintoni na loo nto.
We know that is not the case.	Siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
You must be here today.	Kufuneka ube lapha namhlanje.
He asked why.	Wabuza ukuba kutheni.
He can speak.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha.
I hope no one will.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akukho mntu uza kwenza njalo.
It does not appear to exist.	Kubonakala ngathi akakho.
Did he agree.	Ngaba wavuma .
That's a good thing.	Yinto elungileyo.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo apha.
This will be easy.	Oku kuya kuba lula.
He knew where he had to go.	Wayesazi apho kufuneka aye khona.
Tell me more about it.	Ndixelele ngakumbi ngayo.
I can't say one thing right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha enye into ngoku.
So he did.	Ngoko uyenzile.
But not money.	Kodwa hayi imali.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.
I need to know how that happened.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oko.
You are not going either.	Nawe awuyi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But, but.	Kodwa, kodwa.
or.	okanye.
He did not know why now.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni ngoku.
This is true.	Le yinyani.
It seems too old.	Kubonakala kudala kakhulu.
I will be here.	Ndiza kuba apha.
Yes he knew.	Ewe wayesazi.
He would speak only to us.	Wayeza kuthetha nathi kuphela.
Or just the other day.	Okanye nje ngenye imini.
I don't want to do that again.	Andifuni kuphinda ndiyenze loo nto.
He didn't know what exactly that was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye leyo.
I did this for myself.	Ndenze oku kum.
He was not alone.	Akazange abe yedwa.
He did it perfectly.	Wenza ngokupheleleyo.
No, that one.	Hayi, lowo.
He did not want to go with her.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba naye.
you say.	uthi.
I'm just trying to help.	Ndizama ukunceda kuphela.
But he is not going.	Kodwa akayi.
If that is possible.	Ukuba oko kunokwenzeka.
It's all yours.	Nguwe wonke.
Or maybe the other way around.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngenye indlela.
He wants everything.	Ufuna yonke into.
He did not know anyone there.	Wayengazi mntu apho.
He wanted a job.	Wayefuna umsebenzi.
Well, he better be.	Kulungile, kungcono abe.
I would like very much.	Ndingathanda kakhulu.
He told me everything.	Undixelele yonke into.
But you really don't want to, you know.	Kodwa ngokwenene awufuni, uyazi.
Now we know that to be true.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba yinyani leyo.
I think that's a very bad thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto embi kakhulu.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
I just knew.	Ndandisazi nje.
Every morning.	Njalo kusasa.
I've been thinking about this for a long time.	Kudala ndicinga lento.
He did something very bad to you.	Wenza into embi kakhulu kuwe.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
Or is it.	Okanye ngaba.
Great place.	Indawo enkulu.
I don't know where it is now.	Andazi ukuba iphi ngoku.
Maybe not, but maybe not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo, kodwa mhlawumbi.
Only he was not there.	Kuphela wayengekho.
I do not know.	Andazi.
He is.	Nguye.
Anything but nothing.	Nantoni na kodwa akukho nto.
You know it well.	Wazi kakuhle.
But you already know this.	Kodwa sele uyazi oku.
You mean something.	Uthetha into.
I do not want her to leave.	Andifuni ahambe.
He will live again.	Uya kuhlala kwakhona.
He did not know what his problem was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki yakhe.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
He looked at the book.	Wajonga incwadi.
He didn't want to be in it.	Wayengafuni ukuba kuyo.
I know he won't.	Ndiyazi ukuba akayi.
He never said that to me.	Khange athethe lonto kum.
Or tell someone else about it.	Okanye uxelele omnye umntu ngayo.
Not everyone.	Hayi ngumntu wonke.
This is good.	Oku Kulungile.
If you want.	Ukuba uyafuna.
But not immediately.	Kodwa hayi ngoko nangoko.
I'm just.	Ndim nje.
I can't go.	Andikwazi ukuya.
Very, probably.	Kakhulu, mhlawumbi.
Another great thing to do.	Enye into enkulu yokwenza.
Not too much to go with.	Akukho kakhulu ukuhamba nayo.
It's hard to walk.	Kunzima ukuhamba.
Certainly not.	Ngokwenene akunjalo.
Well, that's my new thing.	Ke, yinto yam entsha leyo.
I'm not sure that's true.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yinyani leyo.
He agreed to stay.	Wavuma ukuhlala.
This is difficult, but not impossible.	Oku kunzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
No, it does not have to be this way.	Hayi, akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
No one knows anything.	Akukho mntu wazi nto.
Now it is not.	Ngoku akunjalo.
.	.
Well, this is not the case.	Ewe, oku akunjalo.
Well, not now.	Ewe, hayi ngoku.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wenza loo nto.
He didn't, you know.	Akazange, uyazi.
He had to leave immediately.	Kwafuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
He would like that to happen.	Angathanda ukuba oko kwenzeke.
If not, no.	Ukuba akunjalo, hayi.
I just knew.	Ndandisazi nje.
It is very true.	Yinyani kakhulu.
I'm trying to find one.	Ndizama ukufumana enye.
He never really talked to me.	Khange athethe nam nyani.
He lives here a long time.	Uhlala ixesha elide apha.
No problem tonight.	Akukho ngxaki ngokuhlwanje.
Not only that.	Akunjalo kuphela.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
Probably not at all.	Mhlawumbi akunakwenzeka kwaphela.
Tell me everything.	Ndixelele yonke into.
He definitely has to go.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka ahambe.
I feel bad.	Ndiziva kakubi.
I don't know how he did it.	Andazi ukuba wenze njani.
But is that true ?.	Kodwa yinyani leyo?.
He wanted to know what was happening.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
It will get better.	Kuya kuba ngcono.
But, there was no need for him to do so.	Kodwa, kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
I never told her.	Zange ndimxelele.
You have to make a decision.	Kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacinga.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu.
No one knows for sure.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He did it alone.	Wakwenza oko eyedwa.
He tried to get help.	Wazama ukufumana uncedo.
Not now or not.	Hayi ngoku okanye hayi.
I thought you needed help or something.	Bendicinga ukuba ufuna uncedo okanye enye into.
Mostly, he knew, but still.	Kakhulu, wayesazi, kodwa nangoko.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ngokwenene.
You know enough.	Uyazi ngokwaneleyo.
He said he did.	Wathi wenze njalo.
Long time no see.	Kudala ndikwazi.
But now he sat down and thought.	Kodwa ngoku wahlala phantsi wacinga.
To travel.	Ukuhamba.
Please, he thought.	Nceda, wacinga.
But he did not want to leave immediately.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
It is not easy to get a job.	Akukho lula ukufumana umsebenzi.
You are here.	Ulapha.
That's a good player.	Ngumdlali olungileyo lowo.
This is true.	Le yinyani.
That is definitely possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngokuqinisekileyo.
I don't want to see more.	Andifuni ukubona ngakumbi.
He thought it was time.	Wayecinga ukuba lixesha.
What is here.	Yintoni na apha.
Obviously, it is not.	Ngokucacileyo, akunjalo.
It happens to be my place, too.	Kwenzeka ukuba indawo yam, kakhulu.
I'd like to just.	Ndingathanda ukuba nje.
I don't think you have to do that.	Andiqondi ukuba kufuneka uyenze loo nto.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
I can't walk right away.	Andikwazi ukuhamba kwangoko.
In all money.	Kuyo yonke imali.
You feel when you want or want.	Uziva xa ufuna okanye ufuna.
Maybe he wanted to help.	Mhlawumbi wayefuna ukunceda.
This way I will do it.	Ngale ndlela ndiza kuyenza.
He wanted to be there.	Wayefuna ukuba khona.
He told me what he wanted to do.	Wandixelela into afuna ukuyenza.
I never thought of it, you know.	Khange ndicinge nto ngayo, uyazi.
It's the same thing.	Yinto enye.
I need to know about this.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ngale nto.
.	.
He was nowhere.	Wayengekho ndawo.
I will definitely do it again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza kwakhona.
Maybe that's you.	Mhlawumbi nguwe lowo.
I hope it is good for you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kulungile kuwe.
This is true.	Le yinyani.
Suddenly, he realized.	Kwangoko, waqonda.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona.
Tell me again how it happened.	Ndixelele kwakhona ukuba kwenzeke njani.
.	.
You definitely want a place.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufuna indawo.
It would be easy enough, he thought.	Kuya kuba lula ngokwaneleyo, wayecinga.
I know he is.	Ndiyazi ukuba nguye.
Success.	Ukuphumelela.
If so.	Ukuba ngoko .
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
He did not want a car.	Akazange afune imoto.
Just too much.	Kakhulu nje.
Where.	Kule .
But, it should.	Kodwa, kufuneka.
Me and you and him.	Mna nawe kunye naye.
That's yours.	Yinto yakho leyo.
Or he wanted to.	Okanye wayefuna.
Yes that's right.	Ewe, oko kulungile.
You may like that.	Ungathanda oko.
I thought not.	Ndandicinga ukuba akunjalo.
Yes, it is absolutely impossible.	Ewe, akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
You are not going anywhere.	Awuyi ndawo.
He tried to stay but could not.	Wazama ukuhlala kodwa akakwazi.
I'm happy for you.	Ndiyavuya ngawe.
I will definitely do it again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza kwakhona.
At the moment he did not know how long he would come.	Okwangoku wayengazi ukuba uza kude kube nini.
But, it seems okay.	Kodwa, kubonakala kulungile.
What will happen to you.	Kuya kwenzeka ntoni kuwe.
He too did not want to see anything.	Naye wayengafuni ukubona nto.
Even more so.	Ngakumbi .
Probably more difficult.	Mhlawumbi nzima ngakumbi.
That seems obvious to me.	Oko kubonakala kucacile kum.
You have to be, too.	Ufanele ukuba njalo, nawe.
I think he knew.	Ndicinga ukuba wayesazi.
This means a little bit.	Oku kuthetha kancinci.
Now she loves it.	Ngoku uyayithanda.
Anything else.	Enye into.
No, we certainly need to do that.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
You have to have it.	Kufuneka ube nayo.
I can do that at home.	Ndingayenza lonto ekhaya.
No, that's fine.	Hayi, kulungile.
Bad.	Embi.
It does not have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba.
We'll talk to you soon.	Siza kuthetha nawe kungekudala.
I thought though.	Bendicinga kodwa.
Or whatever.	Okanye nokuba yintoni na.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
It will not be so.	Akuyi kuba njalo.
He stayed with her.	Wahlala nayo.
I don't know more.	Andazi ngakumbi.
It's really hard.	Kuba nzima ngokwenene.
He did much better.	Wenza ngcono kakhulu.
Probably throughout the house.	Mhlawumbi kuyo yonke indlu.
She tries to talk to him all day.	Uzama ukuthetha nayo imini yonke.
Simply put.	Ukuthetha nje.
You may have done this.	Usenokuba uyenzile le nto.
Maybe you would like to go.	Mhlawumbi ungathanda ukuya.
No it isn't.	Hayi akunjalo.
He has done so.	Uye wenza njalo.
I can't speak enough.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo.
Obviously, this is not necessary.	Ngokucacileyo, oku akuyomfuneko.
Or maybe.	Okanye mhlawumbi .
But he is here.	Kodwa ulapha.
I did not want her to be alone.	Ndandingafuni abe yedwa.
Not yet .	Hayi ngoku .
Nothing much.	Akukho nto ingako.
Where would he go? 	Wayeza kuya phi?
You will get better at it.	Uya kuba ngcono kuyo.
It's just this.	Yinto nje le.
But he will not do that.	Kodwa akayi kuyenza loo nto.
This will last.	Oku kuya kuhlala.
he cannot stay long.	akakwazi kuhlala ixesha elide.
A long time ago, now.	Kudala kakhulu, ngoku.
Maybe just bad.	Mhlawumbi embi nje.
I want to know.	Ndifuna ukwazi.
I just want to see what happens.	Ndifuna nje ukubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
You understood last night.	Uye waqonda phezolo.
I can do it, too.	Ndingayenza, nam.
One day you may know.	Ngenye imini usenokuba uyazi.
This one you can have.	Le unokuba nayo.
But in the end it is true.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni yinyani.
All right.	Kulungile.
As you will do.	Njengoko uya kwenza wena.
I know my place.	Ndiyayazi indawo yam.
He stayed away.	Wahlala kude.
Of course no one is there.	Ewe akukho mntu apho.
I want to know.	Ndifuna ukwazi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
If that's okay with you.	Ukuba oko kulungile nawe.
But it is not, really.	Kodwa akunjalo, ngokwenene.
Most of the time the food is good.	Ixesha elininzi ukutya kulungile.
Well, there is a problem.	Kulungile, kukho ingxaki.
It is possible.	Kunokwenzeka.
That's right then.	Yinyani ke ngoko.
Now this is the thing.	Ngoku le yinto.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
But clearly not.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
He won't have it.	Akayi kuba nayo.
I feel better.	Ndiziva ngcono.
He is not far off.	Akakho kude.
He looked at her and looked at her.	Wajonga wajonga wajonga.
I know this now.	Ndiyayazi le nto ngoku.
Not so for me.	Akunjalo kum.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
He never thought of anything else.	Akazange acinge ngayo enye into.
You know it too.	Uyayazi nawe.
I can't do it all.	Andikwazi ukuyenza yonke.
But tell me why.	Kodwa ndixelele ukuba kutheni.
Or maybe you are telling the truth.	Okanye mhlawumbi uthetha inyani.
Yes, it is possible.	Ewe, kunokwenzeka.
He looks good.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle.
Everyone would be here soon.	Wonke umntu wayeza kuba apha kungekudala.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
What I feel is him.	Oko ndiziva ukuba nguye.
True in every way.	Yinyani ngayo yonke indlela.
It's hard to do that.	Kunzima ukuyenza loo nto.
He did not give up.	Akazange ayeke.
You deserve to be.	Ufanele ukuba .
Of course not.	Hayi ke.
But there is something wrong with the job.	Kodwa kukho into embi emsebenzini.
You know you like it.	Uyazi ukuba uyayithanda.
Really, that's it.	Ngokwenene, yiloo nto.
Something to do.	Into yokwenza.
Or tomorrow.	Okanye kusasa.
You deserve to succeed.	Ufanele ukuphumelela.
New reality.	Inyani entsha.
Really, I did.	Ngenene, ndenze njalo.
Not so for me.	Akunjalo kum.
There is a place for you here.	Kukho indawo yakho apha.
I know you know this.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayazi le nto.
I can do it again.	Ndingayenza kwakhona.
I want to talk.	Ndifuna ukuthetha.
Maybe it's better this way.	Mhlawumbi kungcono ngale ndlela.
I want to be me.	Ndifuna ukuba ndim.
Not better or worse.	Hayi ngcono okanye embi.
Maybe it will happen one day.	Mhlawumbi kuya kwenzeka ngenye imini.
I couldn't do anything about it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza nto ngaloo nto.
This is not possible before.	Oku akunakwenzeka ngaphambili.
He will do it.	Uya kuyenza.
No one has ever tried.	Akukho mntu wakhe wazama.
It's hard though.	Kunzima kodwa.
This will not be the case for you.	Oku akuyi kuba njani kuwe.
No, one.	Hayi, omnye.
But he understood.	Kodwa waqonda.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
I have no place for this.	Andifuni ndawo kule nto.
No problem with anything.	Akukho ngxaki nantoni na.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
That will be easier to do.	Oko kuya kuba lula ukwenza.
He wants it to happen again.	Ufuna ukuba yenzeke kwakhona.
I wish I was.	Ndingathanda ukuba ndim.
.	.
That happened here.	Oko kwenzeka apha.
That would be a very big deal.	Oko kuya kuba yinto enkulu kakhulu.
Of course you do not want to go there.	Ewe awufuni ukuya apho.
If you know.	Ukuba uyazi.
He tried to speak.	Wazama ukuthetha.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
Have you ever.	Ngaba wakhe.
He says yes.	Uthi ewe.
This may be true.	Oku kunokuba yinyani.
I want it to happen quickly.	Ndifuna ukuba yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
But I can't find a way to do it.	Kodwa andikwazi ukufumana indlela yokwenza.
I'm just trying to do my job here.	Ndizama nje ukwenza umsebenzi wam apha.
I doubt it.	Ndiyathandabuza.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
His work has been.	Umsebenzi wakhe uye waba.
What really happened.	Yintoni eyenzekayo ngokwenene.
You know it too.	Nawe uyayazi.
But he finally agreed.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni wavuma.
Good or bad.	Elungileyo okanye embi.
I can't do it.	Andikwazi ukuyenza.
I know him too.	Nam ndiyamazi.
Don't go.	Musa ukuhamba.
No one, really.	Akukho mntu, ngokwenene.
I will do that.	Ndiya kuyenza loo nto.
Everyone wants to succeed, everyone wants to do well.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuphumelela, wonke umntu ufuna ukwenza kakuhle.
Do not make it difficult.	Musa ukwenza kube nzima.
That's the problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki.
It will definitely happen.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kwenzeka.
I think fast.	Ndicinga ngokukhawuleza.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
Or maybe not.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He is my man.	Nguye umntu wam.
No, that's fine.	Hayi, kulungile.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
Here, it is not.	Apha, akunjalo.
Not that he looked.	Hayi ukuba wajonga.
A good car is a reality.	Imoto entle yinyani.
You told everything, everything exactly.	Uxelele yonke into, yonke into kanye.
Good place.	Indawo elungileyo.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange enjenjalo.
They drowned anything.	Wazama nantoni na.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.

Very nice place.	Indawo entle kakhulu.
Tell me, you know.	Ndixelele, wazi.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
Maybe he thought it was you.	Mhlawumbi wayecinga ukuba nguwe.
Or he did.	Okanye wenza.
No problem then.	Akukho ngxaki ke.
He wanted my money.	Wayefuna imali yam.
Too much money.	Imali eninzi kakhulu.
You can do this.	Uyakwazi ukuyenza le nto.
It will be something to do.	Kuya kuba yinto yokwenza.
I thought you could make money.	Ndandicinga ukuba uyakwazi ukwenza imali.
I know very well.	Ndiyazi kakhulu.
But very much so.	Kodwa kakhulu.
Travel is difficult.	Ukuhamba kunzima.
I will do that right now.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto kanye ngoku.
At least .	Kungcono .
No, otherwise.	Hayi, ngenye indlela.
That is why he must stay away from her.	Yiyo ke loo nto kufuneka ukuba ahlale kude naye.
I know nothing about it.	Andazi nto ngayo.
But he is not visible.	Kodwa akabonakali.
.	.
No it isn't.	Hayi akunjalo.
I wish that could happen.	Ndinqwenela ukuba oko kwenzeke.
He tries another way.	Uzama ngenye indlela.
I don't want you talking.	Andifuni uthetha.
But he knew, for sure.	Kodwa wayesazi, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He can never do that.	Akanakuze ayenze loo nto.
Everyone talks about it.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngayo.

He did not give up.	Akazange ayeke.
In the end this will be a good thing.	Ekugqibeleni oku kuya kuba yinto entle.

You have to have it.	Ufanele ube nayo.
You do not think.	Awucingi.
Go with it.	Ukuhamba nayo.
Is it possible to do that.	Ngaba kunokwenzeka ukwenza oko.
But if you do.	Kodwa ukuba wenza.
He didn't know how to do it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze njani.
He didn't want another one.	Akazange afune enye.
Nobody wanted to do it.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuyenza.
Everyone knows that place.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo ndawo.
She is not.	Akakho.
I think it is possible.	Ndicinga ukuba kunokwenzeka.
He didn't want to, yet.	Wayengafuni, okwangoku.
Yes that's right.	Ewe oko kulungile.
But not everyone.	Kodwa akunjalo wonke umntu.
He cannot speak at all.	Akakwazi kwaphela ukuthetha.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.
He looked away.	Wajonga kude.
Or not just down.	Okanye hayi nje phantsi.
What are you doing outside? 	Wenza ntoni ngaphandle?
He thought it was time.	Wayecinga ukuba lixesha.
Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacinga.
You are here.	Ulapha.
No one speaks.	Akukho mntu uthetha.
It was not necessary, either.	Kwakungeyomfuneko, mhlawumbi.
Something else happened to me.	Kukho enye into eyenzekayo kum.
I'm glad you like it.	Ndiyavuya uyayithanda.
I am well aware that this is not easy.	Ndiyazi kakuhle ukuba oku akukho lula.

Or in it.	Okanye kuyo.
I know what exactly.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye.
If something happens to you.	Ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kuwe .
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
When he certainly did not.	Xa ngokuqinisekileyo akazange.
He thought he knew how, exactly.	Wayecinga ukuba uyazi njani, kanye.
I mean, it will have to.	Ndiya kuthetha, kuya kufuneka.
This will eventually happen.	Oku kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
Very much, though.	Kakhulu, nokuba.
Not that he agreed with it.	Akunjalo ukuba wavuma kuyo.
You deserve to be.	Ufanele ukuba.
Also, if you like it, tell someone else about it.	Kwakhona, ukuba uyayithanda, xelela omnye umntu ngayo.
Nothing out.	Akukho nto ngaphandle.
He did not come.	Akazange eze.

In this, he did not succeed.	Kule nto, akazange aphumelele.

That's the thing.	Nantso ke into.
he thought.	wacinga.
No one should do it alone.	Akukho mntu kufuneka ayenze yedwa.
Very good performance.	Ukwenza kakuhle kakhulu.
Or nothing.	Okanye akukho nto.
But the house.	Kodwa indlu.
Yes, that would be even better.	Ewe, oko kuya kuba ngcono ngakumbi.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
With all of it.	Ngayo yonke.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
But this must be the case.	Kodwa oku kufuneka kube njalo.
But for you.	Kodwa kuwe.
This is hard to talk about.	Oku kunzima ukuthetha ngayo.
The big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu.
I need to talk to him.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye.
But you know very well.	Kodwa wazi kakuhle kakhulu.
But it will be difficult.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima.
He also agreed.	Kwakhona wavuma.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, uyenzile.
Not too long ago.	Kungekudala kakhulu.
He felt like he had to say something else.	Waziva ngathi kufuneka athethe enye into.
We know very well about it.	Siyazi kakuhle ngayo.
Talk to you soon .	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kungekudala .
What, what.	Yintoni, yintoni.

That means it is true.	Oko kuthetha ukuba yinyani.
Not so much, not that right.	Hayi kakhulu, hayi ukuba kulungile.
He is not far away.	Akayi kude.
I won't be too hard on you.	Andiyi kuba nzima kakhulu kuwe.
But, it is not.	Kodwa, akunjalo.

Now he knew.	Ngoku wayesazi.
He wants to stay.	Uyafuna ukuhlala.
But he does not want to be here.	Kodwa akafuni ukuba lapha.

He agreed.	Wavuma ke naye.
I'm happy.	Ndiyavuya mna.
Well, maybe.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi.
Later, perhaps, when he is alone.	Kamva, mhlawumbi, xa eyedwa.
He won't want you to do that.	Akayi kufuna ukuba wenze loo nto.
Someone else should have known that.	Omnye umntu bekufanele ukuba uyazi loo nto.
No one knew what had happened.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
I'm sure it will happen the other way around.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kuya kwenzeka ngenye indlela.
No no.	Hayi, hayi.
Anything else.	Enye into.
I can't afford a new car.	Andikwazi ukuthenga imoto entsha.
But how exactly ?.	Kodwa njani kanye?.
He thought that was a good thing.	Wayecinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
You want to, too.	Uyafuna, nawe.
I knew what it would be like.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba njani.
That can be difficult.	Oko kunokuba nzima.
Not really, but really.	Akunjalo, kodwa ngokwenene.

How can he do that to her.	Angayenza njani lonto kuye.
Please do the right thing.	Nceda wenze into elungileyo.

I trust everyone.	Ndiyathemba wonke umntu.
He needed help to do it perfectly.	Wayefuna uncedo ukuze ayenze ngokupheleleyo.
Either that or nothing.	Kunokuba yiloo nto okanye akukho nto.
But not a little.	Kodwa hayi kancinci.
He thought he was a great man.	Wayecinga ukuba yindoda enkulu.
Maybe it's okay with me.	Mhlawumbi kulungile nam.
Learning about it will not do it.	Ukufunda ngayo akuyi kuyenza.

Not good there.	Akukho kakuhle apho.
This is now impossible, if not impossible.	Oku ngoku akunakwenzeka, ukuba akunakwenzeka.
What exactly.	Yintoni ngokwenene.
You just want to be something.	Ufuna nje ukuba yinto.
It's a bad thing again.	Yinto embi kwakhona.
He did not have to.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
He settled down well.	Wahlala kakuhle.
What a horrible place this place is.	Hayi indlela embi ngayo le ndawo.
There is another way.	Kukho enye indlela.
I think everyone should do it once.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu kufuneka ayenze kanye.

I want to be alone.	Ndifuna ukuba ndedwa.
He likes to be alone doing his job.	Uthanda ukuba yedwa esenza umsebenzi wakhe.
But, maybe not.	Kodwa, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I really know this.	Ndiyazi ngokwenene oku.
That's more.	Oko ngakumbi.
Or he tried.	Okanye wazama.
What you have to do, what you have to do.	Kufuneka wenze ntoni, wenze ntoni.
Okay, but just in a way.	Kulungile, kodwa ngendlela nje.
This is really possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
I can't live in it.	Andikwazi ukuhlala kuyo.
Not monkeys.	Hayi nyani .

I think that's a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
Yes, very much indeed.	Ewe, kakhulu ngokwenene.
Please help !.	Nceda nceda!.
I'm not sure anyone did.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba nabani na wenza njalo.
For convenience.	Ukuze kube lula.
He did not say anything for a long time.	Zange athethe nto ixesha elide.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
I did not speak.	Khange ndithethe.
I want to know everything.	Ndifuna ukwazi yonke into.
This creates a lot of money.	Oku kudala imali eninzi.

He says he is not.	Uthi akakho.
But he is trying very hard.	Kodwa uzama kakhulu.
Now he did not know what was coming.	Ngoku wayengazi ukuba kuza ntoni.
I think this is good.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kulungile.
Not so now.	Akunjalo ngoku.
You should, too.	Ufanele, nawe.
He would do it then.	Wayeza kuyenza ngoko.
But that happened later.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka kamva.
Or that.	Okanye ukuba .
Well, not yet.	Ke, hayi okwangoku.

It happens but not always.	Kwenzeka kodwa hayi rhoqo.
He never did.	Akazange ayenze.

Or no, it's not.	Okanye hayi, akunjalo.
You've done enough here.	Wenze ngokwaneleyo apha.

He would go.	Wayeza kuya.
I knew someone was coming.	Ndandisazi ukuba kukho umntu oza kuza.
Nothing much, perhaps.	Akukho nto ingako, mhlawumbi.

You are not going anywhere.	Awuyi ndawo.
I know, he thought.	Ndiyazi, wacinga.
If not, no.	Ukuba akunjalo, hayi.
I had to go to the hospital.	Kwafuneka ndiye esibhedlele.
This seems to me even more possible.	Oku kubonakala kum kunokwenzeka ngakumbi.
Slowly and much.	Kancinci uye kakhulu.
We will do it again.	Siza kuyenza kwakhona.
Not in it.	Hayi kuyo.
He just wants you to know.	Ufuna nje ukuba wazi.
But he did not say that.	Kodwa akazange athethe loo nto.
Not outside.	Akukho ngaphandle.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa oko akunjalo.
I think we did very well.	Ndicinga ukuba senze kakuhle kakhulu.
I need to be able to walk.	Kufuneka ndikwazi ukuhamba.

This is true.	Le yinyani.
That's really all.	Yiloo nto yonke ngokwenene.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga kangako.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
He did not know how to go about it.	Wayengazi ukuba ahambe njani.
I'm sorry.	Ndicela uxolo.
Yes, there is such a place.	Ewe, kukho indawo enjalo.
I don't believe there is.	Andikholelwa ukuba kukho.
But not for him, he realized soon.	Kodwa hayi kuye, waqonda kungekudala.
I wonder who he is.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngubani.
How? 	Njani?
he said.	uthe.
He agreed to everything.	Wavuma kuyo yonke into.
So what did he do? 	Wenze ntoni ke?
I never told anyone.	Zange ndixelele mntu.
Just all this.	Yonke nje le nto.
Too slow.	Ukuhamba kancinci kakhulu.
That's what he wants.	Yiloo nto ayifunayo.
He will go there immediately.	Uza kuya khona kwangoko.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He just knew.	Wayesazi nje.
Maybe you want money.	Mhlawumbi ufuna imali.
You seem to be feeling much better.	Kubonakala ngathi uziva ngcono kakhulu.
Just a little bit, a little bit.	Kancinci nje, kancinci kancinci.
This is not the case here.	Apha akunjalo.
No one seems to know anything about it.	Akukho mntu ubonakala ngathi wazi nto ngayo.
We'll be down soon.	Siza kuba phantsi kungekudala.
He knew he was coming.	Wayesazi ukuba uza kuza.
I'm sure of it.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo.
You have to do that a lot.	Kufuneka wenze oko kakhulu.
He really did not know.	Ngokwenene wayengazi.
But it is possible.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka.
Very nice way, absolutely.	Indlela entle kakhulu, ngokupheleleyo.
.	.
I wish you more money.	Ndinqwenela ukuba imali eninzi.
We need both.	Kufuneka sobabini.
Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.
But that will not happen.	Kodwa oko akuyi kwenzeka.
Yes, or otherwise.	Ewe, okanye ngenye indlela.
That obviously is not the case.	Oko ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
He had better leave.	Kungcono ukuba ahambe.
Because it is impossible.	Kuba akunakwenzeka.
I'm sure .	Ndiqinisekile .
Doing my job.	Ukwenza umsebenzi wam.
But in the end, he did not succeed.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni, akazange aphumelele.
Where is this .	Iphi lento .
I can't win.	Andikwazi ukuphumelela.
He needed help.	Wayefuna uncedo.
He will stay here, with me.	Uya kuhlala apha, kunye nam.
That's what it is.	Nguye lo nto.
But, no, it is not.	Kodwa, hayi, akunjalo.
Everyone needs help.	Wonke umntu ufuna uncedo.
Certainly not his money.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi imali yakhe.
Or to me.	Okanye kum.
One says one thing, another says another.	Omnye uthetha enye into, omnye athethe enye.
So he tried again.	Ngoko wazama kwakhona.
he thought.	wacinga.
Something else happened.	Kwenzeka enye into.
.	.
But then it happened again.	Kodwa ke kwenzeka kwakhona.
You can be.	Unokuba njalo.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
I wanted nothing.	Ndandingafuni nto.
I did not know why.	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni.
Well, one knows.	Ewe, umntu uyazi.
.	.
He had to do so.	Kwafuneka enjenjalo.
I don't think you have to be that way.	Andiqondi ukuba kufuneka ube njalo.
Now is good.	Ngoku kulungile.
But now he knew something else.	Kodwa ngoku wayesazi enye into.
Or you ?.	Okanye wena?.
He is, but more so.	Nguye, kodwa ngakumbi.
Maybe one day.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
But there is another way.	Kodwa kukho enye indlela.
you think.	ucinga.
I know the truth now.	Ndiyazi inyani ngoku.
OK No problem.	Kulungile, akukho ngxaki.
Just tell me that.	Ndixelele nje loo nto.
No no no no no no.	Hayi hayi hayi hayi hayi hayi .
I don't think it's right.	Andiqondi ukuba kulungile.
I never did it before, you know.	Andizange ndiyenze ngaphambili, uyazi.
He really wanted to go.	Ngokwenene wayefuna ukuhamba.
Nobody likes me.	Akukho mntu uthanda mna.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
Who makes money.	Ngubani owenza imali.
He lives with us.	Uhlala nathi.
Certainly not to you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo kuwe.
There is new money.	Kukho imali entsha.
He knew a lot about it.	Wayesazi kakhulu ngayo.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
For a long time it is clear.	Lixesha elide kucacile.
He finally realized what he was going to do.	Ekugqibeleni waqonda ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
.	.
He can't know you're here.	Akakwazi ukuba ulapha.
Eventually, it happened.	Ekugqibeleni, kwenzeka.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ncam.
He did not know what he was thinking.	Wayengazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
He, too, will never succeed.	Naye, akanakuze aphumelele.
I think that's it.	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto.
She wanted to stay with him.	Wayefuna ukuhlala naye.
I'm not going home.	Andiyi ekhaya.
I think not at the moment.	Ndicinga ukuba akunjalo okwangoku.
I want to achieve this.	Ndifuna ukuphumelela le.
So there.	Ngoko apho.

It seems obvious.	Kubonakala ngokucacileyo.

I can't talk enough about it !.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngokwaneleyo ngayo!.
It doesn't have to be here.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba umntu ahlale apha.
It's really hard.	Kunzima ngokwenene.
Or like nothing.	Okanye ngathi akukho nto.
He wanted bad money.	Wayefuna imali embi.
I would like to know what you think.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba ucinga ntoni.
Very good performance.	Ukwenza kakuhle kakhulu.
If you have ever looked again.	Ukuba sele ukhe wajonga kwakhona.
He is here alone.	Ulapha yedwa.
He certainly did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyenzile.
I definitely didn’t want to or do it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndandingafuni ukuba okanye ndiyenze.
There is peace.	Kukho uxolo.
Maybe it will be one day.	Mhlawumbi uya kuba ngenye imini.
He wanted to do this as soon as possible.	Wayefuna ukwenza oku ngokukhawuleza.
But he sat down, a little bit.	Kodwa wahlala phantsi, kancinci.

Reading is really hard.	Ukufunda nzima ngokwenene.
So just.	Ngoko nje.
I'm afraid .	Ndiyoyika .
Tell me .	Ndixelele .
He thought.	Wayecinga.
Maybe it's you.	Mhlawumbi nguwe.
I'm not sure why that happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni oko kwenzeka.
It will be difficult to tell.	Kuya kuba nzima ukuxelela.
he thought.	wacinga.
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze loo nto.
Only for me.	Kuphela kum.
I will not do this.	andiyi kuyenza le nto.
I wonder if he can speak.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba uyakwazi ukuthetha.
If not, that's fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, kulungile.
You have done a very bad thing.	Wenze into embi kakhulu.
You really like it.	Ngokwenene uyayithanda.
I know we did.	Ndiyazi ukuba senze njalo.

Don't go too far or do too much.	Musa ukuhamba kakhulu okanye wenze kakhulu.
I have to do it.	Kufuneka ndiyenze.

But, please tell me the time.	Kodwa, ndicela undixelele ixesha.
Now, he understood.	Ngoku, waqonda.
That's just a bad thing.	Yinto embi nje leyo.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
But it will be a long time for you.	Kodwa kuya kuba lixesha elide kuwe.

I feel better about that.	Ndiziva ngcono ngaloo nto.
Anything else.	Enye into.
Not long ago.	Hayi kudala.
But that is exactly what it is.	Kodwa yiloo nto kanye.
Now he did not.	Ngoku akazange enjenjalo.
Or how exactly.	Okanye njani kanye.
All right, no.	Kulungile, hayi.
I think that is possible, but it is not possible.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kunokwenzeka, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
But I'm not sure.	Kodwa andiqinisekanga.
That's it.	Yiloo nto.
Well, this is fine.	Ewe, oku kulungile.
I thought this was you.	Bendicinga ukuba nguwe lo.
Going everything.	Ukuhamba yonke into.
I did not want him to leave.	Ndandingafuni ahambe.
Yes, this is really happening.	Ewe, oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
It would have been better if he had thought of what everyone else was doing.	Kungcono ukuba wayecinga into eyenziwa ngumntu wonke.
He said no.	Wathi hayi.
Yes, it will.	Ewe, kuya kuba njalo.
That makes it a little easier.	Oko kwenza ukuba kube lula kancinci.
There is always something going on.	Kuhlala kukho into eyenzekayo.
I know.	Mna uyazi.
But maybe not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He had to say this.	Kwafuneka athethe le nto.
I know you like it very much here.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayithanda kakhulu apha.
It's hard to know what that is.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuba yintoni leyo.
Yes Yes! 	Ewe, ewe!
That's all you need to know.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyazi.
But one more thing.	Kodwa enye into.
To me, it seems a lot more.	Kum, kubonakala kakhulu ngakumbi.
Nobody lives here right now.	Akukho mntu uhlala apha ngoku.
I want you to stay here with me.	Ndifuna uhlala apha nam.
But money, no.	Kodwa imali, hayi.
Going home.	Ukuya ekhaya.
This is here.	Le nto apha.
But it is not easy.	Kodwa akukho lula.
That's the thing.	Nantso into.
Now you! 	Ngoku, wena!
.	.
This will not be easy.	Oku akuyi kuba lula.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
I'm going to do it tonight.	Ndiza kuyenza ngokuhlwanje.
Maybe more then.	Mhlawumbi ngakumbi ke.
Something bad is going to happen.	Kuya kwenzeka into embi.
You too .	Nawe .
I feel very bad.	Ndiziva kakhulu.
I'm afraid I'm alone.	Ndiyoyika ukuba ndedwa.
He wants to learn more.	Ufuna ukufunda ngakumbi.
But that is not possible.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka.
Tell me.	Ndixelele.
I think this is a very good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba le yinto entle kakhulu.
He did very well.	Wenza kakuhle kakhulu.
Or no, whatever.	Okanye hayi, nokuba yintoni na.
No one went.	Akukho mntu waya.
He certainly wasn't there yet.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengekho okwangoku.
At the hospital.	Esibhedlele.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
Sooner or later, one has to leave.	Kungekudala okanye kamva, umntu kufuneka ahambe.
He will be here tomorrow.	Uzakuba lapha ngomso.
All right, tell me.	Kulungile, ndixelele.
He understood a little.	Waqonda kancinci.
I never thought that would happen so quickly.	Ndandingacingi ukuba oko kuya kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
There is something else.	Kukho enye into.
If someone wants to do something on their own, that's fine.	Ukuba umntu ufuna ukwenza into yedwa, kulungile.
Again, .	Kwakhona, .
He’s trying to do a lot.	Uzama ukwenza kakhulu.
You, not so much.	Wena, hayi kakhulu.
I want him to succeed.	Ndifuna aphumelele.
This will make it very difficult.	Oku kuya kwenza ukuba kube nzima kakhulu.
he asked.	wabuza.
You look great.	Ukhangeleka kakhulu.
I'm glad you feel the same, because.	Ndiyavuya uziva nawe, kuba.
Maybe it is me.	Mhlawumbi ndim.
That's it.	Yiyo ke.
You will need help.	Uya kufuna uncedo.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
He did not want her to give up.	Wayengafuni ukuba ayeke.
So, one day, he was gone.	Ngoko, ngenye imini, wayengekho.
I will do this as I do.	Ndiya kwenza oku njengam.
But better, for me.	Kodwa kungcono, kum.
I think you need something else.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna enye into.
True or not I do not know.	Yinyani okanye hayi andazi.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
This is not the case at all.	Oku akunjalo kwaphela.
I was thinking about all this here.	Bendicinga ngayo yonke le nto apha.
Nobody wants you.	Akukho mntu ufuna wena.
At present this is not the case.	Okwangoku oku akunjalo.
Something happened then.	Kwenzeka into ngoko.
Food is far from you.	Ukutya kude kuwe.
Probably, it is very difficult.	Mhlawumbi, kunzima kakhulu.
I really want to stay with you.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuhlala nawe.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
I want to know more.	Ndifuna ukwazi kakhulu.
But not this one.	Kodwa hayi le enye.
We have done so here.	Senze njalo apha.
But someone did that.	Kodwa kukho umntu owenza loo nto.
Either that, or he just isn't there.	Nokuba yiloo nto, okanye akakho nje.
I can not speak.	Andikwazi kuthetha.
You know better.	Wazi ngcono.
He said, all right.	Wathi, kulungile.
This will be the case.	Oku kuya kuba njalo.
I think it will be so.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
It’s not easy to do, for sure.	Akukho lula ukwenza, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I did not know where.	Ndandingazi ukuba phi.
Of course not today.	Ewe akunjalo namhlanje.
Today I did not do it.	Namhlanje khange ndiyenze.
But not when you speak.	Kodwa hayi xa uthetha.
He looked at me.	Uye wajonga kum.
He wanted her to stop.	Wayefuna ukuba ayeke.
He is not going anywhere.	Akayi ndawo.
I know you well enough.	Ndikwazi kakuhle ngokwaneleyo.
Well, he did this for her.	Ewe, wakwenza oku kuye.
Obviously he did.	Ngokucacileyo wenze njalo.
Finally he went ahead.	Ekugqibeleni waya ngaphambili.
When everything a lot out.	Xa yonke into eninzi ngaphandle.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
He must have understood.	Umele ukuba waqonda.
I had to think, too.	Kwafuneka ndicinge, nam.
So much for me.	Kakhulu hayi into yam.
It is very difficult to do.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
You know? 	Uyazi?
I want more.	Ndifuna kakhulu.
I think of us both.	Ndicinga ngathi sobabini.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula.
He thought hard.	Wacinga kakhulu.
Way, way, too.	Indlela, indlela, kakhulu.
You know, if you did.	Uyazi, ukuba uyenzile.
I think you know better now.	Ndicinga ukuba wazi ngcono ngoku.
he asked.	wabuza.
Don't be too hard on yourself.	Musa ukuba nzima kakhulu kuwe.
I'm sure.	Ndiqinisekile.
Well, there you are.	Kulungile, nantso ke.
I would like to talk to him.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha naye.
Yeah, now.	Ewe, ngoku.
Whether he wanted to go or not.	Nokuba wayefuna ukuya okanye akafuni.
But it is probably true.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka ukuba yinyani.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngokwenene.
We will do the same.	Siza kwenza njalo.
If you know.	Ukuba uyazi.
It is very difficult to walk.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuhamba.
He knows everything about us.	Wazi yonke into ngathi.
Nobody did.	Akukho mntu wenza.
.	.
He told me about it.	Wandixelela ngaloo nto.
Well done to this one.	Wenze kakuhle kule.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
That is a terrible thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu leyo.
That's why you feel bad.	Yiyo loo nto uziva kakubi.
So do i .	Nam .
But, yes, maybe.	Kodwa, ewe, mhlawumbi.
He did so.	Wenza njalo.
I thought everyone knew.	Ndandicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyazi.
Because you are looking for a job.	Kuba ufuna umsebenzi.
he asked.	wabuza.
Really, it will be better.	Ngokwenene, kuya kuba ngcono.
We have done enough of that.	Senze ngokwaneleyo oko.
It could be today or tomorrow.	Kunokuba namhlanje okanye ngomso.
I thought you were a good person.	Bendicinga ukuba ungumntu olungileyo.
Not all of us.	Akunjalo sonke.
It's hard to read.	Kunzima ukufunda.
You do not have to tell me.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba undixelele.
Only money please.	Imali kuphela nceda.
Which, well, sure.	Nto leyo, kulungile, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
In spite.	Ngaphandle.
You never told anyone about it.	Zange uxelele mntu ngayo.
I can do all that.	Ndingayenza yonke loo nto.
This place.	Le ndawo .
Only thing.	Kuphela into.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I think everyone is here.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu ulapha.
I could not help anyone.	Andizange ndikwazi ukunceda mntu.
Or maybe you go.	Okanye mhlawumbi uye.
But he did not do that.	Kodwa akazange ayenze loo nto.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
That's the way we do things.	Yiloo ndlela esenza ngayo izinto.
French will have to do.	IsiFrentshi kuya kufuneka senze.
Travel well.	Ukuhamba kakuhle.
I think you better tell me.	Ndicinga ukuba kungcono undixelele.
It will be with you soon.	Kuya kuba nawe kungekudala.

That will not be easy.	Oko akuyi kuba lula.
I will make my way.	Ndiya kwenza indlela yam.
Yes, it is.	Ewe, yinyani.
Yes, but no.	Ewe, kodwa hayi.
I don't really want to.	Andifuni ngokwenene.
But that is not possible.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka.
This is clearly not the case.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
I will not do this.	Andiyi kuyenza le nto.
If anything, this makes my job even more difficult.	Ukuba kukho nantoni na, oku kwenza umsebenzi wam ube nzima ngakumbi.
He is.	Nguye.
If anyone will do it, it is.	Ukuba nabani na uya kwenza, nguye.
He will come.	Uya kuza.

I don't know exactly why.	Andazi kanye ukuba kutheni.
it does not have to.	akunyanzelekanga.
You know what's coming.	Uyayazi into ezayo.
You know very well that it is not.	Uyazi kakuhle ukuba akunjalo.
Because he did.	Kuba wenza njalo.
Only.	Kuphela kuphela.
Do the job.	Wenze umsebenzi lowo.
Here it is.	Apha kulungile.
Because that will happen.	Kuba oko kuya kwenzeka.

Not just a little bit.	Hayi nje kancinci.
It's just hard for me now.	Kunzima nje kum ngoku.
Very much.	Kakhulu kakhulu.
Well, it had to be that way.	Ewe, kwafuneka ukuba kube njalo.
I think yes, maybe.	Ndicinga ukuba ewe, mhlawumbi.
This can be difficult.	Oku kunokuba nzima.
This is not only possible, it is very possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka kuphela, kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
You already know that.	Sele uyayazi loo nto.
But, maybe not always.	Kodwa, mhlawumbi akunjalo rhoqo.
He did not know how to do it.	Wayengazi ukuba angayenza njani loo nto.
Yes, very much so.	Ewe, kakhulu.
I think we should do this.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka siyenze le nto.
I had to tell her everything.	Kwafuneka ndimxelele yonke into.
Nobody does better than I do.	Akukho mntu wenza ngcono kunam.
He said he did.	Uthe wenze njalo.
Not only for you but for him, too.	Hayi kuphela kuwe kodwa kuye, naye.

Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo ngayo yonke ingxaki.
.	.
That's a bad thing.	Yinto embi leyo.

Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He said he needed help.	Wathi ufuna uncedo.
You will be.	Uya kuba .
Everyone told me it was going to be hard.	Wonke umntu wandixelela ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
But there is no way.	Kodwa akukho ndlela.
A good dog.	Inja elungileyo.
It is very possible that.	Kunokwenzeka kakhulu ukuba.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
Maybe you did something very wrong.	Mhlawumbi wenze into embi kakhulu.

As you do.	Njengoko wenza.
That is not a bad thing at all.	Asiyonto embi leyo.
This happens a lot.	Oku kwenzeka kakhulu.
Probably, he thought.	Mhlawumbi, wacinga.
Someone is talking to me.	Umntu uthetha nam.
Reading is one thing, speaking another.	Ukufunda yinto enye, ukuthetha enye.
No problem there.	Akukho ngxaki apho.
He will not come forward.	Akayi kuza ngaphambili.
Maybe not so much.	Mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu.

You may have done this well.	Usenokuba uyenzile kakuhle le nto.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.

He did not want to see anything.	Wayengafuni ukubona nto.
He can play.	Uyakwazi ukudlala.
He doesn't want to go there.	Akafuni ukuya apho.
Another agreed.	Omnye wavuma.
I will do it.	Ndiza kuyenza.
But if you want.	Kodwa ukuba uyafuna.
No, it is possible.	Hayi, kunokwenzeka ngakumbi.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.
I want to go home.	Ndifuna ukuya Ekhaya.
I'm not sure if there is one.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kukho enye.
So, one job.	Ngoko ke, umsebenzi omnye.
Not all of us.	Akunjalo sonke.
However, this is not the case.	Kodwa ke, akunjalo.
It will be easy.	Kuya kuba lula.

This is great.	Oku kakuhle.
Something is happening, a new problem.	Kukho into eyenzekayo, ingxaki entsha.
I had to think.	Kwafuneka ndicinge.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
Everything is bad.	Yonke into embi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
But you know what it is.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
He has to stay there.	Kufuneka ahlale apho.
That's it before.	Nantso ke ngaphambili.
He did not go with her.	Akazange naye.
So that's the way.	Ngoko nantso indlela.
He said he did not.	Wathi akazange.
He lives there.	Uhlala apho.
This is what you have to do.	Le nto kufuneka uyenze.

I suspect later.	Ndiyakrokrela kamva.
It seems that something is happening to him.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho into eyenzekayo kuye.
If you want.	Ukuba uyafuna.
I feel like staying here.	Ndiziva ndifuna ukuhlala apha.
Yes, just this way.	Ewe, kanye ngale ndlela.
No, not you.	Hayi, hayi wena.
He didn't know how to do it.	Wayengazi ukuba angayenza njani na.
Fast moving.	Ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
Something like that.	Into enjalo.
He thought he would be.	Wayecinga ukuba uya kuba.
There seems to be a problem.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho ingxaki.
There is everything here.	Kukho yonke into apha.
We all know something about that.	Sonke siyazi into ngaloo nto.
He agreed outside.	Wavuma ngaphandle.
Not what someone else wants it to be.	Hayi le nto omnye umntu afuna abe yiyo.
I hope something happens.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo.
He said he wanted to do it.	Wathi ufuna ukwenza.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
Whatever he comes he will do.	Nantoni na ezayo uya kuyenza.
You like better here.	Uthanda ngcono apha.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe, yinyani leyo.
Well enough, he thought.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, wacinga.
Probably very often.	Mhlawumbi rhoqo kakhulu.
He knew very well.	Wayesazi kakhulu.
I think we will be able to do that.	Ndicinga ukuba siya kukwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
But it does not have to be this way for you.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo kuwe.
I don't want to but.	Andifuni kodwa.
Okay, but only a little bit.	Kulungile, kodwa kuphela kancinci.
Don't go.	Musa ukuhamba.
You go where you want to go.	Uya apho ufuna ukuya khona.
I do not know.	Andazi.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.
I will do it all again.	Ndiza kuyenza yonke kwakhona.
We are going home.	Siya ekhaya.
He thought that maybe he could do that.	Wayecinga ukuba mhlawumbi angayenza loo nto.
It's okay to say no.	Kulungile ukuba uthi hayi.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
This had to be improved.	Oku kwafuneka ukuba ngcono.
.	.
I have been trying this for a long time.	Ndizama oku ixesha elide.
I did not tell anyone.	Khange ndixelele mntu.
That's the place now.	Nantso indawo ngoku.
And now he knew.	Ke ngoku wayesazi.
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.
Not just with him.	Hayi nje naye.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
I am something rather than an actor.	Ndim into kunokuba ngumdlali.
Tell me about it.	Ndixelele ngayo.
Maybe one day.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini.
Well, this is fine.	Ewe, oku kulungile.
It was not.	Khange kube .
All right, all right, then.	Kulungile, kulungile, ngoko.
If you want to.	Ukuba ufuna njalo.
And now what? 	Ke ngoku yintoni?
he thought.	wacinga.
I know it.	Ndiyayazi.
It is very difficult to talk about this.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuthetha ngale nto.
Probably impossible.	Mhlawumbi akunakwenzeka.
You know it's hard.	Uyazi ukuba kunzima.
But he can't.	Kodwa akakwazi.
I'm afraid to go.	Ndiyoyika ukuhamba.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza.
He did not want to be alone.	Wayengafuni ukuba yedwa.
Man, everyone very much.	Umntu, wonke umntu kakhulu.
Probably possible.	Mhlawumbi kunokwenzeka.
I think you know what it is.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
He did not want to read.	Wayengafuni ukufunda.
I know.	Ndiyazi mna.
No one thinks about it again.	Akukho mntu ucinga ngayo kwakhona.
He thought quickly.	Wacinga ngokukhawuleza.
Ok then.	Kulungile ke.
It's not just one thing.	Asiyonto nje enye.
That's a dog.	Nantso inja.
He is doing this now.	Wenza oku ngoku.
You will have to tell me everything about it.	Kuya kufuneka undixelele yonke into ngayo.
Maybe that's all.	Mhlawumbi yiyo yonke loo nto.
Here it is.	Le apha.
There is something new.	Kukho into entsha.
Well, tell me.	Ke, ndixelele .
But it seems like nothing.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi akukho nto.
We'll talk later.	Siza kuthetha kamva.
It seems to have happened here.	Kubonakala ukuba kwenzeke apha.
I will not be alone.	Andiyi kuba ndedwa.
But that will end.	Kodwa oko kuya kuphela.
Nothing about us.	Akukho nto ngathi.
Maybe there is another way.	Mhlawumbi kukho enye indlela.
But this is not the case today.	Kodwa oku akunjalo namhlanje.
Now, one can be.	Ngoku, umntu unokuba.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku .
I'm not sure that much.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kakhulu.
He was not at work.	Wayengekho emsebenzini.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
Success, it seems, is almost impossible.	Ukuphumelela, kubonakala ngathi, akunakwenzeka ngokwenene.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ixesha lokwenza oko ngoku.
You know, it really isn't.	Uyazi, akunjalo ngokwenene.
Something happens every night.	Kukho into eyenzekayo rhoqo ebusuku.
Or do something else.	Okanye wenze enye into.
That's what it is today.	Yiloo nto ke namhlanje.
This is possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka.
He did not want to know.	Wayengafuni ukwazi.
I want you to be that way.	Ndifuna ube njalo.
He thinks about doing something.	Ucinga ngokwenza nto.
You have to go to school.	Kufuneka uye esikolweni.
That's right there.	Yiyo kanye apho.
I think well.	Ndicinga kakuhle .
Yeah, okay, okay.	Ewe, kulungile, kulungile.
I will stay alone for a while.	Ndiza kuhlala ndedwa kancinci.
We really did.	Senze ngokwenene.
I am the only one.	Ndim kuphela.
I am the only one with him.	Ndim naye kuphela.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
Well, whatever it is.	Kulungile, nokuba yintoni na.
Beautiful.	Entle.
No no .	Hayi hayi .
But it is not very easy.	Kodwa akukho lula kakhulu.
Really swimming.	Ngokwenene ukuqubha.
Not like me.	Hayi njengam.
I know you won't do anything.	Ndiyazi ukuba akuyi kwenza nto.
If anything.	Ukuba nantoni na .
But soon.	Kodwa kungekudala.
Yes, he was not.	Ewe, wayengekho.
What.	Yintoni na.
I can't help it.	Andikwazi ukunceda.
One has to just talk.	Kufuneka umntu athethe nje.
You feel really bad.	Uziva kakubi ngokwenene.
You like it.	Uyayithanda.
But you do not want to.	Kodwa awufuni.
There is always something good for everyone.	Kuhlala kukho into entle kuye wonke umntu.
I'm trying to tell the truth.	Ndizama ukuthetha inyani.
You have to do it to be.	Kufuneka wenze ukuze ube.
This creates a problem.	Oku kudala ingxaki.
It is also difficult.	Kwakhona kunzima.
If you want that.	Ukuba ufuna oko.
I will do anything.	Ndiya kwenza nantoni na.
Now she thought it was him.	Ngoku wayecinga ukuba nguye.
I don't know anyone.	Andazi mntu.
I don't know how long it will last.	Andazi ukuba kuya kude kube nini.
For now .	Okwangoku .
I think he is.	Ndicinga ukuba nguye.
But he could not.	Kodwa akazange akwazi.
He certainly did not.	Ngenene akazange.
We all know why.	Sonke siyazi ukuba kutheni.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
You did it, so what.	Uyenzile, yintoni ke.
She does not want to go to the hospital.	Akafuni ukuya esibhedlele.
Obviously, this will not last.	Ngokucacileyo, oku akuyi kuhlala.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga ngakumbi.
Quick, really.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokwenene.
I wish you knew.	Akwaba ubusazi.
It simply means that you will be fully present.	Kuthetha nje ukuba uya kuba khona ngokupheleleyo.
Everyone at school knows.	Wonke umntu esikolweni uyazi.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
You have to have it.	Kufuneka ube nawe.
Hard, yes.	Kunzima, ewe.
Or maybe.	Okanye mhlawumbi.
Good thing too.	Into entle nayo.
He couldn't do it.	Akazange akwazi ukuyenza.
Here, or here.	Apha, okanye apha.
He did more.	Wenze ngakumbi.
I made a lot of money.	Ndenze imali eninzi.
Everyone wants things.	Wonke umntu ufuna izinto.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngokwenene.
Not a bad thing to have.	Hayi into embi ukuba nayo.
I think it is possible.	Ndicinga ukuba kunokwenzeka.
He agreed, really.	Wavuma, ngokwenene.
And he agreed.	Uye wavuma.
You do not have to do this completely.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze oku ngokupheleleyo.
Living alone.	Ukuhlala wedwa.
She would like to help.	Angathanda ukunceda.
He was not long outside.	Wayengekho ixesha elide ngaphandle.
I need to know if you want to stay.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba ufuna ukuhlala.
All of us, you and me.	Sonke, wena kunye nam.
he asked.	wabuza.
It can be a little difficult.	Kunokuba nzima kancinci.
He will have no other choice.	Akayi kuba nayo enye indlela.
I can't make a decision.	Andikwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
If you want to go, you will do the same.	Ukuba ufuna ukuhamba, uya kuyenza loo nto nawe.
Well, when you think about it, that's the same thing.	Kulungile, xa ucinga ngayo, yinto enye leyo.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
Now is the time.	Ngoku lixesha.
I ask anyone.	Ndicela nabani na.
I never did.	Andizange ndiyenze.
I will come.	Ndiza kuza.
This can be so.	Oku kunokuba njalo.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
I think so.	Ndicinga njalo.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
Tom, here again.	Tom, apha kwakhona.
He did this now.	Oku wakwenza ngoku.
Is it, really ?.	Ngaba, ngokwenene?.
This is clearly not possible.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunakwenzeka.
He told me.	Undixelele.
Now and then.	Ngoku nangoko.
He knows everything.	Wazi yonke into.
Or have you ever thought.	Okanye ukhe wacinga.
There is no way at all.	Akukho ndlela kwaphela.
I don't want too much.	Andifuni kakhulu.
This is much better.	Oku kungcono kakhulu.
That seems possible.	Oko kubonakala kunokwenzeka.
His new place.	Indawo yakhe entsha.
No one lives outside.	Akukho mntu uhlala ngaphandle.
I want to know who he is.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba ngubani.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
I did not want to leave.	Ndandingafuni ukuhamba.
You just have to make time to do it.	Kufuneka nje wenze ixesha lokwenza oko.
You can drive a car.	Uyakwazi ukuqhuba imoto.
I'm so glad to be here with you.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuba lapha kunye nawe.
I thought so too.	Nam bendicinga.
This to me, you know.	Oku kum, uyazi.
But are you going.	Kodwa ngaba uya .
I thought you knew that.	Bendicinga uyayazi lonto.
He wanted it this way.	Wayefuna ngale ndlela.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
There is no way to do it any other way.	Akukho ndlela yokwenza oko ngenye indlela.
I would love to be with you.	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukuba nawe.
Probably nothing.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto.

You love this place, really.	Uyayithanda le ndawo, ngenene.
He knew he had to stop there.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ayeke apho.
All right now this.	Kulungile ngoku oku.
No one wanted to leave.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuhamba.
That is clearly impossible.	Oko ngokucacileyo akunakwenzeka.
He knew better, but he did it.	Wayesazi ngcono, kodwa wakwenza oko.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.
So, don't do this.	Ngoko, musa ukwenza oku.
I did not really want to go.	Ndandingafuni nyani ukuhamba.
He could not stay.	Akazange akwazi ukuhlala.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo.
I'll talk to him about that later tonight.	Ndiza kuthetha naye ngaloo nto kamva ngokuhlwanje.
But now he is the problem.	Kodwa ngoku nguye ingxaki .
Not now, but later.	Hayi ngoku, kodwa kamva.
All right, now.	Kulungile, ngoku.

No one wanted to talk to him.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuthetha naye.
Only something happened.	Kuphela into eyenzekayo.
There is so much.	Kukho kakhulu.
Certainly no one will do it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho mntu uya kwenza.
This is good for you.	Oku kulungile kuwe.
What else?!.	Yintoni enye?!.
The work has done well.	Umsebenzi wenze kakuhle.
Or now.	Okanye ngoku.
This is unlikely to happen.	Oku akunakwenzeka ukuba kwenzeke.
You know, and whatever comes next.	Uyazi, kunye nantoni na ezayo.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
No, not bad.	Hayi, hayi kakubi.
He told me to talk to anyone.	Wandixelela ukuba ndithethe nabani.
It will look this way.	Kuya kubonakala ngale ndlela.
I will come.	Ndiza kuza.
As for .	Ngoko .

Another stayed there.	Omnye wahlala apho.
But not just anyone.	Kodwa hayi nje nabani na.
But this did happen.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka.
That you will not do.	Oko awuyi kuyenza.
This is something new.	Le yinto entsha.
Not only that.	Akunjalo kuphela.
But something.	Kodwa into.
Quickly, for sure.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I know you know how to do this.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayazi indlela yokwenza oku.
Or maybe he doesn't think.	Okanye mhlawumbi akacingi.
But then again, probably not.	Kodwa ke kwakhona, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
But, yes.	Kodwa, ewe.
But you certainly know a lot better.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo uyazi kakhulu ngakumbi.
Not at all.	Hayi ngokupheleleyo akunjalo.
I'm sure you know that.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyayazi loo nto.

He just isn't there.	Akakho nje.
Thus.	Ngaloo ndlela.
You better get away from it.	Kungcono uye kude kuyo.
But everyone knew what to do.	Kodwa wonke umntu wayesazi ukuba enze ntoni.

He knew it well there.	Wayesazi kakuhle apho.

I talked a lot.	Ndithethe kakhulu.
Well, he thought so.	Ewe, wayecinga njalo.

This happened to me.	Oku kwenzeka kum.

You know it.	Uyakwazi.

No, not to him.	Hayi, hayi kuye.
It is very difficult to tell.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuxelela.
That he didn't even know what it was.	Loo nto wayengazi nokuba yintoni na.
What you already know.	Oko sele uyazi.
You want to do the right thing.	Ufuna ukwenza into elungileyo.
For now .	Okwangoku .
He lives in me.	Uhlala kum.
You know, whatever.	Uyazi, nantoni na.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
I don't want to do it either.	Nam andifuni kwenza.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
She went to the hospital.	Waya esibhedlele.
Please tell me, please.	Nceda undixelele, nceda.
He does not think well.	Akacingi kakuhle.
He's just a really good man.	Ungumntu nje olungileyo ngenene.
I would love to be with her.	Ndingathanda ukuba naye.
But maybe you know? 	Kodwa mhlawumbi uyazi?

It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
Or to do anything really.	Okanye ukwenza nantoni na ngokwenene.

I think that's a good thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
Yes, he will.	Ewe, uya kwenza njalo.
You always think about it.	Uhlala ucinga ngayo.
He finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni wavuma.
He did not do it regularly.	Akazange ayenze rhoqo.
Well, maybe not.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Because it's hard to do.	Kuba kunzima ukwenza.
Only more true.	Kuphela yinyani ngakumbi.
He did not have to.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
No one is coming here.	Akukho mntu uza apha.

Certainly not me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi mna.
.	.
But that is exactly what he wants.	Kodwa yiloo nto kanye ayifunayo.
I do not believe in anything.	Andikholelwa kuyo nantoni na.
But that will come later.	Kodwa oko kuza kamva.
I will definitely.	Ndiza kuphinda ngokuqinisekileyo.
This seems obvious.	Oku kubonakala kucacile.

He wanted food, he wanted coffee.	Wayefuna ukutya, efuna ikofu.
Really nothing.	Ngokwenene akukho nto.
Now this.	Ngoku oku.
You did the job.	Wenze umsebenzi.
Not just for me.	Akukho nje kum.
He did not know what to do now.	Wayengazi ukuba kufuneka enze ntoni ngoku.
Whether he goes or not.	Ngaba uya okanye akayi.
I think you come to work with me.	Ndicinga ukuba uza emsebenzini kunye nam.
It's just a little true.	Yinyani nje kancinci.
Something about you.	Into ngawe.
Just tell me what I did.	Ndixelele nje ukuba ndenze ntoni.
Yes, that will be seen.	Ewe, oko kuya kubonakala.
What and.	Ntoni na.
Tell me her problem.	Ndixelele ingxaki yakhe.
Really, but there.	Ngokwenene, kodwa apho.
This is just a thing.	Le yinto nje.
I don't like it very much there.	Andiyithandi kakhulu apho.
It's too far for someone to be me.	Kude kakhulu ukuba umntu abe ndim.
He knew nothing at all.	Wayengazi nto kwaphela.
But he will not do it.	Kodwa akayi kuyenza.
But he never talked about it.	Kodwa akazange athethe ngayo.
We know, we know, we know.	Siyazi, siyazi, siyazi.
I don't know if it is.	Andazi ukuba yiyo.
It's true for me.	Yinyani kum.
If I don't like you, I don't like you.	Ukuba andikuthandi, andikuthandi.
Now, he did.	Ngoku, wenze njalo.
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze loo nto.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo kunye nayo yonke loo nto.
I made a way.	Ndenze indlela.
I don't have to do it! 	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ndiyenze!
Fast, but really.	Ngokukhawuleza, kodwa ngokwenene.
That's all.	Yonke loo nto.
You told me everything about yourself.	Undixelele yonke into ngawe.
But he could not say anything else.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuthetha enye into.
One more thing.	Into enye kwakhona.
But all the way there is nothing.	Kodwa yonke indlela akukho nto.
But you can be.	Kodwa unokuba njalo.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
Tell me things.	Ndixelele izinto.
We will talk about this.	Siza kuthetha ngale nto.
But you need to know this.	Kodwa kufuneka ukwazi oku.
But he did not come.	Kodwa akazange eze.
Yes! 	Ewe!
Tomorrow, you will be nothing to me.	Ngomso, awuyi kuba yinto kum.
I think often.	Ndicinga rhoqo.
It seems to us.	Kubonakala ngathi.
I made it easy.	Ndenze lula.
The big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu.
A little about us.	Kancinci ngathi.
Certainly not now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, hayi ngoku.
This is probably not necessary.	Oku mhlawumbi akuyomfuneko.
Police everywhere.	Amapolisa kuyo yonke indawo.
He knew it was true.	Wayesazi ukuba yinyani.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.
I feel a little better.	Ndiziva ngcono kancinci.
He made my job difficult.	Wenza umsebenzi wam ube nzima.
But not you again.	Kodwa hayi wena kwakhona.
Not for me.	Akukho kum.
How about this.	Njani ngale nto.
I am the only one.	ndim ndedwa.
It's hard to see outside.	Kunzima ukubona ngaphandle.
It's not easy being me.	Akukho lula ukuba ndim.
No, not at all.	Hayi, akunjalo ncam.
This is probably better.	Oku mhlawumbi kungcono.
He certainly looked for a place.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wajonga indawo.
He did his job.	Wenze umsebenzi wakhe.
It will be better for you.	Kuya kuba ngcono kuwe.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
He knows about you.	Uyazi ngawe .
Not there.	Akukho apho.
But there is nothing better than nothing.	Kodwa akukho ngcono kakhulu kunokuba akukho nto.
I need to talk to her now.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ngoku.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
Maybe he, too.	Mhlawumbi naye, naye.
I haven't thought about you at all until now.	Khange ndicinge ngawe kwaphela kude kube ngoku.
You know you have to.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka.
So again, he would need help.	Ngoko kwakhona, wayeza kufuna uncedo.
He tried one.	Wazama enye.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
It is impossible to know if this will happen.	Akunakwenzeka ukwazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
He is the only one.	Nguye yedwa.
He would do that.	Wayeza kwenza njalo.
I know who she is.	Ndiyamazi ukuba ngubani.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange ayenze loo nto.
I thought it was him.	Ndandicinga ukuba nguye.
Probably not everyone.	Mhlawumbi hayi wonke umntu.
He wants to know what there is to see.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuba kukho ntoni ukubona.
He did not know exactly what he would do.	Wayengazi ncam ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
I don't know what else.	Andazi ukuba yintoni enye.
He lives with her.	Uhlala naye.
But not you.	Kodwa hayi nawe.
This will happen again.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kwakhona.
I do not know better.	Andazi ngcono.
I don't even know how to talk to him.	Andazi nokuba ndithethe njani naye.
But all of us.	Kodwa sonke sobabini.
Probably no one knows why.	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu wazi ukuba kutheni kwakhona.
It's the same thing here.	Yinto enye apha.
Until then, he remains in prison.	Kude kube ngoko, uhlala entolongweni.
I will stay with you.	Ndiya kuhlala nawe.
He will say nothing.	Akayi kuthetha nto.
Again, not always.	Kwakhona, akukho rhoqo.
He had to go.	Kwafuneka ahambe.
He thought everyone did it.	Wayecinga ukuba wonke umntu wenze njalo.
It's better there.	Kungcono apho.
What is your problem.	Yintoni ingxaki yakho.
But there is a way to do it.	Kodwa kukho indlela yokwenza oko.
He did not speak to her.	Akazange athethe naye.
But he knew what it was.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba yintoni na.
He does not want to.	Akafuni.
I can do it well.	Ndingayenza kakuhle.
You told me that too.	Nawe undixelele lonto.
You like it.	Uyayithanda.
Not later.	Akukho kamva.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi mna.
But this is not the case today.	Kodwa oku akunjalo namhlanje.
What's the matter.	Yintoni ingxaki.
No, not today.	Hayi, hayi namhlanje.
Now, when.	Ngoku, xa .
He knew everything.	Wayesazi yonke into.
That's the person.	Ngumntu lowo.
But it will not last.	Kodwa akuyi kuhlala.
He can play.	Uyakwazi ukudlala.
Sounds good.	Kubonakala kulungile.
House.	Indlu .
Something happened.	Kukho into eyenzekayo.
Or, even.	Okanye, nokuba.
Please go there now.	Nceda uye apho ngoku.
That's me.	Ndim ke lowo.
I know that is not the case.	Ndiyazi ukuba akunjalo.
It's hard to do.	Kunzima ukwenza.
No one knew for sure.	Akukho mntu wayesazi nto ngokuqinisekileyo.
I don't know what will happen to him.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
That will be so.	Oko kuya kuba njalo.
He told me it would get better.	Wandixelela ukuba kuya kuba ngcono.
Not the police.	Hayi amapolisa.
That's the way he wants it.	Yiloo ndlela afuna ngayo.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
I will make it happen.	Ndiza kuyenza yenzeke.
That can be difficult.	Oko kunokuba nzima.
It's your person.	Ngumntu wakho.
Just coffee.	Ikofu nje.
I'm sure of it.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo.
I thought it would be easy.	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba lula.
He thought he was a man.	Wayecinga ukuba yindoda.
It is unlikely that this will happen.	Akunakwenzeka ukuba kwenzeke.
You need to know, here, what you look like.	Kufuneka uyazi, apha, ukuba ukhangeleka njani.
But he does not always think so.	Kodwa akacingi njalo.
But there is a problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki.
You like it.	Uyayithanda.
Certainly too, too.	Ngokuqinisekileyo naye, naye.
you say.	uthi.
I thought you knew.	Bendicinga uyazi.
What then.	Yintoni na ke.
That can be so.	Oko kunokuba njalo.
I suspect that to be true.	Ndiyarhana ukuba yinyani leyo.
Very nice place.	Indawo entle kakhulu.
That is a new thing.	Yinto entsha leyo.
He can never do that.	Akanakuze ayenze loo nto.
Here, there is none.	Apha, akukho.
He did not sit down.	Khange ahlale phantsi.
I want money.	Ndifuna imali.
Soon you will be able to do that alone.	Kungekudala uza kuyenza loo nto wedwa.
So yes, no.	Ngoko ewe, hayi.
He did not, but he agreed.	Akazange, kodwa wavuma.
Not so much, when you think about it.	Hayi kakhulu, xa ucinga ngayo.
So much never.	Kakhulu zange.
.	.
Have a long time.	Ngaba ixesha elide.
.	.
That can be so.	Oko kunokuba njalo.
He started walking.	Waqalisa ukuhamba.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wenze njalo.
Or, it seems to us.	Okanye, kubonakala ngathi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He looked further.	Wajonga ngakumbi.
Maybe he didn't know.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi.
You know what you need to do.	Uyayazi into ekufuneka uyenzile.
That is true.	Ukuba yinyani leyo.
Nobody lives there.	Akukho mntu uhlala apho.
It happened to me.	Kwenzeke kum.
No!' 	Hayi!'
Now you are here.	Ngoku ulapha.
No one deserves it.	Akukho mntu ufanele.
Seeing my dog.	Ukubona inja yam.
It's a little hard to talk about right now.	Kunzima kancinci ukuthetha ngoku.
Maybe this is okay.	Mhlawumbi oku kulungile.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze into.
I hope you know what it means to me.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyazi ukuba kuthetha kangakanani kum.
You should know that by now.	Ufanele ukwazi oko ngoku.
No one knew where he was.	Akukho mntu wayesazi apho.
It's hard to do everything.	Kunzima ukwenza yonke into.
She is not here now.	Akakho ngoku.
Maybe it is me.	Mhlawumbi ndim.
I do not want to go anywhere.	Andifuni uye ndawo.
Well, this is not the case.	Ewe, oku akunjalo.
I will definitely do this again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza le nto kwakhona.
Certainly, he did not speak.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, akazange athethe.
It is so.	Kuba njalo.
That happened a lot.	Oko kwenzeka kakhulu.
He did not make it easy.	Akazange enze lula.
Not just this.	Hayi nje le.
In it, you should have been with me again.	Kuyo, bekufanele ukuba ube nam kwakhona.
It's just, you know.	Yinto nje, uyazi.
Is there any other way to do this.	Ngaba kukho enye indlela yokwenza oku.
Don't go too far.	Musa ukuya kude kakhulu.
No way, but there it is.	Akukho ndlela, kodwa nantso.
Saying things out.	Ukuthetha izinto ngaphandle.
He never said that.	Akazange athethe loo nto.
He just wanted to be away.	Wayefuna kuphela ukuba kude.
Everyone wants that.	Wonke umntu ufuna loo nto.
There is really no way out of this.	Akukho ndlela ngenene kule nto.
I want you to be like me.	Ndingathanda ukuba ube njengam.
I do not know now.	Andazi nam ngoku.
I thought about you a lot, too.	Ndicinge ngawe kakhulu, nam.
Finally he says it's time.	Ekugqibeleni uthi lixesha.
Than you are than me.	Kunokuba wena kunam.
What r u doing.	Wenza ntoni.
Not so obvious.	Hayi ngokucacileyo.
What happened to that.	Kwenzeka ntoni ngaloo nto.
For now .	Okwangoku .
Not only that.	Akunjalo kuphela.
I know immediately everything.	Ndiyazi ngokukhawuleza yonke into.
Low but not out.	Phantsi kodwa hayi ngaphandle.
He didn't know if he wanted to know.	Wayengazi ukuba uyafuna na ukwazi.
That's the problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki.
But you know.	Kodwa uyazi.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
Not just a little, but a lot.	Hayi nje kancinci, kodwa kakhulu.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku .
It is certainly a good thing to do.	Ngokuqinisekileyo yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
Because now the problem.	Kuba ngoku ingxaki.
I want this today.	Ndifuna oku namhlanje.
Also money.	Kwakhona imali.
He wanted to do the work alone.	Wayefuna ukwenza umsebenzi wedwa.
Nobody now.	Akukho mntu ngoku.
You are right.	Uqinisekile.
Is true.	Yinyani.
Now, of course, we know why.	Ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo, siyazi ukuba kutheni.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, uyenzile.
I think we did.	Ndicinga ukuba senze njalo.
You will be great.	Uya kuba kakhulu.
Just, all right.	Nje, kulungile.
Don't stay here.	Musa ukuhlala apha.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
I think he should do that.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka enze njalo.
And then! 	Ke ngoku!
You should have known better, really.	Bekufanele ukuba uyazi ngcono, ngenene.
Not that it will happen.	Akunjalo ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
But, he is here.	Kodwa, ulapha.
He wanted to do that, he understood.	Wayefuna ukuba enjenjalo, waqonda.
No!' 	Hayi!'
he said.	uthe.
He did not.	Akazange.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
He didn't know how to do it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze njani.
I'll stay here.	Ndiza kuhlala apha.
This is a good thing.	Yinto entle le.
What he knew now.	Oko wayesazi ngoku.
.	.
I could not do that.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
Slowly, yes.	Kancinci, ewe.
Not time.	Hayi ixesha.
One is a man.	Omnye yindoda.
Or do something.	Okanye wenze into.
Well, you know why.	Ewe, uyazi ukuba kutheni.
So that's it.	Ngoko ke yinto.
I will not have it.	Andiyi kuba nayo.
You can only be your own person.	Unokuba ngumntu wakho kuphela.
.	.
It has never been so before.	Zange kube njalo ngaphambili.
He did not know exactly where he was.	Wayengazi ncam ukuba uphi.
I'm sure.	Ndiqinisekile.
He thought so too.	Naye wayecinga njalo.
But we will do it one day.	Kodwa siza kuyenza ngenye imini.
He will have to stop immediately.	Kuya kufuneka ayeke ngokukhawuleza.
I wish that was true.	Ndinqwenela ukuba yinyani leyo.
Not with him.	Hayi naye.
I'm not sure how I reacted to this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani ngale nto.
I don't know how we did it.	Andazi ukuba senze njani.
He would need time.	Wayeza kufuna ixesha.
Tell me what happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Now there is another.	Ngoku kukho enye.

You have to do it.	Kufuneka wenze.
You have done well so far.	Wenze kakuhle kude kube ngoku.
He looked away.	Wajonga kude.
But again, he did what he wanted to do.	Kodwa kwakhona, wenza oko ufuna.
I will be with her soon.	Ndiza kuba naye kungekudala.
It can also be difficult to read.	Kwakhona kunokuba nzima ukufunda.
It will come down.	Kuya kuza phantsi.
He looks just a little bit.	Ubonakala nje kancinci .
I do not want her to stay with me.	Andifuni ahlale nam.
He wanted something big.	Wayefuna into enkulu.
You will be alone.	Uzakuba wedwa.
I wonder.	Ndiyazibuza.
That's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu leyo.
But that does not seem to be the case for me.	Kodwa kubonakala ukuba akunjalo kum.
As big as you like.	Enkulu njengoko uthanda.
He wanted, too.	Wayefuna, kakhulu.
I need help.	Ndifuna uncedo.
He just wanted to help.	Wayefuna nje ukunceda.
I had to think clearly.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngokucacileyo.
I can't stay long.	Andikwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide.
Maybe that's why.	Mhlawumbi yiloo nto.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
No one really knows what happened.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokwenene ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
He acted quickly.	Wenza ngokukhawuleza.
That really, really fast.	Oko ngokwenene, ngokukhawuleza ngokwenene.
So, yes.	Ngoko, ewe.
He has to do it.	Kufuneka ayenze.
Not just for him.	Akukho nje kuye.
We know it is.	Siyazi ukuba yiyo.
Not me, but with him.	Hayi nam, kodwa kunye naye.
That obviously you want.	Oko kucacile ukuba uyafuna.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Mhlawumbi akafuni.
But you have to do it now.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze ngoku.
He knew he had to have it.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka abe nayo.
But little by little.	Kodwa kancinci kancinci.
Well, he will.	Kulungile, uya kwenza.
Or you know who he is.	Okanye uyazi ukuba ngubani.
Of course you have to do that.	Ewe kufuneka wenze njalo.

I feel things.	Ndiziva izinto.
But you do not have to.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze njalo.
For now, no problem.	Okwangoku, akukho ngxaki.

No one is coming to you.	Akukho mntu uza kuwe.
Or if anyone is thinking of doing it.	Okanye ukuba nabani na ucinga ukwenza.
But sooner or later it will happen again.	Kodwa kungekudala okanye kamva kuya kwenzeka kwakhona.
But it's just one man.	Kodwa yindoda enye nje.
this is just a man.	yindoda nje le.
Everything else.	Yonke enye enye into.
But he is clearly visible.	Kodwa ubonakala ngokucacileyo.

He thought he could never.	Wayecinga ukuba akanakuze.

I can't do this again.	Andikwazi ukwenza oku kwakhona.
Not at all.	Akunjalo kwaphela.
It does not have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba .

He seemed, that's why.	Wayebonakala, yiyo loo nto.
It doesn't have to be far.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kude.

In my own way.	Ngendlela yam.
But he sat down.	Kodwa wahlala phantsi.
We know where we are going.	Siyazi apho siya khona.
However.	Kodwa ke .
He didn't know what exactly it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni kanye kanye.
It’s not as easy as it seems, you know.	Akukho lula njengoko kubonakala, uyazi.
He had better stay there.	Kungcono ahlale apho.

I was thinking a lot about it, for sure.	Bendicinga kakhulu ngayo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Everything to me.	Yonke into kum.
This is not necessary.	Oku akuyomfuneko.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
This, of course, is not the case.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunjalo.
You knew you knew.	Ubusazi ukuba uyazi.
That's it now.	Nantso ke ngoku.
Or even it will happen.	Okanye nokuba kuya kwenzeka.
I did not want anything bad to happen to him.	Ndandingafuni ukuba kwenzeke into embi kakhulu kuye.
You have become something to me.	Ube into kum.
Another place.	Enye indawo.
He didn't know he was here.	Wayengazi ukuba ulapha.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
Yes, but how? 	Ewe, kodwa njani?
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
He will not.	Akayi.
I don't want you to do that.	Andifuni ukuba wenze loo nto.
This, not so much.	Lo, hayi kakhulu.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But outside.	Kodwa ngaphandle.
Yes, we will talk about it, but not now.	Ewe, siza kuthetha ngayo, kodwa hayi ngoku.
She had to go to him.	Kwafuneka aye kuye.
Not for me though.	Hayi kum kodwa.
Or something like that.	Okanye into enjalo.
If not, that's fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, kulungile.
But it requires work.	Kodwa kufuna umsebenzi.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
he thought.	wacinga.
Only better is better.	Kuphela ngcono kungcono.
I know what's coming.	Ndiyayazi into ezayo.
There is a way to do it, you know.	Kukho indlela yokwenza, uyazi.
It's just that it's time.	Kuphela nje ukuba lixesha.
Another big one.	Enye enkulu.
I would like to talk to him only.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha naye kuphela.
This makes it even more difficult.	Oku kwenza kube nzima ngakumbi.
Looks like nothing.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho nto .
He did not say much.	Akazange athethe kakhulu.
It's just too big.	Yinto nje enkulu kakhulu.
He needs help.	Ufuna uncedo.
All this.	Yonke le nto.
Is true.	Yinyani.
No one else.	Akukho mntu omnye.
Someone has to tell the truth.	Kufuneka umntu athethe inyani.
But clearly man.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo umntu.
We know about you.	Siyazi ngawe.
I did not know better.	Ndandingazi ngcono.
He went to work and did his job.	Waya emsebenzini wenza umsebenzi wakhe.
This is a good thing to have.	Le yinto entle ukuba nayo.
Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacinga.
I don't want that to be tonight.	Andifuni ukuba kube njalo ngokuhlwanje.
He's just trying to find his way.	Uzama nje ukufumana indlela yakhe.
Probably too soon.	Mhlawumbi ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
It will be easier for you.	Kuya kuba lula kuwe.
It certainly seems he is not at home right now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi akakho ekhaya ngoku.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo nje.
At this point.	Kule ndawo.
I'm not sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
I would like to know why.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
Everyone has to go there.	Wonke umntu kufuneka aye apho.
You do not think well.	Awucingi kakuhle.
One, but not another.	Enye, kodwa hayi enye.
Indeed, that is what happened.	Ngokwenene, oko kwenzeka.
Not so with this one.	Akunjalo ngale.
Me, not someone else.	Mna, hayi omnye umntu.
For now.	Okwangoku.
He was not there.	Wayengekho apho.
Is that it.	Ngaba yiloo nto.
To do my thing.	Ukwenza into yam.
I would like to see something soon.	Ndingathanda ukubona into ngokukhawuleza.
Or last night or tomorrow night.	Okanye phezolo okanye ngomso ebusuku.
He did.	Wakwenza.
But he also said.	Kodwa naye wathi .
This will not end well.	Oku akuyi kuphela kakuhle.
He knew everyone.	Wayesazi wonke umntu.
But do not go too fast.	Kodwa musa ukuya apho ngokukhawuleza.
No problem then.	Akukho ngxaki ke.
You will have a hard time finding one.	Uya kuba nzima ukufumana enye.
Quick, really.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokwenene.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
No one really knows.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokwenene.
This is good.	Oku kulungile.
Nobody wants to talk.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuthetha.
All right, all right.	Kulungile, kulungile ke.
It has to be me.	Kufuneka abe ndim.
If that is possible.	Ukuba oko kunokwenzeka.
Too bad .	Kakubi kakhulu .
he wanted to know.	wayefuna ukwazi.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ngokwenene.
But now, the problem.	Kodwa ngoku, ingxaki.
I mean, not exactly.	Ndiya kuthetha, hayi ncam.
He did not speak.	Khange athethe.
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
One has to stop the way.	Umntu kufuneka ayeke indlela.
I'm not entirely sure.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo.
It seems like a long time ago.	Kubonakala ngathi kudala.
Tom is not going anywhere.	UTom akayi ndawo.
That way, that way.	Ngaloo ndlela, ngaloo ndlela.
So not much is happening.	Ngoko akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo.
You do well though.	Wenza kakuhle kodwa.
I'm sure.	Ndiqinisekile.
But not at night, no.	Kodwa hayi ebusuku, hayi.
He can't sit down.	Akakwazi ukuhlala phantsi.
Less reading.	Ukufunda kancinci.
He will have to do it now.	Kuya kufuneka ayenze ngoku.
I'm not sure what he was going to do with it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wayeza kwenza ntoni ngayo.
So there you are.	Ngoko nantso.
I do not know .	Andazi .
He had to do something else.	Kwafuneka enze enye into.
But not here.	Kodwa hayi apha.
To the end.	Ukuya ekugqibeleni.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
Everyone wants their money.	Wonke umntu ufuna imali yakhe.
All right, tell me.	Kulungile, ndixelele.
I knew it.	Ndandisazi.
But do not stay too long.	Kodwa musa ukuhlala ixesha elide.
I think it is absolutely true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani ngokupheleleyo.
He never talked about it.	Akazange athethe ngayo kwaphela.
Maybe something is me.	Mhlawumbi into ndim.
Very nice place.	Indawo entle kakhulu.
Just because he is a good man.	Kuba nje yindoda entle le.
It was also not necessary.	Kwakhona kwakungeyomfuneko.
I don't really know how it happened.	Andazi ngokwenene ukuba kwenzeke njani.
It's hard for me.	Kunzima kum.
She wanted to go with him.	Wayefuna ukuhamba naye.
Is that possible? 	Ngaba oko kunokwenzeka?
She sits down.	Uhlala phantsi.
He will do it one day.	Uza kuyenza ngenye imini.
I know what it will be like.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba njani.
I never went there myself.	Andizange ndiye apho mna.
But nowhere.	Kodwa akukho ndawo.
Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.
I'm not sure at all.	Andiqinisekanga kwaphela.
Everything happened so fast.	Yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
He knew everything.	Wayesazi yonke into .
I wish it were so.	Ndingathanda ukuba kube njalo.
Well, not just you, all of us.	Ewe, hayi wena kuphela, sonke.
Because you also think you know everything.	Kuba kwakhona ucinga ukuba wazi yonke into.
You know, it's good for him.	Uyazi, kulungile kuye.
You think fast.	Ucinga ngokukhawuleza.
Yes .	Ewe .
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka uyenze.
He asked for a quick decision.	Wacela isigqibo ngokukhawuleza.
That will do for me.	Oko kuya kwenza kum.
I hope you did it once or better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza kanye okanye ngcono.
.	.
It's one thing for sure.	Yinto enye ngokuqinisekileyo.
I knew a lot.	Ndandisazi kakhulu.
He went to work early.	Waya emsebenzini kwangethuba.
He did not know where or why.	Wayengazi ukuba phi okanye kutheni.
Just the way you did now.	Kanye ngale ndlela wenze ngayo ngoku.
I'll talk to you again later.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kwakhona kamva.
It's as hard as you want.	Kunzima njengoko ufuna.
Everyone says the same thing.	Wonke umntu uthetha into enye.
.	.
What was he thinking? 	Wayecinga ntoni?
It will be much better.	Kuya kuba ngcono kakhulu.
If not too much.	Ukuba akukho kakhulu enye.
I want you here too.	Ndifuna wena apha nam.
I do not know now.	Andazi ngoku .

But that is not the case.	Kodwa ngokwenene akunjalo.
He will not speak.	Akayi kuthetha.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
We really need to talk about it.	Kufuneka ngokwenene ukuthetha ngayo.
I thought it was impossible.	Ndandicinga ukuba akunakwenzeka.
Ok then.	Kulungile ke.
He agreed.	Wavuma ke.
Nobody knew anything about it.	Akukho mntu wayesazi nto ngayo.
It's hard to say.	Kunzima ukuthetha.
Probably always.	Mhlawumbi rhoqo.
I wonder if that is true.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba yinyani na leyo.
I know he wasn't.	Ndiyazi ukuba wayengekho.
You have to go to him.	Kufuneka uye kuye.
One for me.	Enye kum.
He was not alone in this.	Wayengekho yedwa kule nto.
I hope you can.	Ndiyathemba ukuba unokuba njalo.
Not exactly.	Hayi ncam.
Clearly, he was thinking for a long time.	Kucacile ukuba wayecinga ixesha elide.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
It's just hard to live that far.	Kunzima nje ukuhlala kude kangaka.
.	.
Not just plain.	Hayi nje ngokucacileyo.
One more thing too.	Enye into nayo.
As required.	Njengoko kufuneka.
I can not speak.	Andikwazi kuthetha.

Nice to talk to you again.	Ndiyavuya ukuthetha nawe kwakhona.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
He would say something bad.	Wayeza kuthetha into embi.
Maybe that's me.	Mhlawumbi ndim lowo.
And he said to me.	Wathi ke kum.
I would definitely like to get one soon.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndingathanda ukufumana enye kwangoko.
But yes.	Kodwa ewe .

This is me .	Ndim lo .
It should have been easier.	Bekufanele kube lula.
But that is not the case right now.	Kodwa akunjalo okwangoku.
He always makes it happen.	Uhlala esenza ukuba kwenzeke.
We will be with him.	Siza kuba naye.
He just can't tell.	Akakwazi nje ukuxelela.
Not always.	Akunjalo rhoqo.

I do not know now.	Andazi ngoku.
We will stay for a while.	Siza kuhlala kancinci.
I try everything.	Ndizama yonke into.

Something else happened.	Kukho enye into eyenzekayo.

I did not speak to him.	Khange ndithethe naye.
You think too much.	Ucinga kakhulu.

There really is.	Kukho ngokwenene.
You will need to know about this.	Kuya kufuneka uyazi ngale nto.

You may have noticed.	Usenokuba waqonda.
I'm not entirely sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ngayo.
I did all that.	Ndenze yonke loo nto.
Probably not immediately.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo ngoko nangoko.
Well, that's fine for me.	Ewe, kulungile kum.
Yes, this is really happening.	Ewe, oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
I know how it will end.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuphela njani.

If you did, you should tell me.	Ukuba uyenzile, kufuneka undixelele.
We have done enough of that.	Senze ngokwaneleyo oko.
Now fast to go today.	Ngoku ngokukhawuleza ukuya namhlanje.
Very much.	Kakhulu, kakhulu.
But no one is talking to me.	Kodwa akukho mntu uthetha nam.
Well, not exactly.	Ewe, hayi kanye kanye.
He asked for time.	Wacela ixesha.
I never told anyone.	Zange ndixelele mntu.
But it will probably be so.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kuya kuba njalo.
Tell me why you want to go.	Ndixelele ukuba kutheni ufuna ukuhamba.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
He didn't really want to.	Wayengafuni ngokwenene.
I will do all that.	Ndiya kuyenza yonke loo nto.
Well, you already know that.	Ewe, sele uyayazi loo nto.
But you know that it is impossible.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba akunakwenzeka oko.
I will not do it.	Andiyi kuyenza.
But for now, not always.	Kodwa oko okwangoku, hayi rhoqo.
We have made a decision.	Senze isigqibo.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Slowly but surely.	Kancinci kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo.
No, no, no, no.	Hayi, hayi, hayi, hayi.
You know that.	Uyayazi lonto.
Or to me.	Okanye kum.
He told me.	Wandixelela.
This will only be one thing.	Oku kuya kuba yinto enye kuphela.
I'll talk about how to do that later.	Ndiza kuthetha ngendlela yokwenza oko kamva.
.	.
I would like.	Ndingathanda.
Ok then.	Kulungile ke.
There is always a way.	Kuhlala kukho indlela.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I have to do the same.	Nam kufuneka ndiyenze loo nto.
He did, too.	Wenza njalo, naye.
This will happen once and for all.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kanye.
Nothing, too.	Akukho nto, kakhulu.
Of course not.	Hayi ke kodwa.
I will talk to him.	Ndiza kuthetha naye.
He would do that.	Wayeza kwenza njalo.
I knew it would be so.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
But he soon felt bad about it.	Kodwa kungekudala waziva kakubi ngayo.
He never sat down.	Zange ahlale phantsi.
You know what you need to know.	Uyayazi into ekufuneka uyazi.
I think it's time.	Ndicinga ukuba lixesha.
But more and more.	Kodwa ngakumbi ngakumbi.
Great, too.	Enkulu, nayo.
We will have to go far.	Kuza kufuneka siye kude.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
I know how.	Ndiyazi ukuba njani.
So maybe every other day.	Ngoko mhlawumbi yonke enye imini.
He looked at me.	Wajonga kum.
.	.
He was later.	Waba kamva.
Well, not so with us.	Ewe, akunjalo ngathi .
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He does not know when or who he is.	Akazi ukuba nini okanye ngubani.
We need to act immediately.	Kufuneka senze ngoko nangoko.
I never told anyone to do it.	Khange ndixelele mntu ukuba ayenze.
Do not do that at night.	Musa ukuyenza loo nto ebusuku.
I want one.	Ndifuna enye.
I apologize again.	Ndicela uxolo kwakhona.
But it will be difficult.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngaloo nto.
You should know this.	Ufanele ukwazi oku.
I want to know why.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
But he never, not exactly, never again.	Kodwa akazange, hayi ncam, hayi kwakhona.
That is absolutely true.	Yinyani leyo ngokupheleleyo.
I want you now.	Ndifuna wena ngoku.
Because he tried so hard.	Kuba wazama kakhulu.
But now.	Kodwa ngoku.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
It means that if you want to get better.	Kuthetha ukuba ukuba ufuna ukuba ngcono.
I think it will be so.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
There is just no other way.	Akukho nje enye indlela.
This is what you are here for.	Le ulapha ngayo.
Not really now.	Hayi nyani ngoku.
Well, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile ke.
I know all of that.	Ndiyayazi yonke loo nto.
I just want time.	Ndifuna nje ixesha.
.	.
What is my problem? 	Yintoni ingxaki yam?
he thought.	wacinga.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
He knew he could do it.	Wayesazi ukuba angayenza loo nto.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula.
Tom sat down.	UTom wahlala phantsi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Everyone says.	Wonke umntu uthi.
They drown.	Wazama wazama.
He did that.	Uyenzile loo nto.
I do not want that to happen to me.	Andifuni yenzeke kum lonto.
It happens very often.	Kwenzeka rhoqo kakhulu.
She is not.	Akakho.
I did that.	Ndenze oko.
We will definitely do it now.	Ngokwenene siza kuyenza ngoku.
I'm happy for you.	Ndiyavuya ngawe.
Or whatever, about that.	Okanye nantoni na, ngaloo nto.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi ukwenza le nto.
He was not.	Wayengekho.
But, that's fine.	Kodwa, kulungile.
I think you would like to know.	Ndicinga ukuba ungathanda ukwazi.
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka .
I did not know why.	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni.
Long time ago.	Kudala kakhulu.
Not at night.	Hayi ebusuku.
I'm not entirely sure about this.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ngale nto.
You want too many things.	Ufuna izinto ezininzi kakhulu.
He thought he had told me too much.	Wayecinga ukuba undixelele kakhulu.
Not so, now.	Akunjalo, ngoku.
What could it be.	Ingaba yintoni na.
I feel confident about it.	Ndiziva ndiqinisekile ngayo.
That's a very good thing.	Yinto entle kakhulu leyo.
I do not understand very well.	Andiqondi kakuhle.
You know what this is.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni na le.
He would love to talk to you.	Angathanda ukuthetha nawe.
But you may be alone.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba ulapha wedwa.
Just tell me where it is.	Ndixelele nje ukuba iphi.
A little earlier than he wanted.	Kancinci ngaphambili kunokuba wayefuna.
Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.
Surely that is possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko kunokwenzeka.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
Yes, it will be difficult.	Ewe, kuya kuba nzima.
He did not know how.	Wayengazi ukuba njani.
He checked the time.	Wajonga ixesha.
It really could be better.	Ngokwenene kunokuba ngcono.
This has to happen.	Oku kufuneka kwenzeke.
I have to do that.	Kufuneka ndiyenze loo nto.
Sounds like okay.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile.
Dog, too.	Inja, nayo.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
It's a very bad thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu.
He is not very frequent.	Akakho rhoqo kakhulu.
But no, nothing.	Kodwa hayi, akukho nto.
I don't know why anyone.	Andazi ukuba kutheni nabani na.
Yes, you, too.	Ewe, nawe, nawe.
I'm trying something else.	Ndizama enye into.
But something happened.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo.
Not much of mine has ever ended.	Akukho nto ingako yam kuye kwaphela.
But he stayed.	Kodwa wahlala.
You should know that too.	Ufanele ukwazi oko nawe.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I'm not sure what you did with it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wenze ntoni ngayo.
We'll talk.	Siza kuthetha.
That's the same thing.	Yinto enye leyo.
I doubt you know.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba uyazi.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
But not before.	Kodwa hayi ngaphambili.
I'm trying to do something right here.	Ndizama ukwenza into elungileyo apha.
He tried to speak hard.	Wazama ukuthetha nzima.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Nobody likes the police.	Akukho mntu uthanda amapolisa.
Or no one at all.	Okanye akukho mntu kwaphela.
It just might be easier to get better.	Kuphela nje kunokuba lula ukuba ngcono.
I was just thinking about everything.	Bendicinga nje ngayo yonke into.
I will do it.	Ndiya kuyenza.
Or really.	Okanye ngenene.
But for now it's okay.	Kodwa okwangoku kulungile.
One does not know.	Umntu akazi.
Not just for us.	Hayi nje ngathi.
Or not always.	Okanye hayi rhoqo.
It would be a bad thing to do.	Kuya kuba yinto embi ukuyenza.
He does not have to.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba enze njalo.
Absolutely true.	Yinyani ngokupheleleyo.
No one was going to stay there.	Akukho mntu wayeza kuhlala apho.
It will be with you when there is a problem.	Kuya kuba nawe xa kukho ingxaki.
I can't see how I did it.	Andikwazi kubonakala ukuba ndenze njani.
Not just a little bit.	Hayi nje kancinci.
He did not want to go.	Wayengafuni ukuya.
Whatever it is, you know.	Nokuba yintoni na, uyazi.
A new way.	Indlela entsha.
That's it for now.	Yiloo nto okwangoku.
.	.
So we had to do.	Ngoko kwafuneka senze.
I know you well.	Ndikwazi kakuhle nawe.
With everything, really.	Ngayo yonke into, ngokwenene.
It is very difficult for him.	Kunzima kakhulu kuye.
I'm not sure how.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba njani.
But in the end he did not do this.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni akazange akwenze oku.
But this is not the case at all.	Kodwa oku akunjalo kwaphela.
But, of course, you know that.	Kodwa, ngokuqinisekileyo, uyayazi loo nto.
I know, my bad.	Ndiyazi, embi yam.
It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
But he didn't think of anything.	Kodwa akazange acinge nantoni na.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi loo nto.
He looked down the other way.	Wajonga phantsi ngenye indlela.
He just wanted to know.	Wayefuna nje ukwazi.
I don't want that to happen.	Andifuni ukuba oko kwenzeke.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But he will do this.	Kodwa uza kuyenza le nto.
he asked.	wabuza.
I did not speak.	Khange ndithethe.
Travel well.	Ukuhamba kakuhle.
Or if you want me too.	Okanye ukuba ufuna nam.
Nobody wants you to do that.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba wenze njalo.
What's happening.	Kwenzeka ntoni.
All, really.	Yonke, ngokwenene.
You can be there now.	Unokuba khona ngoku.
He must do so.	Kufuneka enjenjalo.
This seems very difficult.	Oku kubonakala kunzima kakhulu.
But this will happen again, someday.	Kodwa oku kuya kwenzeka kwakhona, ngenye imini.
Maybe someone is coming forward.	Mhlawumbi umntu uza ngaphambili.
Probably not always.	Mhlawumbi hayi rhoqo.
Would you like that.	Ngaba ungathanda ukuba .
But he could not speak for sure.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuthetha ngokuqinisekileyo.
Nothing else yet.	Akukho enye into okwangoku.
Or do you think you did.	Okanye ucinga ukuba wenza.
No, no.	Akunjalo, hayi.
Not that, when.	Hayi ukuba, nini.
I just want to talk.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha.
I know that too.	Nam ndiyayazi lonto.
Making it harder to drive.	Ukwenza ukuba nzima ukuqhuba.
That's what happened.	Yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
Not in this one.	Hayi kule.
But this is not necessary.	Kodwa oku akuyomfuneko.
There is something there.	Kukho into apho.
Going through this now.	Ukuhamba ngale nto ngoku.
I really want to.	Ndifuna ngokwenene.
But, maybe not.	Kodwa, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I just want to get better.	Ndifuna nje ukuba ngcono.
Well, it will always happen.	Kulungile, kuya kwenzeka njalo.
But he certainly knew why.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
No one is there.	Akukho mntu apho.
Everyone will be better.	Wonke umntu uya kuba ngcono.
he thought.	wacinga.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
What do you think?.	Ingaba ucinga ntoni?.
No, nothing much.	Hayi, akukho nto ingako.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
He has to stay here.	Kufuneka ahlale apha.
He did not want much.	Akazange afune nto ingako.
Only this once.	Kuphela oku kube kanye.
I have to do something about it.	Kufuneka ndenze into ngayo.
But no exception.	Kodwa akukho ngaphandle.
He won't do that.	Akayi kuyenza loo nto.
I told her not to do it.	Ndimxelele ukuba angayenzi.
You have to be.	Kufuneka ube.
Whatever he wants.	Nantoni na ayifunayo.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni.
But then something happened.	Kodwa ke kwenzeka enye into.
Now she knows what she wants.	Ngoku uyayazi into ayifunayo.
One day it will happen.	Ngenye imini kuya kwenzeka.
No better no.	Hayi ngcono hayi.
Where would you like to go?	Ungathanda ukuya phi.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ncam.
It's all very real.	Yonke yinyani kakhulu.
Do something else.	Ngaba enye into.
So, he realized it was him.	Ngoko, waqonda ukuba nguye.
Well done though.	Wenze kakuhle kodwa.
He must come immediately.	Kufuneka eze kwangoko.
You know, something like that.	Uyazi, into enjalo.
I'm scared again.	Ndiyoyika kwakhona.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Maybe he didn't go.	Mhlawumbi akazange ahambe.
Maybe all of us now.	Mhlawumbi sonke ngoku.
Maybe he had to do so.	Mhlawumbi kwafuneka enjenjalo.
You have to have it.	Kufuneka ube nayo.
I'm glad to have it.	Ndiyavuya ukuba nayo.
He says, therefore, that it is difficult.	Uthi, ke ngoko, ukuba kunzima.
But not entirely bad.	Kodwa hayi kakubi ngokupheleleyo.
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka.
That's yours.	Yinto yakho leyo.
So maybe you should tell me what happened.	Ngoko mhlawumbi ufanele undixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Not so now.	Akunjalo ngoku.
Come.	Uza .
No one deserves this.	Akukho mntu ufanele oku.
But it's the same thing.	Kodwa yinto enye.
That's him now.	Nguye lowo ngoku.
He was not.	Wayengekho.
Bad place.	Indawo embi.
You need to know.	Kufuneka ukwazi.
I did not go to the hospital.	Andizange ndiye esibhedlele.
I know all of that.	Ndiyayazi yonke loo nto.
This, he said, would be even more difficult.	Oku, uthe, kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
Maybe he is.	Mhlawumbi nguye .
I knew it wouldn't happen.	Ndandisazi ukuba akuyi kuba njalo.
I never did it then.	Andizange ndiyenze ngoko.
He started saying something else.	Waqalisa ukuthetha enye into.
What else .	Yintoni enye .
I will not do that.	andiyi kuyenza loo nto.
And he agreed.	Uye wavuma ke.
That's probably it.	Nto leyo mhlawumbi.
I have to tell her.	Kufuneka ndimxelele.
Someone else did that.	Omnye umntu wenze loo nto.
I know there is.	Ndiyazi ukuba kukho.
In the end, he made a decision.	Ekugqibeleni, wenza isigqibo.
You.	Wena .
I'm sorry.	Ndicela uxolo.
You do not want that to happen.	Awufuni ukuba oko kwenzeke.

Nothing.	Akukho nto.
He knows it is him.	Uyazi ukuba nguye.

Not far from here.	Akukho kude apha.
That will be something new.	Oko kuya kuba yinto entsha.
Not just for me.	Akukho nje kum.
I'm not going there.	Andiyi apho.

I hope you will stay here.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala apha.
Maybe one day.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini.
But that's it.	Kodwa yiloo nto.
.	.
So everyone says.	Ngoko wonke umntu uthi.

That's one good thing about it.	Yinto enye entle ngayo.
We will stay all day.	Siza kuhlala imini yonke.

But he didn't want me to do that.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuba ndenze loo nto.
But, but, but.	Kodwa, kodwa, kodwa.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
That happened, too.	Oko kwenzeka, kwakhona.
It's just not there.	Akukho nje.

Or, not more.	Okanye, hayi ngakumbi.
But something happened there.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo apho.
Great house.	Indlu enkulu.

But there is nothing here.	Kodwa akukho nto apha.
Not a bad bike.	Hayi ibhayisekile embi.
No! 	Hayi!
But, that requires money.	Kodwa, oko kufuna imali.
I don't want to be that way.	Andifuni ukuba njalo.

Yes, you should.	Ewe, ufanele.
I didn't really know, until now.	Andizange ndiyazi ngokwenene, kude kube ngoku.
He had to sit down.	Kwafuneka ahlale phantsi.
I had to say something.	Kwafuneka ndithethe into.
He knew this was coming.	Wayesazi ukuba oku kuza.
He has been with us all the way.	Ube nathi indlela yonke.
I'm not entirely sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ngokupheleleyo ukuba kutheni.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
Just an opportunity.	Ithuba nje.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
He said no, not really.	Wathi hayi, hayi ncam.
He understood then.	Waqonda ngoko.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
So tell me about it.	Ndixelele ke ngayo.
It seems to us.	Kubonakala ngathi.
Well, this is something for now.	Ewe, le yinto ngoku.
To him, but not so much.	Kuye, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Now he knew he had to do it.	Ngoku wayesazi ukuba umele ayenze.
I'll do another one.	Ndiza kwenza enye.
You know very well.	Uyazi kakuhle kakhulu.
No no! 	Hayi, hayi!
Because he did.	Kuba wenza njalo.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngokwenene.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke loo nto.
But it is not far away.	Kodwa akukho kude.
But it had to happen this way.	Kodwa kwafuneka ukuba kwenzeke ngale ndlela.
It will be so here.	Kuya kuba njalo apha.
As really very real.	Njengoko ngokwenene ngokwenene kakhulu.
Yeah, for now.	Ewe, okwangoku.
Not even difficult.	Hayi nokuba nzima.
That is difficult.	Kunzima ke oko.
But this thing.	Kodwa le nto.
He said yes, yes.	Wathi ngokuqinisekileyo, ewe.
Or someone did.	Okanye umntu wenza.
He wanted, now.	Wayefuna, ngoku.
I'm not sure what happened there.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na apho.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa ke kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
There is just this place.	Kukho nje le ndawo.
But that will not be the case.	Kodwa oko akuyi kuba njalo.
This ended for him.	Kwaphela oku kuye.
Nice to see you here.	Ndiyavuya ukubona apha.
But something happened.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo.
This happened here.	Oku kwenzeke apha.
I did not want him to leave.	Ndandingafuni ahambe.
I know all this.	Ndiyayazi yonke lento.
My problem is time.	Ingxaki yam lixesha.
He thought he knew something, but he didn't know who he was.	Wayecinga ukuba uyayazi into, kodwa wayengazi ukuba ngubani.
It's nothing.	Asiyonto.
So he was not.	Ngoko wayengekho.
But then he understood.	Kodwa ke waqonda.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Everyone knew what was going to happen.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
He did well.	Wenza kakuhle.
I don't think we should go to work tomorrow.	Andiqondi ukuba kufuneka siye emsebenzini ngomso.
When you think of something, it is real.	Xa ucinga into, yinyani.
As for? 	Ngoko?
I know!.	Ndiyazi!.
Absolutely with you.	Ngokupheleleyo nawe.
Not much.	Hayi, kakhulu.
he said.	uthe.
Tell me everything yourself.	Ndixelele yonke into wena.
Everywhere.	Kuyo yonke indawo.
You obviously love it.	Ngokucacileyo uyayithanda.
I would like to know more.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ngakumbi.
I hope you will be able to do that one day.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kukwazi ukwenza oko ngenye imini.
I can't be him.	Andikwazi ukuba nguye.
Too long.	Ixesha elide kakhulu.
bad.	embi.
I feel alone.	Ndiziva ndedwa.
Or make way.	Okanye wenze indlela.
This problem.	Le ngxaki .
This way, please.	Ngale ndlela, nceda.
There is only one place.	Kukho indawo enye kuphela.
This means fast.	Oku kuthetha ngokukhawuleza.
Now at home.	Ngoku ekhaya.
No, not me.	Hayi, hayi mna.
He knew everything about us.	Wayesazi yonke into ngathi.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
Outside, maybe not.	Ngaphandle, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
All right.	Kulungile.
Yeah, doing the same thing.	Ewe, ukwenza into enye.
I will do the same.	Nam ndiya kwenza njalo.
It's a little difficult.	Kunzima kancinci.
Something else is needed.	Kufuneka enye into.
Not anymore.	Akukho kwakhona.
I never went anywhere.	Andizange ndiye ndawo.
You do not have to know.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wazi.
Not so much, but enough.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa ngokwaneleyo.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
I think this is impossible.	Ndicinga ukuba oku akunakwenzeka.
He wanted to talk.	Wayefuna ukuthetha.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
This is clearly possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka ngokucacileyo.
I did it for you.	Ndenze kuwe.
Here, not so much.	Apha, hayi kakhulu.
He agreed to go.	Wavuma ukuya .
Here at this place, now.	Apha kule ndawo, ngoku.
He didn't really want to.	Wayengafuni ngokwenene.
This will do.	Oku kuya kwenza.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke loo nto.
Really all day.	Ngokwenene imini yonke.
Something very bad happened.	Kwenzeka into embi kakhulu.
He doesn't know it.	Akayazi.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka wenze.
Not going home.	Hayi ukuya ekhaya.
Now that doesn't seem to be the case.	Ngoku kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
There, now you know.	Apho, ngoku uyazi.
It's a really big deal.	Yinto enkulu ngokwenene.
I did not know how to do it.	Bendingazi ukuba ndenze njani.
It is not a matter of doing that.	Asiyonto yokwenza oko.
It's up to him alone.	Kuye yedwa.
He knows many things.	Wazi izinto ezininzi.
Maybe that’s a good thing, too.	Mhlawumbi yinto entle, nayo.
This is me.	Ndim lo.
Even if it's okay.	Nokuba kulungile.
Or how it happened.	Okanye ukuba kwenzeke njani.
But maybe there is another way to come.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kukho enye indlela ezayo.
You should be here.	Ufanele ukuba lapha.
He speaks well.	Uthetha kakuhle.
Only you and me.	Mna nawe kuphela.
He wanted to be here.	Wayefuna ukuba lapha.
You will need help.	Uya kufuna uncedo.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
I would absolutely love it.	Ndingathanda ngokupheleleyo.
Not now please.	Hayi ngoku nceda.
I will not say that.	Andiyi kuthetha loo nto.
All the way.	Kuyo yonke indlela.
He lives with her.	Uhlala naye.
Maybe someone here.	Mhlawumbi umntu apha.
But clearly not.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
That should have been easier.	Oko bekufanele ukuba kube lula.
Maybe we will.	Mhlawumbi siya kwenza njalo.
I just don't know.	Andazi nje.
But it also requires something bigger.	Kodwa kwakhona kufuna into enkulu.
I'm glad to have him here.	Ndiyavuya ukuba naye apha.
But he did not come.	Kodwa akazange eze.
Not the other way around.	Hayi ngenye indlela.
Really, someone did that.	Ngokwenene, kukho umntu owenza loo nto.
.	.
I know something about that.	Ndiyazi into ngaloo nto.
I want to go again.	Ndifuna ukuhamba kwakhona.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
That's the way we do it.	Yiloo ndlela esenza ngayo.
Eventually, you will want to know more.	Ekugqibeleni, uya kufuna ukwazi ngakumbi.
Yes I! 	Ewe mna!
He said it should be easy.	Wathi kufuneka kube lula.
I will stay only one.	Ndiza kuhlala enye kuphela.
Or you like it very much.	Okanye uyayithanda kakhulu.
Don't be like that.	Musa ukuba njalo.
But it happened yesterday.	Kodwa yenzeke izolo.
That's his problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki yakhe.
Yes, that is possible.	Ewe, oko kunokwenzeka.
This is really happening.	Oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
This will become apparent later.	Oku kuya kubonakala ngokucacileyo kamva.
For it will be so.	Kuba kuya kuba njalo.
To make it easier.	Ukwenza kube lula.
That's the thing about it.	Nantso into ngale nto.
I have done wrong.	Ndenze kakubi.
You have to be better.	Kufuneka ube ngcono.
But there is one major problem.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki enye enkulu.
You are trying to buy time.	Uzama ukuthenga ixesha.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
Go with it.	Ukuhamba nayo.
He made her go.	Wenza ukuba ahambe.
I want to be a good person.	Ndifuna ukuba ngumntu olungileyo.
he asked.	wabuza.
He's just a real man, real good.	Ungumntu nje ngenene, olungileyo ngenene.
Yes you feel bad.	Ewe uziva kakubi.
There is no peace.	Akukho uxolo.
He wanted to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi.
So he agreed.	Ngoko wavuma.
He wanted to go.	Wayefuna ukuhamba.
You may be that.	Usenokuba yiyo loo nto.
That will be the time.	Oko kuya kuba lixesha.
There is another way.	Kukho enye indlela.
Not by man.	Hayi ngumntu.
Not for long.	Hayi ixesha elide.
That's not the way things are now.	Akunjalo ngendlela izinto ngoku.
It's hard to be a man.	Kunzima ukuba yindoda.
Good thing, too.	Into entle, nayo.
That's another thing.	Nantso enye into.
This is not necessary at all.	Oku akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
You are doing much better this week.	Wenza ngcono kakhulu kule veki.
But this will not be easy.	Kodwa oku akuyi kuba lula kangako.
I feel very good.	Ndiziva kakuhle kakhulu.
Looks like he didn't go very far today.	Kubonakala ngathi khange ahambe kakhulu namhlanje.
I can't believe that's it.	Andikholelwa ukuba yiloo nto.
Maybe one day you want money fast.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini ufuna imali ngokukhawuleza.
Certainly not at home.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ekhaya.
Why, why, why.	Kutheni, kutheni, kutheni.
If you did, good job.	Ukuba uyenzile, umsebenzi olungileyo.
Your location.	Indawo yakho.
You know in advance.	Uyazi ngaphambili.
He said he did not know.	Wathi akazi.
He wanted to know why.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba kutheni.
It should have been easy enough.	Bekufanele ukuba kube lula ngokwaneleyo.
Being alone is good.	Ukuba wedwa kulungile.
I hope it won't be hard.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akuyi kuba nzima.
Big, big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu, enkulu.
I can't go right away.	Andikwazi ukuya ngoko nangoko.
That's all you need to know.	Yiyo yonke into ekufuneka uyazi.
Absolutely fine.	Kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
Probably no one else tried this method.	Mhlawumbi akukho mntu wazama ngale ndlela.
Just about this place.	Kanye ngale ndawo.
No, nothing.	Hayi, akukho nto.
I had to tell him something.	Kwafuneka ndimxelele into.
I know better now.	Ndiyazi ngcono ngoku.
But he did not just talk.	Kodwa akazange athethe nje.
I did not want to.	Ndandingafuni.
I'm glad you did.	Ndiyavuya kuba wenza njalo.
This is a great bike.	Le ibhayisekile enkulu.
That's him.	Nguye lowo.
I would like to go.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba.
I know a lot now.	Ndiyazi kakhulu ngoku.
Whatever you do right here, now.	Nokuba wenza ntoni kanye apha, ngoku.
I just thought.	Ndicinge nje.
But nothing.	Kodwa akukho nto.
I would like to do this.	Ndingathanda ukuyenza le nto.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
But he did not think.	Kodwa akazange acinge.
Right there .	Apho kanye .
Maybe you're here.	Mhlawumbi ulapha.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
We both know.	Sobabini siyazi.
So, whatever it is.	Ngoko, nokuba yintoni na.
Doing something is something.	Ukwenza into yinto.
But clearly not.	Kodwa ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
Not exactly a person.	Hayi ncam umntu.
So this.	Ngoko oku.
That certainly is not the case.	Oko ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
It's the same thing though.	Yinto enye kodwa.
He admitted this.	Wavuma oku.
This is good for me.	Oku kulungile kum.
That's it.	Yiyo loo nto.
But you need help.	Kodwa ufuna uncedo.
This is a bad thing.	Yinto embi le.
He doesn't know what it is.	Akayazi ukuba yintoni na.
I would like to know.	Ndingathanda ukwazi.
But maybe not for long.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi ixesha elide.
He wanted his money.	Wayefuna imali yakhe.
He has done this before.	Uye wakwenza oku ngaphambili.
He did not.	Akazange enze .
Now there is.	Ngoku kukho.
I'm afraid to make a decision.	Ndiyoyika ukwenza isigqibo.
That's what he wants.	Yiloo nto ayifunayo.
We, too.	Nathi, nathi.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo.
I did not know then.	Ndandingazi ngoko.
That's my way.	Nantso indlela yam.
Not in this place.	Hayi kule ndawo.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
But that's me.	Kodwa ndim lowo.
I've talked enough.	Ndithethe ngokwaneleyo.
But that is possible.	Kodwa oko kunokwenzeka.
Where is the problem.	Iphi ingxaki.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akazange.
You think about it.	Ucinga ngayo.
I hope you are doing well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenza kakuhle.
.	.
Very much.	Kakhulu, kakhulu.
But a little bit.	Kodwa kancinci.
Of course not.	Akunjalo ke.
.	.
But it is true.	Kodwa yinyani.
I know him now.	Ndiyamazi ngoku.
I'm not really sure yet.	Andiqinisekanga ngenene okwangoku.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
But yes, that is not possible.	Kodwa ewe, oko akunakwenzeka.
He just wanted everything.	Wayefuna nje yonke into.
Speaking, speaking, speaking.	Ukuthetha, ukuthetha, ukuthetha.
He did not want to help.	Wayengafuni ukunceda.
I don't like it either.	Nam andiyithandi.
Yes, certainly enough.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo ngokwaneleyo.
He should have stayed with her.	Bekufanele ahlale naye.
I want to do something great.	Ndifuna ukwenza into enkulu.
I didn't really know.	Ndandingazi ngokwenene.
I really want to go.	Ngokwenene, ndifuna ukuhamba.
He needed time alone.	Wayefuna ixesha eyedwa.
.	.
That will be true.	Oko kuya kuba yinyani.
One is time.	Enye lixesha.
There is no way.	Akukho ndlela.
I can't talk about it.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngayo.
Not even right.	Akukho nokuba kulungile.
He was completely visible.	Wayebonakala ngokupheleleyo.
You know that is not the case.	Uyazi ukuba akunjalo.
So, there is no place for you.	Ngoko ke, akukho ndawo yakho.
So it's hard.	Ngoko kunzima.
I know right away.	Ndiyayazi ngoko nangoko.
You never knew.	Zange wazi.
I know that, for sure.	Ndiyayazi loo nto, ngokuqinisekileyo.
No, too far.	Hayi, kude kakhulu.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
I know what happens in the end.	Ndiyayazi into eyenzekayo ekugqibeleni.
I can't do it.	Andikwazi ukuyenza.
No, no once not now.	Hayi, hayi kanye hayi ngoku.
But it is difficult.	Kodwa kunzima.
Nowhere.	Akakho ndawo.
He did not appear.	Akazange abonakale.
Or anyone.	Okanye nabani na.
Just, really.	Nje, ngokwenene.
I do not know everything.	Andazi yonke into.
Very really.	Kakhulu ngokwenene.
He did not know why.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
To him, to her.	Kuye, kuye.
I'll have to think.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge.
So it happened.	Ngoko kwenzeka oko.
Any longer .	Hayi kwaphela .
I did not really know how or why.	Ndandingazi ngokwenene ukuba njani okanye kutheni.
He knew very well.	Wayesazi kakhulu.
Only.	Kuphela nje .
He wants to help.	Ufuna ukunceda.
So, what? 	Yiyo, yintoni?
I'm not sure where else.	Andiqinisekanga ngenye indawo.
Tom didn't, really.	UTom akazange, ngokwenene.
Not really but what exactly.	Akunjalo kodwa yintoni ngokwenene.
What the hell?!.	Yintoni?!.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka uyenze.
Yeah, for now.	Ewe, okwangoku.
But he just stays.	Kodwa uhlala nje.
I'm so glad to be here.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuba lapha.
No one knows for sure.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
He didn't even know why.	Wayengazi nokuba kutheni.
That is exactly what happened.	Nto leyo kanye eyenzekayo.
I hope this is okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oku kulungile.
I will not.	andiyi.
It will be difficult to speak.	Kuya kuba nzima ukuthetha.
he said.	uthe.
I want a job in this.	Ndifuna umsebenzi kule.
What now.	Yintoni ngoku.
All the money.	Yonke imali.
Yeah, that's it.	Ewe, yiloo nto.
I don't want to say anything else.	Andifuni kuthetha enye into.
It's just a thing.	Yinto nje.
You like it here.	Uyayithanda apha.
He started talking to her.	Waqalisa ukuthetha naye.
I will not speak again.	andiyi kuphinda ndithethe.
Not coffee for me.	Hayi ikofu kum.
He knew better than to walk fast.	Wayesazi ngcono kunokuba ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
I did not completely.	Andizange ngokupheleleyo.
no.	hayi.
Yeah, not a joke.	Ewe, hayi ukudlala.
I thought everyone knew it.	Ndandicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi.
Not so bad, right ?.	Hayi into embi kangaka, akunjalo?.
Being alone really means that you are.	Ukuba wedwa ngokwenene kuthetha ukuba nawe.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni na.
But it was supposed to be.	Kodwa bekufanele ukuba.
It is very difficult to do.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
Very, very long.	Kakhulu, ixesha elide.
This will go a long way.	Oku kuya kude kakhulu.
Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.
Nobody lives here.	Akukho mntu uhlala apha.
More to him.	Ngakumbi kuye.
You have to have it too.	Kufuneka ube nayo nawe.
I do not know.	Andazi.
Where did he go when?	Waya phi nini.
Or maybe not, really.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo, ngokwenene.
Yes, not anyone.	Ewe, hayi nabani na.
This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
That's what needs to happen.	Yinto ekufuneka yenzeke.
I'm just glad to have you.	Ndiyavuya nje ukuba nawe.
I will be able to read again.	Ndiya kukwazi ukufunda kwakhona.
Not a problem.	Hayi ingxaki.
We go to work.	Siya emsebenzini.
Please do better here.	Nceda wenze ngcono apha.
I just know you will.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba uya kuba njalo.
He did not stay with her.	Akazange ahlale naye.
He wanted nothing from her.	Wayengafuni nto kuye.
He made that happen.	Uyenze ukuba yenzeke loo nto.
Please let me know if this is a good idea.	Nceda undixelele ukuba oku kulungile.
Not to him.	Hayi kuye.
I'm trying to stay away from you.	Ndizama ukuhlala kude nawe.
Maybe one, too.	Mhlawumbi enye, nayo.
Why, nothing! 	Kutheni, akukho nto!
he thought.	wacinga.
I have never done this before.	Andizange ndiyenze le nto ngaphambili.
He did well with her.	Wenza kakuhle naye.
I think this may be it, but it seems like it is not.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kunokuba yiyo, kodwa kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
That is a terrible thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu leyo.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
I can't get enough.	Andikwazi ukufumana ngokwaneleyo.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba uyazi.
He doesn't think.	Akacingi.
Yeah, not me, maybe.	Ewe, hayi mna, mhlawumbi.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni.
He wanted her to leave.	Wayefuna ukuba ahambe.
No one else, only you.	Hayi omnye umntu, nguwe kuphela.
You did exactly the right thing.	Wenze kanye into elungileyo.
But it's okay.	Kodwa kulungile.
I'm afraid it is.	Ndiyoyika ukuba yiyo.
No yes, no no.	Hayi ewe, hayi hayi.
But that happened a lot.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka kakhulu.
I can do all that here.	Ndingayenza yonke loo nto apha.
But he understood.	Kodwa waqonda.
So that's it.	Ngoko ke leyo yinto.
Maybe that would be better.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kuba ngcono.
He did well.	Wenza kakuhle.
Driving makes it a lot easier.	Ukuqhuba kwenza kube lula kakhulu.
I need help.	Ndifuna uncedo.
He thought for a moment.	Wacinga kancinci.
It seems to speak well.	Kubonakala ngathi kuthetha kakuhle.
Not before.	Hayi ngaphambili.
No no.	Hayi hayi.
There are so many things.	Kukho izinto ezininzi.
He likes that too.	Naye uyayithanda loo nto.
That thing probably just once.	Nto leyo mhlawumbi kanye kanye.
Please do not.	Nceda musa .
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.
Well, that's all.	Kulungile, yiyo yonke loo nto.
Tell me what happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
He agreed to speak.	Wavuma ukuthetha.
What do you want it to be ?.	Ufuna ukuba yintoni?.
This means that if.	Oku kuthetha ukuba ukuba.
We did this so that everyone could read.	Senze loo nto ukuze wonke umntu akwazi ukufunda.
No, no problem.	Hayi, akukho ngxaki.
But this is not possible.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka.
I never knew how.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuba njani.
I do not know how this happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oku.
He did not want to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba.
You should be here.	Ufanele ukuba apha.
But we will.	Kodwa siza kwenza njalo.
Sorry, no.	Uxolo, akunjalo.
He told me more about it.	Undixelele ngakumbi ngaloo nto.
Yes, he will.	Ewe, uya kuthetha.
he said.	uthe.
But it is very difficult.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu.
I will not do it again.	Andiyi kuphinda.
He thought about it.	Wacinga ngayo.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
He did not do so immediately.	Akazange akwenze oko ngoko nangoko.
Certainly not about you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ngawe.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mhlawumbi yinto entle leyo.
Not now, not to him.	Hayi ngoku, hayi kuye.
It is very difficult for him.	Kunzima kakhulu kuye.
Not for me though.	Hayi kum kodwa.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.
He certainly did not want to be here.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengafuni ukuba lapha.
Probably not so much.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo kakhulu.
Just walking.	Ukuhamba nje.
You will want to.	Uya kufuna.
This is very unlikely.	Oku akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
That's what happened to me.	Nantso ke into eyenzekayo kum.
I don't know, really.	Andazi, ngenene.
This is enough.	Oku kufuneka ngokwaneleyo.
We'll have all that tomorrow.	Siza kuba yonke loo nto ngomso.
He just did.	Wenza nje.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni.
You have to go there.	Kufuneka uye apho.
I'm sure it is.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiyo.
Not so, but.	Akunjalo, kodwa .
Okay again.	Kulungile kwakhona.
He never came to me.	Akazange eze kum.
That's mine.	Yinto yam leyo.
I thought you might like that.	Bendicinga ukuba ungathanda oko.

Just now, .	Ngoku, .
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I know that very well.	Ndiyayazi loo nto kakhulu.
He knew nothing at all.	Wayengazi nto kwaphela.

Nobody thought we were going anywhere.	Akukho mntu wayecinga ukuba siya ndawo.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha.
Would you like.	Ungathanda.
He also did not speak.	Naye khange athethe.
.	.

Very, really.	Kakhulu, ngokwenene.
He makes it very easy.	Wenza kube lula kakhulu.
I'm not sure why.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kutheni.

He started doing something else.	Waqalisa ukwenza enye into.
oh yeah.	ewe.
He knows everything about her.	Uyayazi yonke into yakhe.
I didn’t know, really.	Ndandingazi, ngokwenene.
Everything happened so fast.	Yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
Not that he knew why.	Akunjalo ukuba wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
He didn't want to think about it again.	Wayengafuni kuphinda acinge ngayo.
He agreed to say yes.	Wavuma ukuba ewe.
He did not do so either.	Naye akazange enjenjalo.
Or trying to do it.	Okanye uzama ukwenza.
I better do it someday.	Kungcono ndiyenze ngenye imini.
It can be difficult.	Kunokuba nzima.
He didn't want to say anything.	Wayengafuni kuthetha nto.
Or I did not think so.	Okanye khange ndicinge njalo.
Now to find a place.	Ngoku ukufumana indawo.
No it isn't.	Hayi akunjalo.
He did not speak.	Akazange athethe.
So much for everything.	Kakhulu yonke into.
It should have been harder.	Bekufanele kube nzima ngakumbi.
It is needed here.	Kufuneka apha.
I know a great place.	Ndiyazi indawo enkulu.
But something happened here.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo apha.
It will be much easier.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
Nobody wanted to do that.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwenza oko.
He looked around the house.	Wajonga yonke indlu.
So, that's fine.	Ngoko ke, kulungile.
He had never had it before.	Akazange abe nayo ngaphambili.
Me, too.	Nam, mhlawumbi.
But there is a problem there.	Kodwa kukho ingxaki apho.

He said he did not speak.	Wathi akazange athethe.
I want it right now.	Ndifuna okwangoku.
You know.	Uyazi.
There you and I are.	Nantso mna nawe.
I never did that.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
Just knowing he didn’t know enough.	Ukwazi nje ukuba wayengazi ngokwaneleyo.
He didn't think why.	Akazange acinge ukuba kutheni.
I have never done such a thing yet.	Andizange ndiyenze into enjalo kodwa.
Really doing things.	Ngokwenene ukwenza izinto.
This is not possible before.	Oku akunakwenzeka ngaphambili.
In his work, he had to.	Emsebenzini wakhe, kwafuneka ukuba.

Well done .	Wenze kakuhle .
You should, too !.	Kufuneka, nawe!.

But that is not necessary.	Kodwa oko akuyomfuneko.
Really doing something else.	Ngokwenene ukwenza enye into.
Making it real.	Ukwenza kube yinyani.

He can never stay there.	Akanakuze ahlale apho.
If not, that's fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, kulungile.
He told me no.	Wandixelela ukuba akukho.
It will be very difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
Not for long.	Hayi ixesha elide.
I never thought to talk about it.	Andizange ndicinge ukuthetha ngayo.
Man lives alone.	Umntu uhlala yedwa.
There, now you know.	Apho, ngoku uyazi.
I can't say that enough.	Andikwazi ukuthetha oko ngokwaneleyo.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba ayenze loo nto.
So tell me.	Ndixelele ke.
All right, you.	Kulungile, wena .
I hope you will stay with me.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala nam.
But that, of course, is not the case.	Kodwa oko, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunjalo.
Or so he thought.	Okanye ke wayecinga.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
OK OK.	Kulungile kulungile.
I do not know how this happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke njani oku.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.

Even just.	Nokuba nje.
Do not say such a thing.	Musa ukuthetha into enjalo.
I hope you are feeling better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uziva ngcono.

Now tell me something.	Ngoku ndixelele into.
There is something else there.	Kukho enye into apho.
Well, not exactly.	Kulungile, akunjalo ncam.

I know you did this.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyenzile le nto.
I think there is.	Ndicinga ukuba kukho.
You will not have another.	Awuyi kuba naye omnye.
That's it, he thought.	Yiloo nto, wacinga.
He said he couldn't.	Wathi akakwazi.
Which for sure.	Nto leyo ngokuqinisekileyo.
I really want to do it.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuyenza.

I'd just like to talk about that.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha ngaloo nto kuphela.
I made a new one.	Ndenze entsha.
But if you don't, that's fine.	Kodwa ukuba awufuni, kulungile.
To me, yes.	Kum, ewe.
I doubt it.	Ndiyathandabuza.
He is not here, but.	Akakho apha, kodwa .
But not like me.	Kodwa hayi njengam.
Probably not, sorry.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo, uxolo.
Nice place though.	Indawo entle kodwa.
This will be very difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
But we do not have to decide.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba senze isigqibo.
I just want to do some work.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza umsebenzi.
He just sat there.	Wahlala nje.
I'm glad we don't have to do it.	Ndiyavuya kuba akunyanzelekanga ukuba siyenze.
He did not succeed.	Zange aphumelele.
Good enough, really.	Kulungile ngokwaneleyo, ngokwenene.
He did not say much.	Akazange athethe kakhulu.
He once had everything.	Wakhe waba nayo yonke into.
Maybe he'll be here tonight.	Mhlawumbi uzakuba lapha ngokuhlwanje.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
He did not speak.	Khange athethe.
I will come with you.	Ndiza kuza nawe.
Not everyone.	Ayinguye wonke umntu.
He finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni wavuma.
This can be difficult.	Oku kunokuba nzima.
He began to.	Waqalisa ukuba.
I do not know either.	Andazi nam.
That's the same thing.	Yinto enye leyo.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
No one is coming here.	Akukho mntu uza apha.
Not too much, not too little.	Hayi kakhulu, hayi kancinci kakhulu.
That really happened.	Oko kwenzeka ngokwenene.
Anything to simplify it.	Nantoni na yokwenza lula kuyo.
But this can be difficult.	Kodwa oku kunokuba nzima.
Not a little bit.	Hayi kancinci kancinci.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Now is good.	Ngoku KULUNGILE.
He seemed alone.	Wayebonakala eyedwa.
And you know.	Kanye nawe uyazi.
You know now.	Uyazi ngoku.
Or why.	Okanye kwakutheni.
I never knew that.	Andizange ndiyazi loo nto.
But it was worth it.	Kodwa bekufanele.
He talks a lot.	Uthetha kakhulu.
Not exactly.	Akunjalo kanye.
Long ago now.	Kudala ngoku.
or.	okanye.
It's hard to say.	Kuba nzima ukuthetha.
Or do another one.	Okanye wenze enye.
You can be anyone.	Unokuba nabani na.
But it is true.	Kodwa yinyani.
That's it .	Yiyo leyo .
Is that it.	Ngaba oko .
He finally looked at her.	Ekugqibeleni wajonga kuye.
But for now, no.	Kodwa okwangoku, hayi.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni na.
You know why.	Uyazi ukuba kutheni.
I want to buy a new car.	Ndifuna ukuthenga imoto entsha.
He had to do this.	Kwafuneka enze oku.
I knew one thing but.	Ndandisazi into enye kodwa.
You know it well.	Uyazi kakuhle.
This is certainly not possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku akunakwenzeka.
There is something.	Kukho into .
But it will be difficult.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima.
You know that is impossible.	Uyazi ukuba akunakwenzeka.
It is very difficult for me.	Kunzima kakhulu kum.
So here's the thing.	Ngoko ke le nto.
And so it happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto ke.
I want to be better.	Ndifuna ukuba ngcono.
It will not be difficult.	Akuyi kuba nzima.
It's just time.	Lixesha nje.
Improvement.	Ukwenza ngcono.
I can't decide right now.	Andikwazi ukwenza isigqibo okwangoku.
But he did not stay there long.	Kodwa akazange ahlale ixesha elide apho.
We better do something.	Kungcono senze into.
So yes that's exactly it.	Ngoko ewe yiloo nto ngokwenene.
This happened very quickly.	Oku kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
I know it is very difficult.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima kakhulu.
Or it seems to us.	Okanye kubonakala ngathi.
I go outside.	Ndiya ngaphandle.
Yes! 	Ewe!
Finally he made a decision.	Ekugqibeleni wenza isigqibo.
So clearly that is possible.	Ngoko ngokucacileyo oko kunokwenzeka.
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.
Please do so !.	Nceda wenze njalo!.
He knew nothing about it.	Wayengazi nto ngale nto.
He told me how I did this.	Undixelele ukuba ndenze njani oku.
He said he did not.	Wathi akazange.
I decided.	Ndenze isigqibo.
Very, very little.	Kakhulu, kancinci kakhulu.
I want to go.	Ndifuna ukuhamba.
He did one.	Wenza enye.
But this is good enough.	Kodwa oku kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
I never thought of you.	Zange ndicinge ngawe.
I'm sure.	Ndiqinisekile.
I just don't like it.	Andiyithandi nje.
He also knew that he wanted to do that.	Wayesazi nokuba ufuna enjenjalo.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
Absolutely true.	Yinyani ngokupheleleyo.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba njalo.
It is not necessary.	Akunyanzelekanga.
No one really thinks about it.	Akukho mntu ucinga ngaloo nto ngokwenene.
He told me the other day.	Wandixelela ngenye imini.
I think that's a good thing to do.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
Only he will.	Kuphela uya kwenza.
That will be difficult enough for you.	Oko kuya kuba nzima ngokwaneleyo kuwe.
You like this thing.	Uyayithanda le nto.
No one told me that before.	Akukho mntu wandixelela oko ngaphambili.
I thought a lot.	Ndandicinga kakhulu.
he thought.	wacinga.
Here he thought.	Apha wacinga .
But no one tried to do it.	Kodwa akukho mntu wazama ukuyenza.
You already know how to do it.	Sele uyayazi indlela yokwenza.
Outside, no.	Ngaphandle, hayi.
Yes, it can be easier than you think.	Ewe, kunokuba lula kunokuba ucinga.
It's really true.	Yinyani yinyani.
Yes, everything but one.	Ewe, yonke into kodwa enye.
Probably nothing.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto.
Maybe you did not know.	Mhlawumbi ubungazi.
All right with you.	Kulungile nawe.
You feel bad.	Uziva kakubi.
He is not at home.	Akakho ekhaya.
Finally time is again.	Ekugqibeleni lixesha kwakhona.
Probably nothing, though.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto, kodwa.
Surely this is possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku kunokwenzeka.
Yes, it will.	Ewe, kuya kuba njalo.
You are his person.	Ungumntu wakhe.
He did not want to tell the truth.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha inyani.
I do not understand very well.	Andiqondi kakuhle.
That's your way.	Nantso indlela yakho.
One did not.	Omnye akazange.
You’ve done a lot with this thing before.	Wenze into enkulu ngale nto ngaphambili.
Nothing to me.	Akukho nto kum.

Sorry about that.	Uxolo ngayo.
He would do it.	Wayeza kuyenza.
But, it is not.	Kodwa, akunjalo.
I think soon.	Ndicinga kungekudala.

He will also be tough.	Naye uya kuba nzima.
It will not be so.	Akuyi kuba njalo.
That's fine with me.	Oko kulungile nam.
I can't go to work.	Andikwazi ukuya emsebenzini.
So that's it.	Ngoko ke yiloo nto.
No, sooner or later.	Akunjalo, kungekudala okanye nantoni na.
But for now.	Kodwa okwangoku.
But now you know.	Kodwa ngoku uyazi.
I don't want it to be so true.	Andifuni ukuba yinyani kangako.
I don't even know what it is.	Andazi nokuba yintoni na.
I know where he is now.	Ndiyamazi ukuba uphi ngoku.

You are not going anywhere.	Awuyi ndawo.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka wenze njalo.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
We all know who he is.	Sonke siyazi ukuba ngubani.

Or the opportunity for her to be able to stay home.	Okanye ithuba lokuba akwazi ukuhlala ekhaya.
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
Please tell me.	Nceda undixelele.
You have to be.	Kufuneka ube njalo.

He tried to speak.	Wazama ukuthetha.
But that is exactly what happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka kanye loo nto.
I'm not sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
But he stayed with it.	Kodwa wahlala nayo.
Not so much on it.	Hayi kakhulu kuyo.
I didn't really know.	Ndandingazi ngokwenene.
I never went there.	Andizange ndiye apho.
Maybe more.	Mhlawumbi ngakumbi.
I know him too.	Nam ndiyamazi.
I'm not sure how I did this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndenze njani oku.
You can be me.	Unokuba ndim.
What a great.	Yintoni enkulu.
It is not difficult at all.	Akukho nzima kwaphela.
If anyone.	Ukuba nabani na .
You probably already know about this.	Mhlawumbi sele uyazi ngale nto.
He is a good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo.
Everyone wanted one.	Wonke umntu wayefuna enye.
I am happy to do that.	Ndiyavuya ukwenza oko.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni.
That's him.	Nguye lowo.
But one has to do it.	Kodwa umntu kufuneka ayenze.
But you.	Kodwa wena.

For ease of reading.	Ukuze kube lula ukufunda.
You probably know.	Mhlawumbi uyazi.
I think that's fine now.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile ngoku.
Very nice house.	Indlu entle kakhulu.
He wants to be alone.	Ufuna ukuba yedwa.
It is always there.	Kuhlala kukho.
You know that is not the case.	Uyazi ukuba akunjalo.
I just want to do the right thing.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza into elungileyo.
I don't want to be alone now.	Andifuni kuba ndedwa ngoku.

There is one more problem.	Kukho enye ingxaki enye.

But not now.	Kodwa hayi ngoku.
I had to tell someone.	Kwafuneka ndixelele umntu.
He would really do this.	Wayeza kuyenza ngokwenene le nto.
I think that's true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani.
Nice place, nice place.	Indawo entle, indawo entle.
Me? ' 	Mna?'
you say.	uthi.
But it is possible that.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka ukuba.
That can be so.	Oko kunokuba njalo.
Now it's time for me to go to work.	Ngoku lixesha lokuba ndiye emsebenzini.
Everything is male.	Yonke into yindoda.
Once for me.	Kanye kum.
Or you.	Okanye nawe.
This may happen more often than you think.	Oku kunokwenzeka rhoqo kunokuba ucinga.
Nobody ever talks about it.	Akukho mntu ukhe athethe ngayo.
We have made a lot of money.	Senze imali eninzi kakhulu.
If you can be there.	Ukuba unokuba khona.
I can't do that.	Andikwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
Well, very much so.	Kulungile, kakhulu.
Well, whatever it is.	Kulungile, nokuba yintoni na.
I'm not sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto.
But it is impossible to say that.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka ukuthetha oko.
Well maybe not exactly.	Kulungile mhlawumbi hayi ncam.
He just did it.	Uyenzile nje.

He can do that.	Angayenza loo nto.
I want him to do it.	Ndifuna ayenze.
You want something too.	Nawe ufuna into.
I will not do it again.	Andiyi kuyenza kwakhona.
You know.	Waziva .
But it is possible.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka.
That's fine by me.	Kulungile kum.
I said nothing to myself.	Khange ndithethe nto kum.
If you say yes, that's fine with you.	Ukuba uthe ewe, kulungile kuwe.
It will be a long, long time.	Kuya kuba ixesha elide, kakhulu.
But this is clearly happening, too.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka ngokucacileyo, kwakhona.
He did not speak to her.	Akazange athethe naye.
Not too much to make a decision.	Akukho kakhulu ukwenza isigqibo.
Not like a big deal.	Hayi ngathi yinto enkulu.
I never did that.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
He should have stayed with me.	Bekufanele ahlale nam.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
I'm so glad to be here.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuba lapha.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
He did not say anything else.	Akazange athethe enye into.
It is not easy to do.	Akukho lula ukwenza.
I want to know more about it.	Ndifuna ukwazi ngakumbi ngayo.
We will be.	Siya kuba.

I knew nothing.	Ndandingazi nto.
We go there a lot.	Siya apho kakhulu.
I need help here.	Ndifuna uncedo apha.
This can be anything.	Oku kunokuba nantoni na.
I said nothing.	Zange ndithethe nto.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
He started talking but did not.	Waqalisa ukuthetha kodwa akazange.
He would do this.	Wayeza kuyenza le nto.
Yes, learning is hard.	Ewe, ukufunda kunzima.
That's all.	Yonke loo nto.
He never did.	Akazange ayenze.
Not with us, but with just me.	Hayi kunye nathi, kodwa kunye nam nje.
He did not know what he wanted.	Wayengazi ukuba ufuna ntoni.
No problem with us.	Akukho ngxaki nathi.
You did a good thing.	Wenze into entle.
But that will not happen.	Kodwa oko akuyi kwenzeka.
Whatever you think.	Nokuba ucinga ntoni na.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
If only he knew how bad it was.	Ukuba nje wayesazi ukuba kakubi kangakanani.
But we know one thing.	Kodwa siyazi into enye.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
I said you want to.	Ndithethe ukuba uyafuna.

The big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu.
We know that he did not do that.	Siyazi ukuba akazange ayenze loo nto.
He would do as he pleased.	Wayeza kwenza njengoko efuna.
Is it someone else ?.	Ngaba omnye umntu?.
That's it, that's everything.	Yiloo nto, yiyo yonke into.
You feel bad.	Uziva kakubi.
I will not say anything.	Andiyi kuthetha nto.
That's another one.	Nantso enye.
Now, that seems to be the case.	Ngoku, kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
Nothing, you know.	Akukho nto, uyazi.
Now, please.	Ngoku, nceda.
Maybe for now.	Mhlawumbi okwangoku.
He said no, he said yes.	Wathi hayi, wathi ewe.
But he says this.	Kodwa uthetha oku.
He has to do something.	Kufuneka enze into.
What do you think? 	Ingaba ucinga ntoni?
He does not know why we should go there.	Akayazi ukuba kutheni kufuneka siye apho.
He is not.	Ayinguye.
That's me.	Ndim lowo kodwa.
He did that to her.	Wenza loo nto kuye.
I wish it were but it is not.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube njalo kodwa akunjalo.
He wants to go.	Ufuna ukuhamba.
But you need help.	Kodwa ufuna uncedo.
Just me.	Mna kuphela.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
Maybe he will talk to you.	Mhlawumbi uya kuthetha nawe.
Long, long.	Ixesha elide, elide.
It happens a lot.	Kwenzeka kakhulu.
I don't know what time it is.	Andazi ukuba ngubani ixesha.
I can't talk to her.	Andikwazi ukuthetha nayo.

What would he do?	Wayeza kwenza ntoni na.
But there seems to be a problem.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi kukho ingxaki.
But this is something new.	Kodwa le yinto entsha.
Yeah, yeah, whatever.	Ewe, ewe, nantoni na.
Not all of us.	Akunjalo sonke.
This is good.	Oku kulungile.
Again, that is exactly what happened.	Kwakhona, kwenzeka kanye loo nto.

You did well last night.	Uyenze kakuhle phezolo.
I had to make this happen.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze le nto yenzeke.
Not too much to see here.	Akukho kakhulu ukubona apha.
He didn't think about that either.	Naye akazange acinge ngaloo nto.
He obviously was thinking about this.	Ngokucacileyo wayecinga ngale nto.
This is perfectly fine.	Oku kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
But that is not the case here.	Kodwa akunjalo apha.
Or sooner.	Okanye ngokukhawuleza.
All right.	Kulungile.
This is only good.	Oku kulungile kuphela.
So maybe not.	Ngoko mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He doesn't know it, but he really does know it.	Akayazi, kodwa ngokwenene uyazi.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
That's a good thing right there.	Yinto entle leyo kanye apho.
That's a very good thing for me.	Yinto entle kakhulu leyo kum.
Something else is coming.	Kuza kuza enye into.
I can't stay away.	Andikwazi ukuhlala kude.
You knew better.	Ubusazi ngcono .
He feels everything.	Uziva yonke into.
So, he knew.	Ngoko, wayesazi.
He looked at me.	Wajonga kum.
I think you do, too.	Ndicinga ukuba wenza njalo, nawe.
Yes, it should.	Ewe kufuneka kube njalo.
And now she wants to eat.	Ke ngoku ufuna ukutya.
I never knew this before.	Andizange ndiyazi le nto ngaphambili.
That's me.	Ndim lowo.
I don't really want to.	Andifuni ngokwenene.
It's hard to read.	Kunzima ukufunda.
He wondered what he was going to do.	Wayecinga ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
She thought he looked bad.	Wayecinga ukuba ukhangeleka kakubi.
I just don't understand.	Andiqondi nje.
I think nothing.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho nto.
Not so fast.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza.
Sure, it's a big deal.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, yinto enkulu.
Not good, but better.	Hayi kakuhle, kodwa ngcono.
To make it easier.	Ukwenza kube lula.
I think that will mean something to me.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuthetha ntoni kum.
I want to buy one.	Ndifuna ukuthenga enye.
That's exactly it.	Leyo kanye.
Nobody knew what had happened, exactly.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na, kanye.
Tell me what you think.	Ndixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni.
Better than me.	Ngcono kunam.
He thinks too much of you.	Ucinga kakhulu ngawe.
He must do so.	Kufuneka enjenjalo.
Maybe he tried but could not.	Mhlawumbi wazama kodwa akazange akwazi.
Not immediately.	Hayi ngoko nangoko.
No, no, no.	Hayi, hayi, hayi.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
This may be good for you.	Oku kunokuba kulungile kuwe.
He did the same with you.	Wenze njalo nawe.
But not so with me.	Kodwa akunjalo kum.
But in my work, not so much.	Kodwa emsebenzini wam, hayi kakhulu.
We did this.	Senze oku.
At the moment it is not possible.	Okwangoku akunakwenzeka.
He said he liked it.	Wathi uyayithanda.
Or just you.	Okanye wena nje.
I never did that to myself.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto kum.
It's hard to do.	Kunzima ukwenza.
Hard, hard, hard.	Kunzima, kunzima, kunzima.
One of hers was not there.	Omnye wakhe wayengekho.
No one really knows everything.	Akukho mntu wazi yonke into ngenene.
Yes, that's it.	Ewe, nguye lowo.
If you will do the right thing.	Ukuba uya kwenza into elungileyo.
What is this.	Yintoni na le.
But that is a good thing.	Kodwa yinto entle leyo.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
I can't say more.	Andikwazi kuthetha ngakumbi.
This is not so obvious.	Oku akunjalo ngokucacileyo.
But, so it happened.	Kodwa, ngoko kwenzeka.
He thought he was a man.	Wayecinga ukuba yindoda.
Therefore.	Ngoko ke.
There is just so much.	Kukho kakhulu nje.
He knows anything.	Uyakwazi nantoni na.
If you said it was true.	Ukuba uthe yinyani.
I think he is.	Ndicinga ukuba nguye.
We have to do it.	Kufuneka senze.
But you have to do what you have to do.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze into ekufuneka uyenzile.
This is immediately apparent.	Oku kubonakala ngokukhawuleza.
Yeah, right there.	Ewe, kanye apho.
Every day everyone thinks about it.	Imini yonke umntu ucinga ngayo.
Even if it is a bad thing.	Nokuba yinto embi.
Or maybe not enough.	Okanye mhlawumbi akukho ngokwaneleyo.
How to do this.	Ukwenza njani oku.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
He is invisible.	Akabonakali.
If you don't want to you have to have it.	Ukuba awufuni kufuneka ube nayo.
Not a bit to you.	Hayi kancinci kuwe.
He had to win.	Kwafuneka aphumelele.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
Telling someone is a good thing.	Ukuxelela umntu yinto elungileyo.
If there is such a thing.	Ukuba kukho into enjalo.
Tell me this is good.	Ndixelele ukuba oku kulungile.
I want to help.	Ndifuna ukunceda.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
This is very possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
I think we did well.	Ndicinga ukuba senze kakuhle.
The only decision.	Isigqibo kuphela.
He certainly has done that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uye wakwenza oko.
Tell me.	Ndixelele.
Yes that's right.	Ewe oko kulungile.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
Big dog.	Inja enkulu.
There are many, really.	Kukho ezininzi, ngokwenene.
I'm glad that's always good.	Ndiyavuya ngoko oko kuhlala kulungile.
He never stopped playing.	Akazange ayeke ukudlala.
We will need you to do everything.	Siza kufuna ukuba wenze yonke into.
But it is very possible.	Kodwa kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
He did not have to speak.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba athethe.
No!' 	Hayi!'
I can't get enough of it.	Andikwazi ukufumana ngokwaneleyo kuyo.
He certainly did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uyenzile.
You have to do that.	Kufuneka uyenze loo nto.
When he was not with her.	Xa wayengekho naye .
He talks a lot but does little.	Uthetha kakhulu kodwa wenza kancinci.
He speaks softly.	Uthetha kancinci.
Yes he knew.	Ewe wayesazi.
We have done so here.	Senze njalo apha.
It's a very bad thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu.
But this is not possible.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka.
I didn’t think about it.	Ndandingacingi ngayo.
But for now, it's better to play together.	Kodwa okwangoku, kungcono ukudlala kunye.
Either way this is a good thing.	Ngenye indlela le yinto elungileyo.
But there is that.	Kodwa kukho loo nto.
Just one book.	Incwadi enye nje.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Akukho nto kule nto.
He can't stay.	Akakwazi kuhlala.
Everyone started walking.	Wonke umntu waqalisa ukuhamba.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa ngokwenene akunjalo.
You only want.	Ufuna kuphela.
Yes, he would do this.	Ewe, wayeza kuyenza le nto.
He went a little faster.	Waya ngokukhawuleza kancinci.
Soon it will be better.	Kungekudala kungcono.
Don't be like that.	Musa ukuba njalo.
He must be the only one.	Umele ukuba nguye yedwa.
No one else.	Akukho mntu omnye.
If not, then don't.	Ukuba akunjalo, ngoko musa.
I really want to do that.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuyenza loo nto.
She wanted to be with him again.	Wayefuna ukuba naye kwakhona.
Not now, just in time.	Hayi ngoku, kwangethuba.
You don't want to be that way.	Awufuni ukuba njalo.
This will be the case.	Oku kuya kuba njalo.
I want it to be true.	Ndifuna ukuba yinyani.
As long as you know that.	Nje ukuba uyazi loo nto.
So, you want to be with him.	Ngoko, ufuna ukuba naye.
But he did not know.	Kodwa wayengazi.
I did not tell anyone.	Khange ndixelele mntu.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
You probably know that, too.	Usenokuba uyayazi loo nto, nawe.
Now, alone, again.	Ngoku, eyedwa, kwakhona.
I feel that way now.	Ndiziva njalo ngoku.
Glad you're here !.	Ndiyavuya ulapha!.
He is the one who lives here.	Nguye lo uhlala apha.
I can't do this, he thought.	Andikwazi ukuyenza le nto, wacinga.
Now nothing.	Ngoku akukho nto.
I didn't know how to do that.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
I have him.	Mna naye.
Nobody lives there.	Akukho mntu uhlala apho.
You never told me about it.	Zange undixelele ngayo.
But he has.	Kodwa ukhe waba .
We will speak well.	Siza kuthetha kakuhle.
What are you trying to do here.	Uzama ukwenza ntoni apha.
Or a new way.	Okanye indlela entsha.
I have to do something.	Kufuneka ndenze into.
I know what this is.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni le nto.
Not there.	Akukho apho.
You will need help to make it happen.	Uza kufuna uncedo ukuze yenzeke.
He never stopped walking.	Akazange ayeke ukuhamba.
He will not come.	Akayi kuza.
I've never been there before.	Andizange ndiye apho ngaphambili.
I don't like it very much.	Andiyithandi kakhulu.
I don't think it will happen any other way.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ngenye indlela.
To walk, to walk, to walk.	Ukuhamba, ukuhamba, ukuhamba.
But he knew.	Kodwa wayesazi.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
So, yes, it is probably possible.	Ngoko, ewe, mhlawumbi kunokwenzeka.
or something like that.	okanye into enjalo.
I know nothing.	Andazi nto.
We will do this again.	Siza kuyenza kwakhona le nto.
I knew it well.	Ndandisazi kakuhle.
I thought maybe it would be hard for you.	Bendicinga ukuba mhlawumbi kuya kuba nzima kuwe.
He asked to see.	Wacela ukubona.
I have to make it better.	Kufuneka ndiyenze ngcono.
It's hard for me.	Kunzima kum.
But this is only apparent.	Kodwa oku kubonakala kuphela.
Not so much, but maybe enough.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa mhlawumbi ngokwaneleyo.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze loo nto.
I thought so too.	Nam bendicinga njalo.
You have to go to school.	Kufuneka uye esikolweni.
Nothing much.	Akukho nto ingako.
I always go there.	Ndiya rhoqo apho.
He just isn't there.	Akakho nje.
It is time now.	Lixesha ngoku.
He told me he had done it.	Uye wandixelela ukuba uyenzile.
But, it is not easy to do.	Kodwa, akukho lula ukwenza.
Maybe that will happen.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kwenzeka.
But it was not necessary.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko.
But, but.	Kodwa, kodwa.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
You may have done many things.	Usenokuba wenza izinto ezininzi.
Not today.	Hayi namhlanje.
That's the big problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki enkulu.
So that's fine.	Ngoko kulungile.
But if something else happens to you.	Kodwa ukuba kukho enye into eyenzekayo kuwe.
I would absolutely love to do that.	Ndingathanda ngokupheleleyo ukwenza oko.
I thought about it too.	Nam bendicinga ngayo.
I will not be here.	Andiyi kuba lapha.
It's none of my business.	Asiyonto yam.
Not so but.	Akunjalo kodwa.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
Eventually it ended.	Ekugqibeleni kwaphela.
It's a beautiful new thing.	Yinto entsha entle.
But it really is the same thing.	Kodwa ngokwenene yinto enye.
It's harder than you think.	Kunzima kunokuba ucinga.
He never did.	Zange enjenjalo.
Everyone wants something.	Wonke umntu ufuna into.
I can't do that.	Andikwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
That's all you have to do here.	Yiyo yonke into ekufuneka uyenzile apha.
He knew he had to leave.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ahambe.
Long time ago.	Kudala kakhulu.
She wanted to go with him.	Wayefuna ukuhamba naye.
Man again.	Umntu kwakhona.
No problem at all.	Akukho ngxaki ngokupheleleyo.
Anyone can do this, anyone.	Nabani na angayenza le nto, nabani na.
But this will happen now.	Kodwa oku kuya kwenzeka ngoku.
He did not think that he could really do that.	Akazange acinge ukuba angayenza ngokwenene loo nto.
He would be alone.	Wayeza kuba yedwa.
Maybe you are human.	Mhlawumbi ungumntu.
It's so much better here.	Kungcono kakhulu apha.
I want this here.	Ndifuna oku apha.
You like it.	Uyayithanda.
He did not have to go far.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba aye kude.
he wanted to know.	wayefuna ukwazi.
I'm very sorry about this.	Uxolo kakhulu ngale nto.
I know you are happy.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyavuya.
I think this often, very often.	Ndicinga oku rhoqo, rhoqo kakhulu.
But again that is not the case.	Kodwa kwakhona akunjalo.
There will come a time when enough is enough.	Kuza ixesha apho ngokwaneleyo ngokwaneleyo.
It can be difficult.	Kunokuba nzima.
So he has to do it again.	Ngoko kufuneka ayenze kwakhona.
It will certainly happen to you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kwenzeka kuwe.
For you.	Kuba wena .
You will know about it.	Uya kukwazi ngayo.
In a good way.	Ngendlela entle.
I'm really happy for you.	Ndiyavuya ngokwenene ngawe.
It's hard for him.	Kunzima kuye.
He asked how that could have happened.	Wabuza ukuba kwenzeke njani oko.
I thought that was true.	Ndandicinga ukuba yinyani leyo.
He is here though.	Ulapha kodwa.
Don't talk too much.	Musa ukuthetha kakhulu.
He went to her and sat down.	Waya kuyo wahlala.
I knew it.	Ndandisazi.
I could not help enough.	Khange ndikwazi ukunceda ngokwaneleyo.
I know this is hard.	Ndiyazi ukuba oku kunzima.
I will not have it any other way.	Andiyi kuba nayo ngenye indlela.
Impossible, but not easy.	Akunakwenzeka, kodwa akukho lula.
I'm sure of that.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto.
You will never go there again.	Awuyi kuphinda uye apho kwakhona.
He wants to go.	Ufuna ukuhamba.
No one is there anymore.	Akukho mntu apho kwakhona.
Not at home.	Hayi ekhaya.
Because we know.	Kuba siyazi.
Long time ago.	Kudala kakhulu.
I'm happy then.	Ndiyavuya ngoko.
I did not want to go that way.	Ndandingafuni ukuhamba ngaloo ndlela.
Yes, that's me.	Ewe, ndim lowo.
As you well know.	Njengoko uyazi kakuhle.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze into!.
He is not in prison.	Akakho entolongweni.
Maybe it will be this week.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba njalo kule veki.
Certainly a long time.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ixesha elide.
If you do not want to see the house, well.	Ukuba awufuni ukubona indlu, kulungile.
What the hell? 	Yintoni?
he thought.	wacinga.
Not far enough.	Akukho kude ngokwaneleyo.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Or maybe, too.	Okanye mhlawumbi, kwakhona.
That never happened.	Zange yenzeke lonto.
But no one really knows what is going on.	Kodwa akukho mntu uyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
I think for now, whatever happens.	Ndicinga okwangoku, nantoni na eyenzekayo.
Currently no one.	Okwangoku akukho mntu.
Traveling there will be very difficult.	Ukuhamba apho kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
I just want to go home.	Ndifuna nje ukuya ekhaya.
I don't know what he did.	Andazi ukuba wenze ntoni.
She sits down.	Uhlala phantsi.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngokwenene.
He did not speak.	Khange athethe.
He knew very well.	Wayesazi kakhulu.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
You try a little harder.	Uzama kancinci.
Maybe soon though.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala kodwa.
How long do you plan to stay?	Uceba ukuhlala ixesha elingakanani.
Now nothing.	Ngoku akukho nto.
He wanted to be better.	Wayefuna ukuba ngcono.
But he did.	Kodwa uyenzile.
You know who you want to talk to.	Uyazi ukuba ufuna ukuthetha nabani.
He had to go.	Kwafuneka ahambe.
He doesn't know that.	Akayazi loo nto.
.	.
I didn't really want to know.	Ndandingafuni nyani ukwazi.
If not far away.	Ukuba akukho kude.
I never thought it would happen.	Khange ndicinge ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Yes! 	Ewe!
But no, he thought.	Kodwa hayi, wacinga.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
He wanted to be alone.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa.
Finally, she said yes.	Ekugqibeleni, wathi ewe.
That's what I am.	Yiloo nto ke le.
I want to do it quickly.	Ndifuna ukuyenza ngokukhawuleza.
I think not much.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho kakhulu.
Not now, but someday.	Hayi ngoku, kodwa ngenye imini.
It is very difficult to go very far.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuya kude kakhulu.
He tried again.	Wazama kwakhona.
Glad you're here !.	Ndiyavuya ulapha!.
He is talking to you.	Uthetha nawe.
But he had to go to school.	Kodwa kwafuneka aye esikolweni.
I said nothing.	Khange ndithethe nto.
I don't want that either.	Nathi andifuni lonto.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.
The next day, he thought.	Ngomso, wacinga.
You know how it happened.	Uyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani.
I do not really know.	Andazi ngenene.
I think a lot.	Ndicinga kakhulu.
I thought you might like to know.	Bendicinga ukuba ungathanda ukwazi.
That's a big deal for me now.	Yinto enkulu leyo kum ngoku.
I hope you will stay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uya kuhlala .
It is absolutely necessary.	Kufuneka ngokupheleleyo.
I know you know it.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayazi.
He did something very bad.	Wenza into embi kakhulu.
But he does not want to talk to you.	Kodwa akafuni kuthetha nawe.
But one thing.	Kodwa into enye.
There he became a great man.	Apho waba yindoda enkulu.
Not to him but.	Hayi kuye kodwa.
This has been happening for a long time.	Oku kwenzeka ixesha elide.
So you have to make a decision.	Ngoko kufuneka wenze isigqibo.
John has to leave tomorrow.	UJohn kufuneka ahambe ngomso.
It looks like a human being.	Kubonakala ngathi umntu.
I hope that's okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kulungile.
I know nothing.	Andazi nto.
Just talk to him about it.	Ukuthetha nje naye ngale nto.
Too early in it, too.	Kwangethuba kakhulu kuyo, nayo.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
I told her not to do it.	Ndamxelela ukuba angayenzi.
It will happen in the end.	Kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
I can't go to jail.	Andikwazi ukuya entolongweni.
He didn't think much of it.	Wayengacingi kakhulu ngayo.
He didn't know he had to, but he didn't.	Wayengazi ukuba ufanele, kodwa akazange.
He looks good.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle.
This is very unlikely.	Oku akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
He just wanted to talk to her.	Wayefuna nje ukuthetha naye.
But, what.	Kodwa, yintoni na.
You have to say no.	Kufuneka uthi hayi.
So really no problem.	Ngoko ngokwenene akukho ngxaki.
As you said, clearly.	Njengoko uthe, ngokucacileyo.
This is difficult.	Oku kunzima.
I did not want to see.	Ndandingafuni ukubona.
But this is not exactly the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo ncam.
Very little.	Kancinci kakhulu.
He said, it should.	Wathi, kufuneka.
You know it's okay.	Uyazi ukuba kulungile.
You want a job.	Ufuna umsebenzi.
I made this happen.	Ndenze oku ukuba kwenzeke.
Work is a thing.	Umsebenzi yinto.
He is the problem.	Nguye ingxaki.
As long as you know.	Nje ukuba uyazi.
You don't have to want to do it.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ufuna ukwenza.
I never told him why.	Zange ndamxelela nokuba kutheni.
But not everyone.	Kodwa akunjalo wonke umntu.
This is something new for me.	Yinto entsha le kum.
Even new.	Nokuba entsha.
It is difficult, but not impossible.	Kunzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Tell me if you know.	Ndixelele ukuba uyazi.
This one is not out.	Lo akakho ngaphandle.
That's cute.	Oko kulungile.
Nice to see you too.	Ndiyavuya ukubona nawe.
Long time ago.	Kudala kakhulu.
Well, maybe not immediately.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akunjalo ngoko nangoko.
He says yes.	Uthi ewe.
You already know everything.	Sele uyazi yonke into.
Nobody does anything.	Akukho mntu wenza nto.
He is now, too.	Nguye ngoku, naye.
Or he thought he was.	Okanye wayecinga ukuba nguye.
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka.
I'll have to think about it.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge ngayo.
He did not come.	Akazange eze.
It is possible that.	Kunokwenzeka ukuba .
We know something else out there.	Siyazi enye into ngaphandle.
But anything to me.	Kodwa nantoni na kum.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi kancinci.
But not for long.	Kodwa hayi ixesha elide.
Whatever happens.	Nantoni na eyenzekayo.
I don't want to see everything.	Andifuni ukubona yonke into.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.
Yeah, okay, then.	Ewe, kulungile, ngoko.
For anyone really.	Kuba nabani na ngokwenene.
But not too far away.	Kodwa hayi kude kakhulu.
Not for long.	Hayi ixesha elide.
Finally, it should.	Ekugqibeleni, kufuneka.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto ngokwenene.
Location, place, place.	Indawo, indawo, indawo.
Why did he do that?	Kwakutheni ukuze enze loo nto.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
Something happened to him.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuye.
I can't say anything about that.	Andikwazi ukuthetha nantoni na ngaloo nto.
That's it.	Yiyo ke leyo.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
But only if no one knows.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba akukho mntu uyazi.
He knew he had to leave immediately.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
But he could not.	Kodwa akazange akwazi.
Not all a lot of money.	Hayi yonke imali eninzi.
It only happens once.	Kwenzeka kanye kuphela.
There is another exception.	Kukho enye ngaphandle.
I thought everyone knew.	Ndandicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyazi.
Not just here.	Akukho nje apha.
You like that.	Uyayithanda loo nto.
Probably not immediately.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngoko nangoko.
It's you and no one else.	Nguwe hayi omnye umntu.
No one.	Akukho mntu.
Maybe you too.	Mhlawumbi nawe.
But he could not.	Kodwa ke akazange akwazi.
So he stayed home.	Ngoko wahlala ekhaya.
We know everything or nothing.	Siyazi yonke into okanye akukho nto.
He said a little.	Uye wathi kancinci.
Certainly not today.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo namhlanje.
Or anyone, for that matter.	Okanye nabani na, ngaloo nto.
He did something very bad.	Wenza into embi kakhulu.
I will talk to him.	Ndiza kuthetha naye.
It's really hard outside.	Kunzima nyani ngaphandle.
Maybe you feel worse than I do.	Mhlawumbi uziva kakubi kunam.
Something happened to me there.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kum apho.
I am the whole thing.	Ndim yonke loo nto.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
Sorry, sorry.	Uxolo, uxolo.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.

This means a decision.	Oku kuthetha ukuba isigqibo.
There is another problem.	Kukho enye ingxaki.
Sorry, and so on.	Uxolo, njalo njalo.

He said he did not speak.	Wathi zange athethe.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Mhlawumbi nantso indlela.
Something bad happened last night.	Kwenzeke into embi apha phezolo.
Nice place.	Indawo entle.
He is not exactly in it.	Akakho ncam kuyo.
There it is.	Nantso ke apho.
I will not do it.	Andiyi kuyenza.
But he doesn't know anything about it.	Kodwa akazi nto ngayo.
He did well in it.	Wenza kakuhle kuyo.
Not now, but finally.	Hayi ngoku, kodwa ekugqibeleni.
That's what everyone wants.	Yiloo nto wonke umntu ayifunayo.
Only now.	Kuphela ngoku.
Not always, but always.	Akunjalo rhoqo, kodwa rhoqo.
This will be you, soon.	Oku kuya kuba nguwe, kungekudala.
He did not do many things.	Akazange enze ezininzi.
Certainly not you.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi wena.
Yes that's right.	Ewe kulungile.
Not for us.	Hayi ngathi.
We know what that is.	Siyazi ukuba yintoni leyo.
I can't do that.	Andikwazi ukwenza njalo.
You have to be real.	Kufuneka ube yinyani.
Impossible.	Akunakwenzeka.
Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally?	Uziva ngathi kudala?.
That's what happened here.	Nantso into eyenzekayo apha.
You will not need food there.	Awuyi kufuna ukutya apho.
But this does not have to be.	Kodwa oku akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
You know .	Uyazi .
He did everything well.	Wenza yonke into kakuhle.
As it looks great.	Njengoko kubonakala kakhulu.
I have to talk now.	Kufuneka ndithethe ngoku.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
This, of course, is not entirely possible.	Oku, ngokuqinisekileyo, akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
It has not been easy.	Khange kube lula.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Anything you need to do.	Nantoni na ekufuneka uyenzile.
That's how bad it is.	Yiloo ndlela embi ngayo.
Just when something bad happens to you.	Kanye xa kwenzeka into embi kuwe.
That's what you always try.	Nto leyo uhlala uzama.
I never talked about it.	Andizange ndithethe ngayo.
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi .
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Nice to talk to you.	Ndiyavuya ukuthetha nawe.
It's just true.	Yinyani nje.
I did not want to go to prison.	Ndandingafuni ukuya entolongweni.
You do not want to do this.	Awufuni ukwenza oku.
You mean everything now.	Uthetha yonke into ngoku.
You look good today.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle namhlanje.
But there is.	Kodwa kukho.
You and us ?.	Wena kunye nathi?.
Probably very good.	Mhlawumbi kakuhle kakhulu.
Not if you don't want to.	Hayi ukuba awufuni.
Not so much, but enough.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa ngokwaneleyo.
It will happen the other way around.	Kuya kwenzeka ngenye indlela.
But he did not go there.	Kodwa akazange aye apho.
I did not want to be here.	Ndandingafuni ukuba lapha.
But he could not find any other way.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukufumana enye indlela.
In all of that.	Kuyo yonke loo nto.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
So what did he do.	Wenza ntoni ke.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
We have to do it right.	Kufuneka siyenze kakuhle.
I'm afraid there.	Ndiyoyika kukho.
That's what happened to me.	Nantso ke into eyenzekayo kum.
I think it will happen.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
I never thought this would happen.	Zange ndicinge ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
This one did.	Lo wenza.
Or you.	Okanye nawe.
I know he did not speak.	Nam ndiyazi khange athethe.
He just made it more real.	Uyenzile nje ukuba yinyani ngakumbi.
Everyone knows that.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
Everyone knows it very, very well.	Wonke umntu uyazi kakhulu, kakuhle kakhulu.
That is possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka.
He said he would make it happen.	Wathi uya kuyenza ukuba yenzeke.
Every so often.	Rhoqo.
I know what's coming.	Ndiyayazi into ezayo.
I did not know better.	Ndandingazi ngcono.
You can be here.	Unokuba lapha.
I can not speak.	Andikwazi kuthetha.
I want you here.	Ndifuna wena apha.
But he knew that he would never do such a thing.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba akanakuze enze into enjalo.
I need to talk to him.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye.
Because you told me everything yesterday.	Kuba undixelele yonke into izolo.
I am alone.	Ndim ndedwa .
He will stay with it.	Uya kuhlala nayo.
Making a lot of money.	Ukwenza imali eninzi.
One of mine.	Enye yam.
No matter how long you want it.	Nokuba ufuna ixesha elide kangakanani na.
Not really, everywhere.	Hayi ngokwenene, yonke indawo.
I never thought he would do it.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba angayenza.
No, certainly not.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo kuye.
He must have been thinking of something else.	Umele ukuba wayecinga ngenye into.
Not so much, for sure.	Hayi kakhulu, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Just a good thing.	Into nje elungileyo.
No one ever leaves.	Akukho mntu ukhe ahambe.
Not just one thing.	Hayi nje into enye.
But today.	Kodwa namhlanje.
He can speak.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha.
I didn't say anything else.	Khange ndithethe enye into.
I did my job.	Ndenze umsebenzi wam.
But otherwise, that really isn't the case.	Kodwa ngenye indlela, akunjalo ngokwenene.
I don't know when.	Andazi ukuba nini.
He has only done his job.	Wenze kuphela umsebenzi wakhe.
It's hard to know what to do about it.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuba wenze ntoni ngale nto.
Faster than he thought.	Ngokukhawuleza kunokuba wayecinga.
Or in prison, obviously.	Okanye entolongweni, ngokucacileyo.
He knew he had to stop.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ayeke.
You have obviously done this before.	Ngokucacileyo uyenzile le nto ngaphambili.
I had no idea why, really.	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni, ngokwenene.
I don't know, he thought.	Andazi, wacinga.
He did a little bit of it.	Wenza kancinci kuyo.
Yeah, it's better.	Ewe, kungcono.
Not so here.	Akunjalo apha.
That is exactly what happened to me.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo kum.
Yeah, just one.	Ewe, enye nje.
You have made a lot of money.	Wenze imali eninzi.
Everyone knew everyone.	Wonke umntu wayesazi wonke umntu.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi ncam.
I said nothing to her.	Khange ndithethe nto kuye.
But no.	Kodwa hayi.
It seems impossible right now.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka okwangoku.
Tell me now where you are.	Ndixelele ngoku ukuba uphi.
I'm sure you know.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyazi.
But he eventually went to work.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni waya emsebenzini.
That's his problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki yakhe.
Nobody is going to talk to me.	Akukho mntu uza kuthetha nam.
You have to tell me that.	Kufuneka undixelele njalo.
He lives too far away.	Uhlala kude kakhulu.
Please, please.	Nceda, nceda.
That's what happened.	Yinto eyenzekayo.
So there really is nothing.	Ngoko akukho nto ngokwenene.
He did not do so.	Akazange enze njalo.
He sat for a while.	Wahlala kancinci.
I will do it again tomorrow.	Ndiza kuphinda ngomso.
He will not do anything.	Akayi kwenza nantoni na.
No one wanted to make money.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwenza imali.
I do not want to know.	Andifuni ukwazi.
He will do it one day.	Uza kuyenza ngenye imini.
He knew for sure.	Wayesazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
If not.	Ukuba akukho.
I think not.	Ndicinga ukuba hayi.
But that will happen later.	Kodwa oko kuya kwenzeka kamva.
I didn't have to tell anyone.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba ndixelele mntu.
No, what ?.	Hayi, yintoni?.
I'm sure.	Ndiqinisekile.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi kuyenza le nto.
Except maybe this one.	Ngaphandle mhlawumbi lo.
I made coffee.	Ndenze ikofu.
Of course not.	Hayi ke.
He did not leave.	Akazange ahambe.
Better for him, too.	Kungcono kuye, naye.
Well, maybe not.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
It will last a long time.	Kuya kuphela ixesha elide.
So this is a big deal.	Ngoko le yinto enkulu.
Only.	Kuphela.
Or maybe something completely different.	Okanye mhlawumbi enye into ngokupheleleyo.
He looked at me.	Uye wajonga kum.
This one does very well.	Lo wenza kakuhle kakhulu.
But it is a thing.	Kodwa yinto.
Only impossible.	Kuphela akunakwenzeka.
You know very well.	Ukwazi kakuhle kakhulu.
Maybe that's true now.	Mhlawumbi yinyani leyo ngoku.
She had to say something to him.	Kwafuneka athethe into kuye.
You will be able to speak on your own.	Uya kukwazi ukuthetha wedwa.
He never did.	Akazange ayenze.
I hope that happens soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kwenzeka kungekudala.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma ngoko nangoko.
It will be easy, really.	Kuya kuba lula, ngokwenene.
If this really happened.	Ukuba oku kwenzeka ngokwenene.
Maybe the car is a very good thing.	Mhlawumbi imoto yinto entle kakhulu.
I'm not sure how.	Andazi ncam ukuba njani.
This is my whole thing and everything.	Le yinto yam yonke kunye nayo yonke into.
We know it well.	Siyazi kakuhle.
I would like to do more of that.	Ndingathanda ukwenza ngakumbi oko.
Absolutely impossible, really.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka, ngokwenene.
I could not say anything.	Khange ndikwazi ukuthetha nto.
Where he went.	Apho waya khona.
Everyone told me.	Wonke umntu wandixelela.
I, yes, there I am.	Ke, ewe, nantso ke.
Being able to be.	Ukwazi kuba.
He can't speak.	Akakwazi kuthetha.
He lives far away.	Uhlala kude.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma ngokukhawuleza.
Well, whatever it is.	Kulungile, nokuba yintoni na.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akuyi kuba njalo.
Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacinga.
I can't really speak.	Andikwazi ngokwenene ukuthetha.
I have to make a decision.	Kufuneka ndenze isigqibo.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
Not here, not now.	Hayi apha, hayi ngoku.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
She had to go to him for everything.	Kwafuneka aye kuye ngayo yonke into.
No it isn't.	Hayi akunjalo.
He knew it well.	Wayesazi kakuhle.
Now you want one.	Ngoku ufuna enye.
But it is true.	Kodwa yinyani.
He says it's okay.	Uthi kulungile.
It's just, well.	Yinto nje, kakuhle.
No one thinks it is true.	Akukho mntu ucinga ukuba yinyani.
There is something wrong with him.	Kukho into kuye.
I know it will happen.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
He lives, he lives.	Uhlala, uhlala.
Sounds good.	Kubonakala kulungile.
But not fast enough.	Kodwa hayi ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
Not just me but him too.	Hayi nam kuphela kodwa naye.
Certainly not me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andizange.
Maybe one.	Mhlawumbi enye.
Well not.	Kulungile akunjalo.
How much better you can be.	Unokuba ngcono kangakanani.
A little more.	Kancinci ngakumbi.
But he could not go.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuya.
Please do so again.	Nceda wenze njalo kwakhona.
It will be sooner rather than later.	Kuya kuba kungekudala kunokuba kamva.
I can't say much.	Andikwazi ukuthetha kakhulu.
He sat down and looked at her.	Wahlala phantsi wajonga kuye.
You want money.	Ufuna imali.
I'm afraid.	Ndiyoyika.
She goes to school.	Uya esikolweni.
I had to think about this.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngale nto.
I've said all this.	Ndithethe yonke le nto.
Well, maybe not exactly.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akunjalo ncam.
Or something like that.	Okanye into enjalo.
You have to go to work tomorrow.	Kufuneka uye emsebenzini ngomso.
Immediately.	Kwangoko.
I have to tell her what happened.	Kufuneka ndimxelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
Where are you? 	Uphi?
Not even right.	Akukho nokuba kulungile.
There is one there for you.	Kukho enye apho kuwe.
I feel like you feel it today.	Ndiziva ngathi uziva namhlanje.
I just want time alone.	Ndifuna nje ixesha ndedwa.
He did not leave.	Akazange ahambe.
Just doing the job.	Ukwenza nje umsebenzi.
You know that now.	Uyayazi loo nto ngoku.
But whatever! 	Kodwa nantoni na!
He may not be here.	Usenokuba akakho.
But not for long.	Kodwa hayi ixesha elide.
But, you know, it's possible.	Kodwa, uyazi, kunokwenzeka.
And he admitted this.	Uye wavuma oku.
Why did that happen?	Kwakutheni ukuze kwenzeke oko.
It has to be this.	Kufuneka kube oku.
Yesterday, if possible.	Izolo, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
In improving.	Ekwenzeni ngcono.
But he did not want to know.	Kodwa ke wayengafuni ukwazi.
I could not stay away.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuhlala kude.
But this will be everything today.	Kodwa oku kuya kuba yinto yonke namhlanje.
I'm not sure you did.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wenze njalo.
He will not.	Akayi.
So will you.	Nawe uya kuba njalo.
He wanted to know everything.	Wayefuna ukwazi yonke into.
He is coming here soon.	Uza apha ngokukhawuleza.
I'm not sure about this.	Andiqinisekanga ngale nto.
He didn't want that anymore.	Wayengafuni oko kwakhona.
He didn't really want to know.	Wayengafuni ngokwenene ukwazi.
You know that's not the way we do it.	Uyazi ukuba akunjalo indlela esenza ngayo.
He could quickly do this, then.	Angayenza ngokukhawuleza oku, ngoko.
I don't know, really.	Andazi, ngenene.
I decided.	Ndenze isigqibo.
I don't want that to happen.	Andifuni ukuba yenzeke loo nto.
He wanted to stay no.	Wayefuna ukuhlala hayi.
But it will probably be so.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kuya kuba njalo.
No, he thought.	Akunjalo, wayecinga.
I do not like this book.	Andiyithandi le ncwadi.
I just want to talk.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha.
There is a problem enough.	Kukho ingxaki ngokwaneleyo.
He said that was a big deal.	Wathi yinto enkulu leyo.
He would do it again.	Wayeza kuyenza kwakhona.
asked another.	wabuza omnye.
Not out there.	Akukho ngaphandle apho.
I do not know how or why.	Andazi ukuba njani okanye kutheni.
I want you there.	Ndifuna wena apho.
Not tonight, please.	Hayi ngokuhlwanje, nceda.
I really hope you will do this again.	Ndiyathemba ngokwenene ukuba uya kuyenza le nto kwakhona.
For immediately.	Kuba ngoko nangoko.
But not at night.	Kodwa hayi ebusuku.
Now, today.	Ngoku, namhlanje.
To travel.	Ukuhamba.
I'm not sure where.	Andiqinisekanga apho.
He wants to talk to her.	Ufuna ukuthetha naye.
Just this way.	Kanye ngale ndlela.
He thought so too.	Naye wayecinga njalo.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi nokuba uphi na.
He knew he was coming, eventually.	Wayesazi ukuba uya kuza, ekugqibeleni.
That will only get better.	Oko kuya kuba ngcono ngakumbi.
I know you well.	Ndikwazi kakuhle.
Finally he said.	Ekugqibeleni wathi.
He said he should.	Wathi kufuneka.
That's fine by me.	Kulungile kum.
We all know about it.	Sonke siyazi ngayo.
So this is going to happen.	Ngoko ke oku kuya kwenzeka.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
I want to be your husband.	Ndifuna ukuba yindoda yakho.
I know he didn't.	Ndiyazi ukuba akazange.
I have to go there.	Kufuneka ndiye apho.
He is not far off.	Akakho kude.
But it is a thing.	Kodwa yinto.
He needs help.	Ufuna uncedo.
You just want time.	Ufuna nje ixesha.
But maybe.	Kodwa mhlawumbi.
Yes, not at all.	Ewe, hayi ngokupheleleyo.
He too knew nothing.	Naye wayengazi nto.
You will have to do it.	Kuza kufuneka uyenze.
I'm sure of it.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo.
You only need one.	Ufuna enye kuphela.
He told me about you.	Wandixelela ngawe.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
The one who comes to me, yes.	Lowo uza kum, ewe.
You have to do that.	Kufuneka uyenze loo nto.
I wonder about all that.	Ndiyazibuza ngayo yonke loo nto.
If yes, that's fine.	Ukuba ewe, kulungile.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
You don't want that either.	Nawe awufuni loo nto.
If you have to do that.	Ukuba kufuneka wenze oko.
He did not want anyone to go with him.	Wayengafuni mntu ahambe naye.
But he did not think so.	Kodwa akazange acinge njalo.
He did not think.	Khange acinge.
Or about you.	Okanye ngawe.
That's the problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki.
Even if it is possible.	Nokuba kunokwenzeka.
All right, it's better.	Kulungile, kungcono.
I thought you were a good person.	Bendicinga ukuba ungumntu olungileyo.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
He just did.	Wenza nje.
But we will do it now.	Kodwa siza kuyenza ngoku.
It only happens once.	Kwenzeka kanye kuphela.
If you like it, it's good for you.	Ukuba uyayithanda, kulungile kuwe.
But that is not the case at all.	Kodwa akunjalo ngokupheleleyo.
For what, he did not know exactly.	Kuba yintoni, wayengazi ncam.
All right now.	Kulungile ngoku.
I did not.	Andizange .
Well, he knew he was coming.	Ewe, wayesazi ukuba uza kuza.
I don't want to go there.	Andifuni ukuya apho.
But then it happened.	Kodwa ke kwenzeka.
Just a little bit.	Kancinci nje.
To do this, but not.	Ukwenza oku, kodwa hayi.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
This is something new.	Le yinto entsha.
Or you don't want to.	Okanye awufuni.
No one should do this alone.	Akukho mntu kufuneka ayenze yedwa le nto.
He knew he was going to do it.	Wayesazi ukuba wayeza kuyenza loo nto.
One day soon.	Ngenye imini kungekudala.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe ngomso.
I did not want it to happen.	Ndandingafuni ukuba yenzeke.
I do not know who he is.	Andazi ukuba ngubani.
It's just hard.	Kunzima nje.
Yes to all this.	Ewe kuyo yonke le nto.
Well, not everyone, obviously.	Ewe, ayinguye wonke umntu, ngokucacileyo.
Or something worse.	Okanye into embi ngakumbi.
I can't see how I can do that.	Andikwazi kubonakala ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
He admitted that.	Wavuma ukuba.
So that's fine.	Ngoko kulungile.
You want to be alone.	Ufuna ukuba wedwa.
Nothing to him or anything.	Akukho nto kuye okanye nantoni na.
What's that? 	Yintoni lo nto?
It's hard to see.	Kunzima ukubona.
But he says, no.	Kodwa uthi, hayi.
For in the end, he has to succeed.	Kuba ekugqibeleni, kufuneka aphumelele.
Not in this one.	Hayi kule.
Soon he did not know if anything.	Kungekudala wayengazi ukuba kukho nantoni na.
He thought.	Wayecinga ukuba.
I know.	Ndiyazi.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga mna.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
He looks very good.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle kakhulu.
Everyone stays.	Wonke umntu uhlala.
But we all have to do it together.	Kodwa sonke kufuneka siyenze kunye.
Yeah, enough for now.	Ewe, ngokwaneleyo okwangoku.
But don't be like that.	Kodwa musa ukuba njalo.
I think a lot.	Ndicinga kakhulu.
Not at all.	Akunjalo kwaphela.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
I would love to have it.	Ndingathanda ukuba nayo.
I knew it was going to happen.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
He never wanted to talk to her again.	Akazange afune ukuthetha naye kwakhona.
He said yes.	Wathi ewe.
Don't be like me.	Musa ukuba njengam.
He looked at the bike.	Wajonga ibhayisekile.
I will definitely do this again !!!.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuyenza kwakhona le nto !!!.
What happened to everyone.	Kwenzeke ntoni wonke umntu.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo nje.
I think this means that something really good.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kuthetha ukuba kukho into entle ngokwenene.
Maybe he would be hard.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuba nzima.
That is the problem.	Ingxaki ke leyo.
What do you think.	Ucinga NTONI.
I never thought of anything.	Andizange ndicinge nto.
I hope that comes soon.	Ndiyathemba ukuba oko kuza ngokukhawuleza.
He told me he was here.	Wandixelela ukuba ulapha.
You don't want to go there.	Awufuni ukuya apho.
Or a little better.	Okanye kancinci ngcono.
I want to do this.	Ndifuna ukwenza oku.
I have had to make peace with everything.	Kuye kwafuneka ndenze uxolo nayo yonke into.
I will do that.	Ndiya kuyenza loo nto.
You are not visible to me.	Awubonakali kum.
I know for a fact that it is not.	Ndiyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba akunjalo.
This, of course, will happen.	Oku, ngokwenene, kuya kwenzeka.
I am so happy about this !.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ngale nto!.
He wanted to be me.	Wayefuna ukuba ndim.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
No one is talking to her.	Akukho mntu uthetha naye.
Not so much but no problem.	Hayi kakhulu kodwa akukho ngxaki.
But that's it, just the two of us.	Kodwa yiloo nto, sobabini kuphela.
So, to you at home.	Ngoko, kuwe ekhaya.
I just want to know.	Ndifuna ukwazi kuphela.
No, you are not.	Hayi, awuyi.
I had to talk to him a little bit.	Kwafuneka ndithethe nam kancinci.
It's hard for me to say.	Kunzima kum ukuthetha.
So he said nothing.	Ngoko akazange athethe nto.
A little here.	Kancinci apha.
You will get better.	Uzakuba ngcono.
He is only human.	Ungumntu kuphela.
She is not.	Akakho.
But we will be better off sooner or later.	Kodwa siza kuba ngcono kuye kungekudala okanye kamva.
This is not really necessary.	Oku akuyomfuneko ngokwenene.
There is plenty of time.	Kukho ixesha elininzi.
I can't do that.	Andikwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
I'm really scared.	Ndiyoyika ngokwenene.
But rather.	Kodwa kungcono.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngokwenene.
He can walk.	Uyakwazi ukuhamba.
That's fine, but that's it.	Oko kulungile, kodwa yiloo nto.
No, no help.	Hayi, hayi uncedo.
Obviously, if anything.	Ngokucacileyo, ukuba kukho nantoni na.
Something is happening there.	Kukho into eyenzekayo apho.
So he said.	Ngoko ke wathi.
If you think so.	Ukuba ucinga njalo .
But it is very difficult.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu.
But not now.	Kodwa hayi ngoku.
Definitely okay.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kulungile.
He will do it.	Uza kuyenza.
But yes, he is here.	Kodwa ewe, ulapha.
But only if you are sure you want to.	Kodwa kuphela ukuba uqinisekile ukuba uyafuna.
He never had one.	Akazange abe nayo enye.
This is already evident.	Oku sele kubonakala.
I go to him.	Ndiya kuye.
Not so here.	Akunjalo ke apha.
Yes, a big problem.	Ewe, ingxaki enkulu.
I never thought of another one.	Andizange ndicinge ngenye.
This happens often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo.
Anything else.	Enye into.
Now it looks good.	Ngoku kubonakala kulungile.

It's even harder.	Kunzima ngakumbi.
He always thought.	Wayecinga njalo.
I want to be with her.	Ndifuna ukuba naye.
He said there was no way, no.	Wathi akukho ndlela, akunjalo.
So this is the only one.	Ngoko ke le kuphela.

How can I do it.	Ndingayenza njani.
That's just fine.	Oko kulungile kuphela.
But just a little bit.	Kodwa nje kancinci.
That is possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka.

No no.	Hayi, hayi.
If you have ever felt it, you know.	Ukuba uye waziva, uyazi.
It's a big deal that.	Yinto enkulu ukuba.

Or is it.	Okanye ngaba.
He speaks really well.	Uthetha kakuhle ngenene.

All great.	Yonke enkulu.
But that does not have to happen.	Kodwa oko akunyanzelekanga ukuba yenzeke.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
I will do anything, anything.	Ndiya kwenza nantoni na, nantoni na .
I'm not sure you're human.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ungumntu.
We had to do that.	Kwafuneka senze njalo.
No I don't know.	Hayi andazi.
But he could not.	Kodwa akazange akwazi.
He will do it.	Uza kuyenza.
Finally he began to speak.	Ekugqibeleni waqalisa ukuthetha.

It is not just about us.	Akunjalo ngathi kuphela.

Because he has to do so.	Kuba kufuneka enjenjalo.
We do not have to guess.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba senze isigqibo.
I did not go.	Andizange ndiye.
I do not go to school.	Andiyi esikolweni.
He looked bad right away.	Wabonakala embi ngoko nangoko.
Just another thing.	Enye into nje.
He wants to hurt someone.	Ufuna umntu athethe naye kakubi.
I'm very sorry.	Uxolo kakhulu.
I will not do such a thing here.	Andiyi kwenza into enjalo apha.
This will not happen soon.	Oku akunakwenzeka kungekudala.
But this is not possible.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka.
New.	Entsha.
No help.	Hayi uncedo.
.	.
And you, that's fine.	Ke wena, kulungile.
Nice place.	Indawo entle.
But it seems to be coming soon.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi kuza kungekudala.
He looked slightly.	Wajonga kancinci.
But he did not speak.	Kodwa akazange athethe.
So how can I do it.	Ngoko ndingayenza njani.
I don't like it.	Andiyithandi.
It will be much better.	Kuya kuba ngcono kakhulu.
I know what happened to me.	Ndiyayazi into eyenzekayo kum.
I knew nothing.	Ndandingazi nto.
Here it is, everywhere.	Apha apho, yonke indawo.
I need to know what happened.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.

He did not want to.	Akazange afune.
That's it.	Yiyo ke loo nto.
I didn't want to go either.	Nam ndandingafuni ukuhamba.
I want this.	Ndifuna le.
But, this.	Kodwa, oku.
Certainly not this one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo lo akazange.
For a really long time.	Ixesha elide ngokwenene.
We will certainly need help.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siya kufuna uncedo.
Very nice place.	Indawo entle kakhulu.
Isn't it?.	Akunjalo?.
This is nothing.	Oku akukho nto.

But it will be difficult for you.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima kuwe.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni na.
He never talked about it.	Akazange athethe ngayo.
There is a way to do that.	Kukho indlela yokwenza oko.
Well, not so much.	Ewe, hayi kakhulu.
He deserves it too.	Ufanele nawe.

He had to go there.	Kwafuneka aye apho.
Here it is.	Yiyo ke le.
Of course not.	Akunjalo ke.
I need to talk to him now '.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye ngoku'.
There is not much in it.	Akukho nto ingako kuyo.
I know what he wants.	Ndiyayazi into ayifunayo.
Maybe that could happen to me.	Mhlawumbi oko kunokwenzeka kum.

He did nothing.	Akazange enze nto.
None.	Akukho .
I just want to see.	Ndifuna nje ukubona.
I do not want to go.	Andifuni ukuhamba.
What you are sure of.	Oko uqinisekile ngayo.
Just a little bit.	Kuphela nje kancinci.
He looked down.	Uye wajonga phantsi.
Certainly not as it seems.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo njengoko kubonakala.
I didn't go either.	Nam andizange ndiye.
It is possible, but not impossible.	Kunokwenzeka, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
I just wish.	Ndinqwenela nje .
How are we going to do it.	Siza kwenza njani.
Maybe he knew then.	Mhlawumbi wayesazi ngoko.
As he has to do.	Njengoko kufuneka enze.
I did not want to go with him.	Ndandingafuni ukuhamba naye.
I can do this too.	Nam ndingayenza le nto.
I hope you like it !.	Ndiyathemba uyayithanda !.
Now you know everything.	Ngoku uyazi yonke into.
He just can't do it.	Akakwazi nje ukwenza.
But every morning.	Kodwa rhoqo kusasa.
It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
But no one.	Kodwa akukho mntu.
It can be very difficult to walk.	Kunokuba nzima kakhulu ukuhamba.
He tried, but he could not succeed.	Wazama, kodwa akazange akwazi ukuphumelela.
That means a lot.	Oko kuthetha kakhulu.
All right.	Kulungile.
I can't make money.	Andikwazi ukufumana imali.
Yeah, not me.	Ewe, hayi mna.
He wasn't, he thought.	Wayengekho, wacinga.

I do not know.	Andazi.
But with him, really.	Kodwa kunye naye, ngokwenene.
This is best for you.	Oku kungcono kuwe.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngaloo nto.
It's none of my business.	Akukho nto yam.
I'm happy though.	Ndiyavuya kodwa.
I don't know if this is true.	Andazi ukuba yinyani na le.

There is no place for him.	Akukho ndawo yakhe.

That's what it is.	Yiloo nto ke.
Bad.	Embi.
But this one did.	Kodwa lo wenza.
Well, no, maybe.	Ewe, hayi, mhlawumbi.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andazi ncam ukuba yintoni na.
A little bit .	Kancinci .
Not only that.	Akunjalo kuphela.
Not just me.	Hayi mna kuphela.
Okay, but not too much.	Kulungile, kodwa hayi kakhulu.

She would like to talk to him about it.	Angathanda ukuthetha naye ngayo.
Therefore.	Ngoko ke.
But he is coming.	Kodwa lowo uza.

He did not know what he was planning to do.	Wayengazi ukuba uceba ntoni.
It's hard for me.	Kunzima kum.
I do not really know.	Andazi ngenene.
But he does not have to.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba ayenze loo nto.
It is even more possible.	Kunokwenzeka ngakumbi.
A little, but not really.	Kancinci, kodwa hayi ngokwenene.
So he did not.	Ngoko akazange.
Soon, he thought.	Kungekudala, wacinga.
I did not know yet.	Andizange ndiyazi okwangoku.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
This is a good thing.	Yinto entle le.
Not very well.	Hayi kakuhle.
Only, he did not appear.	Kuphela, akazange abonakale.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
I did this.	Ndenze oku.
No, not now.	Hayi, hayi ngoku.
Just a big bike.	Ibhayisekile nje enkulu.
Not until then.	Hayi kude kube ngoko.
Or a house.	Okanye indlu.
I want to do it.	Ndifuna ukuyenza.
I want to talk.	Ndifuna ukuthetha.
Not really.	Akukho nyani.
You go to him.	Uya kuye.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
A really big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu ngokwenene.
Isn't it .	Akunjalo .
That's not it.	Ayinguye lowo.
He never said anything about you to me.	Zange athethe nto ngawe kum.
Not too much travel.	Hayi ukuhamba kakhulu.
This can be a big deal.	Oku kunokuba yinto enkulu.
Not too early.	Akukho kwangethuba.
He thought hard.	Wacinga kakhulu.
He wanted to know where he was.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba uphi na.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Doing less but doing better.	Ukwenza kancinci kodwa ukwenza ngcono.
That will be much easier.	Oko kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
No one knew why or how it happened.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba kwakutheni okanye kwenzeke njani.
Nobody seems to want me here.	Akukho mntu ubonakala endifuna apha.
He did not, but only.	Akazange, kodwa kuphela.
You knew nothing.	Ubungazi nto.
I can't say why.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ukuba kutheni.
Because there is nothing here.	Kuba akukho nto apha.
I'm not sure what his problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki yakhe.
Thinking about you.	Ndicinga ngawe.
Only now did he not give up.	Kuphela ngoku akazange ayeke.
He wants everything.	Ufuna yonke into.
You just have to stay.	Kufuneka ukuhlala kuphela.
But it is time to do something new.	Kodwa lixesha lokwenza into entsha.
What a great.	Yintoni enkulu.
Very early, obviously.	Kwangoko kakhulu, ngokucacileyo.
In the end, he said it was all right.	Ekugqibeleni, wathi kulungile.
He did not leave.	Akazange ahambe.
Maybe soon enough.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
For a long time, it seems.	Ixesha elide, kubonakala.
He is not here.	Akakho apha.
No problem at all.	Akukho ngxaki kuyo nantoni na.
That means now.	Oko kuthetha ngoku.
But eventually he had to leave.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni kwafuneka ahambe.
I have done everything.	Ndiyenze yonke into.
A little, a little bit.	Kancinci, kancinci kancinci.
He thought he knew.	Wayecinga ukuba uyazi.
I know it's true.	Ndiyazi ukuba yinyani.
That makes it easier to stay.	Oko kwenza kube lula ukuhlala.
That no one, really.	Oko akukho mntu, ngokwenene.
At work.	Emsebenzini.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
I don't like it.	Andiyithandi mna.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
But it had to be everything or nothing.	Kodwa kwafuneka ukuba yonke into okanye akukho nto.
He looked down at everyone.	Wajonga wonke umntu phantsi.
That's not it.	Ayinguye lowo.
Not to stay.	Hayi ukuhlala.
He certainly did not want to be that way.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengafuni ukuba njalo.
I think in advance it is better.	Ndicinga ukuba kwangethuba kungcono.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
You know it well.	Uyazi kakuhle.
That's really everything.	Yiloo nto ngokwenene yonke into.
But maybe not for long.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi ixesha elide.
We know what's coming.	Siyazi into ezayo.
Not immediately.	Hayi ngoko nangoko.
But maybe something.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kukho into.
He went to school there.	Waya esikolweni apho.
But he did not speak.	Kodwa akazange athethe.
Today, this is not the case.	Namhlanje, oku akunjalo.
This is not far off.	Oku akukho kude.
I know you speak well, but.	Ndiyazi ukuba uthetha kakuhle, kodwa .
It wasn't long.	Khange kube kudala.
He did not do this.	Akazange enze oku.
It’s really better together.	Kungcono ngokwenene kunye.
Would you like to know.	Ungathanda ukwazi.
I'm not sure what this is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni le.
I have to think about that.	Kufuneka ndicinge ngaloo nto.
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi .
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
It had to be that way.	Bekufanele kube njalo ke.
I want to talk to her.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye.
I told everyone.	Ndaxelela wonke umntu.
More, now, more.	Ngakumbi, ngoku, ngakumbi.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.
Well, now we will.	Ewe, ngoku siza kwenza njalo.
Doing too many things.	Ukwenza izinto ezininzi.
He started talking.	Waqalisa ukuthetha.
Something like that.	Into enjalo.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
He wanted to do it again.	Wayefuna ukuyenza kwakhona.
Or maybe something else.	Okanye mhlawumbi enye into.
To me there is nothing.	Kum akukho nto.
He has to say something.	Kufuneka athethe into.
It's hard to stay.	Kunzima ukuhlala.
Probably not yet.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo nangoko.
So, for a long time.	Ngoko, ixesha elide.
Sure, that's it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, leyo yinto.
He has agreed to do that.	Uye wavuma ukuyenza loo nto.
No more .	Hayi kwakhona .
Soon, he thought.	Kungekudala, wacinga.
Tell me that's okay.	Ndixelele ukuba oko kulungile.
But it has to be.	Kodwa kufuneka kube njalo.
He looked only at her.	Wajonga kuye kuphela.
That is possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka.
Or just being there.	Okanye ukuba khona nje.
Not everyone has his book.	Akukho ncwadi yakhe wonke umntu.
But in this case, no, not really.	Kodwa kule nto, hayi, hayi ngokwenene.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I will come to you.	Ndiya kuza kuwe.
But you do not want to.	Kodwa awufuni.
Well, yes, he knew why.	Ewe, ewe, wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
But he did not say anything.	Kodwa akazange athethe nto.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
I have to do it too.	Nam kufuneka ndiyenze.
But this, he thought.	Kodwa oku, wacinga.
Obviously, he doesn't.	Ngokucacileyo, akayi.
It will be so here.	Kuya kuba njalo apha.
Not soon.	Akukho kungekudala.
You know my way.	Uyayazi indlela yam.
.	.
Or a book.	Okanye incwadi.
You do not want to be alone, too.	Awufuni ukuba wedwa, nawe.
See how it is.	Ukubona ukuba njani.
He loves his house, but not everyone.	Uyayithanda indlu yakhe, kodwa ayinguye wonke umntu.
But he has to go.	Kodwa kufuneka ahambe.
I am well aware of that.	Ndiyazi kakuhle loo nto.
She would like to know.	Angathanda ukwazi.
Staying is your thing.	Ukuhlala yinto yakho.
I don't know why exactly.	Andazi ukuba kutheni ngokwenene.
He doesn't know how.	Akayazi ukuba njani.
We should have done better.	Bekufanele ukuba senze ngcono.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
There is something, something, something.	Kukho into, into, into.
I want one, too.	Ndifuna enye, nam.
Everything.	Yonke into.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
I will not have it.	Andiyi kuba nayo.
Well, to me it is not.	Ewe, kum akunjalo.
He did not say anything else.	Akazange athethe enye into.
She sits down.	Uhlala phantsi.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
Everywhere, it's a really good thing.	Kuyo yonke indawo, yinto entle ngokwenene.
This is not necessary.	Oku akuyomfuneko.
That's the right thing to do.	Nantso into elungileyo ukuyenza.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
That is very difficult to do.	Oko kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
Very much like me.	Kakhulu njengam.
But it was not necessary.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko.
I think so.	Ndicinga njalo.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.
Maybe you're trying too hard.	Mhlawumbi uzama kakhulu.
I don't always want to.	Andifuni rhoqo.
Maybe it will get better.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba ngcono.
Everyone knows.	Wazi wonke umntu.
No, you should.	Hayi, ufanele.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi loo nto.
I'll do another one.	Ndiza kwenza enye.
He probably knew that this would happen.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba wayesazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
She sits down.	Uhlala phantsi.
I know nothing.	Andazi nto.
He did not.	Akazange.
I will be able to eat, eat, eat.	Ndiza kukwazi ukutya, ukutya, ukutya.
But he did not do that.	Kodwa akazange ayenze loo nto.
One understood.	Omnye waqonda.
He is here today.	Ulapha namhlanje.
No, it seems to us.	Akunjalo, kubonakala ngathi.
I'm not sure about this.	Andiqinisekanga ngale nto.
He is not even real.	Akakho nokuba yinyani.
But you may know better.	Kodwa usenokuba wazi ngcono.
Tomorrow is impossible.	Ngomso akunakwenzeka.
This will mean success.	Oku kuya kuthetha ukuphumelela.
He is a good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo.
He did not want to talk to her right away.	Akazange afune ukuthetha naye ngoko nangoko.
That's whatever he wants to do.	Yiyo nantoni na afuna ukuyenza.
He speaks well.	Uthetha kakuhle.
Again, this happened.	Kwakhona, oku kwenzeka.
It's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu.
I am very skeptical.	Ndiyathandabuza kakhulu.
Obviously.	Ngokucacileyo.
He just did it.	Uyenzile nje.
Not his thing.	Hayi into yakhe.
Sorry, but he is not at all.	Uxolo, kodwa ayinguye kwaphela.
If not.	Ukuba akunjalo.
It comes in handy.	Uza kakuhle.
It's been too long.	Ke ixesha elide kakhulu.
Everyone loves it so much.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda kakhulu.
Bad, for sure.	Embi, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He cannot speak.	Akakwazi ukuthetha.
I'd better do this quickly, he thought.	Kungcono ndiyenze ngokukhawuleza oku, wacinga.
He wants you to do it.	Ufuna ukuba uyenze.
Not to him.	Hayi kuye.
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani.
He can do that.	Angayenza loo nto.
He will not do this to her.	Akayi kuyenza le nto kuye.
I do not know.	Andazi.
Where to buy now.	Apho ukuthenga khona ngoku.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
It happened at home.	Kwenzeke ekhaya.
I do not know how.	Andazi ukuba njani.
I'm not sure how you feel about it.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uziva njani ngayo.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
Well, that's it.	Kulungile, yiloo nto.
I will not do it again.	Andiyi kuphinda.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
He tried anything.	Wazama nantoni na kanye.
I'm trying to do that.	Ndizama ukwenza oko.
He said he would not go.	Wathi akayi.
I did not know how.	Ndandingazi ukuba njani.
I do not know.	Andazi kodwa.
But there is another.	Kodwa kukho enye.
I don't know more.	Andazi ngakumbi.
This is obvious.	Le nto ngokucacileyo.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He finally understood.	Ekugqibeleni waqonda.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
But we will do it.	Kodwa siza kuyenza.
I know it completely now.	Ndiyazi ngokupheleleyo ngoku.
Not yet, he thought.	Hayi okwangoku, wacinga.
He did not speak to anyone.	Akazange athethe mntu.
But I can't.	Kodwa andikwazi.
You have to be alone.	Ufanele ukuba wedwa.
I'm sure of this.	Ndiqinisekile ngale nto.
I'm going to it.	Ndiya kuyo.
Someone to go to work.	Umntu ukuya emsebenzini.
He looked his way.	Wajonga indlela yakhe.
Of course not.	Ewe akukho ngaphandle.
A little too good.	Kancinci kakuhle kakhulu.
He needed help.	Wayefuna uncedo.
He will make it difficult for him.	Uya kwenza kube nzima kuye.
What's the matter with me? 	Yintoni ingxaki kum?
he thought.	wacinga.
No, far from it.	Hayi, kude kuyo.
Just as you like.	Kanye njengoko uthanda.
No matter how hard you try, no matter what you do.	Nokuba uzama kangakanani, nokuba wenza ntoni na.
Not you, obviously.	Hayi wena, ngokucacileyo.
So yeah, you know.	Ngoko ewe, uyazi.
Not monkeys.	Hayi nyani.
I don't know much.	Andazi kakhulu.
he thought.	wacinga.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
Now one.	Ngoku enye.
I know that for sure.	Ndiyayazi loo nto ngokuqinisekileyo.
Not so for him.	Akunjalo kuye.
This really will not end well.	Oku ngenene akuyi kuphela kakuhle.
No no no no no.	Hayi hayi hayi hayi hayi.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Nceda, ndixelele ukuba yintoni.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
You do not have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ube njalo.
I do not know either.	Andazi nam.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
You do as you wish.	Wenza njengoko ufuna.
Alone again alone.	Wedwa kwakhona wedwa.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
Or maybe he is the only one.	Okanye mhlawumbi nguye kuphela.
I'm not sure what the problem is here.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki apha.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He knew nothing about it.	Wayengazi nto ngayo.
No to me, no, no.	Hayi kum, hayi, hayi.
I thought he did.	Ndandicinga ukuba wenze njalo.
Where he would live.	Apho wayeza kuhlala khona.
But, if possible, here.	Kodwa, ukuba kunokwenzeka, apha.
We are fully aware of that fact.	Siyazi ngokupheleleyo loo nto.
He is the only one.	Nguye kuphela.
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka.
It's just completely new.	Yinto nje entsha ngokupheleleyo.
Yeah, not really.	Ewe, hayi ncam.
This happened a long time ago.	Oku kwenzeka kudala.
You have to go to him.	Kufuneka uye kuye.
Only very good.	Kuphela kakuhle kakhulu.
I could not do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza.
I really want to talk to you.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuthetha nawe.
He did not fully succeed, but he tried.	Akazange aphumelele ngokupheleleyo, kodwa wazama.
No police.	Akukho ndawo amapolisa.
You want to see things.	Ufuna ukubona izinto.
One did not stay here.	Omnye akazange ahlale apha.
He looked at the dog.	Wajonga inja.
I know you know.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyazi.
He said that it did not have to be this way.	Wathi akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
Doing this alone.	Ukwenza oku yedwa.
But why? 	Kodwa kutheni?
I knew he was going to go.	Ndandisazi ukuba uza kuya.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni kuthetha.
I don't want him to stop.	Andifuni ayeke.
But a little bit.	Kodwa kancinci.
I would love to know about it before.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ngayo ngaphambili.
No one told me.	Akukho mntu wandixelela.
You know that is not the case.	Uyazi ukuba akunjalo.
I don't want him to stop.	Andifuni ayeke.
You don't have to be.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba ube.
I did everything.	Ndenze yonke into.
No problem with that.	Akukho ngxaki ngaloo nto.
Not immediately.	Akukho ngokukhawuleza.
Maybe I think too much of it.	Mhlawumbi ndicinga kakhulu kuyo.
Of course not.	Ewe akunjalo.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle ke leyo.
I will have to do it.	Kuya kufuneka ndenze .
Time to do it !.	Ixesha lokuba wenze!.
You know what happens.	Uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
How difficult.	Kunzima kangakanani.
I'm thinking of doing that too.	Ndicinga ukwenza loo nto nam.
I can't find this.	Andikwazi ukufumana oku.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
When it was not necessary.	Xa kwakungeyomfuneko.
No, that's fine.	Hayi, kulungile.
This is a very good thing.	Le yinto entle kakhulu.
He stayed.	Wahlala.
Not here.	Hayi apha.
He must do so.	Kufuneka enjenjalo.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe, yinyani leyo.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
No, it is not.	Hayi, akunakwenzeka.
But maybe this is me.	Kodwa mhlawumbi ndim lo.
I can't find the problem.	Andikwazi ukufumana ingxaki.
I hope it is good for you.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kulungile kuwe.
This is a big deal for me.	Le yinto enkulu kum.
What will happen tomorrow?	Kuza kwenzeka ntoni ngomso.
I will not say anything.	Andiyi kuthetha nto.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
He did not want to talk about it.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha ngayo.
He did this.	Uyenzile le nto.
I had to think.	Kwafuneka ndicinge.
I'm certainly not sure.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andiqinisekanga.
There is always something new happening.	Kuhlala kukho into entsha eyenzekayo.
Purchase is no exception.	Ukuthenga akukho ngaphandle.
I said nothing to her.	Khange ndithethe nto kuye.
He has to move slowly.	Kufuneka ahambe kancinci.
There is a problem here.	Kukho ingxaki apha.
Maybe not tomorrow.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngomso.
It's over.	Kwaphela.
Probably not too soon.	Mhlawumbi kungekudala kakhulu.
That's the other one down.	Yiyo enye phantsi.
It's hard to read.	Kunzima ukufunda.
Learning to speak.	Ukufunda ukuthetha.
Maybe no, maybe yes.	Mhlawumbi hayi, mhlawumbi ewe.
Or make it very difficult.	Okanye wenze ukuba kube nzima kakhulu.
But do not do this.	Kodwa musa ukwenza oku.
It means that.	Kuthetha ukuba .
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
I didn't even know why.	Ndandingazi nokuba kutheni.
It's hard to know what to do.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuba wenze ntoni.
He did well.	Wenza kakuhle.
I want to do something to help.	Ndifuna ukwenza into ukunceda.
Not just.	Hayi nje.
No one is talking about us.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngathi.
But otherwise.	Kodwa ngenye indlela.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma kwangoko.
It is not easy there.	Akukho lula apho.
It's a lot harder than you think.	Kunzima kakhulu kunokuba ucinga.
Obviously, too.	Ngokucacileyo, kakhulu.
I thought you might like it.	Bendicinga ukuba ungathanda.
But it won't say much.	Kodwa akuyi kuthetha kakhulu.
My place.	Indawo yam.
So that's fine.	Ngoko ke kulungile.
You know you deserve it.	Uyazi ukuba ufanele.
Not just me.	Hayi nje mna.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
We know everything that happens here.	Siyazi yonke into eyenzekayo apha.
He just didn't want to know about us.	Wayengafuni nje ukwazi ngathi.
I just want to be alone.	Ndifuna nje ukuba ndedwa.
All right, sorry.	Kulungile, uxolo.
I thought the same thing with me.	Bendicinga into enye nam.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
Well, he thought so.	Ewe, wayecinga njalo.
We better do it quickly.	Kungcono ukuba siyenze ngokukhawuleza.
Not really anything, but a lot of things.	Hayi ngokwenene nantoni na, kodwa izinto ezininzi.
Throughout this place.	Kuyo yonke le ndawo.
But not for me.	Kodwa hayi kum.
Here it is again.	Nantso ke kwakhona.
I can't do this.	Andikwazi ukwenza oku.
Dinner.	Ukutya ebusuku.
He certainly looked like he would.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayekhangeleka ngathi uya kuba njalo.
He said it is very difficult.	Uthe kunzima kakhulu.
That's what happened.	Yinto eyenzekayo.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
I can't do that right now.	Andikwazi ukuyenza loo nto okwangoku.
I try very hard.	Ndizama kakhulu.
Is it difficult.	Ngaba kunzima .
He agreed to come to her.	Wavuma ukuba eze kuye.
But that is exactly what happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka loo nto kanye.
It seems like a lot of work right now.	Kubonakala ngathi umsebenzi kakhulu ngoku.
I don't know why really.	Andazi kutheni ngenene.
You do not think clearly.	Awucingi ngokucacileyo.
Now it is very difficult.	Ngoku kunzima kakhulu.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
He did well.	Wenza kakuhle.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
But he is not always.	Kodwa akakho njalo.
This is a long time coming.	Oku kudala kuza.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu .
I thought that was probably a good thing.	Ndandicinga ukuba mhlawumbi yinto entle leyo.
That's fine.	Kulungile oko.
You are not going anywhere.	Awuyi ndawo.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
He said he wanted to help.	Wathi ufuna ukunceda.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
But you know you won't do anything.	Kodwa uyazi ukuba akuyi kwenza nto.
Nobody says that.	Akukho mntu uthetha loo nto.
No matter how out.	Nokuba ngaphandle kangakanani.
No one said it would be easy.	Akukho mntu uthe kuya kuba lula.
Nothing before.	Akukho nto ngaphambili.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
But then again, probably not.	Kodwa ke kwakhona, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
It has to mean something.	Kufuneka kuthetha into.
I can do better here alone.	Ndingayenza ngcono apha ndedwa.
Slowly, no.	Kancinci, hayi.
Well, of course, one has to have it.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo, umntu kufuneka abe nayo.
She is trying to move slowly.	Uzama ukuhamba kancinci.
I can't be alone, either.	Andikwazi ukuba ndedwa, nam.
Now it will be more difficult.	Ngoku kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi.
It happened then.	Kwenzeka ngoko.
He thought nothing of it.	Akazange acinge nto.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona.
Or no one will do it.	Okanye akukho mntu uya kwenza.
She loves it there.	Uyayithanda apho.
You are sure to like this place.	Uqinisekile ukuba uyayithanda le ndawo.
What.	Yintoni na.
he said.	uthe.
You do not want to know.	Awufuni ukwazi.
That's it.	Yiyo loo nto.
Not until today.	Hayi kude kube namhlanje.
Maybe I will.	Mhlawumbi ndiya kwenza njalo.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andiyi.
But he may well have thought so.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba wayecinga .
As it should be.	Njengoko kufuneka kube njalo.
Or, so again, maybe not.	Okanye, ngoko kwakhona, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
A little bit maybe.	Kancinci kancinci mhlawumbi.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
I would not want too much.	Andiyi kufuna kakhulu.
I just don't want to.	Andifuni nje.
But anyone.	Kodwa nabani na.
Well not quite.	Kulungile hayi ngokupheleleyo.
I'm glad this happened.	Ndiyavuya ukuba kwenzeke oku.

Finally he sat down.	Ekugqibeleni wahlala phantsi.
But no one.	Kodwa akukho mntu.
You probably know.	Usenokuba uyazi.
Now nothing.	Ngoku akukho nto.
He agreed to everything.	Wavuma kuyo yonke into.
Just, really alone.	Nje, ngenene wedwa.
he thought.	wacinga.
He did not say anything else.	Akazange athethe enye into.
That can really happen.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
At night you come here.	Ebusuku uza apha.
It's a long time.	Lixesha elide.
No one does this.	Akukho mntu wenza oku.
It lasts a long time.	Uhlala ixesha elide.
John did well.	UJohn wenza kakuhle.
He said he should be alone.	Wathi kufuneka abe yedwa.
No one can have it all.	Akukho mntu unokuba nayo yonke into.
I think so.	Ndicinga njalo.
Well, no, it's not.	Ewe, hayi, akunjalo.
Not just for me.	Hayi kum kuphela.
No one has shared.	Akukho mntu uye waba.
Well, not just.	Ewe, hayi nje.
He knows it has to happen.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka yenzeke.
For now.	Okwangoku.
Or he did, once.	Okanye wenza, kanye.
This is a big deal.	Yinto enkulu le.
But one more thing.	Kodwa enye into.
It happens very often everywhere.	Kwenzeka rhoqo kakhulu kuyo yonke indawo.
But that is simply not possible.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
But not so with me.	Kodwa akunjalo kum.
I wish only one thing.	Ndinqwenela into enye kuphela.
No, you really do not want to.	Hayi, ngenene awufuni.
This seems to us.	Oku kubonakala ngathi.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
What do you plan to do with it ?.	Uceba ukwenza ntoni ngayo?.
Now you .	Ngoku wena .
Obviously something else is happening here.	Ngokucacileyo kukho enye into eyenzekayo apha.
He did not stay long.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide.
Is true.	Yinyani.
He certainly knew better than I did.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayesazi ngcono kunam.
But if you only knew.	Kodwa ukuba ubusazi.
I want everything to happen now.	Ndifuna yonke into yenzeke ngoku.
Great big thing.	Into enkulu enkulu.
But he did nothing about it.	Kodwa akazange enze nto ngaloo nto.
I did something.	Ndenze into.
I would like to say something right away.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha into ngoko nangoko.
But he did not stay there long.	Kodwa akazange ahlale ixesha elide apho.
I did that.	Ndenze loo nto.
You just want time.	Ufuna nje ixesha.
I can not see.	Andikwazi kubonakala.
It's hard for you.	Kunzima kuwe.
But not much more.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu ngakumbi.
No one tried to say a word.	Akukho mntu wazama ukuthetha kancinci.
One way.	Enye indlela.
he thought.	wacinga.
But he could not.	Kodwa akazange akwazi.
Don't talk about it.	Musa ukuthetha ngayo.
You, me and him.	Wena, mna naye.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wakwenza oko.
That's why he wanted to go.	Yiyo loo nto wayefuna ukuhamba.
I will not.	Andiyi.
He said he did.	Wathi wenza.
It seems impossible.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka.
But what happens when you.	Kodwa kwenzeka ntoni xa wena.
He did not think so.	Akazange acinge njalo.
Tomorrow, yes, but not today.	Ngomso, ewe, kodwa hayi namhlanje.
There are so many things here.	Kukho izinto ezininzi apha.
I just want something bigger.	Ndifuna nje into enkulu.
I don't want to do this.	Andifuni ukwenza oku.
I don't know anything else.	Andazi enye into.
But there is someone else there.	Kodwa kukho omnye umntu apho.
Why you ?.	Kutheni wena?.
But nobody thinks about that.	Kodwa akukho mntu ucinga ngaloo nto.
Yes, not long ago.	Ewe, hayi kudala.
Only you and me, really.	Mna nawe kuphela, ngenene.
What.	Yintoni na.
It seems like a thing.	Kubonakala ngathi yinto.
If it is.	Ukuba nguye.
You just want to do it.	Ufuna nje ukuyenza.
He can do it.	Uyakwazi ukwenza.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
Only he did not know how.	Kuphela wayengazi ukuba njani.
He did so.	Wenza njalo .
Maybe it's time.	Mhlawumbi lixesha.
I wonder if this is it.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba ngaba oku.
I can't say such a thing.	Andikwazi ukuthetha into enjalo.
He did not do so.	Akazange enze njalo.
Reading is hard.	Ukufunda kunzima.
Because he is.	Kuba nguye.
He must have wanted to talk to her.	Umele ukuba wayefuna ngokwenene ukuthetha naye.
Well with it all.	Kakuhle ngayo yonke.
You go to it.	Uya kuyo.
Just a little better.	Ngcono nje kancinci.
It makes it difficult.	Kwenza kube nzima.
So this means.	Ngoko oku kuthetha.
It could just be you.	Unokuba nguwe nje.
Or this morning.	Okanye ngale ntsasa.
That is good for me.	Oko kulungile kum.
You will want to see this.	Uya kufuna ukubona oku.
This can just be a thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto nje.
He did not want to.	Wayengafuni.
No, not at all.	Hayi, akunjalo kwaphela.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
You know, it's the same thing.	Uyazi, yinto enye.
I know that now.	Ndiyayazi loo nto ngoku.
I think what it is.	Ndicinga ukuba yintoni na.
So he tried.	Ngoko wazama.
I hope to see everyone there.	Ndiyathemba ukubona wonke umntu apho.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
Why.	Kutheni .
Not next week.	Hayi kwiveki ezayo.
He is not alone.	Akakho yedwa.
And now what.	Ke ngoku yintoni.
You might just be.	Usenokuba nje .
I have to think, not talk.	Kufuneka ndicinge, hayi ukuthetha.
I did not know for sure.	Ndandingazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Or another job.	Okanye omnye umsebenzi.
His really.	Yakhe ngokwenene.
Maybe someone else did.	Mhlawumbi omnye umntu wenza.
It can be very difficult.	Kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
All the way, whatever it is.	Yonke indlela, nokuba yintoni na.
I had to do it all.	Kwafuneka ndiyenze yonke.
Maybe more.	Mhlawumbi ngakumbi.
He has to do it.	Kufuneka enze njalo.
This is just a fact.	Le yinyani nje.
That seems too old.	Oko kubonakala kudala kakhulu.
Another.	Enye .
I don't like it here.	Andiyithandi apha.
I would really like to buy one.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukuthenga enye.
I will always think well of you.	Ndiya kuhlala ndicinga kakuhle ngawe.
But that's the problem now.	Kodwa nantso ke ingxaki ngoku.
He must have known by now.	Umele ukuba wayesazi ngoku.
He looked at me.	Wajonga kum.
This will happen.	Oku kuya kwenzeka.
It will be necessary.	Kuya kufuneka.
We know that for sure.	Siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo oko.
I don't like it.	Andiyithandi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I should have known.	Bekufanele ndiyazi.
He will not say why.	Akayi kuthetha ukuba kutheni.
So, what did he do.	Ke, wenza ntoni.
Well, maybe not.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He really needs help.	Ufuna uncedo ngenene.
Not yet, not now.	Hayi okwangoku, hayi ngoku.
There is no way for you.	Akukho ndlela kuwe.
You want to know.	Ufuna ukwazi.
Do you think so? 	Ngaba ucinga njalo?
he said.	uthe.
You know this place.	Uyayazi le ndawo.
But he was coming.	Kodwa wayeza.
But you know that.	Kodwa uyayazi loo nto.
Maybe you really think.	Mhlawumbi ucinga ngokwenene.
The man did not speak.	Umntu akazange athethe.
Who is this .	Ngubani lo .
She is very happy.	Uyavuya kakhulu.
Maybe it's okay to be so.	Mhlawumbi kulungile ukuba kube njalo.
It certainly seems like one.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi enye.
That is old enough.	Kudala ngokwaneleyo oko.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
But you know.	Kodwa uyazi.
I think we will be together for a long time.	Ndicinga ukuba siza kuba kunye ixesha elide.
Now you know better.	Ngoku uyazi ngcono.
But he knew nothing.	Kodwa wayengazi nto.
I never knew why.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba kutheni.
I think everyone does.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu wenza njalo.
But to simplify everything.	Kodwa ukwenza lula yonke into.
It can be difficult.	Kunokuba nzima.
You think, yes.	Ucinga ukuba, ewe.
Tell me now.	Ndixelele ngoku.
He felt the need to be alone.	Waziva efuna ukuba yedwa.
It is much better to have this.	Kungcono kakhulu ukuba lo.
That's it.	Yiyo loo nto.
We need both.	Kufuneka sobabini.
.	.
More on that now.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto ngoku.
Or that.	Okanye ukuba.
But that is about to happen.	Kodwa kwenzeka loo nto.
I want a job.	Ndifuna umsebenzi.
He had to stop walking.	Kwafuneka ayeke ukuhamba.
I did not tell him everything.	Khange ndimxelele yonke into.
Finally, he thought.	Ekugqibeleni, wacinga.
Maybe, or not.	Mhlawumbi, okanye hayi.
I could not do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza.
We will be with you soon.	Siza kuba nawe kungekudala.
I will have to do this alone.	Kuza kufuneka ndiyenze ndedwa le nto.
He did not go with her.	Akazange naye.
Now food.	Ngoku ukutya.
I didn't say anything else.	Khange ndithethe enye into.
You have to do better.	Kufuneka wenze ngcono.
You know, something new.	Uyazi, into entsha.
I was thinking badly.	Ndandicinga kakubi.
But all that now.	Kodwa yonke loo nto ngoku.
But it is very difficult to do this with it.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ukwenza oku ngayo.
No, not now.	Akunjalo, hayi ngoku.
Did he want to do it again.	Ngaba wayefuna ukuyenza kwakhona.
But he said no.	Kodwa wathi hayi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
That is hard enough.	Oko kunzima ngokwaneleyo.
He makes it hard for him to stay.	Wenza ukuba kube nzima ukuba ahlale.
He also did not want to leave.	Naye wayengafuni ukuhamba.
He would talk to her immediately.	Wayeza kuthetha naye ngokukhawuleza.
He did not know where he wanted to be.	Akazange apho wayefuna ukuba khona.
This, no, is not.	Oku, hayi, akunjalo.
Maybe you should have done a lot of things.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele ukuba wenze izinto ezininzi.
He knew very well.	Wayesazi kakhulu.
I did not know.	Bendingazi.
He has agreed to go.	Uye wavuma ukuhamba.
He didn't know what to do with it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngayo.
I don't know how exactly.	Andazi ukuba njani kanye.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni athethe.
Sure, you know.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, uyazi.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
I never told her that.	Khange ndimxelele lonto.
You will get better there.	Uya kuba ngcono apho.
You want to do well.	Ufuna ukwenza kakuhle.
You know it will be difficult.	Uyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
He wanted to eat.	Wayefuna ukutya.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
This requires space.	Oku kufuna indawo.
I didn't, I didn't.	Andizange, andizange.
I know, I know.	Ndiyazi, ndiyazi.
I did this for myself.	Ndenze oku kum.
I think it should.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka.
But really, no.	Kodwa ngokwenene, hayi.
Well, not everything.	Ewe, hayi yonke into.
.	.
We certainly know that now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo siyazi ukuba ngoku.
Not so much here.	Hayi kakhulu apha.
He speaks alone.	Uthetha yedwa.
Everyone wants to stop.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuba ayeke.
It's hard to walk.	Kunzima ukuhamba.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Akukho nto, akukho nto, akukho nto.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi kanye.
That is good for him.	Oko kulungile kuye.
Now there is only one.	Ngoku kukho enye kuphela.
He did not look for an opportunity.	Akazange afune ithuba.
No one really knew what to do with it.	Akukho mntu wayesazi kakuhle ukuba enze ntoni ngayo.
He wanted to do what was right.	Wayefuna ukwenza into elungileyo.
I'm always scared.	Ndiyoyika rhoqo.
But he stayed there.	Kodwa wahlala apho.
But sooner or later everyone did.	Kodwa ngokukhawuleza okanye kamva wonke umntu wenza.
He will do that immediately.	Uza kuyenza loo nto ngoko nangoko.
I need to talk to you today.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe namhlanje.
Not a bad thing at all.	Hayi into embi ncam.
He just sat there.	Wahlala nje apho.
This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
He stayed that way for a long time.	Wahlala enjalo ixesha elide.
To do such a thing.	Ukwenza into enjalo.
But now, he didn't know what to do.	Kodwa ngoku, wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni na.
I have to think the same thing.	Nam kufuneka ndicinge njalo.
Things to him.	Izinto kuye.
No no.	Hayi, hayi.
I am.	Mna ke.
Something terrible happened.	Kwenzeke into embi.
I'm not sure where or how to do this.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba ndingayenza phi okanye njani le nto.
Or he did not.	Okanye akazange enze.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.
No! 	Hayi!
I want to do better myself.	Ndifuna ukwenza ngcono mna.
But this is true.	Kodwa le yinyani.
It is very difficult for me to do anything.	Kunzima kakhulu kum ukwenza nantoni na.
Everyone knows it.	Wonke umntu uyayazi.
Really, you do not want to.	Ngokwenene, awufuni.
I thought it would be hard.	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
That's it.	Yiyo ke loo nto.
So this can be the case, for me.	Ngoko oku kunokuba njalo, kum.
But he knew for sure that this was not the case.	Kodwa wayesazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba khange kube njalo.
I want to be me and no one else.	Ndifuna ukuba ndim hayi omnye umntu.
He didn't know it was time.	Wayengazi ukuba lixesha.
You will not be.	Awuyi kuba .
When you want.	Xa ufuna.
So how about that.	Ngoko njani ngaloo nto.
Everything is a thing.	Yonke into yinto.
But I am the one who says this.	Kodwa ndim lo uthetha lento.
This does the job.	Oku kwenza umsebenzi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Absolutely.	Ngokupheleleyo.
There is a chance that.	Kukho ithuba lokuba.
But it looks really good.	Kodwa kubonakala kulungile ngokwenene.
.	.
Don't be.	Musa ukuba.
He went to it.	Waya kuyo.
This does it fast.	Oku kuyenza ngokukhawuleza.
.	.
No, not now, not later.	Hayi, hayi ngoku, kamva.
I did not speak to him directly.	Khange ndithethe naye ncam.
It has to mean something.	Kufuneka kuthetha into.
I don't want it to happen.	Andifuni kwenzeke.
I think a lot.	Ndicinga kakhulu.
But one has to make a decision.	Kodwa umntu kufuneka enze isigqibo.
It seems to me very much.	Kubonakala kum kakhulu.
But you want to make a lot of money quickly.	Kodwa ufuna ukwenza imali eninzi ngokukhawuleza.
Not too long.	Hayi ixesha elide kakhulu.
This he very much knew.	Oku kakhulu wayesazi.
If it's true, fine.	Ukuba yinyani, kulungile.
Such he thought.	Enjalo wacinga.
Yes, certainly next week.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo kwiveki ezayo.
He did a lot of time.	Wenza ixesha elininzi.
To you alone.	Kuwe wedwa.
He was not here.	Wayengekho apha.
Where are you?!.	Uphi?!.
I'm just happy.	Ndiyavuya nje.
That's what happened here.	Nantso ke into eyenzekayo apha.
Well, not everything.	Ewe, hayi yonke into.
But you already know that.	Kodwa sele uyayazi loo nto.
Tomorrow, maybe, we'll have him.	Ngomso, mhlawumbi, siza kuba naye.
Sorry, please.	Uxolo, nceda.
He agreed to be alone.	Wavuma ukuba yedwa.
So he said nothing.	Ngoko akazange athethe nto.
He wants to go.	Ufuna ukuhamba.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
So there you are.	Ngoko nantso.
Something is happening there.	Kukho into eyenzekayo apho.
This is a big deal.	Le yinto enkulu.
Yes, that is exactly what happened.	Ewe, oko kwenzeka ngokwenene.
But you can be.	Kodwa unokuba njalo.
I do not believe it to be true.	Andikholelwa ukuba yinyani.
This one! 	Le!
he said.	uthe.
That's his big thing.	Nantso into yakhe enkulu.
He does not know here.	Akazi apha.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ukuba uyayazi lonto.
There is, but not really, not exactly.	Kukho, kodwa hayi ngokwenene, hayi ncam.
She would love that.	Angathanda oko.
I had no idea how I felt about it.	Ndandingazi ukuba ndiziva njani ngaloo nto.
He said nothing.	Zange athethe nto.
He finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni wavuma.
She sits down.	Uhlala phantsi.
That is not necessary at all.	Akuyomfuneko kwaphela oko.
How are you feeling?.	Uziva njani?.
It does not last long.	Akukho kuhlala ixesha elide.
No, not at all.	Akunjalo, ngakumbi.
Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacinga.
I am very happy.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu.
He knew but did not say anything.	Wayesazi kodwa akazange athethe nto.
Maybe you should.	Mhlawumbi ufanele ukuba.
This is probably the same thing.	Oku mhlawumbi yinto enye.
You do not have to be alone.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ube wedwa.
One never knows what will happen.	Umntu akazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
We will come again.	Siza kuza kwakhona.
But he did not say anything.	Kodwa ke akazange athethe nto.
Very nice thing.	Into entle kakhulu.
I want to do well.	Ndifuna ukwenza kakuhle.
Such a beautiful place.	Indawo entle kangaka.
Nowhere really.	Akukho ndawo ngokwenene.
You will be together.	Uya kuba kunye.
But not in the right way.	Kodwa hayi ngendlela elungileyo.
I think this is good.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kulungile.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
Not so soon.	Hayi ngoku kungekudala.
He thought it was okay.	Wayecinga ukuba kulungile.
He speaks well.	Uthetha kakuhle.
It means a lot.	Kuthetha into enkulu.
Now more quickly.	Ngoku ngokukhawuleza ngakumbi.
This will happen today.	Oku kuya kwenzeka namhlanje.
Yes, he is.	Ewe uqinisekile.
Anyone knows what's going on.	Nabani na uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
Again, no problem.	Kwakhona, akukho ngxaki.
He wants what he wants.	Ufuna le nto ayifunayo.
You have made a decision.	Wenze isigqibo.
We will talk about everything.	Siza kuthetha ngayo yonke into.
I don't want that to happen.	Andifuni ukuba yenzeke loo nto.
Big dog.	Inja enkulu.
But tonight there is something else.	Kodwa ngokuhlwanje kukho enye into.
I know where he went.	Ndiyamazi apho waya khona.
It seems unlikely that this would happen.	Kubonakala ngathi akunakwenzeka ukuba oku kunokuba njalo.
Maybe he can't, either.	Mhlawumbi akakwazi, naye.
He is now.	Nguye ngoku.
But you too one day.	Kodwa nawe ngenye imini.
Yeah, sorry about that.	Ewe, uxolo ngaloo nto.
Here or outside.	Apha okanye ngaphandle.
Anyone can do this.	Nabani na angayenza le nto.
To do, to do, to do.	Ukwenza, ukwenza, ukwenza.
Maybe you don't want to.	Mhlawumbi awufuni.
I just want to talk to him.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha naye.
I know who he is.	Ndiyazi ukuba ngubani.
Absolutely true.	Yinyani ngokupheleleyo.
If you did.	Ukuba uyenzile.
He had to speak alone.	Kwafuneka athethe yedwa.
The decision will be his.	Ukwenza isigqibo kuya kuba nguye.
What did I do? 	Ndenze ntoni?
Not a problem.	Hayi ingxaki.
There is something in it.	Kukho into kuyo.

Very nice place.	Indawo entle kakhulu.

I thought badly.	Ndicinge kakubi.
His work.	Umsebenzi wakhe .
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
I will do something great.	Ndiza kwenza into enkulu.
I never thought about it.	Khange ndicinge nto ngayo.

I don't know why exactly.	Andazi ukuba kutheni kanye kanye.
I talked a lot.	Ndithethe kakhulu.
You know what it is.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni na.
Not if you want to stay here.	Hayi ukuba ufuna ukuhlala apha.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
That's all.	Yiloo nto kuphela.
You really want to play.	Ufuna ngokwenene ukudlala.
Not a bad problem.	Hayi ingxaki embi.
He looked good.	Wayekhangeleka kakuhle.
But not anyone.	Kodwa hayi nabani na.

He started walking with it.	Waqalisa ukuhamba ngayo.
It is possible.	Kunokwenzeka.
You need to do what you think is right.	Kufuneka wenze oko ucinga ukuba kulungile.

It should be easy.	Kufuneka kube lula.
More on that soon !.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto kungekudala!.
I need to know tomorrow.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ngomso.

Nobody was going to do that.	Akukho mntu wayeza kuyenza loo nto.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
That's your thing.	Nantso into yakho.
He would surely come alone.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kuza yedwa.
I'm glad you're doing better now.	Ndiyavuya ukuba wenza ngcono ngoku.
I will do that now.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto ngoku.

In practice, perhaps.	Ngokwenza, mhlawumbi.
We know why, 'we know how.	Siyazi ukuba kutheni, 'siyazi ukuba njani.
It is difficult, but possible.	Kunzima, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
Does it really have to happen today.	Ngaba ngokwenene kufuneka yenzeke namhlanje.
But he was going.	Kodwa wayeza kuya.
We need to do better.	Kufuneka senze ngcono.
But he thought better of it, in the end.	Kodwa wacinga ngcono ngayo, ekugqibeleni.
I just want to talk.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha.
I can't talk about that.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngaloo nto.
But not quite.	Kodwa hayi ngokupheleleyo.
But now he has done it.	Kodwa ngoku uyenzile.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele ingxaki.
But, you know.	Kodwa, uyazi.
He did not know how to do such a thing.	Wayengazi ukuba angayenza njani into enjalo.
I'm happy for it.	Ndiyavuya kuyo.
You will not want to leave !.	Awuyi kufuna ukuhamba!.
Or it seems to us.	Okanye kubonakala ngathi.
I will want to do it again.	Ndiza kufuna ukuyenza kwakhona.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
I better do something else.	Kungcono ndenze enye into.
He agreed now.	Wavuma ngoku.
I never knew what the truth was about this.	Andizange ndiyazi ukuba yintoni inyani ngale nto.
You look better with it.	Ukhangeleka ngcono ngayo.
I said too much, or too little.	Ndithethe kakhulu, okanye kancinci kakhulu.
I want to go there.	Ndifuna ukuya apho.
All right, tomorrow.	Kulungile, kusasa.
It should be very simple.	Kufuneka kube lula kakhulu.
I don't really know.	Andikwazi ngokwenene.

I knew nothing about it, you know.	Ndandingazi nto ngayo, uyazi.
Only this is not easy.	Kuphela oku akukho lula.
No one told me.	Akukho mntu wandixelela.
He did a great thing.	Wenza into enkulu.
I don't believe anyone can do that.	Andikholelwa ukuba umntu angayenza loo nto.
He has to think he knows where.	Kufuneka acinge ukuba uyazi apho.
I made a lot of money.	Ndenze imali eninzi.
Of course not.	Ngokwenene, akunjalo.
It's hard to do that.	Kunzima ukuyenza loo nto.
There is just no one.	Akukho mntu nje.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
.	.
You have to say something.	Ufanele ukuthetha into.
Now he looked down.	Ngoku wajonga phantsi.
He did something new.	Wenza into entsha.
And then? 	Ke ngoku?
He said he wanted money.	Wathi ufuna imali.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
But now it is better.	Kodwa ngoku kungcono ngakumbi.
The food is always good.	Ukutya kuhlala kulungile.
Looks like no.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho.
I will say so.	Ndiza kuthetha njalo.
Not so here.	Akunjalo ke apha.
He will be with me.	Uya kuba nam.
She looked at him.	Uye wajonga kuye.
Or to him.	Okanye kuye.
It is finally necessary.	Kufuneka ekugqibeleni.
I can't win.	Andikwazi ukuphumelela.
.	.
Just a problem.	Ingxaki nje.
It is a good thing to do.	Yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
He really wanted to go.	Wayefuna kakhulu ukuhamba.
But this, this.	Kodwa oku, oku.
I would like to see your location.	Ndingathanda ukubona indawo yakho.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
That's not it.	Ayinguye lowo.
In the end, he made a decision.	Ekugqibeleni, wenza isigqibo.
I try harder.	Ndizama ngakumbi.
Yes, this is possible.	Ewe, oku kunokwenzeka.
Exactly why, he could not speak.	Kanye ukuba kutheni, akazange akwazi ukuthetha.
But no one.	Kodwa akukho mntu.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
This will be difficult enough.	Oku kuya kuba nzima ngokwaneleyo.
Not everyone will do that.	Akunjalo ukuba wonke umntu uya kwenza loo nto.
Well, that's what you need to do.	Ewe, yiloo nto ekufuneka uyenzile.
Only more.	Kuphela ngakumbi.
There is always one.	Kuhlala kukho enye.
It's a great thing to drive.	Yinto entle kakhulu ukuqhuba.
Not that anyone will speak.	Akunjalo ukuba nabani na uya kuthetha.
Well, well enough.	Kulungile, kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
He wanted very badly.	Wayefuna kakubi kakhulu.
No, not another.	Hayi, hayi enye.
Or I can talk about it.	Okanye ndikwazi ukuthetha ngayo.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andazi ncam ukuba yintoni na.
I don't know much about it.	Andazi kakhulu ngayo.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
I'm not sure either.	Nam andiqinisekanga.
he said.	uthe.
But there is.	Kodwa kukho.
Not all work.	Hayi wonke umsebenzi.
He thinks of us.	Ucinga ngathi.
If he only knew all that.	Ukuba wayesazi yonke loo nto.
Now my problem.	Ngoku ingxaki yam.
I have to think a little bit.	Kufuneka ndicinge kancinci.
Not like you're talking about it.	Hayi ngathi uthetha ngayo.
No one knew until now.	Akukho mntu wayesazi kude kube ngoku.
But like he never was here.	Kodwa ngathi akazange abe lapha.
This is a person.	Lo ngumntu.
But this is not necessary at all.	Kodwa oku akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
At night .	Ebusuku .
He is here to do something.	Ulapha ukwenza into.
But he did nothing.	Kodwa akazange enze nto.
No one wanted to know.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwazi.
No, not long ago.	Hayi, kungekudala.
Not too far away.	Hayi kude kakhulu.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But only once.	Kodwa kube kanye kuphela.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
But do nothing now.	Kodwa musa ukwenza nto ngoku.
Maybe someone else, then.	Mhlawumbi omnye umntu, ngoko.
Well done, very well.	Wenze kakuhle, kakuhle kakhulu.
But he looks bad.	Kodwa ukhangeleka ngathi wenza kakubi.
You mean it.	Uthetha yona.
I do not know for sure.	Andazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
he asked.	wabuza.
It's hard for me.	Kunzima kum.
I know it will be difficult.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
Good thing.	Into entle.
This will not be true.	Oku akuyi kuba yinyani.
Or don't.	Okanye musa.
It is likely that this will happen soon.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka kungekudala.
Maybe, you know.	Mhlawumbi, uyazi.
I just want to know.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi.
He only knew it was true.	Wayesazi kuphela ukuba yinyani.
That will be all of it.	Kuya kuba yiyo yonke loo nto.
He did not want to.	Wayengafuni .
You just look so alone.	Ukhangeleka wedwa nje.
That is a terrible thing.	Yinto embi ngokwenene leyo.
No there is not.	Hayi, akukho.
Nobody said you had to go somewhere.	Akukho mntu uthe kufuneka uye ndawo.
He lives here.	Uhlala apha.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, nguye ngokwenene.
This is much better.	Oku kungcono kakhulu.
Why here? 	Kutheni apha?
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
Not later now, not to him.	Akukho kamva ngoku, hayi kuye.
But here, there is a problem.	Kodwa apha, kukho ingxaki.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
This happens a lot.	Oku kwenzeka kakhulu.
This is not easy.	Oku akukho lula.
Not you and me.	Akukho mna nawe.
I'm sure of it.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo.
He looked at things.	Wajonga izinto.
That's the problem, really.	Nantso ingxaki, ngokwenene.
But it will not happen.	Kodwa akuyi kwenzeka.
This will be easy.	Oku kuya kuba lula.
Or last night.	Okanye phezolo.
It is more likely that it will be true.	Kunokwenzeka ngakumbi ukuba kuya kuba yinyani.
How, he didn't know.	Njani, wayengazi.
I want to know what you did.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba wenze ntoni.
I will make peace.	ndiya kwenza uxolo.
You will have money.	Uzakuba nayo imali.
Maybe or not.	Mhlawumbi okanye hayi.

If he has to succeed.	Ukuba kufuneka aphumelele.

The only place, really.	Indawo kuphela, ngokwenene.
He will do it, for now.	Uza kwenza, okwangoku.
I think so, yes.	Ndicinga njalo, ewe.
You just have to go to it.	Kufuneka nje uye kuyo.

His house.	Indlu yakhe.
He was not as difficult as everyone thought.	Wayengekho nzima njengoko wonke umntu wayecinga.

Here it is.	Yiyo ke le.
That's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu leyo.
Really, for a long time.	Ngokwenene, ixesha elide.
Or, maybe not.	Okanye, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
No one has ever been there.	Akukho mntu ukhe waya apho.
That is possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka.
Because I would like to get a job.	Kuba ndingathanda ukufumana umsebenzi.
I think you know the place.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayazi indawo.
He did not say much.	Khange athethe kakhulu.
It is impossible to know.	Akunakwenzeka ukwazi.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
Money to do whatever he really wants, when he wants to.	Imali yokwenza nantoni na ayifunayo ngokwenene, xa efuna.
He said he was.	Uye wathi nguye.
I could not say anything.	Khange ndikwazi ukuthetha nto.
No, maybe not.	Hayi, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
But you don't want to be with me enough.	Kodwa awufuni ukuba nam ngokwaneleyo.

Alone alone.	Eyedwa yedwa.
He did the right thing.	Wenza into elungileyo.
Or when you think about it.	Okanye xa ucinga ngayo.
But certainly not.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akukho.
If you are here with me.	Ukuba ulapha kunye nam.
That, yes.	Lowo, ewe.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
But he knew how.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba njani.

What's next.	Yintoni ezayo.
As if.	Ngoku, ngathi.

But you will get better.	Kodwa uya kuba ngcono.
I'm scared.	Ndiyoyika ke.
Just once for him.	Kanye nje kuye.
He will stay with you.	Uya kuhlala nawe.
I thought so too.	Nam bendicinga lonto.
Someone or.	Umntu okanye.
Probably, he thought.	Mhlawumbi, wacinga.
If you want to know what it is.	Ukuba ufuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
He is talking only about you.	Uthetha ngawe kuphela.
He will not be.	Akayi kuba.
Yes, he will do a good job.	Ewe, uya kwenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
You did a really good thing.	Wenze into elungileyo ngenene.
It's hard, you know.	Kunzima, uyazi.

Or, really.	Okanye, ngokwenene.
I know him.	Ndiyamazi.
This is something new to me.	Le yinto entsha kum.
I don't know how long exactly that time.	Andazi ukuba ixesha elingakanani kanye kanye.
It will not be so.	Akuyi kuba njalo.
She is not here now.	Akakho ngoku.
I did not know.	Bendingazi.
Learning to walk.	Ukufunda ukuhamba.
Nobody wanted to do anything.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwenza nantoni na.
I doubt it.	Ndiyathandabuza.
He wanted her to stop.	Wayefuna ukuba ayeke.
Today with me.	Namhlanje nam.
That is why we must do this.	Yiyo loo nto kufuneka senze oku.
It will be easy to do.	Kuya kuba lula ukwenza.
Tell everyone about it.	Xelela wonke umntu ngayo.
One.	Omnye .
He also did not mention it.	Naye akazange athethe ngayo.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
You obviously do not want to.	Ngokucacileyo awufuni.
I think he did.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze njalo.
At school.	Esikolweni.
Where you like.	Apho uthanda khona.
Because he thought he should.	Kuba wayecinga ukuba ufanele.
But there is only me here.	Kodwa kukho mna kuphela apha.
He will be with her.	Uya kuba naye.
I didn't want to do it.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza.
Now no one is going to talk to me.	Ngoku akukho mntu uza kuthetha nam.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
That really, really hard to do.	Oko ngokwenene, kunzima ngokwenene ukwenza.
No one is going anywhere.	Akukho mntu uya ndawo.
I will never do it again.	andiyi kuphinda ndiyenze.
At home today.	Ekhaya namhlanje.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
You just have to do it.	Kuya kufuneka uyenzile nje.
Like, no one knows.	Njengoko, akukho mntu uyazi.
But you need to know something.	Kodwa kufuneka wazi into.
I know nothing about you.	Andazi nto ngawe.
It's just a little good.	Kulungile nje kancinci.
I think so.	Ndicinga njalo.
Maybe it's true.	Mhlawumbi yinyani.
This will do.	Oku kuya kwenza.

Or anyone else.	Okanye nabani na omnye.
That is good or bad.	Oko kulungile okanye kulungile.
He knows all this.	Uyayazi yonke le nto.
That seems old-fashioned.	Oko kubonakala ngathi kudala.
That's the thing.	Nantso into.
he thought.	wacinga.
That is exactly the problem.	Yiloo ngxaki kanye.
That's all you need to know.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyazi.
He just agreed.	Wavuma nje.
He wants nothing.	Akafuni nto.
Now we have to do it.	Ngoku kufuneka senze.
I think that's fine with me.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile kum.
Just a little bit.	Ukuba nje kancinci.
Or a car.	Okanye imoto.
Yeah, all that.	Ewe, yonke loo nto.
You think you'd better do it with me then.	Ucinga ukuba kungcono uyenze kunye nam ke.

Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
Not me.	Hayi nam.
Not just one.	Hayi nje enye.
Just food.	Ukutya nje.

You did the right thing.	Wenze into elungileyo.
I'm glad you did that.	Ndiyavuya uyenzile loo nto.
He has to leave immediately.	Kufuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
Suddenly you know.	Ngokukhawuleza uyazi.
Yesterday was supposed to be.	Izolo bekufanele ukuba yiyo.
Living there is something else.	Ukuhlala apho kukho enye into.
I'm not sure, now.	Andiqinisekanga, ngoku.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
I think that is possible.	Ndicinga ukuba oko kunokwenzeka.
Yes, very much indeed.	Ewe, kakhulu ngokwenene.
It's hard to walk.	Kunzima ukuhamba.
This is not a problem at all.	Oku akukho ngxaki kwaphela apho.
It's really hard to do well.	Kunzima ngokwenene ukwenza kakuhle.
Someone wanted to talk to her.	Umntu wayefuna ukuthetha naye.
Talking to him.	Ukuthetha naye.

But it seems hard.	Kodwa kubonakala kunzima.
Yeah, one more thing.	Ewe, enye into.
I'm not sure either.	Nam andiqinisekanga.
Well, maybe not.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He went ahead of her.	Waya ngaphambili kuye.
He does not know the truth.	Akayazi inyani.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I thought it was so much better.	Ndandicinga ukuba kungcono kakhulu.
I did not go to the hospital.	Khange ndiye esibhedlele.
Impossible to purchase.	Akunakwenzeka ukuthenga.
Now, it.	Ngoku, yona.
No one will come.	Akukho mntu uya kuza.
That happened so quickly.	Oko kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza.
I am well aware of that.	Ndiyazi kakuhle loo nto.
Sounds good to me.	Kubonakala kulungile kum.
He also did not.	Naye akazange.
I don't know how I can do anything else.	Andazi ukuba ndingayenza njani enye into.
Not at all.	Akukho ngokupheleleyo.
This is really a big deal.	Oku ngenene yinto enkulu.
I want to say something to you.	Ndifuna ukuthetha into kuwe.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
That's cute.	Oko kulungile.

No, not very much.	Hayi, hayi kakhulu.
I didn't want to talk about it.	Ndandingafuni ukuthetha ngaloo nto.
Today, it is not.	Namhlanje, akunjalo.
Sorry we did.	Uxolo senze.
I wonder how you feel.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba uziva njani.
Thus outside.	Ngaloo ndlela ngaphandle.
It's not very easy.	Akukho lula kakhulu.
It's true now.	Yinyani ngoku.
I'll bring it.	Ndiza nayo.
This is evident throughout the book.	Oku kubonakala kuyo yonke le ncwadi.
He just wanted to go faster.	Wayefuna nje ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza.
You know that well.	Uyazi kakuhle loo nto.
Where he went, what he did.	Apho waya khona, wenza ntoni.
I told her so.	Ndamxelela njalo.
But he stayed away.	Kodwa wahlala kude.
Do you have to do some work?	Ngaba kufuneka wenze umsebenzi?
He never did this.	Akazange ayenze le nto.
Very nice car.	Imoto entle kakhulu.
Now she thought about it.	Ngoku wacinga ngayo.
I told her about it.	Ndamxelela ngayo.
This is not really the case.	Oku akunjalo ngokwenene.
We will have to do it.	Kuya kufuneka senze.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
I'm so happy right now.	Ndiyavuya ngoko ngoku.
Maybe someday, maybe someday soon.	Mhlawumbi ngenye imini, mhlawumbi ngenye imini kungekudala.
But he also knows it.	Kodwa naye uyayazi.
If not, you will not.	Ukuba akunjalo, awuyi.
So he says yes.	Ngoko uthi ewe.
Not to me, but to you.	Hayi kum, kodwa kuwe.
Not just this.	Hayi nje oku.
Tell me how it happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke njani.
So much we all know.	Kakhulu siyazi sonke.
Maybe that's why.	Mhlawumbi yiloo nto.
But he was not thinking clearly then.	Kodwa wayengacingi ngokucacileyo ngoko.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But not so much now.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu ngoku.
I feel confident about it.	Ndiziva ndiqinisekile ngayo.
There is nothing about that.	Akukho nto ngaloo nto.
Certainly if you do that regularly.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba ukwenza oko rhoqo.
Not if you know.	Akunjalo ukuba uyazi.
Everything happened so fast.	Yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
This is difficult for him.	Oku kunzima kuye.
It will not be so.	Akuyi kuba njalo.
Just, you did well.	Nje, wenze kakuhle.
That's right, yes.	Yinyani leyo, ewe.
You don’t think too much about it.	Awucingi kakhulu ngayo.
Yes this can be difficult.	Ewe oku kunokuba nzima.
It will be early.	Kuya kwangethuba.
He will be so.	Uya kuba njalo.
However, this is not the case here.	Kodwa ke, akunjalo apha.
There he is.	Naye ke lowo.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
I better do it alone.	Kungcono ndiyenze ndedwa.
You told me that.	Undixelele lonto.
You did well there.	Wenze kakuhle apho.
But he is a man.	Kodwa yindoda.
You did everything well.	Uyenze yonke into kakuhle.
Probably very good.	Mhlawumbi kakuhle kakhulu.
I want to go to school.	Ndifuna ukuya esikolweni.
Someone please help.	Umntu ndicela uncedo.
Or he did.	Okanye wenza.
Maybe that will settle down.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kuhlala phantsi.
I can't say who.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngubani.
Outside, that.	Ngaphandle, oko.
I'm happy then.	Ndiyavuya ngoko.
Well, that's not a problem at all.	Ewe, oko akukho ngxaki kwaphela.
How did this happen.	Yenzeke njani le nto.
Home at last.	Ekhaya ekugqibeleni.
He likes to make a lot of money.	Uthanda ukwenza imali kakhulu.
You may have already done so.	Usenokuba sele uyenzile.
To be better, by the way.	Ukuba ngcono, ngendlela.
he thought.	wacinga.
But for now it seems to us.	Kodwa okwangoku kubonakala ngathi .
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
But he has to go.	Kodwa kufuneka ahambe.
Now, you know that.	Ngoku, uyayazi loo nto.
I never thought why.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba kutheni.
You're sure of that.	Uqinisekile ngaloo nto.
He is not here.	Akakho apha.
Here it is.	Yiyo le.
You what? 	Wena ntoni?
.	.
If someone will be me.	Ukuba umntu uya kuba ndim.
So he thought.	Ngoko wacinga.
That happens everywhere.	Oko kwenzeka kuyo yonke indawo.
I would really like that.	Ndingathanda kakhulu ukuba.
But just a little bit.	Kodwa nje kancinci.
He will do anything.	Uya kwenza nantoni na.
That's what you need to do.	Nantso into ekufuneka uyenzile.
How to get this.	Ukufumana njani oku.
I need someone there.	Ndifuna umntu apho.
All this.	Yonke le nto.
But, yes, there is something.	Kodwa, ewe, kukho into.
Isn't that right?	Ngaba akunjalo ewe.
This is good.	Oku kulungile.
But this will be just you and me.	Kodwa oku kuya kuba ndim nawe kuphela.
I know what it will be like.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba njani.
But, it is true.	Kodwa, yinyani.
He did not know what to do.	Wayengazi ukuba uza kwenza ntoni.
If not tomorrow.	Ukuba akukho ngomso.
I would like to see.	Ndingathanda ukubona.
You will be alone.	Uzakuba wedwa.
We did everything well.	Senze yonke into kakuhle.
But not fast enough.	Kodwa hayi ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
Not for you.	Hayi kuwe.
A lot of money.	Imali eninzi.
He did not stay long.	Akazange ahlale phantsi ixesha elide.
Yes, it means yes, no it means no.	Ewe, kuthetha ewe, hayi kuthetha hayi.
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either.	Ewe kulungile ndixelele enye.
But, I don't know where the real problem is.	Kodwa, andazi apho ingxaki ngokwenene.
Yes, if you want to.	Ewe, ukuba ufuna njalo.
That's what everyone wants.	Yiloo nto wonke umntu ayifunayo.
That happened in the end.	Oko kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
I need to talk to you.	Kufuneka ndithethe nawe.
I don't know what.	Andazi yintoni.
Or it will seem to us.	Okanye kuya kubonakala ngathi.
I can do it all day.	Ndingayenza imini yonke.
I thought better of you.	Bendicinga ngcono ngawe.
Happy is the man.	Uyavuya umntu.
I have to go.	Kufuneka ndiye.
I really do not believe.	Andikholelwa ngokwenene.
I don't want to be you.	Andifuni ukuba nguwe.
He stayed, too.	Wahlala, naye.
This is not as easy as it seems.	Oku akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
Whatever that means for you.	Nokuba kuthetha ntoni oko kuwe.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.
He can't speak.	Akakwazi kuthetha.
Whatever.	Nokuba yintoni na.
But he stands for something.	Kodwa umele into.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Not before.	Akunjalo ngaphambili.
He doesn't know this.	Akayazi le nto.
He looked bad.	Wayekhangeleka embi.
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
He really thought he did.	Ngokwenene wayecinga ukuba uyenzile.
No, no, not alone.	Hayi, hayi, hayi yedwa.
What to do, he did not know.	Ukwenza ntoni, wayengazi.
Maybe you did it quickly.	Mhlawumbi uyenzile ngokukhawuleza.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
But it.	Kodwa yona.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
I did not tell anyone.	khange ndixelele mntu.
I hope it's okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kulungile.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
Going there alone was not necessary.	Ukuya apho ndedwa kwakungeyomfuneko.
He's just such a man.	Yindoda enjalo nje.
Obviously, that will not be easy.	Ngokucacileyo, oko akuyi kuba lula.
All right! 	Kulungile!
he thought.	wacinga.
Not where I want to.	Hayi apho ndifuna khona.
Only what.	Kuphela yintoni.
In a big way.	Ngendlela enkulu.
He just wanted to be better.	Wayefuna nje ukuba ngcono.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Ndiqinisekile uyayazi ukuba yintoni leyo.
Maybe he told me.	Mhlawumbi wandixelela.
I do not understand anything.	Andiqondi nto.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Yes, you should.	Ewe, ufanele.
If only, if only.	Ukuba kuphela, ukuba kuphela.
We will make it happen.	Siza kuyenza yenzeke.
Finding his way.	Ukufumana indlela yakhe.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
Something happened to him here.	Kukho into eyenzekayo kuye apha.
I hope it's okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kulungile.
Maybe you should have it.	Mhlawumbi ufanele ube nayo.
That is all.	Yiyo yonke.
I can't do anything, not really.	Andikwazi ukwenza nantoni na, hayi ngokwenene.
But you know what happens.	Kodwa uyayazi into eyenzekayo.
Yes, this will happen.	Ewe, oku kuya kwenzeka.
At this point.	Kule ndawo.
It would seem to be something that is happening here.	Kuya kubonakala ukuba yinto eyenzekayo apha.
I did not tell anyone.	Khange ndixelele mntu.
Not everyone will do it.	Ayinguye wonke umntu oza kuyenza.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
you will do well.	uya kwenza kakuhle.
So, finally.	Ngoko, ekugqibeleni.
He will talk to you.	Uya kuthetha nawe.
Man could never do things again.	Umntu akazange akwazi ukwenza izinto kwakhona.
If you are absolutely sure.	Ukuba uqinisekile ngokupheleleyo.
That was no longer necessary.	Oko kwakungeyomfuneko ngakumbi.
It could be you.	Usenokuba nguwe.
i can do it.	ndingayenza.
Very nice car.	Imoto entle kakhulu.
Even if it's okay.	Nokuba kulungile.
Not here.	Hayi apha.
We know it's hard to do.	Siyazi ukuba kunzima ukwenza.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
It will be much easier.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
Please do it, only you.	Nceda uyenze, nguwe kuphela.
But he stayed with us.	Kodwa wahlala kunye nathi.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni na.
I want to play something else now.	Ndifuna ukudlala enye into ngoku.
Not just immediately.	Hayi nje ngokukhawuleza.
I don't want anything right now.	Andifuni nto ngoku.
I want to talk to her.	Ndifuna ukuthetha naye.
That is also true.	Kwakhona yinyani leyo.
He wants to be her.	Ufuna ukuba nguye.
If not for me, then man.	Ukuba akukho kum, ngoko umntu.
He knew this was coming.	Wayesazi ukuba oku kuza.
Very much.	Kakhulu kakhulu.
She did not know exactly how she felt.	Wayengazi ncam ukuba uziva njani.
Being here.	Ukuba lapha.
We all need to do that.	Sonke kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
Not my problem.	Hayi ingxaki yam.
He never stopped walking.	Akazange ayeke ukuhamba.
This may be true.	Oku kunokuba yinyani.
Or walking.	Okanye ukuhamba.
Someone has to do it.	Kufuneka umntu ayenze.
You are very much.	Nguwe kakhulu.
But he is not going to you.	Kodwa akayi kuwe.
But this is even more difficult.	Kodwa oku kunzima ngakumbi.
I can't walk.	Andikwazi ukuhamba.
That seems to me very clear.	Oko kubonakala kum kucacile.
This happens often.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo.
He wanted to be away from her.	Wayefuna ukuba kude naye.
Finally he looked up.	Ekugqibeleni wajonga.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
It will be more visible.	Kuya kubonakala ngakumbi.
But something terrible happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka into embi kakhulu.
Yeah, something like that.	Ewe, into enjalo.
I think what it is.	Ndicinga ukuba yintoni na.
He wanted peace.	Wayefuna uxolo.
Wherever you are.	Nokuba uphi na.
You think this.	Ucinga le nto.
You go to him.	Uya kuye.
That will really do it.	Oko kuya kuyenza ngenene.
Not all but.	Hayi yonke kodwa.
I'm sure of it now.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo ngoku.
It's just not there.	Akukho nje apho.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
If you will not create.	Ukuba akuyi kudala.
I did not want to see it again.	Ndandingafuni ukubona kwakhona.
He talks a lot.	Uthetha kakhulu.
Something very bad happened.	Kwenzeka into embi kakhulu.
What he was going to do, he didn't know.	Wayeza kwenza ntoni, wayengazi.
He did not think.	Akazange acinge.
There is something you need to do.	Kukho into ekufuneka uyenzile.
You deserve to be.	Ufanele ukuba.
He started reading.	Waqalisa ukufunda.
What we all know is not so.	Oko sonke siyazi ukuba akunjalo.
Tell me something.	Ndixelele into.
He is right there.	Nguye kanye apho.
Not that you won’t be.	Akunjalo ukuba awuyi kuba.
I want to get away from this.	Ndifuna kude kule.
He will surely live again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uya kuhlala kwakhona.
Hard time.	Ixesha lokuba nzima.
Or just fine.	Okanye nje kakuhle.
You know, not always.	Uyazi, hayi rhoqo.
But not everywhere.	Kodwa hayi kuyo yonke indawo.
No one really knows why.	Akukho mntu wazi kakuhle ukuba kutheni.
You know this place.	Uyayazi le ndawo.
You knew then.	Ubusazi ngoko.
Sure enough, he thought.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, wacinga.
Now he did not know.	Ngoku wayengazi.
But he did not come.	Kodwa akazange eze.
But that is exactly what happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka kanye loo nto.
But not so much one.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu enye.
But he loves it.	Kodwa uyayithanda.
Thus.	Ngaloo ndlela.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
I did not tell anyone.	Khange ndixelele mntu.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
So maybe yes.	Ngoko mhlawumbi ewe.
Now he was gone.	Ngoku wayengekho.
I know nothing at all.	Andazi nto kwaphela.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto kanye.
But this is okay !!.	Kodwa oku kulungile !!.
He would say something.	Wayeza kuthetha into.
For a long time, really.	Ixesha elide, ngokwenene.
At home, he thought.	Ekhaya, wacinga.
I don't want either.	Nam andifuni.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza.
He did very well with her.	Wenza kakuhle kakhulu naye.
You know why it did.	Uyazi ukuba kwakutheni ukuze kube njalo.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
I didn't want to do this.	Ndandingafuni ukuyenza le nto.
But it will be very difficult.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
He has to stay.	Kufuneka ahlale.
He never talked to me.	Zange athethe ngayo nam.
I have to do this.	Kufuneka ndiyenze le nto.
Do you know what it is.	Ngaba uyazi ukuba yintoni.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
Yes, there is.	Ewe, kukho.
He cannot succeed.	Akakwazi ukuphumelela.
If you did very well.	Ukuba wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
But one.	Kodwa enye.
Now she plans more.	Ngoku uceba ngakumbi.
Looks like that would be a lot easier.	Kubonakala ngathi oko kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
Making it difficult.	Ukwenza kunzima.
I think it will be so.	Ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Is that difficult.	Ngaba oko kunzima.
To do this too much.	Ukwenza oku kakhulu.
But he could not do it.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza.
Or so you think.	Okanye ucinga njalo.
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.
He did not go far.	Akazange aye kude.
But not now.	Kodwa hayi ngoku.
He did not know how long he had been there.	Wayengazi ukuba wahlala ixesha elingakanani apho.
But, that's me.	Kodwa ke, ndim lowo.
Definitely a must.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka.
It's just that it's so hard, you know.	Kuphela nje ukuba kunzima kakhulu, uyazi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
We will stay here.	Siza kuhlala apha.
In a good way, yes.	Ngendlela entle, ewe.
Not last night.	Hayi phezolo.
I think he didn't want to go.	Ndicinga ukuba wayengafuni ukuhamba.
If not really.	Ukuba akunjalo ngokwenene.
However, that is not the case at all.	Kodwa ke, akunjalo kwaphela.
You, something.	Wena, into.
No, something else is happening here.	Hayi, kukho enye into eyenzekayo apha.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Now we know why.	Ngoku siyazi ukuba kutheni.
That will be difficult enough.	Oko kuya kuba nzima ngokwaneleyo.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
No one.	Akakho mntu.
Nobody wants to go through all that, no more.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuhamba kuyo yonke loo nto, hayi kwakhona.
I'll talk to you.	Ndiya kuthetha nawe.
She wanted to go to him.	Wayefuna ukuya kuye.
He did not want to talk about it.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha ngayo.
Do you want.	Uyafuna.
I really didn't.	Ngenene andizange.
That's what you did.	Yiyo loo nto uyenzile.
We know a little, a little too much.	Siyazi kancinci, kancinci kakhulu.
But it's okay for me.	Kodwa kulungile kum.
He does so now.	Wenza njalo ngoku.
Not so but.	Akunjalo kodwa.
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
On the floor.	Phantsi.
But no, it's not.	Kodwa hayi, akunjalo.
I know you don't want to talk to me.	Ndiyayazi awufuni kuthetha nam.
Just another job.	Omnye umsebenzi nje.
It should be soon.	Kufuneka kube kungekudala.
Maybe there's something else there.	Mhlawumbi kukho enye into apho.
He would come to her.	Wayeza kuye.
You just don't want this to happen.	Awufuni nje ukuba kwenzeke oku.
Everyone talks about it.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngayo.
Very, very quickly.	Kakhulu, ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
He was not there either.	Naye wayengekho.
That is a bad thing.	Yinto embi ke leyo.
It is up to you to decide.	Kuwe ukuba wenze isigqibo.
But he did not stay there.	Kodwa akazange ahlale apho.
We will do better.	Siza kwenza ngcono.
You can drive a car.	Uyakwazi ukuqhuba imoto.
You have made a lot of money.	Wenze imali eninzi.
Everyone needs to talk to me.	Wonke umntu kufuneka athethe nam.
You will get better in the end.	Uya kuba ngcono ekugqibeleni.
He is the only one.	Nguye kuphela.
He went to prison.	Waya entolongweni.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa oko akunjalo.
He is not there.	Akakho apho.
He did not have to.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
He had to stop.	Kwafuneka ayeke.
I'm sorry.	Ndicela uxolo.
This is not so obvious.	Oku akunjalo ngokucacileyo.
Later, he says.	Kamva, uthi.
Well, obviously not.	Ewe, ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
A lot of time really.	Ixesha elininzi ngokwenene.
He can never succeed.	Akanakuze aphumelele.
It is very difficult to do.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
One day, he was gone.	Ngenye imini, wayengekho.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, hayi le.
No, you do not.	Hayi, awufuni.
He knew there was no future for this.	Wayesazi ukuba akukho kamva kule nto.
No one is talking, then.	Akukho mntu uthetha, ngoko.
Not so fast.	Hayi ngokukhawuleza.
I'll stay here.	Ndiza kuhlala apha.
We will be able to talk later.	Siza kukwazi ukuthetha kamva.
I think everyone knows now.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyazi ngoku.
This seems possible.	Oku kubonakala kunokwenzeka.
He looks bad.	Ukhangeleka kakubi.
Nowhere, not here.	Akukho ndawo, hayi apha.
No one is there.	Akukho mntu apho.
I just want to do my job.	Ndifuna nje ukwenza umsebenzi wam.
This should happen yesterday.	Oku kufuneka kwenzeke izolo.
Yes, we know.	Ewe, siyazi.
He knew nothing about that place.	Wayengazi nto ngaloo ndawo.
That's what happened to it.	Nantso into eyenzekayo kuyo.
You probably know that too.	Mhlawumbi uyazi ukuba kakhulu.
He thinks it's okay.	Ucinga ukuba kulungile.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
I thought you knew it.	Bendicinga ukuba uyayazi.
I have him.	Mna naye.
I'm sure of that.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto.
He did not say much.	Akazange athethe kakhulu.
He had to go.	Kwafuneka ahambe.
This can be a thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto.
Where are we going.	Apho siya khona.
Because that makes it so much better.	Kuba oko kwenza ukuba kube ngcono kakhulu.
I can do it this way.	Ndingayenza ngale ndlela.
Tomorrow is clear.	Kusasa kucacile.
I wish you peace.	Ndinqwenela uxolo.
He just did it.	Uyenzile nje.
Now, he said, he understood.	Ngoku, wathi, waqonda.
All right now.	Kulungile ngoku.
He just made it true.	Wenza nje ukuba yinyani.

He said he would not go far.	Wathi akayi kude.
Nobody is going to talk to me.	Akukho mntu uza kuthetha nam.
Swimming alone.	Ukuqubha ndedwa.

Don't go now.	Musa ukuya okwangoku.
I want to do this, really.	Ndifuna ukwenza oku, ngenene.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.

It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
Not the way.	Hayi indlela.
He must be.	Kufuneka abe .
That's what you feel.	Yiloo nto uziva ngayo.
All right now.	Kulungile ngoku.
He wanted to do that.	Wayefuna ukwenza njalo.
He had to seek help.	Kwafuneka afune uncedo.
You just know that.	Uyayazi nje loo nto.
But that is a fact.	Kodwa yinyani leyo.
Maybe he didn't know.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi.
Now bad.	Ngoku embi.
You probably knew better.	Usenokuba ubusazi ngcono.
To say something.	Ukuthetha into.
What r u doing.	Wenza ntoni.
Anything, everything, nothing.	Nantoni na, yonke into, akukho nto.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe, yinyani leyo.

What everyone knows.	Oko wonke umntu uyazi.
Now he finally did.	Ngoku ekugqibeleni wenza.
I know that and you know it.	Ndiyayazi lonto nawe uyayazi lonto.
Of course not.	Hayi ke.
He told me what it was.	Wandixelela ukuba yintoni na.
So many .	Ezininzi kakhulu .
He can't walk.	Akakwazi ukuhamba.
I wish this could happen.	Ndinqwenela ukuba oku kwenzeke.
Maybe he knew, he thought.	Mhlawumbi wayesazi, wacinga njalo.
I thought that was a good thing.	Ndandicinga ukuba yinto entle leyo.
This happens a lot.	Oku kwenzeka kakhulu.
Nothing now.	Akukho nto ngoku.
I want to see what happens.	Ndifuna ukubona ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
No, there is no way.	Hayi, akukho ndlela.
I never did.	Andizange ndiyenze.
Great thing.	Into enkulu.

Yes, that's the problem.	Ewe, loo ngxaki.

This is for everyone.	Oku kuye wonke umntu.
But he did not do this.	Kodwa akazange akwenze oku.
Food, space.	Ukutya, indawo.
Well thought out, whatever it is.	Ndicinge kakuhle, nokuba yintoni na.
Very much so.	Kakhulu ngokupheleleyo.
Not exactly.	Hayi ncam ncam.
I feel differently.	Ndiziva ngenye indlela.
I hope you did well.	Ndiyathemba ukuba wenze kakuhle.

This can be easy, if not too hard, to do.	Oku kunokuba lula, ukuba akukho nzima kakhulu, ukwenza.
But he wanted to stay.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuhlala.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.

Absolutely in it.	Ngokupheleleyo kuyo.
I would love to see how that happens.	Ndingathanda ukubona ukuba kwenzeka njani oko.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
Too long.	Ixesha elide kakhulu.
But that would be hard to do.	Kodwa oko kuya kuba nzima ukwenza.
We know you want money.	Siyazi ukuba ufuna imali.
Obviously this is not the case.	Ngokucacileyo oku akunjalo.
He didn't know what it was all about.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni yonke.
You don't want to do that.	Awufuni ukuyenza loo nto.
It should have been this way or not.	Bekufanele kube ngale ndlela okanye hayi.

I thought it was okay.	Bendicinga ukuba kulungile.
I really know.	Ndiyazi ngokwenene.
Well, yes, it should.	Kulungile, ewe, kufuneka.
I would like now.	Ndingathanda ngoku.
There is a real problem.	Kukho ingxaki ngokwenene.
Yes he wanted to go.	Ewe wayefuna ukuhamba.
Anything to buy time.	Nantoni na ukuthenga ixesha.
I am all.	Ndim wonke.
Everyone thought so.	Wonke umntu wayecinga njalo.
He could not stay long.	Akazange akwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide.
If not now, soon.	Ukuba akunjalo ngoku, kungekudala.
Well, you know a lot about this.	Ewe, uyazi kakhulu ngale nto.
oh yeah.	ewe.
He wanted to know, but he did not.	Wayefuna ukwazi, kodwa akazange.
Well, not too much or a problem.	Ke, hayi kakhulu okanye ingxaki.
None.	Akukho.
It will be necessary.	Kuya kufuneka.
This is really possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
Or you should.	Okanye ufanele ukuba.
I know it's hard.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni kanye ingxaki.
I know it's not me.	Ndiyazi ukuba akukho mna.
You know you have to do it.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka uyenze.
You can simplify it.	Uyakwazi ukuyenza lula.
It is good to go bad.	Kakuhle ukuya embi.
Hard, hard to do.	Kunzima, kunzima ukwenza.
I know this too.	Nam ndiyayazi le nto.
It's also a bike.	Kwakhona ibhayisekile.
All work.	Umsebenzi wonke.
However, that is not possible.	Kodwa ke, oko akunakwenzeka.
I don't like it all.	Andiyithandi yonke.
He can't make a decision.	Akakwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
I told her.	Ndiye ndamxelela.
This is certainly not possible.	Oku ngokuqinisekileyo akunakwenzeka.
Well, maybe not.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
That's the only good thing about it.	Yiloo nto kuphela elungileyo ngayo.
Everyone is very happy.	Wonke umntu uyavuya kakhulu.
Why you will always be.	Kutheni uya kuhlala njalo.
I will do that tomorrow.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto ngomso.
I can't find a job.	Andikwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
He didn't know why, but he knew.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni, kodwa wayesazi.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe yinyani leyo.
I hope .	Ndiyathemba .
I did all that.	Ndenze yonke loo nto.
He wanted to go home.	Wayefuna ukuya ekhaya.
Yes, not yet.	Ewe, hayi okwangoku.
Or maybe.	Okanye mhlawumbi .
I think yes.	Ndicinga ukuba ewe.
All of a sudden.	Kungekudala.
He just has to have it.	Kufuneka nje abe nayo.
Maybe there is.	Mhlawumbi kukho.
I know what you are doing.	Ndiyazi ukuba wenza ntoni na.
It is simply not possible.	Akunakwenzeka nje.
Why do you want to do that ?.	Kutheni ufuna ukuyenza lonto?.
I never did.	Andizange ndiyenze.
But it will be very difficult.	Kodwa kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
Probably nothing.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
Not a person.	Hayi umntu.
You should know.	Ufanele ukwazi.
So, what?!.	Ngoko, yintoni?!.
Slowly, if you want to know the truth.	Kancinci, ukuba ufuna ukwazi inyani.
I talked a lot.	Ndithethe kakhulu.
I will do this.	Ndiya kuyenza le nto.
But he wanted to go.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuhamba.
It's the same thing with you now.	Yinto enye nawe ngoku.
Or maybe the other way around.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngenye indlela.
I did not tell him anything.	Khange ndimxelele nto.
Time is of the essence.	Ixesha asiyonto.
That, of course, is not the case.	Oko, akunjalo, akunjalo.
That's the problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki.
I am the way.	Ndim indlela.
It should be easy to do.	Kufuneka kube lula ukwenza.
He did not want to talk about it.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha ngayo.
He has to say that.	Kufuneka athethe loo nto.
I can't walk here.	Andikwazi ukuhamba apha.
Probably very, very much so.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu, kakhulu.
There is no place for him here.	Apha akukho ndawo yakhe.
He sat in front.	Wahlala ngaphambili.
Making a bad place.	Ukwenza indawo embi.
But he wanted to know.	Kodwa wayefuna ukwazi.
It was not necessary to talk too much.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuthetha kakhulu.
This is a player.	Le ngumdlali.
He wanted to do something bigger.	Wayefuna ukwenza into enkulu ngakumbi.
Sorry again.	Uxolo kwakhona.
Yes, you do as you wish.	Ewe, wenza njengoko ufuna.
But that person will not be me.	Kodwa loo mntu akayi kuba ndim.
Talk to him about it.	Ukuthetha naye ngayo.
He made money.	Wenza imali.
You did everything well.	Wenze yonke into kakuhle.
It certainly seems to be true.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kubonakala ngathi yinyani.
Nobody wants to have it.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba nayo.
He has to stay.	Kufuneka ahlale.
That happened before.	Oko kwenzeka ngaphambili.
It is also possible to do too much.	Kwakhona kunokwenzeka ukwenza kakhulu.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
One more thing, then.	Enye into, ngoko.
No one told me this.	Akukho mntu wandixelela oku.
You have to do a lot of things.	Kufuneka wenze izinto ezininzi.
I know it will be difficult.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
I've had to do that before.	Kuye kwafuneka ndiyenze loo nto ngaphambili.
It's me.	Ndim.
In my own way.	Ngendlela yam.
To you and me both.	Kuwe kunye nam sobabini.
Today, one.	Namhlanje, enye.
He did something with it.	Wenza into ngayo.
He knew what we were going to be.	Wayesazi ukuba siya kuba yintoni na.
I have to go to work.	Kufuneka ndiye emsebenzini.
That's it.	Yiyo nje.
But enough.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo.
So much for one thing.	Kakhulu into enye.
Maybe we'll do it someday.	Mhlawumbi siza kuyenza ngenye imini.
Therefore, it is possible that.	Ngoko ke, kusenokwenzeka ukuba.
So it happened.	Ngoko kwenzeka oko.
Well, you know.	Kulungile, uyazi.
I have done wrong.	Ndenze kakubi.
It's hard to find.	Kunzima ukufumana.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
For now.	Okwangoku nje.
Now, he knew.	Ngoku, wayesazi.
He knew everyone.	Wayesazi wonke umntu.
Why should he do it? 	Kutheni kufuneka ayenze?
He wanted to help, but he did not know how.	Wayefuna ukunceda, kodwa wayengazi ukuba njani.
He tried to help.	Wazama ukunceda.
No! 	Hayi!
he thought.	wacinga.
Well, maybe not.	Ewe, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
So much so.	Ngoko ke kakhulu.
.	.
This can be so.	Oku kunokuba njalo.
It has not been easy.	Akazange abe lula.
I'm just a little bit.	Ndim nje kancinci.
Steal a car if necessary.	Ube imoto ukuba kufuneka.
Finding things now will be much easier.	Ukufumana izinto ngoku kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
For now, it's you.	Okwangoku, nguwe.
But maybe not, too.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo, kakhulu.
I will not be.	Andiyi kuba njalo.
This place here.	Le ndawo apha.
Not another.	Hayi enye.
So yeah, there it is.	Ngoko ewe, kukho loo nto.
But then again, isn’t it always ?.	Kodwa ke kwakhona, akunjalo rhoqo?.
This takes time.	Oku kufuna ixesha.
He thought he knew everyone.	Wayecinga ukuba wazi wonke umntu.
Not just for you.	Hayi nje ngawe.
Not just me, but everyone.	Hayi mna kuphela, kodwa wonke umntu.
No, he is not alone.	Hayi, ayinguye yedwa.
You just want to be here.	Ufuna nje ukuba lapha.
Not that but when.	Hayi ukuba kodwa nini.
He checked the time.	Wajonga ixesha.
Why.	Kutheni .
No, this is fine.	Hayi, oku kulungile.
He told police, however.	Waxelela amapolisa, kodwa .
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
Maybe it's your thing.	Mhlawumbi yinto yakho.
He needed help.	Wayefuna uncedo.
So you come here.	Ngoko uza apha.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
Making a way.	Ukwenza indlela.
I will just say this.	Ndiza kuthetha nje oku.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akuyi kuba njalo.
He’s going to be his player, too, no matter what.	Uya kuba ngumdlali wakhe, naye, nokuba yintoni na.
I already know everything.	Sele ndiyazi yonke into.
You have already done it once.	Sele uyenzile kanye.
He never stopped reading.	Akazange ayeke ukufunda.
So much for that.	Kakhulu ukuba.
This is clearly not the case here.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo apha.
He didn't go far, but he did.	Akazange aye kude, kodwa uyenzile.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
Probably in this book.	Mhlawumbi kule ncwadi.
Is probably.	Ngaba mhlawumbi .
You will not need anything.	Awuyi kufuna nto.
This is great, you know.	Oku kakhulu, ubusazi.
When something like that happens again.	Xa kwenzeka into enjalo kwakhona.
Do it again.	Ngaba kwakhona.
No, that's fine.	Hayi, kulungile.
So please do so.	Ngoko ke nceda wenze njalo.
But again he did nothing.	Kodwa kwakhona akazange enze nto.
.	.
Or anyone else for that.	Okanye nabani na ngaloo nto.
However, it is possible that.	Kodwa ke, kusenokwenzeka ukuba .
Just one problem.	Ingxaki enye nje.
He did not know otherwise.	Wayengazi ngenye indlela.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
He has apologized.	Uye wacela uxolo.
Not at all.	Akunjalo kwaphela.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni kuthetha.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
He looked at the house.	Wajonga indlu.
It's really hard to do anything all day.	Kunzima ngokwenene ukwenza nto imini yonke.
Or now it seems to us.	Okanye ngoku kubonakala ngathi.
Just as he has to do.	Kanye njengoko kufuneka enze njalo.
Now, you too.	Ngoku, nawe.
Then why ?.	Khona kutheni?.
Tell me what.	Ndixelele ntoni.
I can't at all.	Andikwazi kwaphela.
He would make this easier.	Wayeza kwenza oku kube lula.
Something terrible happened to him.	Kwenzeka into embi kuye.
I knew this was going to happen eventually.	Ndandisazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
You should know that.	Kufuneka uyazi ukuba.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
I can not walk properly.	Andikwazi ukuhamba kakuhle.
.	.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
Time now.	Ixesha ngoku.
Nobody knows here.	Akazi mntu apha.
No one will come.	Akukho mntu uya kuza.
Or if something happens.	Okanye ukuba kwenzeke into.
thinking about you.	ndicinga ngawe.
I think he did it immediately.	Ndicinga ukuba uyenzile ngokukhawuleza.
Impossible now.	Akunakwenzeka ngoku.
It will be easy.	Kuya kuba lula.
You will not want to talk to him at all.	Awuyi kufuna ukuthetha naye kwaphela.
You only want to play.	Ufuna ukudlala kuphela.
You may be.	Usenokuba.
Clearly he could not do that.	Ngokucacileyo akazange akwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
No, it's better this way.	Hayi, kungcono ngale ndlela.
Succeeding for a long time.	Ukuphumelela ixesha elide.
He thought fast.	Wayecinga ngokukhawuleza.
No matter what that means.	Nokuba oko kuthetha ntoni na.
He's here now.	Ulapha ngoku.
Or he may be doing what he wants to do.	Okanye usenokuba wenza into ayifunayo.
I made a quick decision.	Ndenze isigqibo ngokukhawuleza.
Pleased to meet you.	Ndiyavuya ukwazi.
You are here, no.	Ulapha, hayi.
But it is not, it is not.	Kodwa akunjalo, akunjalo.
He does not have to do this.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba ayenze le nto.
He just does everything together.	Wenza nje yonke into kunye.
What.	Yintoni na.
In this regard.	Ngale ndlela.
So no one is at home.	Ngoko akukho mntu ekhaya.
For a really long time.	Ixesha elide ngokwenene.
It seems that it will be so.	Kubonakala ngathi kuya kuba njalo.
I thought everyone knew that.	Ndandicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
If you do a good job.	Ukuba wenza umsebenzi olungileyo.
But that is not possible.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
But that is exactly what it is.	Kodwa yiloo nto kanye.
You did, that's fine.	Uyenzile, kulungile.
Now he won't have it either.	Ngoku naye akayi kuba nayo.
That is a must.	Oko kufuneka .
Being alone.	Ukuba wedwa.
He was not thinking for sure.	Wayengacingi ngokuqinisekileyo.
Maybe not today, but in the end.	Mhlawumbi hayi namhlanje, kodwa ekugqibeleni.
That's all.	Yonke loo nto.
We did so.	Senze njalo.
I would like to go with you.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba nawe.
You want money.	Ufuna imali.
.	.
If you have done it for so long.	Ukuba wenze ixesha elide kangako.
I could not go to him.	Khange ndikwazi ukuya kuye.
Many things.	Izinto ezininzi.
He is here once.	Ulapha kanye.
I know you know that.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayazi loo nto.
There is always one.	Kuhlala kukho enye.
This is nothing.	Oku akukho nto.
Well, really.	Kulungile, ngokwenene.
But now there is a problem.	Kodwa ngoku kukho ingxaki.
No one said it would be easy.	Akukho mntu uthe kuya kuba lula.
That is absolutely true.	Yinyani leyo ngokupheleleyo.
I know how much he speaks to you.	Ndiyazi ukuba uthetha kangakanani na kuwe.
I had to tell her about it.	Kwafuneka ndimxelele ngayo.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
This is really hard to do.	Oku kunzima ngokwenene ukwenza.
But today, this is not the case.	Kodwa namhlanje, oku akunjalo.
He is, yes.	Nguye, ewe.
He did the same.	Naye wenze njalo.
he thought.	wacinga.
Not at all, really.	Akunjalo kwaphela, ngokwenene.
This is very difficult.	Oku kunzima kakhulu.
But you know the whole thing now.	Kodwa uyazi yonke le nto ngoku.
To do this.	Ukwenza oku.
He will do it later.	Uya kuyenza kamva.
Maybe that will do.	Mhlawumbi oko kuya kwenza.
So what happened.	Ngoko kwenzeka ntoni.
He will have to leave immediately.	Kuya kufuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
He asked about you.	Wabuza ngawe.
He certainly does not have to.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akuyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
It would be better for us to do so.	Kunokuba ngcono ukuba senze njalo.
He looked at everyone.	Wajonga wonke umntu.
I can't walk.	Andikwazi ukuhamba.
Maybe tomorrow, he thought.	Mhlawumbi ngomso, wacinga.
Or otherwise.	Okanye ngenye indlela.
He did not want to do this.	Wayengafuni ukwenza oku.
It's the worst thing to do.	Yinto embi kakhulu yokwenza.
Nobody does anything about it.	Akukho mntu wenza nto ngaloo nto.
We really did the same thing.	Senze into enye ngokwenene.
I never thought about it.	Khange ndicinge nto ngayo.
But he did not think.	Kodwa akazange acinge.
How much do you know? 	Wazi kangakanani?
And it was so.	Waba njalo ke.
He was not very successful.	Akazange aphumelele kakhulu.
He agreed.	Wavuma.
Looks like nothing.	Kubonakala ngathi akukho nto.
This will happen when something happens, for sure.	Oku kuya kwenzeka xa kukho into eyenzekayo, ngokuqinisekileyo.
Now to him.	Ngoku kuye.
He will stay.	Uya kuhlala.
He thinks he is better.	Ucinga ukuba ngcono.
I thought this was my thing.	Bendicinga ukuba yinto yam le.
I don't want him to go with you.	Andifuni ahambe nawe.
Not a car.	Hayi imoto.
Not to him, not yet.	Hayi kuye, hayi okwangoku.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
Do nothing.	Musa ukwenza nto.
That's a big deal.	Yinto enkulu leyo.
But you have to tell me something.	Kodwa kufuneka undixelele into.
You can be.	Unokuba .
I could say nothing to her.	Khange ndikwazi ukuthetha nto kuye.
But we will need help.	Kodwa siza kufuna uncedo.
This is nothing.	Oku akukho nto.
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani.
I do not want to talk.	Andifuni kuthetha.
I think this is better.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kungcono.
I'm not sure about this.	Andiqinisekanga ngale nto.
Hope to find this soon !.	Ndiyathemba ukufumana oku kungekudala!.
He did not think for a long time.	Akazange acinge ixesha elide.
He is.	Nguye.
It is very true.	Yinyani kakhulu.
But he did not say anything.	Kodwa akazange athethe nto.
He did not come.	Akazange eze.
I feel like I want to do something.	Ndiziva ndifuna ukwenza into.
It has to happen.	Kufuneka yenzeke.
He should have stayed home.	Bekufanele ahlale ekhaya.
So it can be.	Ngoko ke kunokuba njalo.
So you don't go.	Ngoko awuyi.
I think nothing.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho nto.
But you.	Kodwa wena.
I told her that.	Ndamxelela ukuba.
I'm afraid I'm alone.	Ndiyoyika ukuba ndedwa.
Someone said there is.	Omnye umntu uthe kukho.
It's really hard at work.	Kunzima ngokwenene emsebenzini.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga ncam .
Again, no problem.	Kwakhona, akukho ngxaki.
He also looked.	Naye wajonga.
I don't know exactly why.	Andazi kanye ukuba kutheni.
.	.
It is clear.	Kucacile.
You have to be that way too.	Kufuneka ube njalo nawe.
No problem here.	Akukho ngxaki apha.
What else?.	Yintoni enye?.
Then.	Ndiye .
He thought it was okay.	Wayecinga ukuba kulungile.
He didn't know better.	Wayengazi ngcono.
He will do it again.	Uya kuyenza kwakhona.
Probably once.	Mhlawumbi kube kanye.
He knows no one.	Akazi mntu.
He wanted to go.	Wayefuna ukuhamba.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
I think about you a lot.	Ndicinga ngawe kakhulu.
We go to work.	Siya emsebenzini.
I did not know why before.	Ndandingazi ukuba kutheni ngaphambili.
He sat down, looked up.	Uhlala phantsi, wajonga.
He did his job.	Wenza umsebenzi wakhe.
Tell me about it.	Ndixelele ngaloo nto.
Definitely a must.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka.
Not just at home.	Hayi nje ekhaya.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
So yes, for sure.	Ngoko ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo.
That's it.	Yinto leyo.
Sounds good now.	Kubonakala kulungile ngoku.
This is not easy to do.	Oku akukho lula ukwenza.
I'm sure of this.	Ndiqinisekile ngale nto.
I've never been there before.	Andizange ndiye apho ngaphambili.
I would like to do this.	Ndingathanda ukwenza oku.
Everyone knows this for sure.	Wonke umntu uyazi oku ngokuqinisekileyo.
That's the problem with the way.	Nantso ingxaki ngendlela.
Finally, he says.	Ekugqibeleni, uthi.
I can't get enough of it.	Andikwazi ukufumana ngokwaneleyo ngayo.
Tomorrow you will be alone.	Ngomso uzakuba wedwa.
I knew it would happen one day.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ngenye imini.
It has been apparent.	Kube kubonakala.
But certainly.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo.
He wants to know everything.	Ufuna ukwazi yonke into.
She tries to talk a little.	Uzama ukuthetha kancinci.
Well, well, you'll be fine.	Ewe, kulungile, uya kuhlala kakuhle.
I have to do the right thing.	Kufuneka ndenze into elungileyo.
That's all you have to do, really.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyenzile, ngokwenene.
I knew it would be so.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
It is.	Yinto.
I think, obviously.	Ndicinga, ngokucacileyo.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
No one likes everything.	Akukho mntu uthanda yonke into.
We definitely need to go there.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka siye apho.
This is it.	Nguye lo.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
There is something else.	Kukho enye into.
Sorry for the moment.	Uxolo okwangoku.
Yes you want money.	Ewe ufuna imali.
Yeah yeah yeah that's fine.	Ewe ewe ewe kulungile.
Long time.	Ixesha elide.
So there is a problem here.	Ke kukho ingxaki apha.
Do you know why ?.	Uyazi ukuba kutheni?.
He told me no.	Wandixelela ukuba hayi.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
It always happens.	Kwenzeka njalo.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
There are many.	Kukho ezininzi.
For me, learning from everyone.	Kum, ukufunda kuye wonke umntu.
But he could not do that.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
I want to be my own person one day.	Ndifuna ukuba ngumntu wam ngenye imini.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe, yinyani leyo.
Or is he ?.	Okanye nguye?.
He just did.	Wenza nje.
Great place to be.	Indawo entle kakhulu ukuba kuyo.
He knew something was wrong.	Wayesazi ukuba kukho into embi.
If no one will be.	Ukuba akukho mntu uya kuba.
He is not here.	Akakho apha.
If you need to know.	Ukuba kufuneka uyazi.
.	.
I do not know if it is possible.	Andazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Maybe both of us.	Mhlawumbi sobabini.
.	.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa ngokwenene akunjalo.
He did not want to be alone this way.	Wayengafuni ukuba yedwa kule ndlela.
Don't go there just yet.	Musa ukuya apho okwangoku.
It seems clear to me.	Kubonakala ngathi kucacile kum.
You are not visible.	Awubonakali .
Good to see.	Kulungile ukubona.
He doesn't know enough.	Akazi ngokwaneleyo.
Whatever.	Nokuba yintoni na.
Alone alone.	Eyedwa yedwa.
You do not want to do it.	Awufuni ukuyenza.
I will do just that.	Ndiya kwenza kanye loo nto.
I think it is not easy for him.	Ndicinga ukuba akukho lula kuye.
You will stay here.	Uza kuhlala apha.
There seems to be another problem.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho enye ingxaki.
I just want everything to happen.	Ndifuna nje yonke into yenzeke.
I will stay with you.	Ndiya kuhlala nawe.
Not the way it is.	Hayi indlela hayi.
Work will come, better or worse.	Umsebenzi uya kuza, ngcono okanye kakubi.
If you live.	Ukuba uhlala .
It never happened.	Zange kube njalo.
That will be just that.	Oko kuya kuba nje kuphela.
Until we know for sure what it is.	Kude kube siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba yintoni na.
But that, too, is only a matter of time.	Kodwa oko, kwakhona, kuphela ixesha.
No one, time.	Akukho mntu, ixesha.
Not that he knew what it was, then.	Akunjalo ukuba wayesazi ukuba yintoni na, ngoko.
I would really like a house.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene indlu.
You need to know how to do it.	Kufuneka uyazi indlela yokwenza.
He did it.	Uyenzile.
I'm sure of that.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto.
This is a new thing.	Yinto entsha ke le.
Maybe you know, maybe not.	Mhlawumbi uyazi, mhlawumbi hayi.
Many things.	Izinto ezininzi.
Nobody did that.	Akukho mntu wenza oko.
That soon.	Ukuba kungekudala.
If not, it is not.	Ukuba akunjalo, akunjalo.
You need to know everything.	Kufuneka wazi yonke into.
I'm not going there.	Andiyi apho.
That's the way to do it.	Nantso indlela yokwenza.
Or so he thought.	Okanye ngoko wayecinga.
There is a dog, too.	Kukho inja, nayo.
But she did not give up.	Kodwa akazange ayeke.
I was thinking the same thing.	Bendicinga into enye.
If he wants to do it, he can do it.	Ukuba ufuna ukuyenza, angayenza.
Like, you know, talking or whatever.	Njengoko, uyazi, ukuthetha okanye nantoni na enjalo.
But that is not possible.	Kodwa oko akunakwenzeka.
I will definitely stay here again.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiya kuhlala apha kwakhona.
He also knew why.	Wayesazi nokuba kwakutheni.
In it.	Kuyo .
I think it should have happened.	Ndicinga ukuba bekufanele kwenzeke.
That creates a problem.	Oko kudala ingxaki.
His career began.	Umsebenzi wakhe waqalisa.
Not where you want to be.	Akunjalo apho ufuna ukuba khona.
It's even harder.	Kunzima ngakumbi.
He knew it well.	Wayesazi kakuhle.
But if not.	Kodwa ukuba akunjalo.
We need to do this together.	Kufuneka siyenze kunye oku.
I don't know about all that.	Andazi ngayo yonke loo nto.
This should be the case.	Oku kufuneka kube njalo.
Not that he tried to make one.	Akunjalo ukuba wazama ukwenza enye.
Ok then.	Kulungile ke.
I know this for sure.	Ndiyazi ngokuqinisekileyo oku.
Only you and me, then.	Mna nawe kuphela, ngoko.
Good money too.	Imali entle nayo.
No, not at all, otherwise.	Hayi, akunjalo, ngenye indlela.
Yes, not at all.	Ewe, hayi kanye.
That's not it.	Ayinguye lowo.
I'm just trying to get home.	Ndizama nje ukuya ekhaya.
He had to do something like that.	Kwafuneka enze into enjalo.
He looked at her.	Wajonga wajonga.
Maybe sorry.	Mhlawumbi uxolo.
You have to be.	Kufuneka ube.
He said no, not really.	Wathi hayi, akunjalo.
Well, that makes it easy.	Kulungile, oko kwenza kube lula.
He has to make a decision.	Kufuneka enze isigqibo.
I had no idea what it was.	Ndandingazi ukuba yintoni.
A good book.	Incwadi entle.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
I know this is hard for you.	Ndiyazi ukuba oku kunzima kuwe.
Not if you live.	Hayi ukuba uhlala.
I will do it now, immediately.	Ndiza kuyenza ngoku, ngoko nangoko.
Or really, very, very much so.	Okanye ngokwenene, kakhulu kakhulu.
We just have to do it.	Kufuneka siyenze kuphela.
Really? 	Ngokwenene?
How, it is very difficult.	Njani, kunzima kakhulu.
That would be better.	Oko kuya kuba ngcono.
Maybe you don’t want to have it.	Mhlawumbi awufuni ukuba nayo.
I will do that.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto.
So you already know what time it is.	Ngoko sele uyazi ukuba ngubani ixesha.
You deserve to be.	Ufanele ukuba .
I do not want to talk.	Andifuni kuthetha.
Whatever is happening now.	Nantoni na eyenzekayo ngoku.
I want more from you.	Ndifuna ngakumbi kuwe.
Everything happened so fast.	Yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
That's all you have to do.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyenzile.
Someone did it.	Umntu uyenzile.
Not yet.	Hayi ngoku.
Time now.	Ixesha ngoku.
It will be much easier.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
We will be able to see.	Siza kukwazi ukubona.
He is no better.	Akakho ngcono.
I do not know.	Andazi.
But there is something.	Kodwa kukho into.
He just wants to talk.	Ufuna nje ukuthetha.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza.
He told police.	Waxelela amapolisa.
I am the only one, by the way.	Ndim kuphela, ngendlela.
He started talking right away.	Waqalisa ukuthetha ngoko nangoko.
No one will do it.	Akukho mntu uya kwenza.
Yes .	Ewe .
It never happened again.	Zange yenzeke kwakhona.
At home all day.	Ekhaya imini yonke.
Not bad, not too much.	Hayi kakubi, hayi kakhulu.
I'm just trying to play with it.	Ndizama nje ukudlala ngayo.
Is this possible.	Ngaba oku kunokwenzeka .
And if you're here tonight, here you are.	Ke ukuba ulapha ngokuhlwanje, ulapha.
Well, that's what it is.	Ke, yiloo nto ke.
I don't really know why.	Andazi ngokwenene ukuba kutheni.
It makes it easy.	Kwenza kube lula.
No, not this again.	Hayi, hayi oku kwakhona.
It is completely new.	Yinto entsha ngokupheleleyo.
Or maybe he just couldn't.	Okanye mhlawumbi akazange akwazi.
Not always yes.	Akukho njalo ewe.
I don't know what my problem is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki yam.
He did well.	Wenza kakuhle.
You're sure of that.	Uqinisekile ngaloo nto.
I hope to see everyone there.	Ndiyathemba ukubona wonke umntu apho.
We know how that ended.	Siyazi ukuba oko kwaphela njani.
That's just me.	Oko ndim nje.
I only want a bigger one.	Ndifuna kuphela enkulu.
I have to say something.	Kufuneka ndithethe into.
Well maybe a little bit.	Kulungile mhlawumbi kancinci.
As one does.	Njengoko umntu esenza.
To be honest, he didn't, either.	Ukuthetha inyani, akazange, naye.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
I can't tell.	Andikwazi ukuxelela.
He knows you are here with him.	Uyayazi ukuba ulapha kunye naye.
I know that will make your job more difficult.	Ndiyazi ukuba oko kuya kwenza umsebenzi wakho ube nzima ngakumbi.
Or whatever, really.	Okanye nantoni na, ngokwenene.
So we know about it.	Ngoko siyazi ngayo.
He certainly said yes.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uthe ewe.
But not long enough.	Kodwa kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
Yes, it will be very easy.	Ewe, kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
Or to him.	Okanye kuye.
It can be hard to do.	Kunokuba nzima ukwenza.
Not because he wanted to.	Hayi kuba wayefuna.
I feel confident.	Ndiziva ndiqinisekile.
So maybe.	Ngoko mhlawumbi.
We will stay with him.	Siza kuhlala kuye.
I'm sure it is.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba yiyo.
But he sits down.	Kodwa uhlala phantsi.
That would be easy.	Oko kube lula.
No, certainly not food.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo hayi ukutya.
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka.
More on that soon.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto kungekudala.
He did not stay long.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide.
He wanted a big one.	Wayefuna enkulu.
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
I doubt it.	Ndiyathandabuza.
I will do everything right.	Ndiza kwenza yonke into kakuhle.
But he was not alone.	Kodwa wayengekho yedwa.
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi.
But he is talking about something else.	Kodwa uthetha ngenye into.
You will be together.	Uzakuba kunye.
We need to go to him.	Kufuneka siye kuye.
He did my job.	Wenza umsebenzi wam.
I just want to stay in it all day.	Ndifuna nje ukuhlala kuyo imini yonke.
I think that's fine though.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile kodwa.
That is entirely possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngokupheleleyo.
I've never done it before.	Andizange ndiyenze ngaphambili.
He needs help.	Ufuna uncedo.
If you have to.	Ukuba ufanele ukuba.
Only in this area.	Kuphela kule ndawo.
There is so much to do there.	Kukho into eninzi yokwenza apho.
You think things.	Ucinga izinto.
That is true here.	Yinyani leyo apha.
It's better, too.	Kungcono, nam.
I certainly know that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyayazi loo nto.
But now it is not easy.	Kodwa ngoku akukho lula.
It is good to talk to us.	Kulungile ukuthetha nathi.
I want to see that.	Ndifuna ukubona loo nto.
Not exactly.	Hayi ncam.
Or with him.	Okanye naye.
He has to go to prison.	Kufuneka aye entolongweni.
I feel better.	Ndiziva ngcono.
I don't really know why.	Andazi ngenene ukuba kutheni.
Tell me a little about yourself.	Ndixelele kancinci ngawe.
He had to say something to me.	Kwafuneka athethe into kum.
.	.
Or nowhere.	Okanye akukho ndawo.
Just knowing.	Kukwazi nje.
I am glad.	Ndiyavuya.
He became human again.	Waba ngumntu kwakhona.
Maybe he can't.	Mhlawumbi akakwazi.
He did not succeed.	Akazange aphumelele.
Little by little.	Kancinci kancinci.
A little, but not too much.	Kancinci, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
I want something else.	Ndifuna enye into.
But not now.	Kodwa hayi ngoku.
Maybe okay.	Mhlawumbi kulungile.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
He did not want her to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuba ahambe.
He knew why.	Wayesazi ukuba kutheni.
He did that.	Uyenzile loo nto.
You definitely have to have it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kufuneka ube nayo.
Only now.	Kuphela ngoku.
Just tell me what happened.	Ndixelele nje ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
He did not want to do this.	Wayengafuni ukwenza oku.
But it seems right to me.	Kodwa kubonakala kulungile kum.
He does everything.	Wenza yonke into.
He wanted to leave, because he tried to play more.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, kuba wazama ukudlala ngakumbi.
Or not now, but soon.	Okanye hayi ngoku, kodwa kungekudala.
Not for me.	Hayi kum.
Well, not exactly.	Ewe, hayi kanye kanye.
We both know it to be true.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba yinyani.
He looked up.	Wajonga ke.
You probably already know that.	Usenokuba sele uyazi ngaloo nto.
Only my truth.	Inyani yam kuphela.
He just does a lot of good things.	Wenza nje izinto ezininzi kakuhle.
Nothing, now, nobody.	Akukho nto, ngoku, akukho mntu.
He looked good.	Uye wajonga kakuhle.
No, not man.	Hayi, hayi umntu.
So do not do this.	Ngoko musa ukuyenza le nto.
It's a very big thing.	Yinto enkulu kakhulu.
So he lives there alone.	Ngoko uhlala apho yedwa.
Long time.	Ixesha elide.
There is simply no way.	Akukho ndlela nje.
He will do so.	Uza kwenza njalo.
Hush hush.	Ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
This creates a problem.	Oku kudala ingxaki.
Soon, he thought.	Kungekudala, wacinga.
I don't know what else.	Andazi ukuba yintoni enye.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni.
This is your thing.	Yinto yakho le.
No, this is not possible.	Hayi, oku akunakwenzeka.
There is someone else now.	Kukho omnye umntu ngoku.
I thought hard.	Bendicinga nzima.
He seemed to know.	Wayebonakala ngathi uyazi.
He has stayed.	Uye wahlala.
He was not.	Wayengekho.
If it will happen, it will happen.	Ukuba kuya kwenzeka, kuya kwenzeka.
There is no way.	Akukho ndlela.
.	.
Or someone does.	Okanye umntu wenza njalo.
But if something happens to me, you know.	Kodwa ukuba kukho into eyenzekayo kum, uyazi.
He could not.	Akazange akwazi.
But you don't look good.	Kodwa awubonakali kakuhle.
But it's okay.	Kodwa kulungile.
Yes, it is impossible.	Ewe, akunakwenzeka.
You know it's me.	Uyayazi ukuba ndim.
As he finally realized what it was.	Njengoko ekugqibeleni waqonda ukuba yintoni na.
You did it alone.	Wenze wedwa.
Not for me, for you.	Hayi kum, kuwe.
But not just me.	Kodwa hayi mna kuphela.
I'm not going anywhere.	Andiyi ndawo.
You may just know it.	Usenokuba uyazi nje.
You will have everything.	Uya kuba nayo yonke into.
I told her about the place.	Ndamxelela ngaloo ndawo.
He tried to speak.	Wazama ukuthetha.
Me and you, now.	Mna nawe, ngoku.
But enough to do.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo ukwenza.
It's the same thing there.	Yinto enye apho.
I just have to do my job.	Kufuneka ndenze umsebenzi wam nje.
Or, or something.	Okanye, okanye into.
He will come alone.	Uza kuza yedwa.
Or many things.	Okanye izinto ezininzi.
Why do you want to do this.	Kutheni ufuna ukwenza oku.
So no one.	Ngoko akukho mntu.
He lives with her here.	Uhlala naye apha.
No one has ever done such a thing before.	Akukho mntu wakhe wenza into enkulu kangaka ngaphambili.
He told me what he thought.	Undixelele ukuba ucinga ntoni.
You will know where you are going.	Uya kukwazi apho uya khona.
I have to make a decision.	Kufuneka ndenze isigqibo.
Cars.	Imoto .
It is not as easy as it seems.	Akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
But he knew in advance.	Kodwa wayesazi ngaphambili.
All your way.	Indlela yakho yonke.
Does anyone know how to do that.	Ngaba nabani na uyazi indlela yokwenza oko.
You have to be something.	Kufuneka ube yinto.
I don't want her to be able to do that.	Andifuni ukuba akwazi ukuyenza loo nto.
It doesn't mean much.	Akukho kuthetha kakhulu.
But okay, really.	Kodwa kulungile, ngenene.
Will it be.	Ngaba kuya kuba .
It will be much easier.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu.
Tell me clearly.	Ndixelele ngokucacileyo.
He said he knew this.	Wathi uyayazi le nto.
You just think too much.	Ucinga kakhulu nje.
It will make it easier for you.	Kuya kwenza kube lula kuwe.
He also lives here.	Naye uhlala apha.
Deciding what to do.	Ukwenza isigqibo sokuba wenze ntoni.
He stayed with her.	Wahlala nayo.
But I don't know yet.	Kodwa andazi okwangoku.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
He did that a lot.	Wakwenza oko kakhulu.
He went to prison.	Uye entolongweni.
He's here, right here with me.	Ulapha, kanye apha kunye nam.
But, I'm sorry.	Kodwa, ndicela uxolo.
But you have to have it.	Kodwa kufuneka ube nayo.
How did you do it? 	Wenze njani?
.	.
.	.
I know this place very well.	Ndiyazi kakuhle le ndawo.
I'm just coming.	Ndiza nje.
Maybe it will be better for you.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba ngcono kuwe.
That's it, he thought.	Yiloo nto ke, wacinga.
This is really it.	Le nto ngokwenene.
.	.
I'll talk about it.	Ndiza kuthetha ngayo.
Yes Yes.	Ewe, ewe.
Why, nothing much.	Kutheni, akukho nto ingako.
Yes he did.	Ewe uyenzile.
Probably so.	Mhlawumbi kuya kuba njalo.
Wherever you are.	Nokuba uphi na.
At this point.	Kule ndawo.
Do this regularly.	Ukwenza oku rhoqo.
Fast moving now.	Ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza ngoku.
I think we all know why.	Ndicinga ukuba sonke siyazi ukuba kutheni.
Please, please.	Nceda, nceda.
But it happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka.
He wants it to be easy.	Ufuna ukuba kube lula.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
I need help with this.	Ndifuna uncedo kule nto.
Tell me.	Ndixelele.
I said nothing.	Khange ndithethe nto.
Not money.	Hayi imali.
He just isn't there.	Akakho nje.
Yes, this will be easy.	Ewe, oku kuya kuba lula.
But he did not know.	Kodwa wayengazi.
It should be easy.	Kufuneka kube lula.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
It's better for him.	Kungcono kuye.
It's just a bike.	Ibhayisekile nje.
But then it happened.	Kodwa ke kwenzeka.
Not very well.	Hayi kakuhle.
I never thought about it.	Andizange ndicinge ngayo.
No one is there.	Akukho mntu apho.
Suddenly, he sat down.	Ngokukhawuleza, wahlala phantsi.
Here he lived alone.	Apha wahlala yedwa.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I will do it, maybe soon.	Ndiza kuyenza, mhlawumbi kungekudala.
He agreed to everything.	Wavuma kuyo yonke into.
Everyone says here.	Wonke umntu uthi apha.
He doesn't know tonight.	Akazi namhlanje ebusuku.
This is fine.	Kulungile oku.
He wanted that too.	Naye wayefuna loo nto.
In the coming.	Kuyo kuza.
You will need to know better.	Kuya kufuneka uyazi ngcono.
Nobody likes you.	Akukho mntu uthanda wena.
She doesn't know how you feel.	Akakwazi ukuba uziva njani.
Here it is.	Le apha.
But I ask for help.	Kodwa ndicela uncedo.
That's all you have to do.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyenzile.
I want to improve this if possible.	Ndifuna ukwenza ngcono oku ukuba kunokwenzeka.
He did the right thing.	Wenza into elungileyo.
.	.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba kube njalo.
Not a bit of it.	Hayi kancinci kuyo.
Just real time.	Ixesha nje ngokwenene.
Definitely that for a long time.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko ixesha elide.
He did not want her to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuba ahambe.
I think so too.	Ndicinga njalo nam.
You certainly stay if you want to.	Ngokuqinisekileyo uhlala ukuba uyafuna.
Don't go there.	Musa ukuya apho.
But it's just hard to make a way.	Kodwa kunzima nje ukwenza indlela.
I feel everything.	Ndiziva yonke into.
This is something new.	Le yinto entsha.
But he will not stay there.	Kodwa akayi kuhlala apho.
Or it will happen.	Okanye kuya kwenzeka.
I don't like it very much.	Andiyithandi ncam.
He had to stop talking.	Kwafuneka ayeke ukuthetha.
He did so.	Wenza njalo.
As you always see.	Njengoko uhlala ubonakala.
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
Now, you and I.	Ngoku, mna nawe.
You may also like it.	Ungathanda kwakhona.
He tried to stay.	Wazama ukuhlala.
He wanted to talk.	Wayefuna ukuthetha.
Not so much now.	Hayi kakhulu ngoku.
Nice place too.	Indawo entle nayo.
He will do anything.	Uya kwenza nantoni na.
You deserve to be.	Ufanele ukuba.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka wenze.
You better do it.	Kungcono wenze.
Immediately.	Kwangoko.
I know how much it means to him.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuthetha kangakanani kuye.
He tried to speak ill of her.	Wazama ukuthetha kakubi.
It's very, very difficult here.	Kunzima kakhulu, kakhulu apha.
He is here with us.	Ulapha kunye nathi.
You do not have to.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba wenze njalo.
You are not going anywhere.	Akukho ndawo uya kuyo.
He did not say much.	Khange athethe nto ingako.
I made food.	Ndenze ukutya.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.
As does something else.	Njengoko kwenza enye into.
It is probably not possible to do that.	Mhlawumbi akunakwenzeka ukwenza ngale ndlela.
He did, but soon.	Wenza, kodwa ngokukhawuleza.
You have already done it.	Sele uyenzile.
Well, maybe not now.	Ewe, mhlawumbi hayi ngoku.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I did not tell him.	Khange ndimxelele.
I only hope.	Ndiyathemba kuphela.
He just did.	Wenza nje.
I want you.	Ndifuna wena.
I thought so.	Ndicinge njalo.
He did not want just one thing.	Akazange afune nto enye kuphela.
He didn't know there.	Wayengazi apho.
He wanted money.	Wayefuna imali.
Or you don't want to.	Okanye awufuni.
Soon, we will do it your way.	Kwangoko, siza kuyenza ngendlela yakho.
No, no, it's not.	Hayi, hayi, akunjalo.
I will be in it all day.	Ndiza kuba kuyo imini yonke.
You are a person.	Nguwe umntu.
You just want a chance.	Ufuna nje ithuba.
I think everyone.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu.
I would like to see another one.	Ndingathanda ukubona enye.
Now is the time.	Ngoku lixesha.
That's the way we do things.	Yiloo ndlela esenza ngayo izinto.
What happened.	Yintoni eyenzekayo.
You know, something like that.	Uyazi, into enjalo.
You're sure of that.	Uqinisekile ngaloo nto.
I think that's the only thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yiloo nto kuphela.
It could be.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba kube njalo.
He is.	Nguye.
Everyone wants money.	Wonke umntu ufuna imali.
That's another one.	Nantso enye.
This is not so much.	Oku akukho kakhulu.
I can't talk about it right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngayo okwangoku.
It’s his big thing, really.	Yinto enkulu yakhe, ngenene.
I thought you knew.	Bendicinga ukuba uyazi.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi njani.
Someone should have it soon.	Omnye umntu kufuneka abe naye kungekudala.
I just want to see how I did.	Ndifuna nje ukubona ukuba ndenze njani.
Probably, a big dog.	Mhlawumbi, inja enkulu.
I don't know how he can do this.	Andazi ukuba angayenza njani na lento.
This creates a problem.	Oku kudala ingxaki.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
That person should always be you.	Loo mntu kufuneka abe nguwe rhoqo.
Because you should know.	Kuba ufanele ukwazi.
I can do it, but I don't know how.	Ndingayenza, kodwa andazi ukuba njani.
Tell the police.	Xelela amapolisa.
He does not want to talk.	Akafuni ukuthetha.
You know it won't be.	Uyazi ukuba akuyi kuba njalo.
Everyone knew he could do it.	Wonke umntu wayesazi ukuba angayenza loo nto.
That's your place.	Nantso indawo yakho.
Isn't it?	Akunjalo na?
Yes, it is true enough.	Ewe, yinyani ngokwaneleyo.
No curiosity.	Akukho kufuna ukwazi.
I know that is not the case.	Ndiyazi ukuba akunjalo.
It will be harder for him.	Kuya kuba nzima ngakumbi kuye.
You do not have to do it alone.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba uyenze wedwa.
If you do, that's fine.	Ukuba wenza njalo, kulungile.
We know why.	Siyazi ukuba kutheni.
Little by little in everything.	Kancinci kancinci kuyo yonke into.
I hope it's okay.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kulungile.
He doesn't think it means that now.	Akacingi ukuba kuthetha ukuba ngoku.
I have long wanted to talk to you about it.	Kudala ndifuna ukuthetha nawe ngayo.
You and me.	Mna nawe.
Well, not so much.	Ewe, hayi kakhulu.
Either way.	Ngenye indlela.
You said you could buy a house.	Ubuthe uyakwazi ukuthenga indlu.
Maybe that's better.	Mhlawumbi oko kungcono.
We need to do that.	Kufuneka siyenze loo nto.
I don't really want to talk to her.	Andifuni kuthetha naye nyani.
Ready to go.	Le ukuhamba.
That is exactly what is happening here.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo apha.
Again, there is no exception.	Kwakhona, akukho ngaphandle.
I can't tell.	Andikwazi ukuxelela.
That can be very difficult.	Oko kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
So he tried something new.	Ngoko wazama into entsha.
Good man.	Umntu olungileyo.
Really great in every way.	Ngenene kakhulu ngayo yonke indlela.
That is always difficult.	Oko kuhlala kunzima.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
His new place, that is.	Indawo yakhe entsha, leyo.
Living there can be even more difficult.	Ukuhlala apho kunokuba nzima ngakumbi.
Not a bit anymore.	Hayi kancinci kwakhona.
That's really good.	Kulungile ngokwenene.
You only know what happened.	Uyazi kuphela ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
But not soon.	Kodwa hayi kungekudala.
But only that.	Kodwa kuphela oko.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
And now you are here.	Ke ngoku ulapha.
If you are sure.	Ukuba uqinisekile.
Anyone knows what the problem is.	Nabani na uyayazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
But this will not be you.	Kodwa oku akuyi kuba nguwe.
Good job with him.	Umsebenzi olungileyo naye.
I just want to talk to you about it.	Ndifuna nje ukuthetha nawe ngayo.
No one knows anything.	Akukho mntu wazi nto.
That is happening now.	Oko kwenzeka ngoku.
And so it happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto ke.
Whatever.	Nokuba yintoni na.
We know this is not the case.	Siyazi ukuba oku akunjalo.
But this will happen now.	Kodwa oku kuya kwenzeka ngoku.
All right! 	Kulungile!
He said yes.	Wathi ewe.
He started reading.	Waqalisa ukufunda.
Little did she know that it would be so difficult.	Wayengazi nje ukuba kuya kuba nzima kangaka.
I'm glad she came your way.	Ndiyavuya kuba eze ngendlela yakho.
But not this way.	Kodwa hayi ngale ndlela.
I want to be with you here.	Ndifuna ukuba nawe apha.
Just maybe.	Mhlawumbi nje.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
But now I better talk.	Kodwa ngoku kungcono ndithethe.
He did well.	Wenza kakuhle.
Not me, but something.	Hayi mna, kodwa into.
Well, this way you won't have to.	Kulungile, ngale ndlela akuyi kufuneka.
How long, he did not know.	Ixesha elingakanani, wayengazi.
It's hard.	Kunzima.
Obviously, you know that.	Ngokucacileyo, uyayazi loo nto.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
What is the main problem? 	Yintoni ingxaki enkulu?
I go there alone.	Ndiya apho ndedwa.
But we have to do it together.	Kodwa kufuneka siyenze kunye.
Nobody does anything.	Akukho mntu wenza nto.
Not bad now.	Hayi kakubi ngoku.
It will happen in the end.	Kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
Tell me.	Ndixelele.
Or do something.	Okanye wenze into.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
Being alone does.	Ukuba wedwa kwenza njalo.
That's the problem here.	Nantso ke ingxaki apha.
We'll talk next week.	Siza kuthetha kwiveki ezayo.
Yes, I do too.	Ewe, nam.
Obviously we know very little.	Ngokucacileyo siyazi kancinci kakhulu.
It just so happens that he is.	Kwenzeka nje ukuba nguye.
He wanted to know what it was.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
Probably, a little bit.	Mhlawumbi, kancinci.
Time, time, time.	Ixesha, ixesha, ixesha.
I'll talk to him later.	Ndiza kuthetha naye kamva.
He did not have to.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enjenjalo.
We both know why you stay.	Sobabini siyazi ukuba kutheni uhlala.
I will do it now.	Ndiza kuyenza ngoku.
He did not say or do anything.	Akazange athethe okanye enze nto.
He did.	Waba njalo.
He wants to be better.	Ufuna ukuba ngcono.
I have known that for a long time.	Kudala ndiyazi loo nto.
I can't make a decision.	Andikwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
Yes this is.	Ewe oku.
I do not know where he went.	Andazi ukuba waya phi.
Not bad, but not too bad.	Hayi embi, kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Well where are you going.	Kulungile apho uya khona.
Nowhere, just outside.	Akukho ndawo, ngaphandle nje.
I think that's a good thing to do.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto elungileyo ukuyenza.
He did nothing, he said nothing.	Akazange enze nto, akazange athethe nto.
Maybe tomorrow is better.	Mhlawumbi kusasa kungcono.
But that did happen.	Kodwa oko kwenzeka.
No no .	Hayi hayi .
Tell me something about yourself.	Ndixelele into ngawe.
Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacinga.
You like this thing.	Uyayithanda le nto.
You did the job.	Wenze umsebenzi.
Maybe now.	Mhlawumbi ngoku.
Not one thing.	Hayi into enye.
No one has ever looked here.	Akukho mntu ukhe wajonga apha.
I don't like it very much.	Andiyithandi kakhulu.
He did that very well you know.	Wenza loo nto kakhulu uyazi.
But perhaps he was not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi wayengekho.
You could be.	Usenokuba njalo.
For a really long time.	Ixesha elide ngokwenene.
No, or not always.	Akunjalo, okanye akunjalo rhoqo.
I think he can do that.	Ndicinga ukuba angayenza loo nto.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke into.
But he just has to stay in prison.	Kodwa kufuneka nje ahlale entolongweni.
But now it is very difficult.	Kodwa ngoku kunzima kakhulu.
You really mean it.	Uthetha ngokwenene.
He did not want to eat alone.	Wayengafuni ukutya yedwa.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka uyenze.
Maybe later, finally.	Mhlawumbi kamva, ekugqibeleni.
Or it should be.	Okanye bekufanele ukuba.
If anyone.	Ukuba nabani na.
I don't want to say anything.	Andifuni kuthetha nto.
It does not have to be.	Akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.
Not now, not now.	Hayi ngoku, hayi ngoku.
But something happened.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo.
So it's better to stay in this, you think.	Ngoko kungcono ukuhlala kule, ucinga.
So you have to do it for him.	Ngoko kufuneka wenze kuye.
He was gone for a long time.	Wayengekho ixesha elide.
But it is impossible.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka.
I also do not believe in it.	Nam andikholelwa kuyo.
This makes it easier to find a place quickly.	Oku kwenza kube lula ukufumana indawo ngokukhawuleza.
Okay, a little bit.	Kulungile, kancinci.
It will be a little easier.	Kuya kuba lula kancinci.
We come to the end.	Siza ekugqibeleni.
Or no, maybe.	Okanye hayi, mhlawumbi.
But that is what happened.	Kodwa yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
He must be able to do it.	Ufanele akwazi ukuyenza.
We made it.	Senze ukuba siyenze.
Or tomorrow.	Okanye ngomso.
Thinking about you .	Ndicinga ngawe .
All right, it's better.	Kulungile, kungcono.
You like that.	Uyayithanda loo nto.
Yes, he is.	Ewe, nguye.
That's what happened.	Yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
You will want something.	Uya kufuna into.
I did everything well.	Ndenze yonke into kakuhle.
Who did that?!.	Ngubani owenza loo nto?!.
Don't be me.	Musa ukuba ndim.
Here, no.	Apha, hayi.
He will stay with me.	Uya kuhlala nam.
Of course not.	Ewe akunjalo.
I know it's you.	Ndiyazi ukuba nguwe.
.	.
Maybe it will happen, maybe it won't.	Mhlawumbi kuya kwenzeka, mhlawumbi akuyi kwenzeka.
It's just true.	Yinyani nje.
This really happened to him.	Oku kwenzeka ngokwenene kuye.
Someone else did.	Omnye umntu uyenzile.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.
If not, fine, too.	Ukuba akunjalo, kulungile, kwakhona.
I don't want anything to happen to it.	Andifuni kwenzeke nto kuyo.
He knew who this was.	Wayesazi ukuba ngubani lo.
He did not know why.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
Sounds good to be true.	Kubonakala ngathi kulungile ukuba yinyani.
No one is there.	Akukho mntu apho.
He looked further.	Wajonga ngakumbi.
Impossible to do.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza.
I know you will want to help.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kufuna ukunceda.
I just can't have it.	Andikwazi nje ukuba nayo.
This will stay with me.	Oku kuya kuhlala nam.
It's just time.	Lixesha nje.
For a long time then.	Ixesha elide ngoko.
Well, it will be the same thing.	Kulungile, kuya kuba yinto enye.
But one.	Kodwa enye.
Yes he knew.	Ewe wayesazi.
You probably will.	Usenokuba uya kuba njalo.
Help with it.	Nceda ngayo.
So, I am just that.	Ngoko, ndim nje ngoko.
He really wanted her.	Wayefuna kakhulu kuye.
I had to do something new.	Kwafuneka ndenze into entsha.
Finally this morning.	Ekugqibeleni ngale ntsasa.
But not this place.	Kodwa hayi le ndawo.
But it is impossible to know.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka ukwazi.
It's just true.	Yinyani nje.
No matter what, you sit down.	Nokuba kwenzeka ntoni, uhlala phantsi.
That's the problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki.
So he thought.	Ngoko wacinga.
That may be true, but not always.	Oko kunokuba yinyani, kodwa hayi rhoqo.
You have to do something.	Umele ukuba wenze into.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
Maybe it's better.	Mhlawumbi kungcono.
Now this is difficult.	Ngoku oku kunzima.
Or do something quickly.	Okanye wenze into ngokukhawuleza.
Something else happened.	Kukho enye into eyenzekayo.
He has to do it.	Kufuneka enze.
I know nothing about that.	Andazi nto ngaloo nto.
If you were supposed to be here.	Ukuba bekufanele ukuba ulapha.
I can't say that enough.	Andikwazi ukuthetha oko ngokwaneleyo.
In advance .	Ngaphambili .
That's it.	Yinto leyo.
Nobody wants you here.	Akukho mntu ufuna wena apha.
I want to be that way.	Ndifuna ukuba njalo.
If anything, you will be better off.	Ukuba kukho nantoni na, uya kuba ngcono.
He tried again, more.	Wazama kwakhona, ngakumbi.
But soon.	Kodwa kungekudala .
He will be seen.	Uya kubonakala.
But there is another way.	Kodwa kukho enye indlela.
No one agreed to anything.	Akukho mntu wavuma nantoni na.
I want money.	Ndifuna imali.
You seem to be a good person.	Ubonakala ungumntu olungileyo.
he asked.	wabuza.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
He wanted her to come once.	Wayefuna ukuba eze kanye.
I'm not sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto.
So he would do it again.	Ngoko wayeza kuphinda.
No one knew.	Akukho mntu wayesazi.
Finally, there is peace.	Ekugqibeleni, kukho uxolo.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akazange.
And it was so.	Waba njalo ke.
It's something else.	Yinto enye into.
No, that's you.	Hayi, nguwe lowo.
Looks like he did.	Kubonakala ngathi wenze njalo.
Work is coming quickly.	Umsebenzi uza ngokukhawuleza.
He is one person.	Ungumntu omnye.
.	.
I don't really know why.	Andazi ngenene ukuba kutheni.
Not a big deal.	Hayi into enkulu.
Probably too.	Mhlawumbi naye.
He wanted to.	Wayefuna.
Or something else.	Okanye enye into.
You have to do it.	Kufuneka wenze njalo.
You should have known better.	Bekufanele ukuba uyazi ngcono.
He is going home.	Uya ekhaya.
Yes, today we know more about it.	Ewe, namhlanje siyazi ngakumbi ngayo.
But, that's it, man.	Kodwa, yiloo nto, umntu.
It's true now.	Yinyani ngoku.
You know, just once.	Uyazi, kube kanye nje.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
Do not see.	Musa ukubona.
Or it should.	Okanye kufuneka.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
All right, all right now.	Kulungile, kulungile ngoku.
But it will be time.	Kodwa kuya kuba lixesha.
Because this is not the case.	Kuba oku akunjalo.
I think the other way.	Ndicinga ngenye indlela.
I am alone.	Kum ndedwa.
It seems to us.	Kubonakala ngathi.
I'm going to have to think of something else.	Kuza kufuneka ndicinge ngenye into.
I didn't want to do anything.	Ndandingafuni kwenza nto.
But this will do nothing.	Kodwa oku akuyi kwenza nto.
The moment is over.	Okwangoku kwaphela.
You mean something.	Uthetha into.
Maybe stay.	Mhlawumbi ukuhlala.
Because everyone knows it's true.	Kuba wonke umntu uyazi ukuba yinyani.
It's you.	Nguwe wena.
We all know that he will do it.	Sonke siyazi ukuba uya kuyenza.
If not, that's fine.	Ukuba akunjalo, kulungile ukuba.
Everyone knows what money is.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba yintoni imali.
I have not been able to stay that long.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide kangako.
She realized it was him.	Waqonda ukuba nguye.
To this day.	Kude kube namhlanje.
Why did he come here.	Kutheni eze apha.
He just needed help.	Wayefuna nje uncedo.
I did nothing about it.	Khange ndenze nto ngayo .
I'm sure you did.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba wenze njalo.
He did not speak.	Akazange athethe.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ngokwenene.
Thus, he did not.	Ngaloo ndlela, akazange.
I will do it again.	Ndiza kuyenza kwakhona.
Only not so well.	Kuphela hayi kakuhle.
But, it should.	Kodwa, kufuneka.
He said he was sure it was me.	Wathi uqinisekile ukuba ndim.
No, he wanted to talk.	Akunjalo, wayefuna ukuthetha.
So yeah, that's fine.	Ngoko ewe, kulungile.
But this had to happen.	Kodwa oku kwafuneka ukuba kube njalo.
Not a place.	Hayi indawo.
She looked at him.	Wajonga kuye.
To be better.	Ukuze ube ngcono.
It looks perfectly fine.	Kubonakala kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
This speaks well.	Oku kuthetha kakuhle.
Not so.	Akunjalo ngaloo ndlela.
Location.	Indawo .
Great house.	Indlu enkulu.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
It may also be that we do not need to do so.	Kwakhona kusenokwenzeka ukuba akuyomfuneko ukuba senze njalo.
Just that.	Kuphela oko.
There is always a chance.	Kuhlala kukho ithuba.
Or it could be.	Okanye kusenokwenzeka.
Well, it's good to have you.	Ewe, kulungile ukuba ube nawe.
It seems like a long time ago.	Kubonakala ngathi kudala.
He understood more now.	Waqonda ngakumbi ngoku.
But he was not here.	Kodwa wayengekho apha.
He did not come.	Akazange eze.
He could not stay with her.	Akazange akwazi ukuhlala naye.
This can be very simple.	Oku kunokuba lula kakhulu.
A very good person.	Umntu olungileyo kakhulu.
It seems like yesterday.	Kubonakala ngathi izolo.
That's fine by me.	Kulungile kum.
I was thinking about you today.	Bendicinga ngawe namhlanje.
Probably longer.	Mhlawumbi elide.
I'm happy with it now.	Ndiyavuya kuyo ngoku.
What now?.	Yintoni ngoku?.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma ngokukhawuleza.
Very, really.	Kakhulu, ngenene.
Please do it.	Nceda uyenze.
But that is not the case now.	Kodwa akunjalo ngoku.
I didn't know how but.	Ndandingazi ukuba njani kodwa.
That's probably it.	Yiloo nto mhlawumbi.
It should be easy enough to do.	Kufuneka kube lula ngokwaneleyo ukwenza.
He has to be with her.	Kufuneka abe naye.
But he is not there now.	Kodwa akakho ngoku.
But tell me this.	Kodwa ndixelele oku.
This is clearly not the case here.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo apha.
He wanted to talk to her.	Wayefuna ukuthetha naye.
So, because.	Ngoko, kuba.
I just wonder what it is.	Ndiyazibuza nje ukuba yintoni.
So you should.	Ngoko ufanele.
Obviously, it will be better tomorrow.	Ngokucacileyo, kuya kuba ngcono ngomso.
He looked down and looked down.	Wajonga phantsi wajonga phantsi.
Nobody does that.	Akukho mntu wenza ngaloo ndlela.
He said he wanted a place.	Wathi ufuna indawo.
That should be difficult.	Oko kufuneka kube nzima.
But he is not alone.	Kodwa ayinguye yedwa.
I think so.	Ndicinga njalo.
It means work.	Kuthetha umsebenzi.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namhlanje.
I never did.	Andizange ndiyenze.
He sits down quickly.	Uhlala phantsi ngokukhawuleza.
He lives here.	Uhlala apha.
He will, he will.	Uya kwenza, uya kwenza.
I know that now.	Ndiyayazi lonto ngoku.
So it is not.	Ngoko akunjalo.
It will happen.	Kuya kwenzeka.
I think you look good !.	Ndicinga ukuba ukhangeleka kakuhle!.
You do not have to decide now.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba wenze isigqibo ngoku.
Not a little bit.	Hayi kancinci kancinci.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, wakwenza oko.
He knew where he had to go.	Wayesazi apho kufuneka aye khona.
It had to be that way.	Bekufanele kube njalo ke.
She is very personal.	Ungumntu wakhe kakhulu.
I want something else.	Ndifuna enye into.
You have done it before.	Uyenze ngaphambili.
You stand the other way.	Umele enye indlela.
Great thing, really.	Into enkulu, ngokwenene.
I have to do something.	Kufuneka ndenze into.
He does not want to leave.	Akafuni ukuhamba.
Probably not for long.	Mhlawumbi akayi kuhlala ixesha elide.
Nothing to tell.	Akukho nto ukuxelela.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, hayi kakhulu.
One day certainly enough.	Ngenye imini ngokuqinisekileyo ngokwaneleyo.
It's a very bad thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu.
Is it now.	Ngaba ngoku.
No one should know today.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukuba akwazi namhlanje.
I don't want anything to happen to you.	Andifuni kwenzeke nto kuwe.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
This could be better.	Oku kunokuba ngcono.
But he will be here soon.	Kodwa uzakuba lapha kungekudala.
Very, very sorry.	Kakhulu, uxolo kakhulu.
Here is the problem.	Apha kukho ingxaki.
Anyone can do it.	Nabani na angayenza.
And so it happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto ke.
But it will not be easy.	Kodwa akuyi kuba lula.
He'll be here, too.	Uzakuba lapha, naye.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
I doubt you will be able to.	Ndiyathandabuza ukuba uya kukwazi.
Everyone watched.	Wonke umntu wajonga.
No problem at all.	Akukho ngxaki kwaphela.
I don't know what will happen.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
Everything about it.	Yonke into ngayo.
He did not know if he could do this.	Wayengazi ukuba angayenza na le nto.
Soon but for now.	Kungekudala kodwa okwangoku.
That's the way.	Nantso indlela.
If you want.	Ukuba uyafuna.
We need to do it again as soon as possible.	Kufuneka siyenze kwakhona ngokukhawuleza.
It's hard to say.	Kunzima ukuthetha.
That's it.	Yiloo nto.
You knew everyone.	Ubusazi wonke umntu.
He would do this.	Wayeza kuyenza le nto.
That is why being human.	Yiloo nto ke ukuba ngumntu.
He did not stay long outside.	Khange ahlale ixesha elide ngaphandle.
Maybe someone else.	Mhlawumbi omnye umntu.
I did everything very slowly.	Ndenze yonke into kancinci kakhulu.
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba ndingayenza njani.
He stayed a long time.	Wahlala ixesha elide.
I really want to talk to her.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukuthetha naye.
I never knew how to do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuba ndenze njani.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
He did it this morning.	Uyenzile ngale ntsasa.
As you want that.	Njengoko ufuna oko.
That's probably better.	Oko mhlawumbi kungcono.
But this will go a long way.	Kodwa oku kuya kude kakhulu.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
I definitely want to go.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndifuna ukuhamba.
Not this one.	Hayi lo.
There are, of course, exceptions.	Kukho, ngokuqinisekileyo, ngaphandle.
Today is just hard.	Namhlanje kunzima nje.
Being and being.	Ukuba kunye nokuba.
I was just thinking about it.	Ndandicinga nje ngayo.
But in a good way.	Kodwa ngendlela elungileyo.
I thought you did well.	Bendicinga ukuba wenze kakuhle.
You like something like that.	Uyayithanda into enjalo.
But it is possible.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka.
Now, there is a problem.	Ngoku, kukho ingxaki.
We did it for you.	Senze wena.
Well, you think you will be alone.	Ewe, ucinga ukuba uzakuba yedwa.
He speaks well.	Uthetha kakuhle.
You told me that before.	Undixelele lonto ngaphambili.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
Anything good.	Nantoni na entle.
I want a job.	Ndifuna umsebenzi.
I don't want anything.	Andifuni nto.
She loves the car.	Uyayithanda imoto.
I think he did.	Ndicinga ukuba wenze njalo.
He looked for a long time.	Wajonga ixesha elide.
Finding a house.	Ukufumana indlu.
I thought a lot.	Bendicinga kakhulu.
He had to be with her.	Kwafuneka abe naye.
In everything.	Kuyo yonke into.
But something else.	Kodwa ngenye into.
But that will not last long.	Kodwa oko akuyi kuba lixesha elide.
That's all.	Yiloo nto kuphela.
It will be now.	Kuya kuba ngoku.
Probably not immediately.	Mhlawumbi hayi nangoko.
That's exactly right.	Yinto ngokwenene leyo.
I can't do it.	Andikwazi ukuyenza.
I think that's true.	Ndicinga ukuba yinyani leyo.
He wanted something from her.	Wayefuna into kuye.
Yes he would.	Ewe wayeza kuhlala.
It's absolutely something.	Yinto ngokupheleleyo.
I don't really like it.	Andiyithandi ngokwenene.
He lives alone.	Uhlala wedwa.
Maybe you've already done it.	Mhlawumbi sele uyenzile.
He knew who this was.	Wayesazi ukuba ngubani lo.
He stayed once in it.	Wahlala kanye kuyo.
Finally there is someone.	Ekugqibeleni kukho umntu.
There is something good for everyone.	Kukho into entle kuye wonke umntu.
He says there is not much.	Uthi akukho nto ingako.
That's it.	Yiloo nto.
Maybe it should have been.	Mhlawumbi bekufanele ukuba .
I hope not.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
But more on that all later.	Kodwa ngakumbi kuyo yonke loo nto kamva.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
I'm not sure when.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba nini.
He thought so.	Wacinga ngaloo ndlela ke.
We, too.	Nathi, nathi.
Maybe a little but not too much.	Mhlawumbi kancinci kodwa hayi kakhulu.
But not only that.	Kodwa hayi kuphela.
We have to do things.	Kufuneka senze izinto.
Or stop it altogether.	Okanye ayeke kwaphela.
But you will not get better.	Kodwa awuyi kuba ngcono.
Yes, not at all.	Ewe, hayi ngokupheleleyo.
We'll talk more later.	Siza kuthetha ngakumbi kamva.
Everywhere but nowhere.	Kuyo yonke indawo kodwa akukho ndawo.
Yes, that's true enough.	Ewe, yinyani ngokwaneleyo leyo.
If you want.	Ukuba uyafuna.
Now, there is an obvious exception.	Ngoku, kukho ngaphandle ngokucacileyo.
He had to do something.	Bekufanele enze into.
Not long enough.	Kungekudala ngokwaneleyo.
I don't know how I can do that.	Andiqondi ukuba ndingayenza njani loo nto.
I did all the work.	Ndenze wonke umsebenzi.
You probably haven't done that.	Mhlawumbi khange uyenze loo nto.
I can't believe he knew.	Andikholelwa ukuba wayesazi.
I know what it is now.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni ngoku.
Of course you can.	Ngokuqinisekileyo unokuba nayo.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
That's it now.	Yiyo ngoku.
But he is not there.	Kodwa akakho apho.
He just didn't do it.	Akazange enze nje.
He can't walk.	Akakwazi ukuhamba.
That will not be easy.	Oko akuyi kuba lula.
Please tell me something.	Nceda undixelele into.
It will be fast.	Kuya kuba ngokukhawuleza.
He must have known.	Umele ukuba wayesazi.
This happens regularly here.	Oku kwenzeka rhoqo apha.
I have to make money from it.	Kufuneka ndenze imali ngayo.
Just this.	Oku nje.
I would like to know why.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba kutheni le nto.
Now he didn't even want to be that.	Ngoku wayengafuni nokuba yiloo nto.
.	.
But for that to happen this requires work.	Kodwa ukuze kwenzeke oku kufuna umsebenzi.
He wanted to know everything.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngayo yonke into.
Another really nice place.	Enye indawo entle ngokwenene.
But that is not the case here.	Kodwa akunjalo apha.
Of course not.	Ewe, akunjalo.
He was going to be tough.	Wayeza kuba nzima.

This will be very demanding.	Oku kuya kufuna kakhulu.
I know he is.	Ndiyazi ukuba nguye.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ngokwenene.
The more you talk about it.	Xa uthetha ngakumbi ngaloo nto.

That's the only way to do it.	Yiloo ndlela kuphela yokwenza oko.

Maybe you want to be yourself.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukuba nguwe.
No one knows anything.	Akukho mntu wazi nto.
It's hard to say.	Kunzima ukuthetha.
To be otherwise impossible.	Ukuze kube ngenye indlela akunakwenzeka.
It's so much better this way.	Kungcono kakhulu ngale ndlela.
Food, one.	Ukutya, enye.
Clearly, he thought.	Ngokucacileyo, wacinga.
This here is not the case.	Oku apha akunjalo.

If you want one.	Ukuba ufuna enye.
If not better.	Ukuba akukho ngcono.

Well, you know.	Kulungile, uyazi.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
You know better.	Uyazi ngcono.
There is a time.	Kukho ixesha.

I could not do it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza.
No one is at home.	Akukho mntu ekhaya.
Not always.	Akunjalo rhoqo.
He can do that but not too much.	Angayenza loo nto kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Maybe a long time ago.	Mhlawumbi kudala, kudala.
Yes, money.	Ewe, imali.
This will be difficult.	Oku kuya kuba nzima.
It's a very bad thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu.
Everyone went there.	Wonke umntu waya apho.
Tell me what's the problem.	Ndixelele yintoni ingxaki.
But he is not good at it.	Kodwa akakho kakuhle kuyo.
He did not know anyone there.	Wayengazi mntu apho.
Obviously, no one was coming.	Ngokucacileyo, akukho mntu wayeza kuza.
He did not need to say more.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba athethe ngakumbi.
You only have to do the work once.	Kufuneka wenze umsebenzi kube kanye kuphela.
Not much better, but better.	Hayi ngcono kakhulu, kodwa ngcono.
For now, here.	Okwangoku, apha.

It's the same thing.	Yinto enye.
Talk to you soon.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kungekudala.
But he could not do it.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza.
Well, not everyone.	Ewe, ayinguye wonke umntu.
No one is going anywhere.	Akukho mntu uya ndawo.
You really deserve it.	Ufanele ngokwenene.
So, he looks good.	Ngoko, ukhangeleka kakuhle.
I know him.	Ndiyamazi.
But to me, he made a lot of money.	Kodwa kum, wenza imali eninzi kakhulu.
I want to go.	Ndifuna ukuhamba.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
But it should.	Kodwa kufuneka.
To me that's good.	Kum oko kulungile.

.	.
Soon, perhaps, but for now.	Kungekudala, mhlawumbi, kodwa okwangoku.
We all know it well.	Sonke siyazi kakuhle.
But he asked for help.	Kodwa wacela uncedo.
He did not think it was true.	Akazange acinge ukuba yinyani.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ndicela undixelele.
But it's really hard to see.	Kodwa ngenene kunzima ukubona.
Where are you now???.	Uphi ngoku???.
It's you.	Nguwe.
He can't go there.	Akakwazi ukuya apho.
If you really want to just get it.	Ukuba ufuna ngokwenene ukufumana nje.

Yeah, except for a little bit.	Ewe, ngaphandle nje kancinci.
I just know what you can do.	Ndiyazi nje ukuba uyakwazi ukwenza ntoni.
Talk about everything.	Ukuthetha ngayo yonke into.
But maybe he won't.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akayi.
He did not want to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba.
Just a house.	Indlu nje.
What he wants is for him.	Into ayifunayo nguye.
I do not know yet.	Andazi okwangoku.
Or I do not know.	Okanye andazi.

That's a good thing probably.	Yinto entle leyo mhlawumbi.

Just as you told me.	Kanye njengoko undixelele.
Just making it harder.	Ukwenza nje kube nzima.
For now he would just like to stay.	Okwangoku angathanda nje ukuhlala.
Man does not want, it seems he wants something else.	Umntu akafuni, kubonakala ngathi ufuna enye into.
He had to speak alone.	Kwafuneka athethe yedwa.
Not so, not now.	Hayi ngoko, hayi ngoku.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
Maybe a long time ago.	Mhlawumbi kudala.
You've already done it.	Sele uyenzile njalo.
I did well with it.	Ndenze kakuhle ngayo.
This is not possible.	Oku akunakwenzeka.
Someone may have done just that.	Umntu usenokuba wenze kanye loo nto.

It's a new thing.	Yinto entsha.
Or the police.	Okanye amapolisa.

I can't stay long.	Andikwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide.
He tried to speak he could not.	Wazama ukuthetha akakwazi.

This happened here.	Oku kwenzeke apha.
I do not like his way.	Andiyithandi indlela yakhe.

Walking forward far away.	Ukuhamba ukuya ngaphambili kude.
He really did.	Wenze ngokwenene.
But he stayed for a long time.	Kodwa wahlala ixesha elide.

Certainly, now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, ngoku.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
Probably not for long.	Mhlawumbi hayi ixesha elide.
Apparently nothing.	Kubonakala ukuba akukho nto.
Until then, enough.	Kude kube ngoko, ngokwaneleyo.
I'm the problem there.	Ndim ingxaki apho.
He did not speak.	Khange athethe.
I didn't say anything else.	Khange ndithethe enye into.
It's just true.	Yinyani nje.
You will say whatever you do.	Uya kuthetha nantoni na ukuyenza.
I can't be me.	Andikwazi ukuba ndim.
You will get better.	Uya kuba ngcono.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
You will know this.	Uya kukwazi oku.

I thought it was okay.	Ndandicinga ukuba kulungile.
He knew this was hard.	Wayesazi ukuba oku kunzima.
But there is something about you.	Kodwa kukho into ngawe.
You know the place.	Uyayazi indawo.
Everyone wants to be here.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukuba lapha.
I knew it would be hard today.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima namhlanje.
I never thought of anyone or anything.	Khange ndicinge mntu okanye nantoni na.
I hope you do not want to.	Ndiyathemba ukuba awufuni.
But you are thinking well.	Kodwa ucinga kakuhle.
Where did he go, what did he do.	Ukuba waya phi, wenza ntoni.
I've already said a lot.	Sele ndithethe kakhulu.
He thought he had better go.	Wacinga ukuba kungcono ahambe.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
There is nothing here.	Akukho nto apha.
I never thought about it.	Andizange ndicinge ngayo.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
This will happen.	Oku kuya kwenzeka.
He tried very hard.	Wazama kakhulu.
This is it.	Nguye lo.
He did not know anyone there.	Wayengazi mntu apho.
This is for sure.	Oku ngokuqinisekileyo.
I'm not sure where.	Andiqinisekanga apho.
Now what are we going to do with it.	Ngoku siza kwenza ntoni ngayo.
You probably thought.	Mhlawumbi wacinga.
It's hard, when he wants hard.	Kunzima, xa efuna nzima.
Please say yes.	Ndicela uthi ewe.
It happened to him.	Kwenzeka kuye.
And now this.	Ke ngoku oku.
It seems to be true.	Kubonakala ngathi yinyani.
Just something about you.	Into nje ngawe.
Everything.	Yonke into .
But this certainly will not do.	Kodwa oku ngokuqinisekileyo akuyi kwenza.
He wants to be.	Ufuna ukuba .
Maybe it’s me, or it’s just me.	Mhlawumbi ndim, okanye ndim nje.
You want badly.	Ufuna kakubi.
It's hard to read.	Kunzima ukufunda.
I did not go.	Andizange ndiye.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But don't make it too easy.	Kodwa musa ukuyenza lula kakhulu.
Most of the time alone.	Ixesha elininzi wedwa.
I don't know what it is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni.
That's exactly what it is.	Yiloo nto ngokwenene.
I have to go there.	Kufuneka ndiye apho.
I didn't do it.	khange ndiyenze.
Prolonged hospital stay.	Ukuhlala ixesha elide esibhedlele.
I will stay with him here.	Ndiza kuhlala naye apha.
That's you.	Nguwe ke.
It has to happen to you.	Kufuneka yenzeke kuwe.
But not exactly.	Kodwa hayi ncam.
But, well, it's okay to go.	Kodwa, kulungile, kulungile ukuhamba.
To him, maybe, but not me.	Kuye, mhlawumbi, kodwa hayi mna.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi akunjalo.
We go there a lot.	Siya apho kakhulu.
I will never do it again.	andiyi kuphinda ndiyenze.
But anyone can do that.	Kodwa nabani na angayenza loo nto.
I will be.	Ndiza kuba.
All right.	Kulungile.
He said he liked it very much.	Uthe uyayithanda kakhulu.
We will do the same.	Siya kwenza njalo.
He certainly knew nothing about it.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wayengazi nto ngayo.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa ngokwenene akunjalo.
Thus.	Ngaloo ndlela .
That's it.	Yiyo loo nto.
So what exactly is that.	Ke yintoni leyo kanye.
So how do you do it.	Ngoko wenza njani.
So everyone says.	Ngoko wonke umntu uthi.
You should have known this was going to happen.	Bekufanele ukuba uyazi ukuba oku kuya kwenzeka.
Great place.	Indawo enkulu.
I don't know anyone.	Andazi mntu.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
Just you.	Wena nje.
For a really long time.	Ixesha elide ngokwenene.
That one is very visible.	Lowo ubonakala kakhulu.
I hope not.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
I never did either.	Nam andizange ndiyenze.
Time is of the essence.	Ixesha kukwazi nje.
I will not do this.	Andiyi kuyenza le nto.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.	Kudala ndicinga ngayo.
There is something else.	Kukho enye into.
That's me.	Ndim lowo.
It means everything.	Kuthetha yonke into.
But he did not think.	Kodwa akazange acinge .
Maybe a little bit.	Mhlawumbi kancinci.
Finally he checked the time.	Ekugqibeleni wajonga ixesha.
I will say that.	Ndiza kuthetha loo nto.
But he will do it.	Kodwa uya kuyenza.
But I'm not sure.	Kodwa andiqinisekanga.
Well, maybe not so much.	Ewe, mhlawumbi hayi kakhulu.
Maybe not, but it seems to us.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo, kodwa kubonakala ngathi.
But really, yes.	Kodwa ngokwenene, ewe.
He does not know alone.	Akazi yedwa.
But then again, you know this.	Kodwa kwakhona, uyazi oku.
But, it is not possible.	Kodwa, akunakwenzeka.
No one is at home.	Akukho mntu ekhaya.
Clearly, it could be.	Ngokucacileyo, kunokuba njalo.
Yes, certainly yes.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo ewe.
I can do nothing.	Andikwazi kwenza nto.
What happened to him ?.	Kwenzeke ntoni kuye?.
He also knew about it.	Naye wayesazi ngayo.
I can't win.	Andikwazi ukuphumelela.
He did not say anything for a long time.	Akazange athethe nto ixesha elide.
He is.	Nguye.
But he could not do it.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuyenza.
I could not.	Khange ndikwazi.
This will end badly.	Oku kuya kuphela kakubi.
I think he can do everything.	Ndicinga ukuba angayenza yonke into.
Maybe he went too far.	Mhlawumbi waya kakhulu.
But one more thing.	Kodwa enye into.
Now is the time.	Ngoku lixesha.
He looked at me.	Wajonga wajonga kum.
I would really like to know.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukwazi.
Yeah, one more thing.	Ewe, enye into.
I think a lot.	Ndicinga kakhulu.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
I don't know when.	Andazi ukuba nini.
To me this means everything.	Kum oku kuthetha yonke into.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.
I certainly know more now.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndiyazi ngakumbi ngoku.
But he was not in it or in it.	Kodwa wayengekho kuyo okanye kuyo.
It seems difficult.	Kubonakala ngathi kunzima.
He knows his car.	Uyayazi imoto yakhe.
If anything.	Ukuba kukho nantoni na.
I never told anyone.	Zange ndixelele mntu.
Well done.	Wenze kakuhle.
Yeah, that's it.	Ewe, yiloo nto.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Uxolo ngayo yonke into.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I, by the way.	Ndim, ngendlela.
.	.
I never thought about it before.	Ndandingacingi ngayo ngaphambili.
I want to be something.	Ndifuna ukuba yinto.
I never said otherwise.	Andizange ndithethe ngenye indlela.
I made my own coffee.	Ndenze ikofu yam.
We are well aware of that.	Siyazi kakuhle loo nto.
But everything.	Kodwa yonke into.
But too much money.	Kodwa imali eninzi kakhulu.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
Not just here.	Akunjalo nje apha.
Something like that.	Into enjalo.
We'd better do it down here.	Kungcono siyenze phantsi apha phantsi.
You absolutely deserve it.	Ufanele ngokupheleleyo.
That is not what he wants.	Asiyonto ayifunayo leyo.
If you do, that's fine.	Ukuba wenza, kulungile.
Or tell me.	Okanye undixelele.
You have already done enough.	Sele wenze ngokwaneleyo.
But for him, for sure.	Kodwa kuye, ngokuqinisekileyo.
I thought you knew that.	Bendicinga ukuba uyayazi lonto.
But this is not easy.	Kodwa oku akukho lula.
I can't say why.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba kutheni.
You have to do some work at home.	Kufuneka wenze omnye umsebenzi ekhaya.
Either way this is better.	Ngenye indlela oku kungcono.
He looked bad.	Wayekhangeleka embi.
Nobody knew he was here.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ukuba ulapha.
There is a problem with this method.	Kukho ingxaki ngale ndlela.
But it has to be better.	Kodwa kufuneka kube ngcono.
It just has to.	Kufuneka nje.
That's exactly what it is.	Nto leyo kanye kanye.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo enye.
He did not go today.	Akazange namhlanje.
Not too long ago.	Kungekudala kakhulu.
If it happens, it happens.	Ukuba kwenzeka, kwenzeka.
.	.
So it's hard.	Ngoko kunzima.
But he did not want to.	Kodwa akazange afune.
Long time ago.	Kudala kakhulu.
Not just good enough.	Hayi nje kakuhle ngokwaneleyo.
I knew nothing about it.	Ndandingazi nto ngayo.
I can do it later.	Ndingayenza kamva.
One, no.	Enye, hayi.
To me, just like me.	Kum, njengam.
I really think it will.	Ngokwenene ndicinga ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
Well, well enough.	Kulungile, kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
But now .	Kodwa ngoku .
A real place.	Indawo ngokwenene.
Very alone.	Kakhulu wedwa.
But it's hard, you know, for now.	Kodwa kunzima, uyazi, okwangoku.
.	.
This will happen soon.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kungekudala.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi.
I can not do as you like.	Andikwazi ukwenza njengoko uthanda.
It all has to build something big in the end.	Yonke kufuneka yakhe into enkulu ekugqibeleni.
He sat down very quietly.	Wahlala phantsi kakhulu.
There is always a chance.	Kuhlala kukho ithuba.
I will speak.	Ndiza kuthetha.
Now you know.	Ngoku uyazi.
He knew in advance.	Wayesazi ngaphambili.
It is very difficult for him.	Kunzima kakhulu kuye.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange.
I will be too.	Nam ndiya kuba njalo.
But not yet.	Kodwa hayi okwangoku.
I would like to find someone.	Ndingathanda ukufumana umntu.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
There is only your way.	Kukho indlela yakho kuphela.
But he would do it.	Kodwa wayeza kuyenza.
Now there are many.	Ngoku kukho ezininzi.
I didn't want to know anything.	Ndandingafuni ukwazi nto.
How about another? 	Njani enye?
But this happened to me.	Kodwa oku kwenzeka kum.
Tom did not come.	UTom akazange eze.
I've never done it before.	Andizange ndiyenze ngaphambili.
All right, then.	Kulungile, ngoko ke.
That's what it is.	Yiloo nto ke.
I totally apologize.	Ndicela uxolo ngokupheleleyo.
I am the only one, the only one.	Ndim kuphela, ndim kuphela.
Is true.	Yinyani.
I want to see.	Ndifuna ukubona.
It's hard but it's okay.	Kunzima kodwa kulungile.
I would really like that.	Ndingathanda kakhulu oko.
Of course not.	Akunjalo ke.
I don't even know how this happened.	Andazi nokuba kwenzeka njani oku.
Or he did.	Okanye wenza.
No matter how long you want it.	Nokuba ufuna ixesha elide kangakanani.
Why are we here.	Kutheni siza apha.
You do not really want to know.	Awufuni ngokwenene ukwazi.
Now it is something new.	Ngoku yinto entsha.
I'll stay here.	Ndiza kuhlala apha.
Now you want it again.	Ngoku ufuna kwakhona.
I knew nothing about it.	Ndandingazi nto ngayo.
I need to speak well of this now.	Kufuneka ndithethe kakuhle ngale nto ngoku.
It will be easier than you think.	Kuya kuba lula kunokuba ucinga.
He started stealing food.	Waqalisa ukuba ukutya.
We know more.	Siyazi ngakumbi.
Impossible to do.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza.
I will come now.	Ndiza kuza ngoku.
He means everything.	Uthetha yonke into.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
That's how bad it is.	Nantso indlela embi ngayo.
We will do it again.	Siza kuphinda.
Now, really.	Ngoku, ngokwenene.
So you don't want to.	Ngoko awufuni.
It is not necessary at all.	Akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
You are the person now.	Nguwe lo mntu ngoku.
Because you probably know.	Kuba mhlawumbi uyazi.
Today you may know more about this.	Namhlanje usenokuba uyazi ngakumbi oku.
Today, it will be much better.	Namhlanje, kuya kuba ngcono ngakumbi.
I certainly did not want to do that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ndandingafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
This looks good.	Oku kubonakala kulungile.
You have to tell me that place.	Kufuneka undixelele loo ndawo.
So it is not.	Ngoko akunjalo.
Good man.	Umntu olungileyo.
He is a good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo.
He said he would like to.	Wathi angathanda.
I would like to know.	Ndingathanda ukwazi.
If not, you will do it alone.	Ukuba akunjalo, uya kuyenza yedwa.
I did so.	Ndenze njalo.
He did not.	Akazange .
You mean the same thing.	Uthetha into enye.
I wish someone would tell me this soon.	Akwaba umntu undixelele le nto ngokukhawuleza.
I can't say anything to anyone.	Andikwazi ukuthetha nantoni na kuye nabani na.
I'm going to it.	Ndiya kuyo.

I'm sure he is.	Ndiqinisekile nguye.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
I told her before.	Ndamxelela ngaphambili.

I never thought he knew this.	Zange ndicinge ukuba uyakwazi oku.
Hope to see you soon!.	Ndinqwenela ukubona!.
This is definitely a good thing.	Ngokuqinisekileyo le yinto entle.
It's even harder.	Kunzima ngakumbi.
We all know that it is not easy.	Sonke siyazi ukuba akukho lula.

Too long.	Ixesha elide kakhulu.
I will do well.	Ndiya kwenza kakuhle.

That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
The food is good.	Ukutya kulungile.
It's too far to walk.	Kude kakhulu ukuhamba.

He did well.	Wenza kakuhle.
Don't do it.	Musa ukwenza.
One way.	Enye indlela.
Do you feel that way now ?.	Uziva njalo ngoku?.

So, he did just that.	Ngoko, wenza kanye loo nto.
Just like me.	Kanye njengam.
I can't talk about this.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngale nto.
I really thought this was true.	Ngenene bendicinga ukuba le yinyani.
He did so.	Wenze njalo.
I can't talk about you.	Andikwazi ukuthetha ngawe.
He couldn't do it.	Akazange akwazi ukuyenza.
Anyone will do.	Nabani na uya kwenza.
Well, he thought.	Ewe, wacinga.
You want to buy more.	Ufuna ukuthenga ngakumbi.
Way too much, obviously.	Indlela kakhulu, ngokucacileyo.
I would really like to see that.	Ndingathanda ngokwenene ukubona oko.
No problem for me.	Akukho ngxaki kum.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
I would love to have it.	Ndingathanda ukuba nayo.
If not .	Ukuba akukho njalo .
You know you will do anything.	Uyazi ukuba uya kwenza nantoni na.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
But you probably do not want to.	Kodwa mhlawumbi awufuni.
I will not be anything.	Andiyi kuba yinto.
He talks about it quickly.	Uthetha ngaloo nto ngokukhawuleza.
He knows all this.	Uyayazi yonke le nto.
I don't want any problems at home.	Andifuni ngxaki ekhaya.
Or me, with that.	Okanye mna, ngaloo nto.
This is possible but not possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka kodwa akunakwenzeka.
He sat down with us.	Wahlala nathi phantsi.
He did not know what the problem was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
No one thought too much of it.	Akukho mntu wayecinga kakhulu ngayo.
Living with him.	Ukuhlala naye.
There is certainly no one today.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho mntu namhlanje.
I just don't want to.	Andifuni nje.
But you have to do this.	Kodwa kufuneka wenze oku.
We need to do something about it.	Kufuneka senze into ngayo.
He was very thoughtful.	Wayecinga kakhulu.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi kusenokwenzeka ukuba akakwazi.
you say.	uthi.
It's hard though.	Kunzima kodwa.
That will do something.	Oko kuya kwenza into.
Why did he come.	Kwakutheni ukuze eze.
But not low enough.	Kodwa hayi phantsi ngokwaneleyo.
I had to go to work myself.	Kwafuneka ndiye emsebenzini mna.
You know that.	Uyayazi loo nto.
I want to be with you here.	Ndifuna ukuba nawe apha.
He had a hard time with her.	Waba nzima naye.
But he did not speak.	Kodwa akazange athethe.
He said no.	Uye wathi hayi.
Not for a long time, though.	Hayi ixesha elide, kodwa .
He really did.	Wenze ngokwenene.
.	.
You really have to do that.	Kufuneka wenze oko ngokwenene.
But this is okay.	Kodwa oku kulungile.
But it does not seem that easy.	Kodwa kubonakala ngathi akukho lula kangako.
I did not speak.	Khange ndithethe.
I know what this is.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni le.
This happened a long time ago.	Oku kwenzeka kudala.
Too much money.	Imali eninzi kakhulu.
But that is not really necessary.	Kodwa oko akuyomfuneko ngokwenene.
I suspect he is the problem.	Ndiyarhana ukuba nguye ingxaki.
I wish he came here.	Ndinqwenela ukuba eze apha.
He did not want to leave.	Akazange afune ukuhamba.
.	.
Not only that.	Akunjalo kuphela.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona.
But he had to do it.	Kodwa kwafuneka ayenze.
He said he did not know.	Uye wathi akazi.
I hope not.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
It happens all the time.	Kwenzeka rhoqo.
Here, right here.	Apha, kanye apha.
No, he thought, not long ago.	Hayi, wacinga, kungekudala.
One way or another.	Enye indlela okanye enye.
But it is not easy to buy.	Kodwa akukho lula ukuthenga.
We know where you live.	Siyazi apho uhlala khona.
It happens very often.	Kwenzeka rhoqo kakhulu.
Not only here.	Hayi apha kuphela.
I haven't done it yet.	Khange ndiyenze ngoku.
I knew nothing.	Ndandingazi nto.
Come on in, take a look.	Uza kuza.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kangako.
He speaks quickly.	Uthetha ngokukhawuleza.
This is you.	Nguwe lo.
I thought it was okay.	Bendicinga ukuba kulungile.
But he thought better of it.	Kodwa wacinga ngcono ngayo.
That's it now.	Nto leyo ngoku.
He made a lot of money.	Wenza imali eninzi.
He is completely absent.	Akakho ngokupheleleyo.
I don't even know if this is true.	Andazi nokuba yinyani na le.
Just a little.	Nje kancinci.
I'm not sure .	Andiqinisekanga .
I want everyone there.	Ndifuna wonke umntu apho.
That's the problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki.
he thought.	wacinga.
I didn't want anything to happen.	Ndandingafuni ukuba kwenzeke nantoni na.
Or do too much.	Okanye wenze kakhulu.
She is not at work or at home.	Akakho emsebenzini okanye ekhaya.
I would, too.	Ndingathanda, nam.
You already know why.	Sele uyazi ukuba kutheni.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke loo nto.
But not for long.	Kodwa hayi ixesha elide.
True, then.	Yinyani, ke.
Staying with us will be difficult.	Ukuhlala nathi kuya kuba nzima.
I'm not sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
True to the end.	Yinyani ekugqibeleni.
Maybe it's you.	Mhlawumbi nguwe.
He tried very hard.	Wazama kakhulu.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
Too bad, if you think about it.	Into embi, ukuba ucinga ngayo.
Or later at night.	Okanye kamva ebusuku.
Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacinga.
You are trying to make a decision.	Uzama ukwenza isigqibo.
It will be much easier if.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu ukuba .
But this is clearly not the case.	Kodwa oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
To be with him.	Ukuba naye.
Well, he knows what happened to him.	Ewe, uyazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni kuye.
But this is it.	Kodwa lo nguye.
He looked better.	Wayekhangeleka ngcono.
But he was visible.	Kodwa wayebonakala.
That will mean what.	Ukuba kuya kuthetha ntoni na.
He can't stay long.	Akakwazi ukuhlala ixesha elide.
I'm not sure when it happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yenzeke nini.
I will totally do this.	Ndiza kuyenza ngokupheleleyo le nto.
Your location please.	Indawo yakho nceda.
I have done a very bad thing.	Ndenze into embi kakhulu.
Everything.	Yonke into.
Even if he doesn't want to.	Nokuba akafuni.
This is not his thing.	Asiyonto yakhe le.
He knew about it.	Wayesazi ngayo.
You may be trying to buy time.	Usenokuba uzama ukuthenga ixesha.
I think you are.	Ndicinga wena .
He said nothing to me.	Zange athethe nto kum.
I'm afraid.	Ndiyoyika.
Yeah, that's fine.	Ewe, kulungile.
Now I know why.	Ngoku ndiyazi ukuba kutheni.
No one sat down.	Akukho mntu wahlala.
I did something else.	Ndenze enye into.
There is a lot of money for him.	Kukho imali eninzi kuye.
There is no better or worse.	Akukho ngcono okanye embi.
There is not much to do.	Akukho nto ingako yokwenza.
No, he did not.	Hayi, akazange.
But, that happened.	Kodwa, oko kwenzeka.
So, fast to go today.	Ngoko, ngokukhawuleza ukuya namhlanje.
But in the end it will be better for him.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni kuya kuba ngcono kuye.
The big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
But that is definitely possible.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo oko kunokwenzeka.
He can never go fast enough.	Akanakuze ahambe ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
He tried to speak.	Wazama ukuthetha.
But not here.	Kodwa hayi apha.
He has sat down.	Uye wahlala phantsi.
I was thinking about you.	Bendicinga ngawe.
He thought nothing of it.	Akazange acinge nto.
I think this is clear.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kucacile.
Probably this book.	Mhlawumbi le ncwadi.
I told her that.	Ndamxelela oko.
I wish you knew.	Ndinqwenela ukuba ukwazi.
But it's okay.	Kodwa kulungile.
I am well aware of that.	Ndiyazi kakuhle loo nto.
Really, really.	Ngokwenene, ngokwenene.
But to make time.	Kodwa ukwenza ixesha.
He told me about it.	Wandixelela ngayo.
I told her everything.	Ndamxelela yonke into.
That's a bad thing.	Yinto embi leyo.
He has to speak.	Kufuneka athethe.
He did not speak.	Khange athethe.
I think you would like.	Ndicinga ukuba ungathanda.
he said.	uthe.
But not for long.	Kodwa hayi ixesha elide.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
He is completely human.	Ungumntu ngokupheleleyo.
I hope it will be the other way around.	Ndiyathemba ukuba kuya kuba ngenye indlela.
So now to you.	Ngoko ke ngoku kuwe.
Obviously there is something.	Ngokucacileyo kukho into.
I wish it were so.	Ndinqwenela ukuba kube njalo.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona.
Or maybe yes.	Okanye mhlawumbi ewe.
This is possible.	Oku kunokwenzeka.
Anything you need to do.	Nantoni na ekufuneka uyenzile.
But she could not decide.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
He would need another.	Wayeza kufuna enye.
I have to speak fast.	Kufuneka ndithethe ngokukhawuleza.
That's probably why.	Yiloo nto mhlawumbi kutheni.
Slowly, but surely.	Kancinci, kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo.
Mary loves it too.	UMariya uyayithanda, naye.
He never did this.	Akazange ayenze le nto.
I hope you have understood.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uye waqonda.
He would go.	Wayeza kuya.
But it does not have to be.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko ukuba kube njalo.
As you can one day.	Njengoko unokuba ngenye imini.
He never did such a thing.	Akazange enze into enjalo.
She is very happy, too.	Uyavuya kakhulu, naye.
He began to.	Waqalisa ukuba.
How? 	Njani?
But you do not have to go to it.	Kodwa akunyanzelekanga ukuba uye kuyo.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo.
But he knew it was necessary.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kufuneka.
It's very difficult now.	Kunzima kakhulu ngoku.
I don't know how to do it.	Andazi ukuba ndenze njani.
Or again maybe not.	Okanye ke kwakhona mhlawumbi akunjalo.
You did very well.	Wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
If you do not want to read this.	Ukuba awufuni ukufunda oku.
Is true.	Yinyani.
It's not very easy.	Akukho lula kakhulu.
You know the place.	Uyayazi loo ndawo.
That's fine too.	Kulungile nam.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
I wonder.	Ndiyazibuza.
This is a much bigger thing.	Le yinto enkulu ngakumbi.
Seeing what it is.	Ukubona oko kukho.
I told her that.	Ndamxelela lonto.
Not otherwise.	Akunjalo ngenye indlela.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza.
I don't know this place yet.	Andazi le ndawo okwangoku.
Now, of course, he knew.	Ngoku, ngokuqinisekileyo, wayesazi.
Certainly.	Ngokuqinisekileyo.
I won't be away for long.	Andiyi kuba kude nayo ixesha elide.
he thought.	wacinga.
It had to be that way.	Kwafuneka kube njalo.
He knew it very well.	Wayesazi kakuhle kakhulu.
Do not make this difficult.	Musa ukuyenza nzima le nto.
He didn't know what to do with it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngayo.
He went to her.	Waya kuye.
That will not last.	Oko akuyi kuhlala.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
You told me about you.	Undixelele ngawe.
All right, we'll talk to you later.	Kulungile, siza kuthetha nawe kamva.
I am the only one.	ndim kuphela .
Now, you're talking to me.	Ngoku, uthetha nam.
It never was.	Zange ukhe ube njalo .
He will do this.	Uya kuyenza le nto.
Yeah, it's better.	Ewe, kungcono.
Maybe just a little bit.	Mhlawumbi nje kancinci.
Certainly not as easy as it seems.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akukho lula njengoko kubonakala.
That's my thing.	Nantso ke into yam.
Glad to read here again.	Ndiyavuya ukufunda apha kwakhona.
Only that, anything more.	Kuphela oko, nantoni na ngakumbi.
Very, very early.	Kakhulu, ngaphambili kakhulu.
It's good to have you here.	Kulungile ukuba nawe apha.
He looked at me.	Uye wajonga kum.
I hope not, but it could be.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo, kodwa kunokuba njalo.
This seems to me good.	Oku kubonakala kum kulungile.
Nothing.	Akukho nto.
Not now, don't be like that.	Hayi ngoku, musa ukuba njalo.
This is a bad thing.	Yinto embi le.
He didn't know why, exactly, but he knew.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni, kanye, kodwa wayesazi.
He knows nothing.	Akazi nto.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
It's harder than it seems.	Kunzima kunokuba kubonakala.
That's what he wants.	Yiloo nto ayifunayo.
What is your problem.	Yintoni ingxaki yakho.
Not if you know.	Akunjalo ukuba uyazi.
But not just me.	Kodwa hayi mna kuphela.
I don't know if I will ever do that.	Andazi ukuba ndiza kwenza njalo na.
But this is not possible.	Kodwa oku akunakwenzeka.
Not really.	Akunjalo ngokwenene.
It is impossible to tell.	Akunakwenzeka ukuxelela.
Well, now we know.	Ewe, ngoku siyazi.
This is possible, but difficult.	Oku kunokwenzeka, kodwa kunzima.
Again, a little bit.	Kwakhona, kancinci kancinci.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa ke akunjalo.
Now, anyone can do it.	Ngoku, nabani na angayenza.
You go home if you want.	Uya ekhaya ukuba uyafuna.
No, that's true.	Hayi, yinyani leyo.
Maybe he didn't know.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi.
I am very happy to win today.	Ndiyavuya kakhulu ukuphumelela namhlanje.
I'll be down.	Ndiza kuba phantsi.
But nothing to me.	Kodwa akukho nto kum.
She did not know how she felt.	Wayengazi ukuba uziva njani.
Sure it's hard, but it is possible.	Ngokuqinisekileyo kunzima, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
It's hard to tell now.	Kunzima ukuxelela ngoku.
All right, no.	Kulungile, hayi.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
He said no.	Wathi khange.
If not, it's much better for you.	Ukuba akunjalo, kungcono kakhulu kuwe.
I really didn't know why.	Ngokwenene ndandingazi ukuba kutheni.
How, he didn't know.	Njani, wayengazi.
I'm glad it isn't, you know, another house.	Ndiyavuya ukuba akunjalo, uyazi, enye indlu.
You can do this well.	Uyakwazi ukwenza oku kakuhle.
I can't walk.	Andikwazi ukuhamba.
Probably not at all.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo kwaphela.
No one too much.	Akukho mntu kakhulu.
No one wanted anything else.	Akukho mntu wayefuna enye into.
That, we will do it.	Oko, siza kuyenza.
But he is not there.	Kodwa akakho apho.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
I don't want to do it again.	Andifuni kuyenza kwakhona.
Did you know that.	Ubusazi ukuba.
He thought it was hard.	Wacinga ukuba nzima.
Do it now.	Ukwenza ngoku.
This is true.	Yinyani le.
But no one I know really likes it.	Kodwa akukho mntu ndiyazi ukuba uyayithanda ngokwenene.
And he abode there.	Wahlala ke apho.
In this regard.	Ngale ndlela.
It's hard here.	Kunzima apha.
But not for me.	Kodwa hayi kum.
I would do something like that.	Ndiya kwenza into enjalo.
he thought.	wacinga.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
I really do not believe.	Andikholelwa ngokwenene.
He said it was okay.	Wathi kulungile.
Lots of space.	Indawo eninzi.
I have made a beautiful house.	Ndenze indlu entle.
No one talks too much.	Akukho mntu uthetha kakhulu.
He did whatever he wanted.	Wenza nantoni na ayifunayo.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mhlawumbi yinto elungileyo.
That is very possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka kakhulu.
OK OK.	Kulungile, kulungile.
He did not stay.	Akazange ahlale.
I think that's fine now.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile ngoku.
But it is difficult.	Kodwa kunzima.
I think everyone knows it.	Ndicinga ukuba wonke umntu uyayazi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
He doesn't think about it.	Akacingi ngayo.
I'm sure you did.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba wenze njalo.
Nowhere.	Akukho ndawo .
Me, me, me.	Mna, mna, mna.
Or maybe not.	Okanye mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi nokuba uphi.
I know that.	Ndiyayazi loo nto.
Everyone started talking right away.	Wonke umntu waqalisa ukuthetha ngoko nangoko.
She didn't want to talk to him anymore.	Wayengafuni ukuthetha naye kwakhona.
He told me what it was.	Wandixelela ukuba yintoni na.
Tell me one more.	Ndixelele enye.
Why is there another.	Kutheni kukho enye.
Not now, but soon.	Hayi ngoku, kodwa kungekudala.
I don't think it will be so.	Andiqondi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
That's all.	Yonke loo nto.
We will do it.	Siza kuyenza.
Okay there.	Kulungile apho.
One has to do that clearly.	Umntu kufuneka enze loo nto ngokucacileyo.
Or like me.	Okanye njengam.
I need help with this.	Ndifuna uncedo kule.
Now it looks like he is coming.	Ngoku kubonakala ngathi uza kuza.
But no.	Kodwa hayi.
Down where we go.	Phantsi apho siya khona.
That, or money.	Oko, okanye imali.
We know it will be difficult.	Siyazi ukuba kuya kuba nzima.
Therefore.	Ngoko ke .
Sorry, but he does not want to.	Uxolo, kodwa akafuni.
So everyone.	Ngoko wonke umntu.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngokwenene.
I hope not.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
Not time or place.	Hayi ixesha okanye indawo.
Maybe we will.	Mhlawumbi siya kwenza njalo.
Sorry, maybe.	Uxolo, mhlawumbi.
Not so much, really.	Hayi kakhulu, ngokwenene.
I want to make a new way.	Ndifuna ukwenza indlela entsha.
How about it ?.	Njani ngayo?.
Something in it.	Enye into kuyo.
You do not think.	Awucingi.
It will also be much easier to make money.	Kwakhona kuya kuba lula kakhulu ukwenza imali.
I can't tell anyone.	Andikwazi ukuxelela mntu.
I'm not sure you did.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba uyenzile.
Absolutely! 	Ngokuqinisekileyo!
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
How? 	Njani?
Because this is really possible.	Kuba oku kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
This is clearly not the case.	Oku ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
You did the job.	Wenze umsebenzi.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma ngoko nangoko.
Is it okay ?.	Ngaba kulungile?.
Going once.	Ukuhamba kanye.
I have to do.	Kufuneka ndenze.
Tell me what happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
He didn't know then.	Wayengazi ngoko .
Obviously really.	Ngokucacileyo ngokwenene.
I know what will happen, in the end.	Ndiyazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni, ekugqibeleni.
Fast, fast, fast.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza.
Not a person.	Hayi umntu.
He will do that.	Uya kwenza oko.
It's better now.	Kungcono ngoku.
Or to be difficult.	Okanye ukuba nzima.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
I didn't want to do anything.	Ndandingafuni kwenza nto.
This is not for you.	Oku akukho kuwe.
Nobody loves money.	Akukho mntu uthanda imali.
So this had to happen.	Ngoko oku kwafuneka kwenzeke.
No! 	Hayi!
He would like to know everything.	Angathanda ukwazi yonke into.
He has done that now for her.	Wenze lonto ngoku kuye.
He did so.	Wenze njalo.
Everyone and everything.	Wonke umntu nayo yonke into.
Just work.	Umsebenzi nje.
He just did his job.	Wenza nje umsebenzi wakhe.
That's what happened here.	Nantso into eyenzekayo apha.
I do not want to talk to you.	Andifuni kuthetha nawe.
It's just that everything happened so fast.	Kuphela nje ukuba yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
You stay there, okay.	Uhlala apho, kulungile.
I want to stay.	Ndifuna ukuhlala.
Everyone does their own thing.	Wonke umntu wenza into yakhe.
Not all the way, just a little bit.	Hayi yonke indlela, nje kancinci.
He really did.	Uyenzile ngokwenene.
Everything is bad.	Yonke into embi.
But really not about us.	Kodwa ngokwenene akukho ngathi.
He knows the whole thing.	Uyayazi yonke loo nto.
You are that person.	Nguwe loo mntu.
I also knew why.	Ndandisazi nokuba kutheni.
There is another way.	Kukho enye indlela.
I think it is impossible.	Ndicinga ukuba akunakwenzeka.
But another problem for me.	Kodwa enye ingxaki yam.
Nice to see you.	Ndiyavuya ukubona.
If you do not want to leave, do not.	Ukuba awufuni ukuhamba, musa.
Too much for everything.	Kakhulu kakhulu kuyo yonke into.
I did, too.	Ndenze, kakhulu.
He too is doing well.	Naye wenza kakuhle.
Thus we have.	Ngaloo ndlela siye .
You know what that is.	Uyayazi ukuba yintoni leyo.
I'm really happy for him.	Ndiyavuya ngokwenene kuye.
I know him.	Ndiyamazi.
This will happen again.	Oku kuya kwenzeka kwakhona.
I hope so.	Ndiyathemba ukuba.
Everyone knows that place.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo ndawo.
It is impossible to do anything.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza nantoni na.
It is very difficult for me.	Kunzima kakhulu kum.
He was really thinking too much.	Wayecinga kakhulu ngenene.
Money, money, money.	Imali, imali, imali.
Why should he be something else ?.	Kutheni kufuneka abe enye into?.
This happened once.	Oku kwenzeka kanye.
To talk about it.	Ukuze athethe ngayo.
But he has to go.	Kodwa kufuneka ahambe.
I hope not.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
So he lives alone.	Ngoko uhlala yedwa.
He will want this for you.	Uya kufuna oku kuwe.
There is a car there.	Kukho imoto apho.
Man.	Umntu.
If it is true then it is true.	Ukuba yinyani ke yinyani.
So it is possible.	Ngoko kunokwenzeka.
I go to him.	Ndiya kuye.
Yeah, everything the same for me.	Ewe, yonke into enye kum.
True or false.	Yinyani okanye akunjalo.
No, nothing.	Hayi, akukho nto.
I'm afraid to speak.	Ndiyoyika ukuthetha.
So my man was not there.	Ngoko umntu wam wayengekho.
I would like to read that.	Ndingathanda ukufunda oko.
That is a fact no one wants to talk about.	Leyo yinyani akukho mntu ufuna ukuthetha ngayo.
I need help with everything.	Ndifuna uncedo ngayo yonke into.
Or is it.	Okanye ngaba .
Better than nothing either, though.	Kungcono kunokuba akukho nto mhlawumbi, kodwa.
I just don't want to.	Andifuni nje.
That's the place.	Nantso ke indawo.
To be .	Ukuba .
He looks old.	Ukhangeleka kudala.
Now, that would not be possible.	Ngoku, oko akunakwenzeka.
Very large house.	Indlu enkulu kakhulu.
No! 	Hayi!
Now we probably know more.	Ngoku mhlawumbi siyazi kakhulu.
So that's fine.	Ngoko kulungile.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
Not that he is.	Hayi ukuba nguye.
This is clear to see.	Oku kucacile ukubona.
It probably won't be long.	Mhlawumbi akuyi kuba ixesha elide.
And he looked.	Uye wajonga.
But man never thought of it, you know.	Kodwa umntu akazange acinge ngayo, uyazi.
I can't do this right now.	Andikwazi ukuyenza le nto ngoku.
I will talk to him.	Ndiza kuthetha naye.
Maybe something else happened.	Mhlawumbi kukho enye into eyenzekayo.
And he agreed.	Uye wavuma.
You did something wrong.	Wenze into embi ngayo.
.	.
What happens, everyone.	Kwenzeka ntoni, wonke umntu.
So not for long then.	Ngoko hayi ixesha elide ngoko.
What a great.	Yintoni enkulu.
He later told me.	Kamva undixelele.
We know how this happened.	Siyazi ukuba kwenzeka njani oku.
I'm not sure how.	Andazi ncam ukuba njani.
I knew what this would mean.	Ndandisazi ukuba kuya kuthetha ntoni oku.
But not this one.	Kodwa hayi le.
He has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe.
But not once.	Kodwa hayi kanye.
Great thing, something.	Into enkulu, into .
This is a long time coming.	Oku kudala kuza.
He will have to be.	Kuya kufuneka ukuba abe.
Maybe it happened to you now.	Mhlawumbi kwenzeka kuwe ngoku.
Not a good thing.	Hayi into entle.
I just want to win.	Ndifuna nje ukuphumelela.
He did not do so either.	Naye akazange enjenjalo.
Don't, please don't.	Musa, nceda musa.
But not for me.	Kodwa hayi kum.
Today if possible.	Namhlanje ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Anyone would like to be with him.	Nabani na angathanda ukuba naye.
You don't want to do that.	Awufuni ukuyenza loo nto.
He has to do well.	Kufuneka enze kakuhle.
Finding my place.	Ukufumana indawo yam.
I'm not really sure.	Andiqinisekanga ngenene.
I'm not sure at all.	Andiqinisekanga kwaphela.
It will always be difficult.	Kuya kuhlala kunzima.
Seeing anything.	Ukubona nantoni na.
He told me that last night.	Undixelele oko phezolo.
No, he wanted to know.	Hayi, wayefuna ukwazi.
You are not going anywhere.	Awuyi ndawo.
To do it.	Ukuyenza.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Set down.	Wahlala phantsi.
This is hard to do.	Oku kunzima ukwenza.
He did enough.	Wenza ngokwaneleyo.
It's my man.	Ngumntu wam.
You mean someone.	Uthetha umntu.
I will do that.	Ndiza kuyenza loo nto.
You did well.	Uyenze kakuhle.
There is that, too.	Kukho loo nto, nayo.
You are not visible.	Awubonakali.

You like it.	Uyayithanda.
Just, really really soon.	Nje, ngokwenene ngokwenene kungekudala.
I feel better.	Ndiziva ngcono.
He didn't know.	Wayengazi.
You know, really.	Uyazi, ngokwenene.
You probably know that.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba uyayazi loo nto.
So he said.	Ngoko uthe.
it will not be.	akuyi kuba njalo.
Not outside.	Akukho ngaphandle.
That's a bad thing.	Yinto embi leyo.
He knew her too.	Wayesazi naye.
He can't get a job.	Akakwazi ukufumana umsebenzi.
Problem at work.	Ingxaki emsebenzini.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
One thing.	Into enye.
You will know it soon.	Uya kukwazi ngokukhawuleza.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
And he agreed.	Uye wavuma wavuma.
I know better.	Ndiyazi ngcono.
I thought you wanted to go with me.	Ndandicinga ukuba ufuna ukuhamba nam.
But that's all.	Kodwa yiloo nto kuphela.
I thought it would be different.	Ndandicinga ukuba kuya kuba ngenye indlela.
He wanted to swim.	Wayefuna ukuqubha.
Food becomes easier.	Ukutya kuba lula.
It only happens once.	Kwenzeka kanye kuphela.
There is always something.	Kuhlala kukho into.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
I want to eat.	Ndifuna ukutya.
We will do just that.	Siya kuyenza loo nto kanye.
So there is no problem with that.	Ngoko ke akukho ngxaki ngaloo nto.
I couldn't talk about it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuthetha ngayo.
But maybe not.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Why this should be the case, no one knows.	Kutheni le nto kufuneka kube njalo, akukho mntu uyazi.
Just to see.	Ukubona nje.
I will be with you.	Ndiza kuba nawe.
Maybe later, someday.	Mhlawumbi kamva, ngenye imini.
He just didn't know.	Wayengazi nje.
But no one thinks about that anymore.	Kodwa akukho mntu ucinga ngaloo nto kwakhona.
Not you.	Hayi nawe.
and, and, and.	kunye, kunye, kunye.
I'll talk to you later.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kamva.

I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
There is something to do.	Kukho into yokwenza.
He never did.	Akazange enjenjalo.
Everyone wants to help everyone out.	Wonke umntu ufuna ukunceda wonke umntu ngaphandle.
It's my thing.	Yinto yam.
Or maybe to me.	Okanye mhlawumbi kum.
He felt bad about it.	Waziva kakubi ngayo.
No it isn't.	Hayi, akunjalo.
But, not always.	Kodwa, hayi rhoqo.
I can not speak.	Andikwazi ukuthetha.
Everyone loves it.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda.
I do not know how.	Andazi ukuba njani.
Everyone loves it.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda.
He may not be here.	Usenokuba akakho apha.
We will definitely do this.	Ngokwenene siza kuyenza le nto.
This is perfectly fine.	Oku kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
Or maybe this is me.	Okanye mhlawumbi ndim lo.
New.	Entsha.
This would be, of course, impossible.	Oku kuya kuba, ke, akunakwenzeka.
I'm not sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
I don't really want to.	Andifuni ngokwenene.
He did a good thing, too.	Wenza into entle, naye.
I'll just say it.	Ndiza kuthetha nje.
What a fuck.	Yintoni loo nto.
He later apologized.	Kamva wacela uxolo.
That can be so.	Oko kunokuba njalo.
I can't stay.	Andikwazi ukuhlala.
He finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni wavuma.
This will not end tomorrow.	Oku akuyi kuphela ngomso.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
He might not have said anything, you know.	Usenokuba akazange athethe nto, uyazi.
I'm going to have to think of something.	Kuya kufuneka ndicinge into.
I know he doesn't know.	Ndiyamazi ukuba akazi.
Not that he doesn't want to go.	Hayi ukuba akafuni ukuya.
I will do it next week.	Ndiza kuyenza kwiveki ezayo.
.	.
So that's a good thing.	Ngoko ke yinto entle leyo.
No, not just you, but.	Hayi, hayi wena kanye, kodwa .
It means he did not.	Kuthetha ukuba akazange.
How hard it is for him.	Kunzima kangakanani kuye.
You would not even know why.	Ubungazi nokuba kutheni.
Maybe for a long time.	Mhlawumbi ixesha elide.
But he went there.	Kodwa waya khona .
You will not end.	Awuyi kuphela.
He did not speak immediately.	Khange athethe ngoko nangoko.
He can do that.	Angayenza loo nto.
That's his man.	Ngumntu wakhe lowo.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
He did not know where he was.	Wayengazi ukuba uphi.
He wants to talk to you.	Ufuna ukuthetha nawe.
He finally agreed.	Ekugqibeleni wavuma.
But he knew.	Kodwa wayesazi.
Even if you don't want to.	Nokuba awufuni.
But it's okay.	Kodwa kulungile.
We should have done better.	Bekufanele ukuba senze ngcono.
I knew nothing, or anyone.	Ndandingazi nto, okanye nabani na.
We know he is.	Siyazi ukuba nguye.
He will do it tomorrow.	Uza kuyenza ngomso.
Not then or later.	Hayi ngoko okanye kamva.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi.
Will you do it?	Ngaba uya kuyenza?
he asked.	wabuza.
I'm not sure why.	Andazi ncam ukuba kutheni.
It's better for him.	Kungcono kuye.
This is not mandatory.	Oku akunyanzelekanga.
It is better, perhaps, to.	Kungcono, mhlawumbi, ukuba .
Maybe someone will be you.	Mhlawumbi umntu uya kuba nguwe.
There is no future for it.	Akukho kamva kuyo.
I've never been here before.	Andizange ndiye apha ngaphambili.
He didn't want any more.	Akazange afune ngakumbi.
Now where did you go.	Ngoku uye phi.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
It is not easy.	Akukho lula ncam.
We know it is possible.	Siyazi ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Or so you think.	Okanye ucinga njalo.
This is not really the case.	Oku akunjalo ngokwenene.

Everyone wanted to stay.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukuhlala.
Being alone with him.	Ukuba naye yedwa.
He asked what the problem was.	Wabuza ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
I have never told anyone before.	Zange ndixelele mntu ngaphambili.
It was not necessary at all.	Kwakungeyomfuneko kwaphela.
He never stopped and never went to her.	Zange ayeke khange aye kuye.
I don't really want to talk about it.	Andifuni nyani ukuthetha ngayo.
I'm not sure about this.	Andiqinisekanga ngale nto.
It is impossible to make a decision.	Akunakwenzeka ukwenza isigqibo.
Just doing it.	Ukwenza nje.
He has done it now.	Uyenzile ngoku.
I thought you did very well.	Bendicinga ukuba wenze kakuhle kakhulu.
That's all you have to do.	Yiloo nto kuphela ekufuneka uyenzile.
Tell me about it.	Ndixelele ngale nto.
Nobody wants it to happen.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuba kwenzeke.
He didn't want me to know that.	Wayengafuni ukuba ndiyazi loo nto.
We know how.	Siyazi ukuba njani.
There is only one.	Kukho kuphela.
I think so.	Ndicinga ukuba njalo.
There is nothing in it.	Akukho nto kuyo.
He just wasn't there.	Wayengekho nje.
Yes, indeed.	Ewe, ngokwenene.
That is possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka.
He knew it would be so.	Wayesazi ukuba kuya kuba njalo.
But you stay, if possible.	Kodwa uhlala, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
He will stay with us.	Uya kuhlala nathi.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni.
He was thinking the other way.	Wayecinga ngenye indlela.
What the hell .	Yintoni .
Certainly not for me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi kum.
Or a dog.	Okanye inja.
Like all of us.	Ngathi sonke.
We did it with him.	Senze naye.
I thought that was possible.	Ndandicinga ukuba oko kunokwenzeka.
Tell me now what happened.	Ndixelele ngoku ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na.
He admitted that he needed help.	Wavuma ukuba ufuna uncedo.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
So it will certainly be.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kuba njalo.
Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacinga.
I didn't think of anything.	Khange ndicinge nto.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
But it is not that simple.	Kodwa akukho lula kangako.
He was not too far away.	Wayengekho kude kakhulu.
It is very difficult to tell.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuxelela.
I did not think.	Khange ndicinge.
I'm coming forward again.	Ndiza ngaphambili kwakhona.
To do something.	Ukwenza into.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke loo nto.
But, it is not.	Kodwa, akunjalo.
But, that is not the case here.	Kodwa, akunjalo apha.
Only, of course, what he knew.	Kuphela, ngokuqinisekileyo, oko wayesazi.
He is not very much.	Akakho kakhulu.
He knew now.	Wayesazi ngoku.
Yes, that's right.	Ewe, yinyani leyo.
No, it is not.	Hayi, akuyomfuneko.
Yes, it could, but not today.	Ewe, ngokuqinisekileyo kunokuba njalo, kodwa hayi namhlanje.
Later this week now.	Kamva kule veki ngoku.
He just did it very, very well.	Wenza nje kakhulu, kakuhle kakhulu.
He must succeed.	Kufuneka aphumelele.
Being a great reality.	Ukuba yinyani enkulu.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze nto.
It never happened to me.	Zange yenzeke kum.
I want to do something, but I don't know what it is.	Ndifuna ukwenza into, kodwa andazi ukuba yintoni.
no no.	hayi hayi.
Yeah, now I know.	Ewe, ngoku ndiyazi.
I don't know how he lives with you.	Andazi ukuba uhlala njani nawe.
If there is such a thing.	Ukuba kukho into enjalo.
Man lives alone, something like that.	Umntu uhlala yedwa, into enjalo.
Now, away from you.	Ngoku, kude nawe.
The police just want to know about it.	Amapolisa afuna nje ukwazi ngayo.
You are the only one for me.	Nguwe wedwa kum.
I don't like this about me.	Andiyithandi le nto kum.
He thought quickly.	Wacinga ngokukhawuleza.
He thought about it a lot.	Wacinga ngaloo nto kakhulu.
But rather.	Kodwa kungcono.
As you should know.	Njengoko kufuneka uyazi.
It's all the same thing.	Yinto enye yonke.
So the work has done well.	Ngoko umsebenzi wenze kakuhle.
I had no idea what was going to happen.	Ndandingazi ukuba kuza kwenzeka ntoni.
I'm not sure about this.	Andiqinisekanga ngale nto.
Maybe he would talk.	Mhlawumbi wayeza kuthetha.
What is that.	Yintoni leyo.
He wanted to talk.	Wayefuna ukuthetha.
He will do it again.	Uya kuphinda.
Or anyone, really.	Okanye nabani na, ngokwenene.
Now it will be easier.	Ngoku kuya kuba lula.
I don't want to stay here.	Andifuni ukuhlala apha.
But he never spoke to me.	Kodwa akazange athethe nam.
You deserve to get it.	Ufanele ukufumana.
But not so with me.	Kodwa akunjalo kum.
Well, very much so.	Kulungile, kakhulu.
Maybe for you.	Mhlawumbi kuwe.
It will be hard to find.	Kuya kuba nzima ukufumana.
Where you want it.	Apho ufuna khona.
Tell anyone anything.	Xelela nabani na nantoni na.
I want to go win.	Ndifuna ukuya ukuphumelela.
Yes this is more difficult.	Ewe oku kunzima ngakumbi.
But you already know it all.	Kodwa sele uyazi yonke loo nto.
He stayed then.	Wahlala ke.
I hope it is true.	Ndiyathemba ukuba yinyani.
But it will happen.	Kodwa kuya kwenzeka.
All right.	Kulungile.
I'd like to talk to you about it.	Ndingathanda ukuthetha nawe ngayo.
No, he thought.	Hayi, wacinga.
I'm not sure what it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni.
Clearly, she wanted to talk to him.	Kucacile ukuba wayefuna ukuthetha naye.
He did not know what this was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni le.
It's even harder.	Kunzima ngakumbi.
To make it easier to find.	Ukwenza kube lula ukufumana.
What are you doing right here.	Wenza ntoni kanye apha.
She is not here now.	Akakho ngoku.
He did not say anything immediately.	Akazange athethe nto ngoko nangoko.
I'm sure of that.	Ndiqinisekile ngaloo nto.
He wanted to know now.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngoku.
What he wants.	Yintoni ayifunayo.
He started saying something.	Waqalisa ukuthetha into.
.	.
It will be very difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
If possible.	Ukuba kunokwenzeka.
Here is the book.	Nantso ke le ncwadi.
It seems possible.	Kubonakala ngathi kunokwenzeka.
He became one.	Waba yiyo.
You're sure of that.	Uqinisekile ngaloo nto.
But it is also impossible.	Kodwa kwakhona akunakwenzeka.
But it certainly is not.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
But he is a person.	Kodwa ungumntu.
I never thought much of it.	Andizange ndicinge kakhulu ngayo.
You know your person well.	Wazi kakuhle umntu wakho.
There is no such person.	Akakho loo mntu.
I do not know how.	Andazi indlela.
No, otherwise.	Hayi, ngenye indlela.

Slow but smooth.	Ukuhamba kancinci kodwa kakuhle.
He wants money today.	Ufuna imali namhlanje.
Not so with him.	Naye akunjalo.
But today is better.	Kodwa namhlanje kungcono.

You just have to do it.	Kufuneka uyenze nje.
I'm trying to stay there.	Ndizama ukuhlala apho.

Maybe it is me.	Mhlawumbi ndim.
But we did well.	Kodwa senze kakuhle.
You talk to me tomorrow.	Uthetha nam kusasa.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
Not to him.	Hayi kuye.
I will not be.	Andiyi kuba.
Maybe true, maybe not.	Mhlawumbi yinyani, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
Outside there is none.	Ngaphandle akukho.
The only way.	Indlela kuphela.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi kancinci.
Getting there, is exactly what he wants.	Ukufumana apho, kanye le nto ayifunayo.
Yes, one wants money.	Ewe, umntu ufuna imali.
But it is not easy.	Kodwa akukho lula.
He is here to do his work.	Ulapha ukwenza umsebenzi wakhe.
No one lives that long.	Akukho mntu uhlala ixesha elide kangako.
I will do it again.	Ndiza kuyenza kwakhona.

He also did not speak.	Naye akazange athethe.
I want to know where it is.	Ndifuna ukwazi ukuba iphi.

I know now.	Ndiyazi ngoku.
He never did.	Akazange ayenze.
But if it's true, if it's true.	Kodwa ukuba yinyani, ukuba yinyani .

He doesn't know that.	Akayazi loo nto.
Really, that's it.	Ngokwenene, yiloo nto.
But more.	Kodwa ngakumbi.
I never knew that.	Andizange ndiyazi loo nto.

But now you know that.	Kodwa ngoku sele uyazi ukuba.
He really wanted me.	Wayefuna kakhulu kum.
I need to talk to him.	Kufuneka ndithethe naye.
He may well have done so.	Kusenokwenzeka ukuba wakwenza oko.
Here, it is not.	Apha, akunjalo.
I'm not sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto.
He began to study it.	Waqalisa ukufunda kuyo.

Not for long.	Hayi ixesha elide.
I want to see something.	Ndifuna ukubona into.
I never talked about it.	Zange ndithethe ngayo.
Yes, that's it.	Ewe, nguye lowo.
The more, the better.	Kakhulu, ngcono kakhulu.
Now he knew everyone.	Ngoku wayesazi wonke umntu.
You need to know this.	Kufuneka uyazi oku.
He did so.	Wenze njalo.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
This is not necessary at all.	Oku akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
This is not possible.	Akunakwenzeka oku.
I will do it.	Ndiza kuyenza.
I never did that.	Andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
Even if it seems difficult.	Nokuba kubonakala kunzima.
We will talk to him.	Siza kuthetha naye.
Not at all.	Akukho kwaphela.
I have never been able to do that before.	Andizange ndikwazi ukuyenza loo nto ngaphambili.
He didn't want to do that.	Wayengafuni ukuyenza loo nto.
I think that's fine.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile.
If that's right.	Ukuba oko kulungile.
Where are you? 	Uphi?
he asked.	wabuza.
Or for now.	Okanye okwangoku.
Or the other way around.	Okanye enye indlela.
Of course he did not know.	Ewe wayengazi.
He is a very good man.	Ungumntu olungileyo kakhulu.
But he did not.	Kodwa akazange enjenjalo.
He was not good at it.	Wayengekho kakuhle kuyo.
This is a good thing.	Yinto entle le.
You talk about that a lot.	Uthetha ngaloo nto kakhulu.
Not at all.	Akunjalo kwaphela.
If you will stay.	Ukuba uya kuhlala.
This is probably long enough.	Oku mhlawumbi ixesha elide ngokwaneleyo.
Work has to do the same thing.	Umsebenzi kufuneka wenze into enye.
Someone said something, whatever.	Umntu athethe into, nantoni na.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbi kakhulu.
Today he has apologized.	Namhlanje uye wacela uxolo.
But a little bit.	Kodwa kancinci.
Then tomorrow.	Khona ngomso .
He did not appear.	Akazange abonakale.
I don’t know why, really.	Andazi ukuba kutheni, ngokwenene.
Please make it easier.	Nceda ukuhamba kube lula.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
I could not.	Andizange ndikwazi.
But in my own way.	Kodwa ngendlela yam.
You just have to be able to do it.	Kufuneka nje ukwazi ukwenza.
She would like this.	Angathanda oku.
That is it.	Yiyo lento.
I do not know what this is.	Andazi ukuba yintoni le.
Everyone speaks well.	Wonke umntu uthetha kakuhle.
Maybe that ??? 	Mhlawumbi loo nto???
I think this is good.	Ndicinga ukuba oku kulungile.
Now, not later.	Ngoku, hayi kamva.
You know that well.	Uyazi kakuhle loo nto.
He wanted to leave, but.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, kodwa .
She sits down.	Uhlala phantsi.
So maybe you should have talked to him.	Ngoko mhlawumbi bekufanele ukuba uthetha naye.
We both go to it.	Sobabini siya kuyo.
He tried to speak but could not.	Wazama ukuthetha kodwa akakwazi.
I don't know what that means.	Andazi ukuba oko kuthetha ntoni na.
But it will happen in the end.	Kodwa kuya kwenzeka ekugqibeleni.
Maybe okay.	Mhlawumbi kulungile.
I can not.	Andikwazi.
I want to know, too.	Ndifuna ukwazi, nam.
Maybe in a week.	Mhlawumbi kwiveki.
Is this possible.	Ngaba oku kunokwenzeka.
Now or.	Ngoku okanye.
Not here, in this place.	Hayi apha, kule ndawo.
There is only one thing.	Kukho into kuphela.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi kancinci.
It is difficult, but possible.	Kunzima, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
Therefore, it will not happen.	Ngoko ke, akuyi kwenzeka.
It is difficult, but not impossible.	Kunzima, kodwa akunakwenzeka.
No one was going to say or do anything.	Akukho mntu wayeza kuthetha okanye enze nantoni na.
I really want to get that.	Ndifuna ngokwenene ukufumana oko.
Everything the same now.	Yonke into enye ngoku.
But not for you.	Kodwa hayi kuwe.
There is nothing here, nothing.	Akukho nto apha, akukho nto.
He had to speak.	Kwafuneka athethe.
So maybe.	Ngoko mhlawumbi.
One for you.	Enye kuwe.
No problem.	Akukho nto ingxaki.
It is very difficult for him.	Kunzima kakhulu kuye.
He sits down quickly.	Uhlala phantsi ngokukhawuleza.
I think he had to do that.	Ndicinga ukuba kwafuneka enjenjalo.
There is just again.	Kukho kwakhona nje.
As you talk about.	Njengoko uthetha ngayo.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akunjalo.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
Ok then .	Kulungile ke .
Help someone else.	Nceda omnye umntu.
That will definitely make the job easier.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oko kuya kwenza umsebenzi ube lula.
He did not say anything, but he did anything.	Akazange athethe nantoni na, kodwa enze nantoni na.
I said nothing.	Khange ndithethe nto.
He would be a good man.	Wayeza kuba ngumntu olungileyo.
Being away for a long time.	Ukuba kude ixesha elide.
Probably too soon.	Mhlawumbi ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
But he would never do such a thing.	Kodwa akanakuze enze into enjalo.
Not alone.	Hayi yedwa.
I will do everything as it should.	Ndiya kwenza yonke into njengoko kufuneka.
It’s hard to know anything for sure.	Kunzima ukwazi nantoni na ngokuqinisekileyo.
Only you.	Nguwe kuphela.
I feel that way every morning.	Ndiziva njalo kusasa.
It finally happened.	Ekugqibeleni kwenzeka.
Too fast to do something.	Ngokukhawuleza kakhulu ukwenza into.
Maybe you did really well at it.	Mhlawumbi wenze kakuhle ngenene kuyo.
It's such a thing.	Yinto enjalo.
This happened yesterday.	Oku kwenzeke izolo.
However.	Kodwa ke.
There is a big problem there.	Kukho ingxaki enkulu apho.
Yes it is.	Ewe yiyo.
Or whatever.	Okanye nokuba yintoni na.
Walking fast is hard to see.	Ukuhamba ngokukhawuleza kunzima ukubona.
But, for me.	Kodwa, kum.
He would come to her.	Wayeza kuza kuye.
It's too far away for you.	Kude kakhulu kuwe.
Going to work.	Ukuya emsebenzini.
He talks more.	Uthetha ngakumbi.
No, that's a big deal.	Hayi, yinto enkulu kakhulu.
There is nothing in it.	Akukho nto kuyo.
I'm scared of everything.	Ndiyoyika yonke into.
I’m not sure he was wondering who would do that.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba wayecinga ukuba ngubani oza kuyenza loo nto.
He can just do it.	Angayenza nje .
I just don't know.	Andazi nje.
You will not go.	Awuyi kuya.
You did a good thing.	Wenze into entle.
He was clearly thinking.	Wayecinga ngokucacileyo.
When are you coming.	Uya nini.
You look great.	Ukhangeleka kakhulu.
Certainly not me.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andizange.
it is impossible.	akunakwenzeka.
Very, very, very scared.	Kakhulu, kakhulu, ndiyoyika kakhulu.
No, at home.	Akunjalo, ekhaya.
This is good enough.	Oku kulungile ngokwaneleyo.
Everyone knew the other.	Wonke umntu wayesazi omnye.
I know you are just a person.	Ndiyazi ukuba ungumntu nje.
Maybe in a week.	Mhlawumbi kwiveki.
I'm sure it's okay.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba kulungile.
But really.	Kodwa ngokwenene.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
He did not want to leave.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba.
I'll talk to you.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe.
so do i.	nam.
He understood something immediately.	Waqonda into ngoko nangoko.
That's the place.	Nantso indawo.
That's the way it is.	Yiloo ndlela.
Or a place.	Okanye indawo.
No, everyone does that.	Hayi, wonke umntu wenza njalo.
But he is not there now.	Kodwa akakho ngoku.
Can someone ask for help here.	Ngaba umntu ndicela uncedo apha.
He realized it wasn't him.	Waqonda ukuba ayinguye.
Man, you have to know all that.	Mntu, kufuneka uyazi yonke loo nto.
I want to be here.	Ndifuna ukuba lapha.
No one deserves that.	Akukho mntu ufanele ukuba oko.
You really want to.	Ufuna ngokwenene.
But it is not alone.	Kodwa akunjalo yedwa.
I do not want her to leave.	Andifuni ahambe.
She has understood.	Uye waqonda.
he thought.	wacinga.
He wanted to be alone with her.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa kunye naye.
He thought he was looking for a job.	Wayecinga ukuba ufuna umsebenzi.
We know for sure now.	Siyazi ngokuqinisekileyo ngoku.
I think about this tonight.	Ndicinga ngale nto ebusuku.
She goes home every night.	Uya ekhaya rhoqo ebusuku.
You need to know.	Kufuneka wazi.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
But we know he did.	Kodwa siyazi ukuba uyenzile.
He thinks he can do it.	Ucinga ukuba angayenza loo nto.
You should know.	Ufanele ukwazi.
But now there is a house.	Kodwa ngoku kukho indlu.
He stayed there for a long, long time.	Wahlala apho ixesha elide, elide.
Or now he was thinking.	Okanye ngoku wayecinga.
So, you know.	Ngoko, uyazi.
I'm not sure about that, yet.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto, okwangoku.
He looked here at me.	Wajonga apha kum.
Have you ever thought.	Ngaba ukhe wacinga .
I'm not sure we will.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba siya kufuna.
He is doing everything now.	Wenza yonke into ngoku.
It will not be easy.	Akuyi kuba lula.
He has done all this.	Uyenzile yonke le nto.
This is a big deal.	Le yinto enkulu.
So he told the police.	Ngoko waxelela amapolisa.
Or nothing.	Okanye akukho nto.
Everyone did not want to say anything to him.	Wonke umntu wayengafuni ukuthetha nantoni na kuye.
This will be clearly seen.	Oku kuya kubonakala ngokucacileyo.
He appeared.	Wabonakala.
What money.	Yintoni imali.
He just didn't know.	Wayengazi nje.
I can do this.	Ndingayenza le nto.
He told me right away.	Undixelele kwangoko.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
This is something completely new to me.	Le yinto entsha ngokupheleleyo kum.
Obviously not.	Ngokucacileyo akazange enjenjalo.
It's okay for him to do it.	Kulungile ukuba ayenze.
No one is doing the right thing again.	Akukho mntu wenza into elungileyo kwakhona.
There is no way one wants to go.	Akukho ndlela umntu afuna ukuhamba ngayo.
One day maybe but not now.	Ngenye imini mhlawumbi kodwa hayi ngoku.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa oku akunjalo.
Because that's exactly what it is.	Kuba yiloo nto kanye.
Or if something else happens to you.	Okanye ukuba kukho enye into eyenzekayo kuwe.
He did not want to go there at all.	Wayengafuni ukuya apho kwaphela.
What's happening.	Kwenzeka ntoni.
I can't go home.	Andikwazi ukuya ekhaya.
He too did not want to do anything.	Naye wayengafuni kwenza nto.
We have both gone.	Siye sobabini.
It seems like yesterday.	Kubonakala ngathi izolo.
I did not speak.	Khange ndithethe.
No one is talking to her.	Akukho mntu uthetha naye.
He thought that anything could happen to him.	Wacinga ukuba kunokwenzeka nantoni na kuye.
By all means.	Ngayo yonke indlela.
I think you like that.	Ndicinga ukuba uyayithanda loo nto.
Why does he have to stay so long? 	Kutheni kufuneka ahlale ixesha elide kangaka?
A little more.	Kancinci ngakumbi.
This is a person.	Lo ngumntu.
Going through everything.	Ukuhamba kuyo yonke into.
No one can be.	Akukho mntu unokuba .
Or maybe the other way around.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngenye indlela.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akazange enjenjalo.
Someone was coming.	Umntu wayeza kuza.
He did not really tell the truth.	Khange athethe nyani.
I don't know anyone there.	Andazi mntu apho.
He just lives here.	Uhlala nje apha.
It will be very difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
It should be easy to do, but it is not.	Kufuneka kube lula ukwenza, kodwa akunjalo.
But he did not have to do anything about it.	Kodwa kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze nto ngaloo nto.
You will need money.	Uya kufuna imali.
He knows he has to be much better.	Uyazi ukuba kufuneka abe ngcono kakhulu.
He asked what it was.	Wabuza ukuba yintoni na.
I know you completely.	Ndikwazi ngokupheleleyo.
Well, that's up to now.	Ewe, oko kude kube ngoku.
He is the one who has to make the decision.	Nguye ekufuneka enze isigqibo.
I have to do this.	Kufuneka ndiyenze le nto.
Maybe someone there will know.	Mhlawumbi umntu apho uya kukwazi.
That's a very good thing.	Yinto entle kakhulu.
If he only knew.	Ukuba wayesazi.
Everyone knows that.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto.
But something happened.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo.
Just seeing what he wants.	Ukubona nje into ayifunayo.
I know about you now.	Ndiyazi ngawe ngoku.
So to me.	Ngoko ke kum.
I know the place.	Ndiyayazi indawo.
He did this.	Uyenzile le nto.
I think you just need time.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna nje ixesha.
You have to do something.	Kufuneka wenze into.
I'm not sure now what happened to it.	Andiqinisekanga ngoku ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kuyo.
It will not be easy.	Akuyi kuba lula.
Whatever.	Nokuba yintoni na.
Nobody has to do that.	Akukho mntu kufuneka enze loo nto.
I would like to know.	Ndingathanda ukwazi .
Like me.	Njengam.
He will be one day.	Uya kuba njalo ngenye imini.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
But nobody did that.	Kodwa akukho mntu wakwenza oko.
.	.
You obviously want to help.	Ngokucacileyo ufuna ukunceda.
That is exactly what is happening here.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo apha.
If possible, please.	Xa kunokwenzeka, nceda.
Or he tried.	Okanye wazama.
Yes, that's me.	Ewe, ndim lowo.
No problem here.	Akukho ngxaki apha.
You probably know exactly what it is.	Usenokuba uyazi kakuhle ukuba yintoni na.
You should know that.	Ufanele ukwazi oko.
This is difficult.	Oku kunzima.
It's hard to do.	Kunzima ukwenza.
He did not want to eat.	Wayengafuni ukutya.
Or is that what it is.	Okanye yiloo nto ke le.
I think that’s okay if it’s okay.	Ndicinga ukuba kulungile ukuba kulungile.
So, maybe not.	Ngoko, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He looked down.	Wajonga phantsi.
I need to know now.	Kufuneka ndiyazi ngoku.
Sounds good to me.	Kubonakala kulungile kum.
I do not know where you live.	Andikwazi apho uhlala khona.
He wanted to see.	Wayefuna ukubona .
Most of the time.	Ixesha elininzi.
He had to talk to her for a long time.	Kwafuneka athethe naye ixesha elide.
That's it.	Yiloo nto.
He didn't know there.	Wayengazi apho.
He sat down with her.	Wahlala phantsi naye.
I was thinking of something else.	Bendicinga enye into.
I will not be alone.	Andiyi kuba ndedwa.
No, very quickly.	Hayi, ngokukhawuleza kakhulu.
What else? 	Yintoni enye?
Very much.	Kakhulu kakhulu.
At last.	Ekugqibeleni.
Yes, he did.	Ewe, waqonda.
This will do well.	Oku kuya kwenza kakuhle.
He had to do it again.	Kwafuneka ayenze kwakhona.
He did not have to.	Kwakungeyomfuneko ukuba enze njalo.
Yeah, you know.	Ewe, uyazi.
He wanted to.	Wayefuna.
This will be the case.	Oku kuya kuba njalo.
He does the work with it.	Wenza umsebenzi ngayo.
I really need help.	Ndifuna ngokwenene uncedo.
I only want one thing.	Ndifuna into enye kuphela.
He really did not know.	Ngokwenene wayengazi.
He will or will not come.	Uya kuza okanye akayi kuza.
It is not easy to succeed.	Akukho lula ukuphumelela.
She goes to work.	Uya emsebenzini.
He is not here.	Akakho apha.
He will be there tomorrow.	Uzakuba khona ngomso.
Everything the same.	Yonke into enye.
Making a decision becomes difficult or impossible.	Ukwenza isigqibo kuba nzima okanye akunakwenzeka.
That's what happened.	Yiloo nto eyenzekayo.
Apparently not much.	Kubonakala ukuba akukho kakhulu.
There is help.	Kukho uncedo.
Really great thing.	Into enkulu ngokwenene.
No, far from it.	Akunjalo, kude kuyo.
That's it now.	Nto leyo ngoku.
You knew it was going to happen.	Ubusazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka.
Everyone loves something like that.	Wonke umntu uyayithanda into enjalo.
Making it harder to walk.	Ukwenza kube nzima ukuhamba.
He did not want to.	Wayengafuni.
Or he never stopped.	Okanye akazange ayeke.
Eventually he had to say something.	Ekugqibeleni kwafuneka athethe into.
I will not go there.	Andiyi kuya apho.
As he does.	Njengoko esenza.
Is that true? 	Ngaba yinyani leyo?
That is exactly what happened.	Yiloo nto kanye eyenzekayo.
This is just hard.	Oku kunzima nje.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku akunjalo.
That seems better to me.	Oko kubonakala kungcono kum.
Obviously no one feels like buying today.	Ngokucacileyo akukho mntu uziva efuna ukuthenga namhlanje.
For if he is not.	Kuba ukuba akakho .
Here not too much.	Apha hayi kakhulu.
He wanted to talk.	Wayefuna ukuthetha.
But later you will want to talk to him.	Kodwa kamva uya kufuna ukuthetha naye.
I'm glad you're here too.	Ndiyavuya ulapha nawe.
He did his job.	Wenza umsebenzi wakhe.
he stayed with you.	wahlala nawe.
He did whatever he wanted to do.	Wenza nantoni na afuna ukuyenza.
he asked.	wabuza.
But it was not so long ago.	Kodwa zange kube kudala kangaka.
But he only looked down.	Kodwa wajonga phantsi kuphela.
That's what happened.	Yinto eyenzekayo.
It's a thing to do, one thing.	Yinto yokwenza, into enye.
Sorry, I'm not sure.	Uxolo, andiqinisekanga.
For me, it's better.	Kum, kungcono.
But you look confident, now.	Kodwa ubonakala uqinisekile, ngoku.
This is not the case.	Oku akunjalo.
If so how ?.	Ukuba ewe njani?.
He must be with us.	Ufanele abe nathi.
Thus reading.	Ngaloo ndlela ukufunda.
We will do that.	Siza kuyenza loo nto.
I made it impossible.	Ndenze ukuba akunakwenzeka.
Maybe next week.	Mhlawumbi kwiveki ezayo.
I doubt it though.	Ndiyathandabuza kodwa.
I didn't really know him.	Khange ndikwazi ncam kuye.
But it is not necessary.	Kodwa akuyomfuneko.
But enough to say.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo ukuthetha.
I know exactly why.	Ndiyazi kakuhle ukuba kutheni.
Or is it.	Okanye ngaba.
So surely he would come.	Ngoko ngokuqinisekileyo wayeza kuza.
Yes he told me.	Ewe wandixelela .
You will get better.	Uzakuba ngcono.
But he was not.	Kodwa wayengekho.
He knows what he wants to do.	Uyayazi into afuna ukuyenza.
We need to do better.	Kufuneka senze ngcono.
I do not know you.	Andikwazi wena.
Well, that's what happened.	Ewe, nantso into eyenzekayo.
Very good performance.	Ukwenza kakuhle kakhulu.
Not that he wanted to.	Akunjalo ukuba wayefuna.
But, for now.	Kodwa, okwangoku.
It is very difficult to do.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
If not, tomorrow.	Ukuba akunjalo, ngomso.
I know you are here at home with us.	Ndiyazi ukuba ulapha ekhaya kunye nathi.
I'm afraid you did.	Ndiyoyika ukuba wenze njalo.
I know about it.	Ndiyazi ngayo.
I'm not sure at all.	Andiqinisekanga kwaphela.
He doesn't want you to know.	Akafuni ukuba wazi.
Anyone can do that.	Nabani na angayenza loo nto.
I would probably buy it again.	Ndingathanda mhlawumbi ukuthenga kwakhona.
I could just do that.	Ndingayenza nje loo nto.
Sure, it happened.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, kwenzeka.
You probably did not know.	Umele ukuba ubungazi.
It's hard.	Kunzima.
He obviously needed help.	Ngokucacileyo wayefuna uncedo.
That happened to me.	Oko kwenzeka kum.
It has to be okay.	Kufuneka kulungile.
I knew one thing.	Ndandisazi into enye.
I need help.	Ndicela uncedo.
I don't know how to do this.	Andazi ndingayenza njani lento.
You want to know what it is.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuba yintoni na.
He knew he had to leave immediately.	Wayesazi ukuba kufuneka ahambe ngokukhawuleza.
Very nice place.	Indawo entle kakhulu.
But in the end, he could not.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni, akazange akwazi.
He lives with us now.	Uhlala nathi ngoku.
Nothing at all.	Akukho nto kwaphela.
One does very well.	Omnye wenza kakuhle kakhulu.
I never thought where he was.	Khange ndicinge ukuba uphi.
Also, do not do this.	Kwakhona, musa ukuyenza le nto.
So don't dwell on that.	Ngoko musa ukuhlala ucinga ngaloo nto.
I'm sorry.	Ndicela uxolo.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
Not for me.	Akukho kum.
I did well.	Ndenze kakuhle.
I'm sure of it.	Ndiqinisekile ngayo.
Okay, but it could be better.	Kulungile, kodwa kunokuba ngcono.
But enough.	Kodwa ngokwaneleyo.
I'm not sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngaloo nto.
Does anyone know how to do that.	Ngaba nabani na uyazi indlela yokwenza oko.
It is all or nothing.	Yinto yonke okanye akukho nto.
I don't know why.	Andazi ukuba kutheni.
It is.	Yinto .
We'll just be here.	Siza kuba lapha nje.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Lixesha lokuba wenze oku.
Food is very difficult.	Ukutya kunzima kakhulu.
to play.	ukudlala.
No more.	Hayi kwakhona.
Very nice place, too.	Indawo entle kakhulu, nayo.
But maybe not more.	Kodwa mhlawumbi hayi ngakumbi.
Too much to do.	Ukwenza kakhulu.
One has to do something about this.	Umntu kufuneka enze into ngale nto.
It will be soon.	Kuya kuba kungekudala.
Sorry, but no.	Uxolo, kodwa hayi.
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
Maybe not today.	Mhlawumbi hayi namhlanje.
I will come later.	Ndiza kuza kamva.
I did my job.	Ndenze umsebenzi wam.
But he was not alone.	Kodwa wayengekho yedwa.
She is happy to be alone.	Uyavuya ukuba yedwa.
I did not go to work.	Khange ndiye emsebenzini.
Slow movement.	Ukuhamba kancinci.
So here you go, again.	Ngoko ke apha uya, kwakhona.
Only time.	Ixesha kuphela.
No, really.	Akunjalo, ngokwenene.
This seems much better.	Oku kubonakala kungcono kakhulu.
You know how you can be.	Uyazi ukuba unokuba njani.
You have to do well.	Ufanele ukwenza kakuhle.
I know about you.	Ndiyazi ngawe.
.	.
I'm scared of something.	Ndiyoyika into.
I had to think about it.	Kwafuneka ndicinge ngayo.
You mean something to me.	Uthetha into kum.
So, you told me.	Ke, undixelele.
You have to go there.	Kufuneka uye apho.
How would he stay.	Wayeza kuhlala njani.
But that probably means there is a problem ahead.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kuthetha ukuba kukho ingxaki ngaphambili.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba yintoni ingxaki.
I don't know where it is.	Andazi ukuba iphi na.
I want to do it outside, if possible.	Ndifuna ukuyenza ngaphandle, ukuba kunokwenzeka.
I have to do something tonight.	Kufuneka ndenze into ngokuhlwanje.
I'm not going anywhere.	Andiyi ndawo.
He didn't know, really, what it was.	Wayengazi, ngokwenene, ukuba yintoni na.
I would like to read.	Ndingathanda ukufunda.
He comes here at night.	Uza apha ebusuku.
I think so.	Ndicinga ukuba .
He did not know why.	Wayengazi ukuba kutheni.
I did this alone.	Ndenze oku ndedwa.
Tell me this.	Ndixelele oku.
But he is not here.	Kodwa akakho apha.
That is definitely possible.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngokuqinisekileyo.
Maybe you want to learn something new.	Mhlawumbi ufuna ukufunda into entsha.
Absolutely true.	Yinyani ngokupheleleyo.
I’m not sure how hard it is.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kunzima kangakanani.
No one wanted to know.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukwazi.
I think we should.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka senze njalo.
It will happen, but not yet.	Kuya kwenzeka, kodwa hayi okwangoku.
He won't talk about it.	Akayi kuthetha ngayo.
I have never talked to you about it before.	Andizange ndithethe nawe ngayo ngaphambili.
A little bit.	Kancinci.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
He just looked.	Wajonga nje.
He told me that's it.	Wandixelela ukuba yiloo nto.
And he thought.	Uye wacinga.
Please, nothing.	Nceda, akukho nto.
I did not speak to him.	Khange ndithethe naye.
But if he did not.	Kodwa ukuba akazange .
We did everything together.	Senze yonke into kunye.
Everyone knows.	Wazi wonke umntu.
No, not at all, no.	Hayi, akunjalo, hayi.
It will be easy enough to do.	Kuya kuba lula ngokwaneleyo ukwenza.
You know what.	Wazi ntoni.
I want a job.	Ndifuna umsebenzi.
I never talked to him about that.	Khange ndithethe naye oko.
Sorry again.	Uxolo kwakhona.
Obviously.	Ngokucacileyo.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Better, he thought.	Kungcono, wacinga.
I don't want.	Andifuni.
I would like to know more.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ngakumbi.
I think it's a new thing.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto entsha.
He also has to find another.	Naye kufuneka afune enye.
I really think you should.	Ngokwenene ndicinga ukuba ufanele.
I do not understand.	Andiqondi.
I know what it is.	Ndiyazi ukuba yintoni.
You know a little about it, but not all of it.	Uyazi kancinci ngayo, kodwa hayi yonke.
So, you know, this is going to be tough.	Ke, uyazi, oku kuya kuba nzima.
No no.	Hayi, hayi.
I want something big.	Ndifuna into enkulu.
Yeah, it's a whole new thing, you know.	Ewe, yinto entsha ngokupheleleyo, uyazi.
Or maybe he just couldn't.	Okanye mhlawumbi akazange akwazi.
he thought.	wacinga.
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze loo nto.
What happened.	Yintoni eyenzekayo.
Probably always.	Mhlawumbi rhoqo.
he said.	uthe.
He looked away.	Wajonga kude.
Or more time.	Okanye ixesha elininzi.
I'm happy though.	Ndiyavuya kodwa.
I'm thinking of doing it.	Ndicinga ukwenza.
Someone will talk a lot.	Umntu uza kuthetha kakhulu.
I'm not sure about that.	Andiqinisekanga ngayo.
It is very difficult.	Kunzima kakhulu.
It will happen great to you.	Kuya kwenzeka enkulu kuwe.
But you just love it.	Kodwa uyayithanda nje.
I knew nothing about you.	Ndandingazi nto ngawe.
Not always, but often enough.	Akunjalo rhoqo, kodwa rhoqo ngokwaneleyo.
It's too far.	Kude kakhulu.
But it is difficult.	Kodwa kunzima.
I can't do it.	Andikwazi ukuyenza.
He wanted to help.	Wayefuna ukunceda.
This may happen soon.	Oku kunokwenzeka kungekudala.
You do not even have to go to school to do it.	Akunyanzelekanga nokuba uye esikolweni ukuze uyenze.
The big problem.	Ingxaki enkulu.
I have to say one thing.	Kufuneka ndithethe into enye.
He said he wanted to talk to me.	Wathi ufuna ukuthetha nam.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
This could be it.	Oku kunokuba yiyo.
Not that he was thinking.	Akunjalo ukuba wayecinga.
I will say just a little bit.	Ndiza kuthetha nje kancinci.
I will not speak again.	Andiyi kuphinda ndithethe.
But then something else happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka enye ingxaki.
I have done a terrible thing to him.	Ndenze into embi kuye.
That is exactly what happened.	Kwenzeka loo nto kanye.
He can speak well.	Uyakwazi ukuthetha kakuhle.
We help you.	Siza kuwe.
If not.	Ukuba akunjalo.
I did not tell him anything.	Khange ndimxelele nto.
We also know that it is not easy.	Siyazi nokuba akukho lula.
It will be difficult.	Kuya kuba nzima.
None of his.	Akukho nto yakhe.
But he did.	Kodwa wenza njalo.
I'm not going anywhere.	Andiyi kuya ndawo.
He wanted to be alone.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa.
That's all.	Yiyo yonke le nto.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He does everything.	Wenza yonke into.
No, he was not.	Hayi, wayengekho.
But he knew why.	Kodwa wayesazi ukuba kwakutheni.
Or something.	Okanye into.
If you are sure.	Ukuba uqinisekile .
It's the same thing.	Yinto enye kanye.
I just want to know why you did it.	Ndifuna nje ukwazi ukuba kutheni uyenzile.
Is it true.	Ngaba yinyani.
I need help here.	Ndifuna uncedo apha.
You will probably be here tonight.	Mhlawumbi uya kuba apha ebusuku.
Nobody is there now.	Akukho mntu apho ngoku.
This, man can never do.	Oku, umntu akanakuze akwenze.
He wants to do it.	Ufuna ukuyenza.
I will have him here.	Ndiza kuba naye apha.
Harder than anyone knew.	Kunzima kunokuba nabani na wayesazi.
I did this to him.	Ndenze lento kuye.
I just want to play.	Ndifuna nje ukudlala.
He wanted to talk, say something.	Wayefuna ukuthetha, athethe into.
Man, that's it.	Mntu, yiloo nto ke.
Finally you have felt it.	Ekugqibeleni uye waziva.
It will or will not happen.	Kuya kwenzeka okanye akuyi kwenzeka.
It should be easy.	Kufuneka kube lula.
I know you will.	Ndiyazi ukuba uya kuyenza.
Again, this is just me.	Kwakhona, oku ndim kuphela.
So, for sure.	Ngoko, ngokuqinisekileyo.
He wanted to talk about everything.	Wayefuna ukuthetha ngayo yonke into.
But he did not want to go home.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuya ekhaya.
Did you do wrong ?.	Ngaba wenze kakubi?.
It's hard to know.	Kunzima ukwazi.
Probably all of that.	Mhlawumbi yonke loo nto.
Everyone knows that today.	Wonke umntu uyayazi loo nto namhlanje.
This means a lot of things.	Oku kuthetha izinto ezininzi.
Because something is coming.	Kuba kukho into ezayo.
That's the problem.	Nantso ke ingxaki.
So it will be difficult.	Ngoko kuya kuba nzima.
I can't stay with him.	Andikwazi ukuhlala naye.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
Eventually, it will happen.	Ekugqibeleni, kuya kwenzeka.
This would be nice.	Oku kunokuba kulungile.
Yes, not at all.	Ewe, hayi ngokupheleleyo.
Isn't it.	Akunjalo.
I could not do this.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza oku.
Or, don't.	Okanye, musa.
You can be ahead.	Unokuba ngaphambili.
That was not necessary.	Oko kwakungeyomfuneko.
How difficult it is for you to know that.	Kunzima kangakanani kuwe ukwazi oko.
Everyone thinks you are here.	Wonke umntu ucinga ukuba ulapha.
Just tell me who it is.	Ndixelele nje ukuba ngubani.
I know that, absolutely.	Ndiyayazi loo nto, ngokupheleleyo.
But not alone.	Kodwa hayi yedwa.
It’s all together.	Yinto yonke kunye.
So that makes it very difficult.	Ngoko oko kwenza kube nzima kakhulu.
I doubt this.	Ndiyathandabuza ngale nto.
Just too much.	Kakhulu nje.
No, not at all.	Hayi, hayi kangako.
Or maybe nothing at all.	Okanye mhlawumbi akukho nto kwaphela.
So he went to it.	Ngoko waya kuyo.
She told me.	Uye wandixelela.
It just so happens that it does.	Kwenzeka nje ukuba kube njalo.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga mna.
But just a little bit.	Kodwa nje kancinci.
He wanted to.	Wayefuna .
Ready to go?.	Le ukuhamba?.
I can't walk.	Andikwazi ukuhamba.
One to go.	Omnye ukuya.
But especially for me.	Kodwa ngakumbi kum.
It's the same thing.	Yinto enye.
This is not the case now.	Oku akunjalo ngoku.
It's even harder.	Kunzima ngakumbi.
He just wanted to talk.	Wayefuna nje ukuthetha.
For now.	Okwangoku.
He's going to have to do something about it.	Kuya kufuneka enze into ngaloo nto.
This means either, or, or, or.	Oku kuthetha okanye, okanye, okanye.
But I'm not sure anymore.	Kodwa andiqinisekanga kwakhona.
But he said all of us.	Kodwa wathi sonke.
Not so for me.	Akunjalo kum.
That's the same thing.	Yinto enye ke leyo.
But not you.	Kodwa hayi wena.
Maybe something happened there.	Mhlawumbi kukho into eyenzekayo apho.
It is very necessary.	Kufuneka kakhulu.
I have to do better.	Kufuneka ndenze ngcono.
Everyone talks about it.	Wonke umntu uthetha ngayo.
Here, it is not.	Apha, akunjalo.
But today, we have made peace with it.	Kodwa namhlanje, senze uxolo nayo.
Now not so much.	Ngoku hayi kakhulu.
Eventually he has to leave.	Ekugqibeleni kufuneka ahambe.
You will not have it.	Awuyi kuba nayo.
He stays home all the time.	Uhlala ekhaya rhoqo.
Anything at all.	Nantoni na kwaphela.
There is no way.	Akukho ndlela.
.	.
Please, do not.	Nceda, musa .
I just know.	Ndiyazi nje.
He will do it.	Uya kuyenza.
But not more.	Kodwa hayi ngakumbi.
So now.	Ngoko ngoku.
But he said nothing to her.	Kodwa akazange athethe nto kuye.
It happened to you.	Kwenzeke kuwe.
But me.	Kodwa mna.
He certainly agreed.	Ngokuqinisekileyo wavuma.
There is nobody here.	Akukho mntu apha.
But no one speaks.	Kodwa akukho mntu uthetha.
How did this happen.	Kwenzeka njani oku.
He is not here.	Akakho apha.
I told her that.	Ndamxelela lonto.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akunjalo.
There you are, yes.	Nantso ke, ewe.
There is one there.	Kukho enye apho.
I don't even know when.	Andazi nokuba nini.
There is no doing things or eating.	Akukho ukwenza izinto okanye ukutya.
I don't know what will happen.	Andazi ukuba kuya kwenzeka ntoni.
You know what, maybe not.	Uyazi ukuba yintoni, mhlawumbi akunjalo.
I don't know much.	Andazi kakhulu.
To be with him.	Ukuba naye.
Very, very difficult.	Kakhulu, kunzima kakhulu.
I don't understand why either.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni nam.
It's hard here.	Kunzima apha.
Down, down, down.	Phantsi, phantsi, phantsi.
So much for the whole day.	Kakhulu imini yonke.
I can't make a decision.	Andikwazi ukwenza isigqibo.
He knew everyone.	Wayesazi wonke umntu.
I think you want money.	Ndicinga ukuba ufuna imali.
I think that's a big deal.	Ndicinga ukuba yinto enkulu.
Not so much, but maybe enough.	Hayi kakhulu, kodwa mhlawumbi ngokwaneleyo.
Looks like there is.	Kubonakala ngathi kukho.
He tried to speak slowly.	Wazama ukuthetha kancinci.
That's it.	Nantso ke.
He did not stay there long.	Akazange ahlale ixesha elide apho.
he thought.	wacinga.
You need to know that.	Kufuneka uyazi loo nto.
But really, there is.	Kodwa ngokwenene, kukho.
He just loves it here so much.	Uthanda nje apha kakhulu.
I do not know.	Andazi.
Mary and me.	UMary kunye nam.
He did not want to talk.	Wayengafuni kuthetha.
I'll talk to you later.	Ndiza kuthetha nawe kamva.
I will do something.	Ndiya kwenza into.
Now or later.	Ngoku okanye kamva.
Well, maybe there is.	Ewe, mhlawumbi kukho.
Certainly not me !.	Ngokuqinisekileyo hayi mna!.
He knows but he doesn't know what it is right now.	Uyazi kodwa akazi ukuba yintoni okwangoku.
I think you should have it.	Ndicinga ukuba kufuneka ube naye.
He did so later.	Wakwenza oko kamva.
You told me that.	Undixelele lonto.
Especially at night.	Kakhulu ebusuku.
He stayed there for a long time.	Wahlala apho ixesha elide.
I didn't know much about it.	Ndandingazi nto ingako ngayo.
We will do this together.	Siza kuyenza kunye le nto.
He will be so.	Uya kuba njalo .
But not difficult, or long.	Kodwa hayi nzima, okanye ixesha elide.
I would like to do that.	Ndingathanda ukwenza njalo.
But one thing.	Kodwa into enye.
You know, you just want to be yourself.	Uyazi, ufuna nje ukuba nguwe.
No one knew about this.	Akukho mntu wayesazi ngale nto.
I think a lot of you.	Ndicinga kakhulu ngawe.
No problem no problem.	Akukho ngxaki akukho ngxaki.
But not now.	Kodwa hayi ngoku.
He did not give up.	Akazange ayeke.
Or maybe the other way around.	Okanye mhlawumbi ngenye indlela.
.	.
We will need another.	Siza kufuna enye.
No one knew the other.	Akukho mntu wayesazi omnye.
No, really.	Hayi, ngokwenene.
It will be the same thing.	Kuya kuba yinto enye.

I would love to see what you do with it.	Ndingathanda ukubona ukuba wenza ntoni ngayo.
I would like to get some money.	Ndingathanda ukufumana imali.
He told me once.	Undixelele kanye.
But yes, that did happen.	Kodwa ewe, oko kwenzeka.
He lives here.	Uhlala apha.
It's a new thing.	Yinto entsha.
I thought so too.	Nam bendicinga njalo .
He understood immediately.	Waqonda ngoko nangoko.
So that's fine.	Ngoko ke kulungile.
He thought he would have to do it.	Wayecinga ukuba kuya kufuneka enze.
He is a human being.	Ungumntu.
he asked.	wabuza.
He was not.	Wayengekho.
But in everything else.	Kodwa kuyo yonke enye into.
Mary alone.	UMariya yedwa.
Not too far away.	Hayi kude kakhulu.
absolutely not.	ngokupheleleyo akunjalo.
That's it for now.	Yiloo nto okwangoku.
He did that.	Uyenzile loo nto.
Maybe something else.	Mhlawumbi enye into.
He tried to sit down.	Wazama ukuhlala phantsi.
This is it, he realized.	Yiyo le, waqonda.
No one yet.	Akukho mntu okwangoku.
We had to do it.	Kwafuneka siyenze.
I think a lot of things.	Ndicinga izinto ezininzi.
It will be difficult.	Kuza kuba nzima.
I can't read this.	Andikwazi ukufunda oku.
Really really.	Ngenene ngenene.
This is it.	Lo nguye.
Not you.	Hayi nawe.
I didn't want to talk to her either.	Nam ndandingafuni kuthetha naye.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
But he is not really there.	Kodwa akakho ngokwenene apho.
It's good for you.	Kulungile kuwe.
It’s really hard, really.	Kunzima ngokwenene, ngenene.
But that.	Kodwa ukuba .
Nobody wanted this to happen.	Akukho mntu wayefuna ukuba kwenzeke oku.
he thought.	wacinga.
It's hard to see.	Kunzima ukubona.
He said he couldn't speak for sure.	Wathi akakwazi ukuthetha ngokuqinisekileyo.
We did it.	Senze ngayo.
I feel completely alone.	Ndiziva ndedwa ngokupheleleyo.
Not much is happening.	Akukho nto ingako eyenzekayo.
But in the meantime, he has to stay.	Kodwa okwangoku, kufuneka ahlale.
So, again, here.	Ngoko, kwakhona, apha.
But not so much now.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu ngoku.
I wonder why.	Ndiyazibuza ukuba kutheni.
It is also very unlikely.	Kwakhona akunakwenzeka kakhulu.
I can't talk too much right now.	Andikwazi ukuthetha kakhulu ngoku.
He also did not want to leave.	Naye wayengafuni ukuhamba.
This would be a good thing.	Oku kunokuba yinto entle.
I think it could be better.	Ndicinga ukuba kunokuba ngcono.
I want you too.	Nam ndifuna wena.
But only as you want.	Kodwa kuphela njengoko ufuna.
More on that a little bit.	Ngakumbi ngaloo nto kancinci.
I'm sure you know.	Ndiqinisekile uyayazi.
But only time.	Kodwa kuphela ixesha.
Tomorrow fast enough.	Ngomso ngokukhawuleza ngokwaneleyo.
Nobody likes you.	Akukho mntu uthanda wena.
But it will certainly happen sooner rather than later.	Kodwa ngokuqinisekileyo kuya kwenzeka ngokukhawuleza kunokuba kamva.
But no.	Kodwa akukho.
Do you know what it is?	Ngaba uyazi ukuba yintoni?
I don't want.	Andifuni.
No one.	Akukho mntu .
.	.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
Not so with you.	Akunjalo nawe.
But no.	Kodwa hayi.
He asked to speak to me.	Wacela ukuthetha nam.
But just a little bit.	Kodwa nje kancinci.
He did not speak to her.	Zange athethe naye.
No one, really.	Akukho mntu, ngokwenene.
You will talk to me.	Uya kuthetha nam.
Another good thing.	Enye into entle.
He says he knows he thinks everything.	Uthi uyazi ukuba ucinga yonke into.
But what is worse.	Kodwa yintoni embi ngakumbi.
He thought he did.	Wayecinga ukuba wenze njalo.
There, there, now.	Apho, apho, ngoku.
You know that, too.	Uyayazi loo nto, nawe.
The sooner it gets better.	Ngokukhawuleza kuya kuba ngcono.
There is just nothing there.	Akukho nto nje apho.
It has to be visible.	Kufuneka abonakale.
No one will want to stay here.	Akukho mntu uya kufuna ukuhlala apha.
Probably nothing.	Mhlawumbi akukho nto.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
This seems to be a very bad thing.	Oku kubonakala ngathi yinto embi kakhulu.
It should, it should, it should.	Kufuneka, kufuneka, kufuneka.
This will end badly.	Oku kuya kuphela kakubi.
That can really happen.	Oko kunokwenzeka ngokwenene.
I thought it was okay.	Bendicinga ukuba kulungile.
Isn't it .	Akunjalo .
But that is not the case now.	Kodwa akunjalo ngoku.
Well, we'll do it here.	Kulungile, siza kuyenza apha.
I do not know who he is.	Andazi ukuba ngubani na.
There is no place for him here.	Akukho ndawo yakhe apha.
He really has to go.	Kufuneka ahambe ngokwenene.
Is it true.	Ngaba yinyani.
Now but now.	Ngoku kodwa ngoku.
.	.
And then .	Ke ngoku .
Good reading.	Ukufunda kakuhle.
He wanted to stay.	Wayefuna ukuhlala.
Virtually everyone does.	Ngokwenene wonke umntu wenza njalo.
I want one now.	Ndifuna enye ngoku.
If you do that you will be with me.	Ukuba wenza njalo uzakuba nam.
I did not want this to happen.	Ndandingafuni ukuba yenzeke le nto.
She went to the hospital.	Waya esibhedlele.
But he does not want to.	Kodwa akafuni.
Now, there is.	Ngoku, kukho.
We have been coming here for a long time.	Kudala siza apha.
No problem.	Akukho ngxaki.
Anyone, really.	Nabani na, ngenene.
That's it.	Yiyo loo nto.
He immediately began talking about it.	Ngoko nangoko waqalisa ukuthetha ngayo.
All of us here.	Nathi sonke apha.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukho enye into.
He told someone else.	Waxelela omnye umntu.
He never did that.	Khange ayenze loo nto.
There is something else.	Kukho enye into.
A little, maybe.	Kancinci, mhlawumbi.
I know him.	Ndiyamazi mna.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
But a little bit.	Kodwa kancinci.
How to make more money.	Indlela yokwenza imali eninzi.
I want to stay with you.	Ndifuna ukuhlala nawe.
He actually went to school.	Wathi nyani waya esikolweni.
I don't think he did.	Andiqondi ukuba wenza njalo.
He had to sit down.	Kwafuneka ahlale phantsi.
No, he certainly did not.	Hayi, ngokuqinisekileyo akazange.
But nowhere.	Kodwa akukho ndawo.
Not that it would be a bad thing.	Akunjalo ukuba kuya kuba yinto embi.
It's just a good thing to do.	Yinto nje elungileyo ukuyenza.
No no.	Hayi, hayi.
But he talks a lot.	Kodwa uthetha kakhulu.
But it is difficult.	Kodwa kunzima.
Here I am.	Apha nam.
My big house.	Indlu yam enkulu.
But he may not know it.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba akayazi loo nto.
he thought.	wacinga.
I thought it was okay.	Bendicinga ukuba kulungile.
He did not.	Akazange.
But it is very difficult.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu.
I don't know why right now, or who.	Andazi ukuba kutheni okwangoku, nokuba ngubani.
I don't know what's going on here.	Andazi kwenzeka ntoni apha.
No, that's fine.	Hayi, kulungile.
There is not much there.	Akukho nto ingako apho.

What do you want.	Ingaba ufuna ntoni.
No one speaks the other way.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngenye indlela.
Certainly this.	Ngokuqinisekileyo oku.
She went to the hospital.	Uye esibhedlele.
he did not go to school.	khange aye esikolweni.
Why, he didn't know.	Kutheni, wayengazi.
Clearly this.	Ngokucacileyo lo.
Not tomorrow, now.	Hayi ngomso, ngoku.
With him, or with him alone.	Naye, okanye naye kuphela.
But in the end.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni.
She had to go to him.	Kwafuneka aye kuye.
You should be here soon.	Ufanele ukuba apha ngokukhawuleza.
He can never succeed.	Akanakuze aphumelele.
But he did not want to be with her.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuba kunye naye.
I never told anyone about it.	Khange ndixelele mntu ngayo.
But you mean something else.	Kodwa uthetha enye into.
So will you.	Nawe uya kuba njalo.
Beautiful new house.	Indlu entle entsha.
Not to him.	Hayi kuye.
But now he knew.	Kodwa ngoku wayesazi.
He can't walk.	Akakwazi ukuhamba.
I don't know what happened.	Andazi ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.
I don't want to do that.	Andifuni ukwenza njalo.
I know him at work.	Ndiyamazi emsebenzini.
That seems obvious.	Oko kubonakala kucacile.
But also.	Kodwa, kwakhona.
He knew a little bit.	Wayesazi kancinci.
I know nothing.	Andazi nto.
Very good thing, very much.	Into entle kakhulu, kakhulu.
A little bit of everything, really.	Kancinci kuyo yonke into, ngokwenene.

No, far from it.	Hayi, kude kuyo.
Going to prison.	Ukuya entolongweni.
I don't know, maybe.	Andazi, mhlawumbi.
I'm really happy.	Ndiyavuya ngokwenene.
No one should do anything about it.	Akukho mntu kufuneka enze nantoni na kuyo.
You talk a little bit about that.	Uthetha kancinci ngaloo nto.
I am now.	Ndim ngoku.
He knows he won't.	Uyazi ukuba akasayi.
Is it possible to do that.	Ngaba kunokwenzeka ukwenza oko.
He would do it.	Wayeza kuyenza.
Surely, you must know.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, umele ukuba uyazi.
Not so much, not so bad.	Hayi kakhulu, hayi kakubi.
But perhaps he did not succeed there.	Kodwa mhlawumbi akazange aphumelele apho.
I will speak.	Ndiza kuthetha.
I would like to go.	Ndingathanda ukuhamba.
I also doubt it.	Kwakhona ndiyathandabuza.
But that will happen later.	Kodwa oko kuya kamva.
He said yes he is.	Wathi ewe nguye.
Certainly not.	Ngokuqinisekileyo akuyi kuba njalo.
Everyone, yes.	Wonke umntu, ewe.
But he finally realized that he needed to talk.	Kodwa ekugqibeleni waqonda ukuba kufuneka athethe.
he thought.	wacinga.
Probably not at all tonight.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo kwaphela ngokuhlwanje.
No one, but no one.	Akukho mntu, kodwa akukho mntu.
Very, probably.	Kakhulu, mhlawumbi.
You're not going.	Awuyi.
Yes, he was not.	Ewe, wayengekho.
Just doing it.	Ukwenza nje.
But it's okay.	Kodwa kulungile.
But he is here.	Kodwa ulapha.
But I don't know why.	Kodwa andazi ukuba kutheni.
No one knows for sure.	Akukho mntu wazi ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba yinyani.
But this is too far away.	Kodwa oku kude kakhulu.
He wants to be.	Ufuna ukuba njalo.
He said he did.	Wathi uyenzile.
He knew better than he thought.	Wayesazi ngcono kunokuba acinge.
I'm not so sure.	Andiqinisekanga kakhulu.
It seems to us.	Kubonakala ngathi.
But, this is true.	Kodwa, le yinyani.
I just want you to know.	Ndifuna nje ukuba wazi.
Well done, but again.	Wenze kakuhle, kodwa kwakhona.
I wish just once.	Ndinqwenela kube kanye nje .

Not a purchase.	Hayi ukuthenga.
I think it's time.	Ndicinga ukuba lixesha.
Clearly, he did not want to talk.	Kucacile ukuba wayengafuni kuthetha.
Therefore, he knows everything.	Ngoko ke, wazi yonke into.
I'm not even sure why.	Andiqinisekanga nokuba kutheni.
I'm afraid someone is coming.	Ndiyoyika ukuba umntu uza .
I know this for sure.	Ndiyazi ngokuqinisekileyo oku.
That's not it.	Hayi loo nto.
He thought, maybe that's better.	Wacinga ukuba, mhlawumbi oko kungcono.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga ncam.
He never really went to school.	Akazange aye esikolweni ngokwenene.
No one told me anything.	Akukho mntu wandixelela nto.
Said the man.	Wathi umntu.
I know now that it is not so.	Ndiyazi ngoku ukuba akunjalo.
It will be much easier for you.	Kuya kuba lula kakhulu kuwe.
That is a new thing.	Yinto entsha leyo.
Just tell me one thing.	Ndixelele nje into enye.
He said no.	Uthe hayi.
Help, finally.	Uncedo, ekugqibeleni.
He does not go to school.	Akayi esikolweni.
For now, he didn't want to know.	Okwangoku, wayengafuni ukwazi.
I think you look good.	Ndicinga ukuba ukhangeleka kakuhle.
He had to think.	Kwafuneka acinge.
I do not know.	Andazi.
To me this is not the case.	Kum oku akunjalo.
What am I going to do.	Ndiza kwenza ntoni .
He had never done that before.	Akazange ayenze loo nto ngaphambili.
But he would do it.	Kodwa wayeza kuyenza.
Good to have you.	Kulungile ukuba nawe.
I'm glad you did.	Ndiyavuya ukuba uyenzile.
This may be true.	Oku kunokuba yinyani.
Everyone is coming here.	Wonke umntu uza apha.
He looked.	Wajonga.
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze loo nto.
Everyone wanted to play.	Wonke umntu wayefuna ukudlala.
It doesn't have to happen.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba yenzeke.
He always looks.	Ukhangeleka njalo .
That's me.	Ndim ke lowo.
You definitely want to play.	Ngokuqinisekileyo ufuna ukudlala.
This makes it a lot easier.	Oku kwenza kube lula kakhulu.
This is here.	Oku apha.
To do, to do, to do.	Ukwenza, ukwenza, ukwenza.
But a little more.	Kodwa ngakumbi kancinci.
It is not necessary at all.	Akuyomfuneko kwaphela.
Slowly but frequently.	Kancinci kodwa rhoqo.
If you do that you will do well.	Wenza loo nto uya kuyenza kakuhle.
It has been necessary.	Kuye kwafuneka.

I want to stay in it.	Ndifuna ukuhlala kuyo.
But only him.	Kodwa naye kuphela.
Doing it is not difficult.	Ukwenza akukho nzima.
You did the job.	Wenze umsebenzi.
My whole house.	Yonke indlu yam.
So you think a little bit.	Ngoko ucinga kancinci.
So, that's fine.	Ngoko, kulungile.
But you probably already know that.	Kodwa mhlawumbi sele ukwazi oko.
That's the way.	Nantso indlela.
Not so much more.	Hayi kakhulu ngakumbi.
I never thought he should do that.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba ufanele enjenjalo.
Time is of the essence.	Ixesha kukwazi.
no.	hayi.
He looks good.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle.
This is not the case.	Ayinguye lo.
Not now though.	Hayi ngoku kodwa.
Yes, it is very difficult.	Ewe, kunzima kakhulu.
Maybe he didn't know why.	Mhlawumbi wayengazi ukuba kwakutheni.
I thought about everything.	Ndicinge ngayo yonke into.
Not always.	Akunjalo rhoqo.
I did not know how.	Ndandingazi ukuba njani.
I did something.	Ndenze into.
He is one person.	Ungumntu omnye.
He did it again.	Uyenzile kwakhona.
It's really true.	Yinyani ngokwenene.
I know for sure.	Ndiyazi ngokuqinisekileyo.
You would like to have it otherwise.	Ungathanda ukuba nayo ngenye indlela.
He did not want to, but he did.	Wayengafuni, kodwa wenza njalo.
I can't get to do this.	Andikwazi ukufumana ukwenza oku.
Yes Yes.	Ewe, ewe.
I could not go to him.	Khange ndikwazi ukuya kuye.
You can be alone.	Unokuba yedwa.
Not if you have to.	Akunjalo ukuba kufuneka.
So please do.	Ngoko nceda wenze.
He wanted to see.	Wayefuna ukubona.
It's just that everything has to happen fast.	Kuphela nje ukuba yonke into kufuneka yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
No, not that, when.	Hayi, hayi ukuba, nini.
There is another car.	Kukho enye imoto.
Probably more along the way.	Mhlawumbi ngakumbi ngendlela.
All right.	Kulungile.
I couldn't do anything about it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza nto ngaloo nto.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
But something happened.	Kodwa kukho into eyenzekayo.
To get .	Ukufumana .
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo.
But it is really difficult.	Kodwa kunzima ngokwenene.
Food in it.	Ukutya kuyo.
Maybe he wasn't there now.	Mhlawumbi wayengekho ngoku.
He just said to go.	Uthe nje ukuba ahambe.
I never thought about it.	Khange ndicinge ngayo.
He wants you to be alone.	Ufuna ukuba ube yedwa.
But he did not sit down.	Kodwa akazange ahlale phantsi.
We will do the same.	Siya kwenza njalo.
Don't be too hard on yourself.	Musa ukuba nzima kakhulu kuwe.
I hope you know.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyazi.
One can never think.	Umntu akanakuze acinge.
He says he wants to stay with me.	Uthi ufuna ukuhlala nam.
He just did his job.	Wenza nje umsebenzi wakhe.
But it was not too early.	Kodwa zange kwangethuba.
It just happens.	Kwenzeka nje.
But that will be the end of it.	Kodwa oko kuya kuba ekugqibeleni.
He did not want to go there.	Wayengafuni ukuya apho.
We don't have to do it.	Akunyanzelekanga ukuba siyenze.
He said he did not know.	Wathi akazi.
.	.
Like me, but not bad.	Njengam, kodwa hayi kakubi.
But it is unlikely to be the case.	Kodwa akunakwenzeka ukuba kube njalo.
Everyone was gone.	Wonke umntu wayengekho.
Where are you.	Uphi.
You will do very well here.	Uza kwenza kakuhle kakhulu apha.
I said nothing.	Khange ndithethe nto.

As required.	Njengoko kufuneka.
The problem is you.	Ingxaki nguwe.

Tell me later.	Ndixelele kamva.
He knew nothing.	Wayengazi nto.
He did not speak.	Khange athethe.
He wants to, but he can't.	Uyafuna, kodwa akakwazi.
Nobody talks about that.	Akukho mntu uthetha ngaloo nto.
I do not believe.	Andikholelwa.
It's hard to do anything.	Kunzima ukwenza nto.

He says yes.	Uthi ewe.
It's time.	Lixesha.

I really need help.	Ndifuna ngokwenene uncedo.
He had to go.	Bekufanele ahambe.
He looks good.	Ukhangeleka kakuhle.
This is not easy.	Oku akukho lula.
That's why you're here.	Yiyo loo nto ulapha.
I don’t want to do it for long.	Andifuni ukuyenza ixesha elide.
I didn’t want to talk too much or too little.	Ndandingafuni ukuthetha kakhulu okanye kancinci kakhulu.
He talks a lot.	Uthetha kakhulu.
Or so he thought.	Okanye wayecinga njalo.
Or not.	Okanye akunjalo.
If anyone can do that.	Ukuba nabani na uyakwazi ukwenza njalo.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbi akunjalo.
He did not want to eat.	Wayengafuni ukutya.
I didn't think of anything.	Khange ndicinge nto.
Yes, this is happening.	Ewe, kwenzeka oku.
You know very well.	Wazi kakhulu.
He never had her.	Akazange abe naye.
He lives here with me.	Uhlala apha nam.
It will be so.	Kuya kuba njalo.
Down in it.	Phantsi kuyo.
This may be true.	Oku kunokuba yinyani.
He wanted to play.	Wayefuna ukudlala.
He did not say much.	Khange athethe kakhulu.
But he knew nothing about it.	Kodwa wayengazi nto ngale nto.
I apologize to her.	Ndicela uxolo kuye.
None of your coffee.	Akukho ikofu yakho.
Over again.	Kwakhona kwakhona.
No no no no.	Hayi hayi hayi hayi.
He always told me.	Undixelele njalo.
You want to make money.	Ufuna ukwenza imali.
Or not exactly.	Okanye hayi ncam.
Everyone looked at him.	Wonke umntu wajonga kuye.
I'm trying to find this way.	Ndizama ukufumana le ndlela.
To me, not so much.	Kum, hayi kakhulu.
For anything to me.	Kuba nantoni na kum.
I would like to do that.	Ndingathanda ukwenza oko.
You are human, too.	Ungumntu, nawe.
Everything probably.	Yonke into mhlawumbi.
If I am.	Ukuba ndim.
He said confidently.	Wathi ngokuqinisekileyo.
It's better, but not much better.	Kungcono, kodwa akukho ngcono kakhulu.
But that won't happen, either.	Kodwa oko akuyi kwenzeka, mhlawumbi.
I talked a lot.	Ndithethe kakhulu.
Only you will make your way.	Nguwe kuphela oza kuyenza indlela yakho.
I can't say why.	Andikwazi kuthetha ukuba kutheni.
No problem though.	Akukho ngxaki kodwa.
That's the problem.	Yiloo nto ingxaki.
The truth is the truth.	Inyani yinyani.
This is perfectly fine.	Oku kulungile ngokupheleleyo.
You are the one.	Wena nguwe.
Not all of us.	Akunjalo sonke.
I couldn't do anything about it.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza nto ngayo.
That's why you're here.	Yiyo loo nto ulapha.
Do you really.	Ngaba ngokwenene.
I just want his job.	Ndifuna nje umsebenzi wakhe.

But not more.	Kodwa hayi ngakumbi.
I would like to know what he looked like.	Ndingathanda ukwazi ukuba wayekhangeleka njani.
If you like.	Ukuba ungathanda .
But, soon something happened.	Kodwa, kungekudala kukho into eyenzekayo.

But something unusual happened next.	Kodwa kwenzeka into entsha.
Walking at night.	Ukuhamba ebusuku.
You like it here.	Uyayithanda apha.
I do not want anywhere.	Andifuni ndawo.
Once upon a time there was too much.	Kanye lixesha elininzi kakhulu.
That's a good thing.	Yinto entle leyo.
Or tomorrow.	Okanye ngomso.
The big problem there.	Ingxaki enkulu apho.
He did everything else.	Wenza yonke enye into.
Maybe you did.	Mhlawumbi wenze njalo.
He knew then that he would like to.	Wayesazi ngoko ukuba angathanda.
But you.	Kodwa wena .
I also .	Mna nam .
There is plenty of room.	Kukho indawo eninzi.
You only have to do it once.	Kufuneka uyenze kube kanye kuphela.
Either way no.	Ngenye indlela akukho.
Is this possible ?.	Ngaba oku kunokwenzeka?.
Yesterday it seems.	Izolo kubonakala.
Tell me how it happened.	Ndixelele ukuba kwenzeke njani.
Not outside.	Hayi ngaphandle.
I hope you get better.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uzakuba ngcono.
I can't stay here all day.	Andikwazi ukuhlala apha imini yonke.
I said something nice about you.	Ndithethe into entle ngawe.
There is nothing wrong with feeling that way.	Akukho nto uziva kakubi ngayo.

It's a really good thing.	Yinto entle ngokwenene.
Yes!' 	Ewe!'
We all need to do this.	Kufuneka senze oku sonke.
I told her to talk to you about it.	Ndimxelele ukuba athethe nawe ngayo.
He agreed, but asked for another.	Wavuma, kodwa wacela enye.
Going to work.	Ukuya emsebenzini.
I’m sure there is nothing.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba akukho nto yonke.
Sounds good to me.	Kubonakala kulungile kum.
That sounds good to me.	Oko kubonakala kulungile kum.
How to make it happen.	Indlela yokwenza ukuba kwenzeke.
I want to do this only once.	Ndifuna ukwenza oku kube kanye kuphela.
I'm glad you did.	Ndiyavuya ukuba uyenzile.
I spoke to him yesterday.	Ndithethe naye izolo.
He said it would be very difficult.	Uthe kuya kuba nzima kakhulu.
But she is optimistic.	Kodwa unethemba.
That's true.	Yinyani leyo.
So very, very sorry.	Ngoko kakhulu, uxolo kakhulu.

No, he wanted to go with her.	Hayi, wayefuna ahambe naye.
Now, no problem.	Ngoku, akukho ngxaki.
It is possible.	Kunokwenzeka.
I think it is clear that it is not.	Ndicinga ukuba kucacile ukuba akunjalo.
But no, obviously, too.	Kodwa hayi, ngokucacileyo, kakhulu.
He admitted that he knew nothing.	Wavuma ukuba akazi nto.
So it is not possible.	Ngoko ke akunakwenzeka.
I hope not.	Ndiyathemba ukuba akunjalo.
Yeah, everything.	Ewe, yonke into.
I did not speak.	Khange ndithethe.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
I do not know either.	Andazi nam.
He didn't know what to do about it.	Wayengazi ukuba enze ntoni ngaloo nto.
But everyone knew better.	Kodwa wonke umntu wayesazi ngcono.
But that is not the case at all.	Kodwa akunjalo kwaphela.
I don't want to do that.	Andifuni kuyenza loo nto.
Or a bicycle.	Okanye ibhayisekile.
He thought he should find someone else.	Wayecinga ukuba ufanele afune omnye umntu.
I do not want this to happen.	Andifuni ukuba kwenzeke oku.
I think so, yes.	Ndicinga njalo, ewe.
Yes, not at all.	Ewe, hayi ngokupheleleyo.
But in a really good way.	Kodwa ngendlela entle ngokwenene.
One must have thought so.	Umntu umele ukuba wayecinga njalo.
He always knows.	Wazi njalo.
That's your thing.	Nantso ke into yakho.
Or just this.	Okanye nje oku.
He never did that.	Akazange ayenze loo nto.
No it isn't.	Hayi akunjalo.
I could not do anything.	Andizange ndikwazi ukwenza nto.
Just at home.	Nje ekhaya.
Bad place to be.	Indawo embi ukuba ube kuyo.
I know exactly what is coming.	Ndiyazi kakuhle into ezayo.
Yes to it.	Ewe kuyo.
Like me and you.	Njengam nawe.
I don't want to talk to her.	Andifuni kuthetha naye.
But not with him.	Kodwa hayi naye.
Until then, no one knew anything.	Kude kube ngoko, akukho mntu wazi nto.
What is this? 	Yintoni lento?
he asked.	wabuza.
Then he understood how long.	Waqonda ke ngoko ukuba kude kube nini.
He would stay.	Wayeza kuhlala.
Everyone says the same thing.	Wonke umntu uthetha into enye.
I will .	Ndiza .
I certainly never did that.	Ngokuqinisekileyo andizange ndiyenze loo nto.
Obviously this is not necessary.	Ngokucacileyo oku akuyomfuneko.
I was thinking about you.	Bendicinga ngawe.
That's what it is.	Yiloo nto ke.
I did something.	Ndenze into.
But that can be so.	Kodwa oko kunokuba njalo.
I would like to stay.	Ndingathanda ukuhlala.
So maybe okay.	Ngoko mhlawumbi kulungile.
I didn't do it.	Khange ndiyenze.
No not yet.	Hayi okwangoku.
I can do it today.	Ndingayenza namhlanje.
So he told me.	Undixelele ke.
That's a bad thing.	Nantso into embi.
This means,.	Oku kuthetha ukuba, .
If possible again.	Ukuba kunokwenzeka kwakhona.
The decision.	Isigqibo .
Well done.	Kulungile ukuba uyenzile.
I'm not sure either.	Nam andiqinisekanga.
He also knew.	Naye wayesazi.
I think you know about it.	Ndicinga ukuba uyazi ngayo.
I do not understand why.	Andiqondi ukuba kutheni.
As soon as.	Njengoko kwangoko.
I did not think.	Khange ndicinge.
I'm glad to be here.	Ndiyavuya ukuba lapha.
But that's okay.	Kodwa oko kulungile.
This is good.	Oku kulungile.
For me.	Kum nje.
.	.
Maybe suddenly, he thought.	Mhlawumbi ngokukhawuleza, wacinga.
It seems obvious.	Kubonakala ngathi kucacile.
It can be very difficult.	Kunokuba nzima kakhulu.
I want to read.	Ndifuna ukufunda.
He lives in it.	Uhlala kuyo.
I'll talk to him now.	Ndiza kuthetha naye ngoku.

He said he knew that.	Wathi uyayazi loo nto.
You feel because you are human.	Uziva kuba ungumntu.
Really nice thing.	Into entle ngokwenene.
Traveling becomes difficult.	Ukuhamba kuba nzima.
Impossible, but there is a chance.	Akunakwenzeka, kodwa kukho ithuba.
This is not exactly the case.	Oku akunjalo ncam.
Not for me.	Hayi kum.
Maybe he was just not at home.	Mhlawumbi wayengekho nje ekhaya.
It's time again.	Lixesha kwakhona.
I talked a lot.	Ndithethe kakhulu.
But no, there is no way.	Kodwa hayi, akukho ndlela.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
It's one thing or another.	Yinto enye okanye enye.
I want you to know beforehand.	Ndifuna ukuba uyazi ngaphambili.
But, everything happened very quickly.	Kodwa, yonke into yenzeke ngokukhawuleza.
He did not say much.	Akazange athethe kakhulu.
Well, that is much better.	Ewe, oko kungcono kakhulu.
I'm not sure what happened.	Andiqinisekanga ukuba kwenzeke ntoni na.
Maybe maybe.	Mhlawumbi mhlawumbi.
He is talking to you.	Uthetha nawe.
But not everyone.	Kodwa ayinguye wonke umntu.
We did well.	Senze kakuhle.
But he probably did not think about it at all.	Kodwa kusenokwenzeka ukuba akazange acinge ngayo kwaphela.
He knows the way everywhere.	Uyayazi indlela kuyo yonke indawo.
You know right now.	Uyazi ngoku ngoku.
Not a bit.	Hayi kancinci.
But it seems difficult now.	Kodwa kubonakala kunzima ngoku.
Is this okay.	Ngaba oku kulungile.
No one is out.	Akukho mntu ngaphandle.
Not bad.	Hayi kakubi.
Not much.	Hayi kakhulu.
Really, it is.	Ngokwenene, yinyani.

Also, he looked bad.	Kwakhona, wayekhangeleka kakubi.
You are the only one who really made it happen.	Nguwe kuphela owenza ukuba yenzeke ngokwenene.
I know it's hard.	Ndiyazi ukuba kunzima.
I never thought about how that happened or why.	Andizange ndicinge ukuba oko kwenzeka njani okanye kutheni.
That's what happened to me, you know.	Nantso into eyenzekayo kum, uyazi.
To travel.	Ukuhamba.
There you are, yes.	Nantso ke, ewe.
I know you know that.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyayazi lonto.
I know you know.	Ndiyazi ukuba uyazi.
It was not necessary.	Kwakungeyomfuneko.
He knows nothing at all.	Akazi nto kwaphela.
Well, maybe this won't be too difficult.	Kulungile, mhlawumbi oku akuyi kuba nzima kakhulu.
he asked.	wabuza.
I have known that for a long time.	Kudala ndiyazi loo nto.

This is better.	Oku kungcono.
I'm scared now.	Ndiyoyika ngoku.
Just to see what happens.	Ukubona nje ukuba kwenzeka ntoni.

It is finally necessary.	Kufuneka ekugqibeleni.
It gets better.	Kuba ngcono ngakumbi.

Long time.	Ixesha elide.
But he remains.	Kodwa uhlala.
He needs to talk to you.	Kufuneka athethe nawe.
A little, but he did.	Kancinci, kodwa wenza.

There is a way.	Kukho indlela.
That's all.	Yonke loo nto.

Well, he thought.	Ewe, wacinga.
Slowly, yes.	Kancinci, ewe.
That is very true.	Yinyani leyo kakhulu.
Right now.	Ngoku ngoku.
.	.
Not that this is new.	Hayi ukuba yinto entsha le.
You knew better.	Ubusazi ngcono.
This does not have to happen immediately.	Oku akunyanzelekanga ukuba yenzeke kwangoko.
But perhaps it will.	Kodwa mhlawumbi kuya kufuneka.
I also did not speak.	Nam khange ndithethe.
If there is no problem.	Ukuba akukho ngxaki.
You understand now.	Uye waqonda ngoku.
Or not well.	Okanye hayi kakuhle.
If you want to go with us.	Ukuba uyafuna ukuhamba nathi .
I will not be.	andiyi kuba.
In a good way.	Ngendlela entle.
I would like to play with him.	Ndingathanda ukudlala naye.
Yeah, not really.	Ewe, hayi ncam.
You will not need anything.	Awuyi kufuna nto.
That's a bad thing.	Nantso ke into embi.
He wanted to be human.	Wayefuna ukuba ngumntu.
Or no matter how hard you try.	Okanye nokuba uzama ukwenza njani.
He said he knew how.	Wathi uyazi njani.
no.	hayi.
Well, not really, obviously.	Ewe, akunjalo, ngokucacileyo.
There is nothing there, really.	Akukho nto apho, ngokwenene.
I'm sure you know about it.	Ndiqinisekile ukuba uyazi ngayo.
It really needs to.	Kufuneka ngokwenene.
But soon.	Kodwa kungekudala.
So you think about it.	Ngoko ucinga ngayo.

I know for sure tomorrow.	Ndiyazi ngomso ngokuqinisekileyo.
There is a way to do this again.	Kukho indlela yokwenza oku kwakhona.
Or next week.	Okanye kwiveki ezayo.
Buying a car is a big deal.	Ukuthenga imoto yinto enkulu.
He did it.	Uyenzile.

I think it is very difficult.	Ndicinga ukuba kunzima kakhulu.
Just for sure.	Kanye ngokuqinisekileyo.
No one likes to eat alone.	Akukho mntu uthanda ukutya yedwa.
But he did not succeed.	Kodwa akazange aphumelele.
Fast, fast.	Ngokukhawuleza, ngokukhawuleza .
I don't want to talk about it.	Andifuni kuthetha ngayo.
I did not know.	Ndandingazi.
Don't go too far for it.	Musa ukuya kude kakhulu kuyo.
That makes one person.	Oko kwenza umntu omnye.
Once in this place.	Kanye kule ndawo.

Don't just do it.	Musa nje ukwenza.
And then? 	Ke ngoku?
It has to be.	Kufuneka kube njalo.
I never thought about it.	Khange ndicinge ngayo.
There is no peace.	Akukho uxolo.
Nice place.	Indawo entle.

I know everything about it.	Ndiyazi yonke into ngayo.

That's a good thing.	Yinto entle.
But not yet.	Kodwa hayi okwangoku.
Nobody wants to stay long.	Akukho mntu ufuna ukuhlala ixesha elide.
But you are about to do it.	Kodwa sele uza kuyenza.
So it seems like a big deal.	Ngoko kubonakala ngathi yinto enkulu.
Not so much, but it is possible.	Akunjalo kakhulu, kodwa kunokwenzeka.
He knows it too.	Naye uyayazi.
This will make his job easier.	Oku kuya kwenza umsebenzi wakhe ube lula.
You will not have to do anything.	Akuyi kufuneka wenze nantoni na .

So that's a good thing for him.	Ngoko yinto entle leyo kuye.
Nothing out.	Akukho nto ngaphandle.
Dog day and night.	Inja imini ebusuku.
I did not know where he was going.	Ndandingazi ukuba uye phi.
Well, not much else.	Ewe, hayi kakhulu enye into.

I will do it.	Ndiza kuyenza.
I did not tell him anything.	Khange ndimxelele nto.
I think you will get better.	Ndicinga ukuba uzakuba ngcono.
That is exactly what happened.	Yinto kanye eyenzekayo.
But not so much.	Kodwa hayi kakhulu.
Yeah, that's a big deal.	Ewe, yinto enkulu leyo.

Probably not immediately.	Mhlawumbi hayi ngokukhawuleza.
I'm so scared.	Ndiyoyika kakhulu.
We know why you are here.	Siyazi ukuba kutheni ulapha.
He does something else with you.	Wenza enye into nawe.
He looked away.	Uye wajonga kude.
Not only that.	Akunjalo nje.

It seems to us.	Kubonakala ngathi.
The food is much better.	Ukutya kungcono kakhulu.
Drive to him.	Ukuqhuba ukuya kuye.

This can be so.	Oku kunokuba njalo.
He does not know where he is.	Akazi nokuba uphi.
He really wanted to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngokwenene.
He did not do so.	Akazange enze njalo.
I never thought I would.	Khange ndicinge ukuba ndenze njalo.
But now this.	Kodwa ngoku oku.
I'm not sure.	Andiqinisekanga.
Mary is capable of doing things.	UMariya uyakwazi ukwenza izinto.
Really, much better in every way.	Ngokwenene, ngcono kakhulu ngayo yonke indlela.
It will get better this way, really.	Kuya kuba ngcono ngale ndlela, ngokwenene.

I hope you know that.	Ndiyathemba ukuba uyayazi loo nto.
This makes it very difficult.	Oku kwenza ukuba kube nzima kakhulu.
But that is a fact.	Kodwa yinyani leyo.
It is not necessary.	Akuyomfuneko.
This is a big deal for me.	Yinto enkulu le kum.

If you want to make one.	Ukuba ufuna ukwenza enye.
Coffee can be a really good thing.	Ikofu ingaba yinto entle ngokwenene.
I do not know everything.	Andazi yonke into.

If he does not want us to do so.	Ukuba akafuni senze njalo.
I'm happy to do it.	Ndiyavuya ukuyenza.
He said he would do it.	Wathi uza kwenza njalo.
Finally there.	Ekugqibeleni apho.
You have to make money to do that.	Kufuneka ukwenza imali ukwenza oko.
Everyone knows everyone.	Wonke umntu wazi wonke umntu.
I hope that one day.	Ndiyathemba ukuba ngenye imini.
He didn't know what it was.	Wayengazi ukuba yintoni na.
Staying at home is not possible.	Ukuhlala ekhaya akunakwenzeka.

I'll talk about it later.	Ndiza kuthetha ngayo kamva.
I'm glad to see this.	Ndiyavuya ukubona oku.
So he needs help.	Ngoko ufuna uncedo.
He does not want to talk about this today.	Akafuni kuthetha ngale nto namhlanje.
Or you may have.	Okanye uye waba.
