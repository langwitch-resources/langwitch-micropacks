Not more than him.	Ne više nego on.
At the party.	Na zabavi.
Some of it already exists.	Nešto od toga već postoji.
It doesn't work for me.	Za mene to ne radi.
I was thinking only of myself.	Mislio sam samo na sebe.
Yes.	Može.
I didn't want to be here.	Nisam htela da budem ovde.
I've never done that before.	Nikada to ranije nisam radio.
What are you not doing.	Što ne radiš.
It would be good to see the truth.	Bilo bi dobro vidjeti istinu.
It should work.	Trebalo bi da radi.
You have to win.	Morate pobijediti.
He knew as if she had told him.	Znao je kao da mu je rekla.
I wouldn’t like to see what’s out there now.	Ne bih volio da vidim šta je sada tamo.
We can't go on.	Ne možemo dalje.
Really, that’s what we actually do.	Zaista, to je ono što mi zapravo radimo.
He thought only of himself.	Mislio je samo na sebe.
It should be, but it's not.	Trebalo bi da bude, ali nije.
They won't be there.	Oni neće biti tamo.
It's not that we're doing badly.	Nije da nam ide loše.
I'm sorry, but no.	Žao mi je, ali ne.
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
He had to do it now.	Morao je to da uradi sada.
I'll get a job.	Naći ću posao.
Obviously you can't.	Očigledno ne možeš.
It shouldn't be long.	Ne bi trebalo biti dugo.
Nobody had money.	Niko nije imao novca.
And there is much more.	A ima još mnogo toga.
It won't be long.	Neće dugo otići.
I would do that.	Ja bih to uradio.
It would take a long time.	Trebalo bi puno vremena.
I love it too.	I ja to volim.
I can't believe it's mine.	Ne mogu vjerovati da je moja.
I mean obviously.	Mislim očigledno.
I want to be with him more.	Želim više da budem sa njim.
Even if you are alone.	Čak i ako ste sami.
I can do it.	Ja to mogu.
I want to do this as much as she does.	Želim ovo da uradim koliko i ona.
Even now he might be doing it.	Čak i sada možda to radi.
I hope so.	Nadam se da jeste.
Anything can happen, you know.	Sve se može dogoditi, znaš.
It's hard to leave.	Teško je otići.
I told you earlier.	Rekao sam ti ranije.
Or a bad guy.	Ili loš momak.
This or nothing.	Ovo ili ništa.
I wanted them to know that.	Želeo sam da to znaju.
He didn't see so well.	Nije tako dobro vidio.
I had to.	Morao sam.
It was more of an idea.	Bila je to više ideja.
Maybe you're right.	Možda si u pravu.
We are the only ones who still have them.	Mi smo jedini koji ih još uvijek imamo.
She's not here for me.	Ona nije tu zbog mene.
Just not with me.	Samo ne sa mnom.
And they were, indeed.	I bili su, zaista.
Besides, it should work.	Osim toga, trebalo bi da radi.
But so far nothing has happened.	Ali do sada se ništa nije dogodilo.
I know this.	Znam ovo.
The problem is that it was us.	Problem je što smo to bili mi.
He is the only one who is not.	On je jedini koji nije.
There is still much to be done.	Ima još mnogo toga da se uradi.
He's not the first, you know.	Nije prvi, znaš.
This is so good and so easy.	Ovo je tako dobro i tako lako.
He didn't see me.	Nije me video.
We have to work together.	Moramo raditi zajedno.
It's too hard.	Previše je teško.
Do the job.	Raditi posao.
I can't find him.	Ne mogu ga naći.
Nothing was good.	Ništa nije bilo dobro.
That was simply not true.	To jednostavno nije bila istina.
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
I don't know if it will do the job, but it could.	Ne znam da li će to uraditi posao, ali moglo bi.
This is your team.	Ovo je tvoj tim.
I hope you are the real one.	Nadam se da ste vi pravi.
And you did well.	I dobro ste uradili.
Works on anything.	Radi na bilo čemu.
We need more.	Treba nam više.
I knew immediately that there was nothing.	Odmah sam znao da nema ništa.
It's working for me right now.	Trenutno mi radi.
That's it!.	To je to!.
There! 	Tamo!
Not so now.	Sada nije tako.
I mean, you saw it.	Mislim, video si to.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
It will only get better.	Samo će biti bolje.
But there was much more.	Ali bilo je mnogo više.
That's the way.	To je način.
I saw it wasn't.	Video sam da nije.
It seems to have worked so far.	Čini se da je do sada radio.
Until next time.	Sve do sljedećeg puta.
You will go to school.	Ići ćeš u školu.
But they said no.	Ali oni su rekli ne.
It's pretty simple.	Prilično je jednostavno.
Not yet.	Za sada nije.
I hope not.	Nadam se da nije.
He liked to do things.	Voleo je da radi stvari.
Or we'll leave too.	Ili ćemo i mi otići.
I wish that were true.	Voleo bih da je to istina.
This is the first time this has happened.	Ovo je prvi put da se to dogodilo.
They are not who and what you are.	Oni nisu ko i šta ste vi.
He came home.	Došao je kući.
He made her feel safe.	Učinio je da se osjeća sigurno.
I've left three times already.	Otišao sam već tri puta.
It must be true.	Mora da je istina.
I thought you were too.	I ja sam mislio da jesi.
He asked me.	Zamolio me je.
He loves you completely.	On te potpuno voli.
But it is not easy to do.	Ali to nije lako učiniti.
I do not know how.	Ne znam kako.
Now I know what it is.	Sada znam šta je to.
You know, we can do it.	Znaš, mi to možemo.
Better is better.	Bolje je bolje.
Why do you want to do this?	Zašto želiš ovo da uradiš?
They will tell you what cannot be done and why.	Oni će vam reći šta se ne može učiniti i zašto.
We have been for some time.	Mi smo već neko vrijeme.
You don't know either.	Ni ti ne znaš.
That's what a friend told me.	To mi je prijatelj rekao.
He worked, worked and worked more.	Radio je, radio i radio još.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
And I have a job.	I imam posao.
Nobody saw anything wrong with that.	Niko nije video ništa loše u tome.
I want to tell you this.	Želim ti ovo reći.
You knew that.	Znao si to.
She can't help it.	Ona ne može pomoći.
It's so easy.	Tako je lako.
You couldn't know.	Nisi mogao znati.
I want fun.	Želim zabavu.
You are never alone.	Nikad nisi sam.
Maybe he just went home.	Možda je upravo otišao kući.
Have you said anything yet?	Jeste li već nešto rekli?
I really want him to be here.	Zaista želim da bude ovdje.
But there seems to be more to it than that.	Ali čini se da ovdje ima više od toga.
There is more.	Ima još toga.
You should go now.	Trebao bi ići odmah.
That's what you need.	To je ono što ti treba.
He thought he knew that way now.	Mislio je da sada zna na taj način.
I never said anything like that.	Nikad nisam rekao tako nešto.
This time it may not be as safe as you think.	Ovaj put možda nije tako siguran kao što mislite.
Not even from you.	Čak ni od tebe.
Tomorrow will be better than today, that’s for sure.	Sutra će biti bolje nego danas, to je sigurno.
So much has happened in a few days.	Toliko se toga dogodilo za nekoliko dana.
I don't have any money right now.	Trenutno nemam novca.
I have to go back.	Moram se vratiti.
Happy journey home.	Sretan put kući.
It really couldn't.	Zaista nije moglo.
You weren't the one.	Ti nisi bio taj.
He just needs you.	Samo te treba.
It was good for a little for my life.	Bilo je dobro za malo za moj život.
Obviously, that can't be the case.	Očigledno je da to ne može biti tako.
You're here now.	Sada si ovdje.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
And that can't happen.	A to se ne može dogoditi.
No, just not.	Ne, samo ne.
I hope so.	Nadam se da jeste.
You have to go.	Moraš ići.
I'm like a.	Ja sam kao a.
I should have given you everything.	Trebao sam ti dati sve.
It will never be again.	Nikada više neće biti.
This used to be life.	Nekada je ovo bio život.
I brought this back.	Vratio sam ovo.
I have to get back there, he told himself.	Moram se vratiti tamo, rekao je sebi.
I do it well.	Ja to dobro radim.
He was glad he wasn't.	Bilo mu je drago što nije.
Besides, you can't do that.	Osim toga, ne možete to učiniti.
It should be much better this year.	Ove godine bi trebao biti mnogo bolji.
The only thing is.	Jedina stvar je.
He expected all that.	Sve je to očekivao.
Everything works well.	Sve radi dobro.
That will always be true.	To će uvijek biti istina.
That's exactly what he wanted.	To je upravo ono što je želio.
He said it well.	Dobro je rekao.
He was still alone.	I dalje je bio sam.
He thought it would be so.	Mislio je da će biti tako.
Or anything from before.	Ili bilo šta od ranije.
But he knows none of that.	Ali on ne zna ništa od toga.
She is not.	Ona nije.
Tomorrow wouldn't be so bad.	Sutra ne bi bilo tako loše.
They knew it would not be easy for us.	Znali su da nam neće biti lako.
I know it's very good.	Znam da je jako dobro.
He couldn't tell.	Nije mogao reći.
She's never been here before.	Nikad prije nije bila ovdje.
She doesn't think of me.	Ona ne misli na mene.
In fact, everything is so.	Zapravo, sve je tako.
It's not like that at all.	Nije ni malo tako.
No one has ever been there.	Niko nikada nije bio tamo.
In a way that was good.	Na način koji je bio dobar.
You should have known.	Trebalo je znati.
But he is afraid.	Ali on se boji.
He did it.	On je to uradio.
I don't like to be surprised.	Ne volim biti iznenađen.
He was where he was supposed to be.	Bio je tamo gdje je trebao biti.
It's really good.	Zaista je dobro.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
I lost so much time.	Izgubio sam toliko vremena.
This is obviously not happening.	Ovo se očigledno ne dešava.
That's all right.	To je sve u redu.
In fact, it was not difficult.	Zapravo, to nije bilo teško.
But it is not easy.	Ali nije lako.
She knew about him.	Znala je za njega.
But it happens.	Ali to se dešava.
We like it.	Sviđa nam se.
Maybe this one just isn’t for me.	Možda ovaj jednostavno nije za mene.
That can't be bad.	To ne može biti loše.
I asked him.	pitao sam ga.
And that's exactly it.	I to je upravo to.
He saw them.	Video ih je.
I like to be alone.	Volim biti sam.
And at the time, it was a pretty good idea.	I u to vrijeme, to je bila prilično dobra ideja.
Only one team returned.	Samo jedan tim se vratio.
Many years ago this was not true.	Prije mnogo godina to nije bila istina.
But he knows he can't.	Ali on zna da ne može.
You can get anything.	Možete dobiti bilo šta.
He's like you.	On je kao ti.
he asked.	pitao.
There were not many people.	Nije bilo puno ljudi.
I think a lot.	Mislim puno.
Today was much better.	Danas je bilo mnogo bolje.
I know it and you know it.	Ja to znam i ti to znaš.
Nothing seems to have happened here.	Čini se da se ovdje ništa nije dogodilo.
Which he was.	Što je i bio.
I just wanted to say just like that!	Samo sam htio reći samo tako!
But good.	Ali, dobro.
As soon as we can.	Što prije možemo.
But it can't be helped.	Ali ne može se pomoći.
Or we were alone.	Ili smo bili sami.
They weren't into it.	Nisu bili u tome.
Is he.	Je li on.
What we just did.	Šta smo upravo uradili.
I know what to do with it.	Znam šta da radim s tim.
But I just can't.	Ali jednostavno ne mogu.
.	.
You have to be.	Moraš biti.
I was alone in the house.	Bio sam sam u kući.
He will.	On će.
He's everything you weren't.	On je sve što ti nisi bio.
But they were.	Ali bili su.
Anywhere, anytime.	Bilo gdje, bilo kada.
But it takes time.	Ali za to treba vremena.
That's not no either.	Ni to nije ne.
I know it's him.	Znam da je on.
He just doesn’t think about these things.	On jednostavno ne misli na ove stvari.
It wasn't meant to be.	To nije trebalo biti.
Indeed, they may not be.	Zaista, možda i nisu.
We never knew what to do.	Nikad nismo znali šta da radimo.
I've done this before.	Radio sam ovo ranije.
He said it was true.	Rekao je da je istina.
I saw myself.	Video sam sebe.
That’s what’s so hard.	To je ono što je tako teško.
That was my only hope.	To je bila moja jedina nada.
And she loves it.	I ona to voli.
You never told me that much.	Nikad mi nisi toliko rekao.
And that would be it.	I to bi bilo.
Really good question.	Zaista dobro pitanje.
But no, I don't know what I am.	Ali ne, ne znam šta sam.
And maybe it's okay.	I možda je u redu.
He had never done that before.	Nikada prije to nije radio.
I do not know.	Ne znam.
But no further.	Ali ne dalje.
And it should be.	I trebao bi biti.
Not so bad.	Nije tako loše.
I have a few.	Imam nekoliko.
And he's good.	I on je dobar.
To do this.	Da uradiš ovo.
But! 	Ali!
He is a good man, really good.	On je dobar čovjek, zaista dobar.
He had no idea how long.	Nije imao pojma koliko dugo.
I can do it alone.	Mogu sama.
But you are a man too.	Ali i ti si čovjek.
I'm a friend.	Ja sam prijatelj.
Money, he says.	Novac, kaže.
But you don't know.	Ali ne znaš.
This just works.	Ovo samo radi.
But don't say that.	Ali ne govori to.
Something needed to be given.	Nešto je trebalo dati.
He was a father.	On je bio otac.
It's just hard for me to say.	Samo mi je teško reći.
I haven't seen him in thirty years.	Nisam ga vidio trideset godina.
Or it could be.	Ili bi mogao biti.
He heard something.	Čuo je nešto.
That was my thing.	To je bila moja stvar.
Now I have nothing about it.	Sada nemam ništa o tome.
I have no idea if that's true.	Nemam pojma da li je to istina.
She has it now, she knows it.	Ona ga sada ima, zna to.
I don't think they knew anything.	Mislim da ništa nisu znali.
She doesn't want to go.	Ona ne želi da ide.
I don't think so.	Mislim da nisu.
I can not see you.	Ne mogu da te vidim.
They are here today, they are gone tomorrow.	Danas su tu, sutra ih nema.
I can not.	Ne mogu.
None of us was ready for what happened next.	Niko od nas nije bio spreman za ono što se dalje dogodilo.
We need it now.	Treba nam odmah.
Nobody, never.	Niko, nikad.
And that is exactly what is happening now.	I upravo se to sada dešava.
Don't talk about it anymore.	Nemoj više o tome.
Very good.	Vrlo dobar.
I was ready.	Bio sam spreman.
I'm sure something is wrong here too.	Siguran sam da i tu nešto nije u redu.
So tired.	Tako umoran .
Obviously this is not the case.	Očigledno to nije tako.
I thought it was just a game and I didn’t know any better.	Mislio sam da se samo igra i da ne znam ništa bolje.
Good for us.	Dobro za nas.
Obviously that won't happen.	Očigledno se to neće dogoditi.
I'm not going to get away from it.	Neću otići od toga.
That's how the story goes.	Tako priča ide.
I couldn't do that, until now.	Nisam to mogao učiniti, do sada.
She will see for herself what happened.	Sama će vidjeti šta je bilo.
What he said was that he should do what he loves.	Ono što je rekao je da treba da radi ono što voli.
I thought he did a really good job there.	Mislio sam da je tamo uradio zaista dobar posao.
It was last year.	Bilo je to prošle godine.
You shouldn't have.	Nisi trebao.
Maybe there are too many of us.	Možda nas je previše.
You just aren't.	Jednostavno nisi.
No, it was someone.	Ne, to je bio neko.
You have to go.	Moraš otići.
Obviously, he didn't.	Očigledno, on to nije učinio.
You can't win.	Ne možeš pobijediti.
I had it.	Imao sam ga.
Not even a little.	Čak ni malo.
You're not there yet.	Još nisi tamo.
I can only say.	Mogu samo reći.
He loves you very much.	On te jako voli.
As it was, there weren’t many problems.	Kako je bilo, nije bilo mnogo problema.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
No, that wasn't it either.	Ne, ni to nije bilo to.
No, nothing tonight.	Ne, ništa večeras.
We have all that.	Imamo sve to.
We need more.	Treba nam više.
I would hear them.	Čuo bih ih.
That doesn't do any good.	To ne čini dobro.
It's almost there now.	Sada je skoro tu.
We never had much money.	Nikada nismo imali mnogo novca.
Whether we need it or not, we have to buy it.	Trebali nam to ili ne, moramo ga kupiti.
Even when we are alone, we are never alone.	Čak i kada smo sami, nikada nismo sami.
He just didn't know how much.	Samo nije znao koliko.
Obviously there was no problem.	Očigledno tu nije bilo problema.
She talks a little.	Ona malo govori.
Just not today.	Samo ne danas.
You didn't ask for that.	Nisi to tražio.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
Maybe she herself didn't know.	Možda ni ona sama nije znala.
What is today.	Šta je danas.
I'm glad you're here with me.	Drago mi je da si ovdje sa mnom.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikome nije rekao.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
Life was good again.	Život je ponovo bio dobar.
That would be my father.	To bi bio moj otac.
I know this would not be enough.	Znam da ovo ne bi bilo dovoljno.
I know how to know.	Znam kako da znam.
And before that another one.	A prije toga još jedan.
We didn't know what to do.	Nismo znali šta da radimo.
But he knew he wasn't.	Ali znao je da nije.
This is my first.	To je moj prvi.
Nothing is good or bad.	Ništa nije dobro ili loše.
But we didn't.	Ali nismo.
I bought this one, this one and this one.	Kupio sam ovaj, ovaj i ovaj.
I love it very much.	Volim to jako.
But it seems to go beyond that.	Ali čini se da to ide dalje od toga.
This year they are again.	Ove godine su ponovo.
Maybe not much, maybe long.	Možda ne mnogo, možda dugo.
Everyone said that.	Svi su to rekli.
I did exactly as you said.	Uradio sam tačno kako si rekao.
We know where you've been.	Znamo gdje si bio.
But don't tell him that.	Ali nemoj mu to reći.
You are life to me.	Ti si za mene život.
I do not know.	Ne znam.
They could stay for a while, and maybe not.	Mogli bi ostati neko vrijeme, a možda i ne.
I had a lot to tell him.	Imao sam mnogo toga da mu kažem.
This never really happened.	Ovo se zapravo nikada nije dogodilo.
He'll be right back.	Odmah će se vratiti.
And, you know, he's right.	I, znate, on je u pravu.
Not now or never.	Ne sada ili nikad.
I'm done with that.	Završio sam s tim.
Not how many times something happened, but whether it ever happened.	Ne koliko se puta nešto dogodilo, već da li se ikada dogodilo.
I'm your friend.	Ja sam tvoj prijatelj.
It's your money.	To je tvoj novac.
He wanted to be both.	Želio je biti oboje.
It's just not safe.	Jednostavno nije sigurno.
It will come to you.	Doći će do tebe.
It's really good.	Zaista je dobro.
I can't go anymore.	Više ne mogu ići.
He just plays everything.	On jednostavno svira sve.
He couldn't either, but he wanted to.	Nije mogao ni on, ali je htio.
You will do that.	To ćeš uraditi.
I didn't want to see you, she said.	Nisam htela da te vidim, rekla je.
That should help a lot.	To bi trebalo mnogo da pomogne.
I think he's ready to deal with it.	Mislim da je spreman da se nosi sa tim.
Which was certainly not often.	Što sigurno nije bilo često.
It was hard to see.	Bilo je teško vidjeti.
That is easy.	To je lako.
There was no help for that.	Za to nije bilo pomoći.
We need better.	Moramo bolje.
This tells us a few things.	Ovo nam govori nekoliko stvari.
I worked for it.	Radio sam za to.
I loved going there.	Voleo sam da idem tamo.
So far so good.	Za sada je bilo dobro.
He wondered how many times he had said that.	Pitao se koliko je puta to rekao.
That was never true.	To nikad nije bila istina.
But he never did anything.	Ali on nikada ništa nije uradio.
And not exactly.	I ne baš tako.
She didn't tell me.	Nije mi rekla.
And in everyone.	I u svima.
We have this.	Imamo ovo.
You may have to be.	Možda ćete morati biti.
He wants us to have a new team.	Želi da imamo novi tim.
And she's not here.	A ona nije ovdje.
Except it is.	Osim što jeste.
This is something you don't want to do.	Ovo je nešto što ne želite da radite.
It all works well.	To sve dobro radi.
I was really surprised.	Bio sam zaista iznenađen.
I know it's only a matter of time.	Znam da je samo pitanje vremena.
But nothing is easy here.	Ali ovdje ništa nije lako.
I can't give you anything.	Ne mogu ti ništa dati.
If not, that's fine too.	Ako ne, i to je u redu.
.	.
She didn't know it was her.	Nije znala da je to ona.
Probably better than ever.	Vjerovatno bolje od bilo koga.
You can't tell anyone.	Ne možeš nikome reći.
I've never heard of him.	Nikad nisam čuo za njega.
Now the question is, how?	Sada je pitanje, kako?
I just know it.	Ja to jednostavno znam.
He never loved you.	Nikada te nije volio.
Not that ever.	Nije da bi ikada.
I said no.	Rekao sam ne.
If the thing works long enough.	Ako stvar radi dovoljno dugo.
But she never told you the truth.	Ali ti nikad nije rekla istinu.
Now he was sure of it.	Sada je bio siguran u to.
You are so good.	Ti si tako dobar.
We have too much stuff.	Imamo previše stvari.
I just didn't want to see them again.	Jednostavno nisam htela da ih ponovo vidim.
That's why we're here.	Zbog toga smo ovdje.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
But it was difficult.	Ali to je bilo teško.
This should have been done.	Trebalo je ovo uraditi.
But he can't.	Ali ne može.
I always say.	Ja uvek kažem.
Only it was much more than that.	Samo što je to bilo mnogo više od toga.
We don't work.	Ne radimo.
Or 'just'.	Ili 'samo'.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
I couldn't have them.	Nisam ih mogao.
You either like it or you don't.	Ili ti se sviđa ili ne.
It better be with.	Bolje da je sa.
He thought he could help.	Mislio je da može pomoći.
Or even both.	Ili čak oboje.
But, you know.	Ali, znate,.
She didn't want to.	Nije htela.
There is no time for that now.	Nema vremena za to sada.
This is not true.	Ovo nije istina.
But I am.	Ali sam.
Or they won't.	Ili neće.
One on one.	Jedan na jedan.
I'm not sure what to do.	Nisam siguran šta da radim.
My father lives alone at home.	Moj otac živi sam kod kuće.
If you want, we can do it here.	Ako želite, možemo to učiniti ovdje.
Maybe I don't even know.	Možda ni ne znam.
I wish it wasn't.	Voleo bih da nije.
I say no.	Ja kažem ne.
I bought it for you.	Kupio sam to za tebe.
But no, there it is.	Ali ne, tu je.
Things in the house.	Stvari u kući.
They couldn't be.	Nisu mogli biti.
It won't be now.	Neće biti sada.
Nobody likes to do this job.	Niko ne voli da radi ovaj posao.
We don't need it.	Ne treba nam.
They certainly didn't.	Sigurno nisu.
I'm not leaving.	Neću otići.
It has never been bad for us.	Za nas to nikada nije bilo loše.
What? 	Šta?
she said.	ona je rekla.
Unless you want to go back to work.	Osim ako se ne želiš vratiti na posao.
Today that is not true.	Danas to nije istina.
In fact, he doesn't drive.	U stvari, on ne vozi.
There's a lot of money there.	Tamo je mnogo novca.
And he asked.	I pitao je.
But this can happen.	Ali ovo se može dogoditi.
But there was more.	Ali bilo je više.
I mean, that's what he said he meant.	Mislim, to je ono što je rekao da misli.
Like the day before.	Kao i dan ranije.
I mean, a lot of money.	Mislim, puno novca.
Maybe.	Možda.
Only you can see her.	Samo je ti možeš vidjeti.
So far we can see what works and what doesn't.	Do sada možemo vidjeti šta radi, a šta ne.
How you want.	Kako želiš.
That's how it's done.	Tako se to radi.
Unless.	Osim ako nije.
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
Really.	Zaista.
What is not obvious is why.	Ono što nije očigledno je zašto.
But it wasn't that bad.	Ali to nije bilo tako loše.
I should help with that.	Trebao bih pomoći u tome.
I mean, it's not good at all.	Mislim, uopšte nije dobro.
I don't want to be friends with you.	Ne želim da budem prijatelj sa tobom.
But it makes me.	Ali to me čini.
No one had.	Niko nije imao.
If you say so.	Ako ti tako kažeš.
He'll probably be back for more.	Vjerovatno će se vratiti po još mnogo toga.
He had to be fine.	Morao je biti dobro.
I've never seen him before.	Nikada ga ranije nisam vidio.
It seemed pretty simple.	Činilo se prilično jednostavno.
And it is now.	I to je sada.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
That was not quite true.	To nije bilo baš tačno.
I need help.	Treba mi pomoć.
I could have gone any way.	Mogao sam ići na bilo koji način.
Obviously, do everything you can.	Očigledno, uradite sve što možete.
You don't have to anymore.	Ne moraš više.
I really saw her.	Zaista sam je vidio.
And it looks like that.	I izgleda tako.
But not only that.	Ali ne samo to.
It seemed a little too easy.	Činilo se malo previše lako.
This is the job he wanted.	Ovo je posao koji je želio.
He couldn't say anything.	Nije mogao ništa reći.
You should do it soon.	Trebao bi to uskoro.
We have it now.	Sada ga imamo.
This is not helpful.	Ovo nije od pomoći.
This is something that is already happening.	To je nešto što se već dešava.
He didn't do it.	On to nije uradio.
He said nothing.	Nije rekao ništa.
He knows nothing better.	On ne zna ništa bolje.
I wonder when this will happen.	Pitam se kada će se ovo dogoditi.
No, now even more so.	Ne, sada još više.
We have to do something.	Moramo nešto da uradimo.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
I can believe that.	Mogu vjerovati u to.
Which could be bad.	Što bi moglo biti loše.
He was just a guy.	Bio je samo momak.
She says nothing.	Ona ne govori ništa.
And nothing happens.	I ništa se ne dešava.
And fast.	I to brzo.
I like that she wanted to do anything with me.	Sviđa mi se što je htela da uradi bilo šta sa mnom.
And how much.	I koliko.
Just my code.	Samo moj kod.
Nobody has anything.	Niko nema ništa.
And further.	I dalje.
They know it's better there.	Oni znaju da je tamo bolje.
I guess we could do that.	Pretpostavljam da bismo to mogli.
He lost his job.	Izgubio je posao.
The next one will come to me.	Sljedeće će doći kod mene.
There should be many more.	Trebalo bi ih biti mnogo više.
He didn't want to be.	Nije želeo da bude.
He doesn't need to.	On ne treba.
As ever.	Kao i uvijek.
I may never return.	Možda se nikada neću vratiti.
So it can't be that bad.	Tako da ne može biti tako loše.
I'm still pretty busy.	Još uvijek sam prilično zauzet.
It was time for work.	Bilo je vrijeme za posao.
They won't help you.	Oni ti neće pomoći.
That was wrong.	To nije bilo u redu.
This time nothing happened.	Ovaj put se ništa nije dogodilo.
It may not be long.	To možda neće biti dugo.
I couldn't see them.	Nisam ih mogao vidjeti.
He is not the first to do so.	Nije prvi koji je to učinio.
You weren't here.	Ti nisi bio ovdje.
And much, much more.	I mnogo, mnogo više.
I realized that was true.	Shvatio sam da je to istina.
They only want money for three weeks.	Novac želite samo tri sedmice.
I'm not sure that's okay.	Nisam siguran da je to u redu.
Live now !.	Sada živi!.
Just tell me what's going on with you.	Samo mi reci šta se dešava sa tobom.
Obviously, maybe not.	Očigledno, možda neće.
But it's fast.	Ali to je brzo.
I like to be helpful.	Volim biti od pomoći.
That's what you do.	To je ono što radiš.
Pretty much.	Prilično.
That's the only way.	To je jedini put.
If you weren't.	Da nisi.
Yes, we know.	Da, znamo.
I could leave now.	Mogao bih sada otići.
He realized that immediately.	To je odmah shvatio.
It often seems like nothing.	Često to izgleda kao ništa.
You should be safe now.	Sada bi trebao biti siguran.
I think it's me.	Mislim da sam to ja.
That cannot be allowed.	To se ne može dozvoliti.
He said the car hadn't been there before.	Rekao je da auto prije nije bio tamo.
I never knew.	Nikad nisam znao.
He should leave and he should leave immediately.	Trebao bi otići i trebao bi otići odmah.
You should do it.	Trebao bi to uraditi.
I have to say.	Moram reći.
It couldn't be easy.	To nije moglo biti lako.
It was tomorrow.	Bila je sutra.
I just needed to say yes.	Trebao sam samo da kažem da.
I got you.	Imam te.
There is little more to say.	Ima još malo šta da se kaže.
You could buy anything there.	Tamo si mogao kupiti bilo šta.
They can be me.	Oni mogu biti ja.
And that should be enough.	I to bi trebalo biti dovoljno.
He's fine tonight.	On je dobro večeras.
The only question is ‘when’.	Pitanje je samo 'kada'.
But he doesn't see.	Ali on ne vidi.
It's been a long time.	Prilično je dugo.
He was fine.	Bio je u redu.
Fast and secure, that’s the way it’s done.	Brzo i sigurno, to je način na koji se to radi.
I don't need a job that much.	Ne treba mi posao toliko.
It's hard to see.	Teško je to vidjeti.
Be like.	Biti kao.
He didn't get any further.	Nije stigao dalje.
There is more.	Ima još toga.
I never wanted you, you know.	Nikad te nisam želeo, znaš.
He didn't know that.	On to nije znao.
So we can never know.	Tako da nikada ne možemo znati.
It must be him.	To mora biti on.
He knows what he can do.	On zna šta može.
All he could see now was himself.	Sve što je sada mogao da vidi bio je on sam.
No, no, no.	Ne, ne, ne.
That's my problem.	To je moj problem.
He never did that to me.	Nikad mi to nije uradio.
I think more than anyone in the house.	Mislim više od bilo koga u kući.
There was something about how they were together.	Bilo je nešto u tome kako su bili zajedno.
That's just the way it should look.	Samo tako treba da izgleda.
they said.	oni su rekli.
We were .	Bili smo .
We have to do things right.	Moramo da radimo stvari kako treba.
I want to go.	Želim da idem.
And it really is.	I zaista jeste.
So it was now.	Tako je bilo sada.
It will not be easy.	To neće biti lako.
Yes, probably that one.	Da, vjerovatno taj.
I doubt it, but maybe.	Sumnjam, ali možda.
He won't tell me.	Neće mi reći.
Everything seems to be going well.	Čini se da sve ide dobro.
That's not a problem.	To nije problem.
And we both knew why.	I oboje smo znali zašto.
And if I can't, it's not my problem.	A ako ne mogu, nije moj problem.
You will either get it or not.	Ili ćeš ga dobiti ili ne.
But really, there's nothing wrong with that.	Ali zaista, nije ništa loše.
I used to want what you had.	Nekada sam želeo ono što si ti imao.
And so it can.	I tako može.
He did not ask what had happened to him.	Nije pitao šta mu se dogodilo.
And he was.	I on je bio.
Just for now.	Samo za sada.
It actually works.	To zapravo radi.
Someone will come for you.	Neko će doći po tebe.
How long have they been gone.	Koliko dugo ih nije bilo.
It really is often.	Zaista često jeste.
You don't need a reason.	Ne treba ti razlog.
Please, no more.	Molim te, nemoj više.
And that's more than that.	I to je više od toga.
He couldn't tell what it was.	Nije mogao reći šta je to.
But it was nothing to him.	Ali za njega to nije bilo ništa.
It was easy for me to leave.	Bilo mi je lako otići.
The question is not so simple.	Pitanje nije tako jednostavno.
No, it's nothing like that.	Ne, nije ništa tako.
Not even one.	Čak ni jedan.
You sure don't want to.	Sigurno ne želiš.
But we have a job to do.	Ali mi moramo da uradimo posao.
Which is a lot.	Što je mnogo.
But that someone wouldn't be me.	Ali taj neko ne bih bio ja.
But that's okay too.	Ali i to je u redu.
It is not enough to just know this.	Nije dovoljno samo znati ovo.
I'm done now.	Sada sam završio.
Mine isn't.	Moj nije.
He couldn't go home.	Nije mogao kući.
But she didn't know if anyone went with him.	Ali da nije znala da li je neko otišao s njim.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
I think we have a problem.	Mislim da imamo problema.
That happened today.	To se dogodilo danas.
She told him the truth.	Rekla mu je istinu.
Not enough for.	Nije dovoljno za .
This never happens.	Ovo se nikada ne dešava.
It was so fast.	Bilo je tako brzo.
But now he's gone too.	Ali sada i njega nema.
I'll probably say yes.	Verovatno ću reći da.
How good of you to be here.	Kako je dobro od tebe što si ovde.
If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.	Ako želite da se nešto uradi kako treba, morate to učiniti sami.
I need to talk to you.	Moram razgovarati s tobom.
What is this? 	Šta je ovo?
He's wasted enough time already.	Već je izgubio dovoljno vremena.
I know you better than that.	Znam te bolje od toga.
I'm sure you can do that.	Siguran sam da to možeš.
It is also true that we have been here before.	Istina je i da smo već bili ovdje.
He didn't need it.	Nije mu trebao.
You were really good.	Bio si stvarno dobar.
Obviously it wasn't real life.	Očigledno to nije bio pravi život.
And so it takes some time.	I tako treba neko vrijeme.
if for any.	ako za bilo koji.
I thought.	Mislio sam.
I think we need more of that.	Mislim da nam treba više toga.
You should be safe here.	Ovdje bi trebali biti sigurni.
And there he was.	I tamo je bio.
You are alone.	Vi ste sami.
That is what it is.	To je ono što jeste.
Was it none of that.	Je li to bilo ništa od toga.
It was hard to find a job.	Bilo je teško naći posao.
Usually not much.	Obično ne mnogo.
But you have to see for yourself.	Ali morate to sami vidjeti.
Maybe better than that.	Možda i bolje od toga.
A long time ago.	Prije mnogo vremena.
But it was difficult.	Ali bilo je teško.
I can't find him now.	Ne mogu ga sada naći.
We don't know enough.	Ne znamo dovoljno.
It's not an idea.	Nije ideja.
That is not happening now.	To se sada ne dešava.
Probably never, actually.	Verovatno nikad, zapravo.
He just knows that.	To samo zna.
She was right, you know.	Bila je u pravu, znaš.
I couldn't ask him anything.	Nisam mogao ništa da ga pitam.
That was the way a man should do it.	To je bio način na koji bi čovjek morao učiniti.
But it is.	Ali jeste.
Me too.	I ja sam.
I have my own car.	Imam svoj auto.
You are my friend.	Ti si moj prijatelj.
There's work.	Tu je posao.
I bought it again.	Ja sam ga ponovo kupio.
I don't see a reason why you can't.	Ne vidim razlog zašto ne možeš.
I think he's there.	Mislim da je tamo.
What was beyond that, they had no idea.	Šta je bilo dalje od toga, nisu imali pojma.
So far I have done well.	Do sada sam radio dobro.
But that was no longer the case.	Ali to više nije bilo tako.
He can do almost anything.	Može skoro sve.
There is something else.	Postoji još nešto.
Not anymore.	Ne više.
And it’s actually pretty hard.	I zapravo je prilično teško.
I shouldn't have known more than that.	Nisam trebao znati više od toga.
It’s actually pretty good.	Zapravo je prilično dobro.
Nothing is fast enough.	Ništa nije dovoljno brzo.
One man has a problem, one doesn't.	Jedan čovjek ima problem, jedan nema.
But even this is quite unlikely.	Ali i ovo je prilično malo vjerovatno.
It shouldn't have, but it did.	Nije trebalo, ali jeste.
And that was it.	I to je bilo to.
He would tell me a little.	Malo bi mi rekao.
You're never here again.	Nikad više nisi tu.
I'll come tonight.	Doći ću večeras.
I don't need anyone.	Ne treba mi niko.
That was easy to do.	To je bilo lako uraditi.
I'm sure it will be.	Siguran sam da će biti.
But you will.	Ali hoćeš.
Could this be a problem?	Može li ovo biti problem?
I have it here.	Imam ga ovdje.
There is still much to be done.	Ima još mnogo toga da se uradi.
Completely without him.	Potpuno bez njega.
Not so much in a bad way.	Ne toliko na loš način.
For both of us.	Za nas oboje.
Very difficult.	Veoma teško.
How hard it is to say them.	Koliko ih je teško reći.
I can't say if it's good or bad.	Ne mogu reći da li je dobro ili loše.
That should be it.	To bi trebalo biti.
No problem.	Nema problema.
You have to tell me what's going on here.	Moraš mi reći šta se ovde dešava.
I didn't even know you were here.	Nisam ni znao da si ovde.
It was very hard to be here.	Bilo je jako teško biti ovdje.
We have enough of them.	Imamo ih dovoljno.
But that was good enough.	Ali to je bilo dovoljno dobro.
It's enough.	Dovoljno je.
He was safe here.	Ovdje je bio siguran.
I love him more than him.	Više volim njega nego njega.
There must be a story in that.	Mora da postoji priča u tome.
Not at any time.	Ne bilo kada.
They didn't tell me anything about it.	Nisu mi ništa rekli o tome.
Do you have to go?	Moraš li ići?
It is.	Da jeste.
You just don't need it anymore.	Jednostavno ti više ne treba.
And he would.	I on bi.
We have to do something.	Moramo nešto učiniti.
Years.	Godine.
It's not that hard to do.	To nije tako teško uraditi.
Not just this question.	Ne samo ovo pitanje.
I see them.	Vidim ih.
I was happy to have him there.	Bio sam sretan što sam ga imao tamo.
But I can't do it that way.	Ali ne mogu nas na taj način.
But he could not stay in the house.	Ali nije mogao ostati u kući.
This was true.	Ovo je bilo tačno.
How old are you?	Koliko imaš godina?
Everything happens.	Sve se dešava.
I am nothing.	Ja sam ništa.
You think you can do anything !.	Misliš da možeš sve!.
And about us.	I o nama.
We didn't have much time.	Nismo imali puno vremena.
, no.	, ne.
We are glad you are here !.	Drago nam je što ste ovdje!.
I really didn't know what to think.	Zaista nisam znao šta da mislim.
But the money would be nice.	Ali novac bi bio dobar.
And you can't do anything.	I ne možeš ništa.
There is a reason.	Tu je razlog.
It's simple, really.	Jednostavno je, zaista.
It may not work for you.	Za tebe možda neće.
He never knew.	Nikada nije znao.
You should too.	I ti bi trebao.
It must be bad for me to do that.	Mora da je loše da to uradim.
Yes, he's fine.	Da, on je dobro.
It's been a while.	Već neko vrijeme.
I thought this was correct.	Mislio sam da je ovo tačno.
Maybe it was before.	Možda je bilo i ranije.
I said that.	Rekao sam to.
Something is not quite right here.	Nešto ovdje nije potpuno tačno.
It seems like nothing is going right for him.	Čini se kao da mu ništa ne ide kako treba.
They just didn't know.	Jednostavno nisu znali.
She was at home.	Bila je kod kuće.
No one will come.	Niko neće doći.
That's it.	To je to.
It can't be helped.	Ne može se pomoći.
So much more.	Toliko više.
There are more of them than ever before.	Ima ih više nego ikada prije.
He seemed to mean it.	Činilo se da je to mislio.
I really don't know why.	Zaista ne znam zašto.
You just did that.	Upravo si to uradio.
Nobody knew that.	To niko nije znao.
Someone like.	Neko kao.
I don't think so.	Mislim ne baš.
In that time.	U to vrijeme.
He knew immediately that it had to be true.	Odmah je znao da to mora biti istina.
He decided not to.	Odlučio je da to ne uradi.
I won't say that here.	Neću to reći ovdje.
In fact, much more can be said.	Zapravo, mnogo više se može reći.
I'll see you tomorrow.	Naći ćemo se sutra.
We need rain.	Treba nam kiša.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Svi su znali da će on biti tamo.
He could do anything.	Mogao je sve.
I just didn't know what to do.	Jednostavno nisam znao šta da radim.
It didn't start well.	Nije dobro počeo.
Something bad.	Nešto loše.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
But if.	Ali ako.
I made it look like that.	Napravio sam da tako izgleda.
But he wanted to know more.	Ali želio je znati više.
That is not enough.	To nije dovoljno.
I would never do that at home.	Nikad to ne bih uradio kod kuće.
I'm here tomorrow.	Ja sam ovde sutra.
I'll just tell him.	Samo ću mu reći.
I like that from time to time.	Sviđa mi se to s vremena na vrijeme.
It could have been anyone.	Mogao je biti bilo ko.
But that is the question of the people.	Ali to je pitanje ljudi.
No, really, you have to.	Ne, stvarno, moraš.
Everything will be fine.	Sve će biti u redu.
I think you will.	Mislim da hoćeš.
Maybe you should go.	Možda bi trebao otići.
If anyone can help me.	Ako mi neko može pomoći.
In fact, it's really quite simple.	U stvari, to je zaista prilično jednostavno.
I would too.	I ja bih bio.
But this must be done in the right way.	Ali ovo se mora uraditi na pravi način.
It is very, very difficult.	To je veoma, veoma teško.
I hope it works for you !.	Nadam se da radi za vas!.
And if not.	A ako ne.
I knew you were doing one.	Znao sam da radiš jedan.
He wouldn't ask again.	Ne bi ponovo pitao.
But she knows it.	Ali ona to zna.
Something like that can't be.	Tako nešto ne može biti.
But she was at home.	Ali bila je kod kuće.
In fact, he preferred it.	Zapravo, više je volio.
That's right.	Tako smo.
The car looked good.	Auto je dobro izgledao.
Even if the problem is .	Čak i ako je problem .
Simple and good.	Jednostavno i dobro.
It's not easy.	Nije lako.
Probably is.	Vjerovatno jeste.
I am here.	Ja sam ovde.
This was not real.	Ovo nije bilo stvarno.
That's what she said.	Tako je ona to rekla.
Indeed, we know.	Zaista, znamo.
I don't love her.	Ne volim je.
I say no, you won't.	Ja kažem ne, ti nećeš.
Me and me and me and me.	Ja i ja i ja i ja.
This must be the reason.	Ovo mora da je razlog.
We won't talk about it anymore.	Nećemo sada više o tome.
I've heard it myself.	I sam sam to čuo.
They used to be able to.	Nekada su mogli.
He had never done that before.	Nikad to ranije nije radio.
She didn't know who the man was.	Nije znala ko je taj čovjek.
The thing will happen.	Stvar će se dogoditi.
What year is it now?	Koja je sada godina?
That was the only way.	To je bio jedini način.
No, it was more than that.	Ne, bilo je više od toga.
You really should know that.	Zaista bi to trebao znati.
But now, there is nothing.	Ali sada, nema ništa.
Too many people.	Previše ljudi.
No one did, as far as he knew.	Niko nije, koliko je on znao.
If that's what you want.	Ako je to ono što želiš.
He told me .	On mi je rekao .
If they are here.	Ako su ovde.
You can tell me.	Možeš mi reći.
But that probably didn’t happen.	Ali to se nije vjerovatno dogodilo.
I didn't even see it.	Nisam ni vidio.
It's real now.	Sada je stvarno.
But he was much more than that.	Ali on je bio mnogo više od toga.
You heard her.	Čuo si je.
That car is going fast.	Taj auto ide brzo.
No one would say anything.	Niko ništa ne bi rekao.
But no one knows how much it is.	Ali niko ne zna koliko je to.
I have to be here.	Moram da budem ovde.
But they didn't tell him.	Ali nisu mu rekli.
No, it can't be.	Ne, ne može biti.
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno si u pravu.
So you never know.	Tako da nikad ne znaš.
I had no one to go with.	Nisam imao s kim da idem.
I don't know them all.	Ne znam ih sve.
I can’t really be with him and work a lot.	Ne mogu stvarno biti s njim i puno raditi.
I think that's what's wrong with me.	Mislim da je to ono što nije u redu sa mnom.
And that it could be.	I da bi moglo biti.
You really were.	Stvarno si bio.
I don't mean that.	Ne mislim to.
That's not so bad.	To nije tako loše.
Not this.	Ne i ovo.
And there is more.	I ima još toga.
She is not afraid.	Ne boji se.
He went after it and got it.	Otišao je za njim i dobio ga.
I don't want to see that thing ever again.	Ne želim da vidim tu stvar više ikada.
The problem was that there were so many of them.	Problem je bio u tome što ga je bilo toliko.
Not that we do.	Nije da to radimo.
You don't know.	Vi ne znate.
It was only a matter of time.	Bilo je samo pitanje vremena.
I'm alone now.	Sada sam sam.
I doubt much will be done.	Sumnjam da će se mnogo uraditi.
This is.	Ovo je.
Not what he was looking for.	Ne ono što je tražio.
I've never been here before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio ovde.
I didn't know what to do there.	Nisam znao šta da radim tamo.
It's really simple.	Zaista je jednostavno.
But it won't.	Ali neće.
I see nothing but money.	Ne vidim ništa osim novca.
Enough is never wrong.	Nikad dovoljno nije u redu.
I have time.	Imam vremena.
They were probably right.	Verovatno su bili u pravu.
Here the work is busy.	Ovdje je posao zauzet.
Alone.	Sama.
We like him better.	On nam se više sviđa.
It's not safe.	Nije sigurno.
No one knows what you want except you.	Niko ne zna šta želiš osim tebe.
And that was true.	I to je bila istina.
It was necessary.	Trebalo je.
He'll probably leave.	Verovatno će otići.
I was completely alone.	Bio sam potpuno sam.
And that is true.	I to je tačno.
Nobody actually says that.	Niko to zapravo ne govori.
We will go.	Ići ćemo.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
He says he will find the money.	Kaže da će naći novac.
This is him.	Ovo je on.
They really were.	Zaista su bili.
He always talks.	On uvek priča.
My car is not working properly.	Moj auto ne radi kako treba.
I will never do that again.	Nikad to više neću uraditi.
But not much.	Ali ne i puno.
This is not very good, but it is better.	Ovo nije baš dobro, ali je bolje.
He knew they knew something he didn't.	Znao je da oni znaju nešto što on nije znao.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
And maybe he knows how he is.	I možda zna kako mu je.
Life goes on.	Život ide dalje.
The first and only.	Prvi i jedini.
There is only one of you.	Postoji samo jedan od vas.
It won't be okay.	Neće biti u redu.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
He is often right.	Često je u pravu.
He's not doing anything for you.	Ne radi ništa za tebe.
I see myself doing this often.	Vidim sebe kako to često radim.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Bolje je malo novca nego bez novca.
I never got the money.	Nikad nisam dobio novac.
I ask her why she does that.	Pitam je zašto to radi.
And that says something.	I to nešto govori.
He didn't want to be there anymore.	Nije želio više biti tamo.
You told me you were.	Rekao si mi da jesi.
But there is no way to really do that.	Ali ne postoji način da se to zaista uradi.
That's what we need.	To je ono što nam treba.
He doesn't love me.	On me ne voli.
This has never happened before.	To se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
Today, not tomorrow.	Danas, ne sutra.
I didn't look well.	Nisam izgledao dobro.
And they.	I oni.
It should have been done many years ago.	Trebalo je to uraditi prije mnogo godina.
We are not sure how to do this.	Nismo sigurni kako to učiniti.
I love you both.	Volim vas oboje.
It wasn't as bad as all that.	Nije bilo tako loše kao sve to.
Which I don't do.	Što ja ne radim.
But it doesn't always work out that way.	Ali ne ide uvijek tako.
And we almost did.	I skoro smo to uradili.
We'll leave early.	Otići ćemo ranije.
And we don't know why.	I ne znamo zašto.
And it happens.	I to se dešava.
Life doesn't usually go that way.	Život obično ne ide tako.
I think that's really the case.	Mislim da je to zaista tako.
Yes, he could have done it.	Da, mogao je to da uradi.
I know you've never seen me before.	Znam da me nikad prije nisi vidio.
He was bad.	Bio je loš.
It is good.	Dobro je.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
In fact, I saw too much.	U stvari, video sam previše.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
He says to do.	Kaže da uradi.
You want some of that.	Nešto od toga hoćeš.
But now I see it.	Ali sada to vidim.
It's hard for me to love him.	Teško mi je da ga volim.
It's pretty easy to do.	To je prilično lako učiniti.
That's what you have to do.	To je ono što morate učiniti.
That's exactly what you said.	Upravo si tako rekao.
He will surely come.	On će sigurno doći.
It's not.	Nije.
Not much.	Nisu mnogo.
And there is a problem in us.	I tu je problem u nama.
But he wouldn't do that.	Ali on to ne bi uradio.
He didn't try to tell me it would be okay.	Nije mi pokušao reći da će biti u redu.
He, in fact, never saw it.	On to, zapravo, nikada nije video.
She wants to live again.	Ona želi ponovo da živi.
Today it seems like it never happened.	Danas kao da se to nikada nije dogodilo.
And she does.	I ona to radi.
We have to do something.	Moramo nešto učiniti.
Maybe that was my problem.	Možda je to bio moj problem.
That's a lot for me.	To je puno za mene.
I just know, that's all.	Samo znam, to je sve.
She would know what to do.	Znala bi šta da radi.
He never did.	Nikad nije.
Will definitely be back.	Sigurno će se vratiti.
He said it so quickly.	Rekao je to tako brzo.
But only here.	Ali samo ovde.
He heard and saw enough.	Čuo je i vidio dovoljno.
One is not too good.	Jedan nije previše dobar.
She is no longer with us.	Ona više nije sa nama.
He did it often.	Često je to radio.
He made it himself.	Sam ga je napravio.
Now was the time.	Sada je bilo vrijeme.
This is all right.	Sve ovo je u redu.
I was sure.	Bio sam siguran.
It wasn't easy, but it was.	Nije bilo lako, ali jeste.
I'm sure you'll be fine.	Siguran sam da ćeš biti dobro.
They could be much better next year.	Mogli bi biti mnogo bolji sljedeće godine.
The question is what next.	Pitanje je šta dalje.
You just can't say anything, you know?	Jednostavno ne možeš reći bilo šta, znaš?
There are very few people.	Vrlo malo ljudi je.
I really love them both.	Zaista ih volim oboje.
My real life.	Moj pravi život.
Much better.	Mnogo bolje.
I hope this can be helpful.	Nadam se da ovo može biti od pomoći.
Sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga.
I said he was fine, and he was.	Rekao sam da je dobro, i bio je.
Probably never.	Vjerovatno nikad.
That simply cannot be true.	To jednostavno ne može biti istina.
That's not really what it's about.	Nije to zapravo ono o čemu se radi.
I just promised to see her there for sure.	Obećao sam samo da ću je tamo sigurno vidjeti.
If so, what is the way to do it.	Ako jeste, koji je način da se to uradi.
I can not believe.	Ne mogu vjerovati.
It no longer exists, it no longer exists.	Više ne postoji, više ne postoji.
So you've never seen that.	Tako da to nikad nisi video.
They weren't.	Nisu bili.
There is much more.	Postoji mnogo više.
It's easy to work with us.	Lako je raditi sa nama.
Not now, not yet.	Ne sada, ne još.
When she wants something done, she wants it done.	Kada želi da se nešto uradi, ona želi da se uradi.
But for me that is not true.	Ali za mene to nije tačno.
It's easy to come by.	Lako je doći.
Do it right, and it exists.	Uradite to kako treba, i postoji.
But he himself could do nothing.	Ali on sam nije mogao ništa.
But it doesn't work this way.	Ali ne radi na ovaj način.
Everything would be fine, he said.	Sve bi bilo u redu, rekao je.
That is what we must do.	To je ono što moramo učiniti.
This is simple.	Ovo je jednostavno.
It's good.	To je dobro.
I couldn't find him.	Nisam ga mogao naći.
All three so.	Sve tri tako.
It's because of the spell.	To je zbog čini.
She told him not to do it anymore.	Rekla mu je da to više ne radi.
And that was it.	I to je bilo.
And that doesn't exist at the moment.	A to trenutno ne postoji.
It's not that money in itself is bad.	Nije da je novac sam po sebi loš.
I wish I had it.	Voleo bih da ga imam.
That's easy to say.	To je lako reći.
They can be very good.	Vrlo dobro mogu biti.
He didn't want her to do this.	Nije želio da ona ovo uradi.
Even this is not enough.	Čak ni ovo nije dovoljno.
Business is getting better.	Posao ide na bolje.
But do something.	Ali uradi nešto.
I don't know when.	Ne znam kada.
But with me or without me, it will happen.	Ali sa mnom ili bez mene, to će se dogoditi.
It was so hard.	Bilo je tako teško.
But it doesn't work this time.	Ali to ovaj put ne radi.
But not easy.	Ali ne lako.
Or not.	Ili ne.
It's something you either do or you don't.	To je nešto što ili radite ili ne radite.
I gave him this.	Dao sam mu ovo.
She will never believe me.	Ona mi nikada neće vjerovati.
I came back for you.	Vratio sam se po tebe.
I am glad.	Drago mi je.
You don't need that.	Ne treba ti to.
You can do this at home, people.	Ovo možete uraditi kod kuće, ljudi.
Maybe that's how it should be.	Možda tako i treba da bude.
But there is not much time for that.	Ali nema puno vremena za to.
Now, do it.	Sada, uradi to.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
Much more in fact.	Mnogo više u stvari.
It can only be given.	Može se samo dati.
It's fast.	Brzo je.
But he would lose.	Ali izgubio bi.
I didn't know what happened.	Nisam znao šta se dogodilo.
But we no longer work for ourselves.	Ali mi više ne radimo za sebe.
No one has done that before.	Niko to ranije nije uradio.
Is anyone else still waiting there?!?	Da li još neko tamo još čeka?!?
You can never win.	Nikad ne možeš pobijediti.
But that didn't really happen.	Ali to se nije baš dogodilo.
That's what he would say.	To bi on rekao.
I think this is a game.	Mislim da je ovo igra.
He could see that.	Mogao je to da vidi.
I don't know who it could be.	Ne znam ko bi to mogao biti.
There will be none of that.	Neće biti ništa od toga.
I had no problem with it.	Nisam imao problema sa njim.
You would probably expect.	Verovatno bi očekivao.
Or a.	Ili a.
Tell me the truth.	Reci mi istinu.
They had very little time.	Imali su vrlo malo vremena.
I'm not sure about this.	Nisam siguran u ovo.
I thought it might be hard, but it’s not.	Mislio sam da bi moglo biti teško, ali nije.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
He had no idea how he did it.	Nije imao pojma kako je to uradio.
That’s all you can do with it.	To je sve što možete učiniti s tim.
There is nothing we can do for now.	Za sada ne možemo ništa učiniti.
It feels good.	Osjeća se dobro.
Any idea would be helpful.	Bilo koja ideja bi bila od pomoći.
Now you know why.	Sada znate zašto.
Can I get a better code.	Mogu li dobiti bolji kod.
He just was.	Samo je bio.
This was life as usual.	Ovo je bio život kao i obično.
We should too.	I mi bi trebali.
Why is he so afraid?	Zašto se toliko boji?
Not for long.	Ne dugo.
She wants you home.	Ona te želi kući.
I would love that too.	I ja bih to voleo.
It is so.	To je tako.
He shouldn't have been surprised.	Nije trebao biti iznenađen.
There are too many of them.	Previše ih je.
None of that happened.	Ništa od toga se nije dogodilo.
Three months now.	Sada tri mjeseca.
I knew there was another one.	Znao sam da postoji još jedan.
We could do a lot to have more money.	Mogli bismo mnogo toga da uradimo da imamo više novca.
Think of life itself.	Misli na sam život.
There is work.	Postoji posao.
This may not be enough.	Ovo možda neće biti dovoljno.
How good.	Kako dobro.
Guys, that should have been said.	Ljudi, to je trebalo reći.
All she knew was that she had to talk to him.	Sve što je znala je da mora razgovarati s njim.
I didn't want this for you.	Nisam želeo ovo za tebe.
I've never seen this before.	Nikada prije nisam vidio ovo.
I was so tired.	Bio sam tako umoran.
I mean, just completely.	Mislim, samo potpuno.
She is the reason we can do it.	Ona je razlog zašto to možemo.
If you really want to, you will.	Ako zaista želiš, hoćeš.
And the money is good.	A i novac je dobar.
It was time	Vrijeme je bilo
We needed to get the team back on track.	Trebali smo vratiti tim na pravi put.
It won't be anymore.	Neće više biti.
I came to say just that.	Došao sam da kažem samo to.
And that way.	I to na taj način.
They didn't know he was there.	Nisu znali da je on tamo.
I really like it.	Stvarno mi se sviđa.
He probably was to everyone.	Vjerovatno je svima bio.
But that was enough.	Ali to je bilo dovoljno.
It can't get any better.	Ne može biti bolje.
Everything seems to be going well.	Čini se da sve ide dobro.
I'm too busy today.	Danas sam previše zauzet.
Who would we be.	Ko bi bili mi.
Something happened.	Nešto se dogodilo.
She knew better now.	Sada je znala bolje.
He could never really say, no more.	Nikada nije mogao stvarno reći, ne više.
This works well.	Ovo dobro radi.
What can be done?	Šta se može učiniti?
Not much more could be said.	Činilo se da se nije mnogo više moglo reći.
Tell me how you are.	Reci mi kako si.
One is new.	Jedan je novi.
She doesn't do that.	Ona to ne radi.
He knew he had to leave.	Znao je da mora otići.
You can see it today.	Možete to vidjeti danas.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
But you don't.	Ali ti ne.
Nobody saw him.	Niko ga nije video.
They never told me anything about it.	Nikada mi ništa nisu rekli o tome.
You have to work with everyone.	Morate raditi sa svima.
He knew we had him.	Znao je da ga imamo.
Maybe you can help us.	Možda nam možete pomoći.
There is no way to know anything for sure now.	Ne postoji način da se bilo šta sigurno zna sada.
He didn't know anymore.	Nije znao više.
I would have to go.	Morao bih da idem.
I couldn't tell him.	Nisam mu mogao reći.
This cannot happen.	Ovo se ne može dogoditi.
I had to do this alone.	Morao sam ovo da uradim sam.
I'm going to see him.	Idem da ga vidim.
I couldn't really say.	Nisam mogao baš reći.
That would be the only way.	To bi bio jedini način.
That was tomorrow.	To je bilo sutra.
I would like to know if that is the case or not.	Volio bih znati da li je tako ili nije.
But they are not the only ones.	Ali oni nisu jedini.
The more you are.	Što si više.
You will find what you need.	Naći ćete ono što vam treba.
I suppose.	Pretpostavljam.
Exactly.	Tačno tačno.
He didn't come to me.	Nije došao kod mene.
He is telling the truth.	On govori istinu.
Now we know why.	Sada znamo zašto.
Actually, it was good.	U stvari, bilo je dobro.
I guess you even told him about it.	Pretpostavljam da si mu čak i rekao za to.
So it took a long time.	Tako da je trebalo dosta vremena.
That was not a problem here.	To nije bio problem ovdje.
Like you didn't.	Kao što ti to nisi uradio.
I just loved working with him.	Jednostavno sam volio raditi s njim.
A lot has already happened.	Dosta se već dogodilo.
He has to come to his senses.	Mora da dođe sebi.
I would really love to see that.	Zaista bih to volio vidjeti.
This is currently working.	Ovo trenutno radi.
It was just real.	Samo što je bilo stvarno.
We have a little more time.	Imamo još malo vremena.
With anyone, really.	Sa bilo kim, zaista.
I am now going.	Idem sada.
Business, you know, business.	Posao, znate, posao.
There is something wrong here.	Ovdje nešto nije u redu.
I asked him what he wanted.	Pitao sam ga šta želi.
It should be you.	To bi trebao biti ti.
It could have been.	Moglo je biti.
Aren't they like.	Nisu li to kao .
No if but but.	Nema ako i ali ali.
It could be anything.	Moglo bi biti ništa.
I don't know why he did that either.	Ni ja ne znam zašto je to uradio.
It's for everyone.	To je za sve.
Not that she would ever tell him that.	Nije da bi mu to ikada rekla.
And maybe he's right.	I možda je u pravu.
That may be fine, it may not be.	To može biti u redu, možda nije.
He's not there.	On nije tamo.
I'm telling you.	Kažem ti.
We can't know.	Ne možemo znati.
Or maybe not everyone knows it.	Ili to možda svi ne znaju.
No one came.	Niko nije došao.
What could.	Šta bi moglo.
He had heard it all before.	Sve je to već čuo.
But she also said yes many times.	Ali i ona je mnogo puta rekla da.
This was not my idea.	Ovo nije bila moja ideja.
Everyone knows everything.	Svi znaju sve.
Not bad for not doing much.	Nije loše što se ne radi mnogo.
Which was obvious.	Što je bilo očigledno.
But there was nothing you could do.	Ali ništa nisi mogao da uradiš.
She's waiting for me.	Čeka me.
It was a good day.	Bio je to dobar dan.
It's just me.	To sam samo ja.
You seem to be right.	Čini se da ste u pravu.
But something happened to me.	Ali nešto mi se dogodilo.
I knew you would come back.	Znao sam da ćeš se vratiti.
He makes the game look so easy.	On čini da igra izgleda tako lako.
That goes on.	To ide dalje.
We will tell the truth.	Reći ćemo istinu.
Why doesn't he say anything, he wondered.	Zašto ništa ne kaže, pitao se.
And that was not the question.	I to nije bilo pitanje.
It could have been anything or anyone.	Moglo je biti bilo šta ili bilo ko.
He knew everything he needed to know.	Znao je sve što je trebao znati.
It doesn't take long.	Ne treba dugo.
Like us.	Kao i mi.
I have a lot to tell you.	Imam puno toga da ti kažem.
It is hard.	Teško je.
I know better now.	Sada znam bolje.
And neither do you.	A ni ti.
This time he was sure he had heard something.	Ovaj put je bio siguran da je nešto čuo.
I have no doubt about that.	Ne sumnjam u to.
I like what you do.	Sviđa mi se to što radiš.
I can not believe.	Ne mogu vjerovati.
But not just any guy.	Ali ne bilo koji momak.
She knows she can.	Ona zna da može.
That can't be good.	To ne može biti dobro.
Look, it's just hard.	Vidi, samo je teško.
But what can they say.	Ali šta oni mogu reći.
It all takes time.	Za sve to treba vremena.
But it must be too much.	Ali mora da je previše.
I'm happy for him, really.	Drago mi je zbog njega, zaista.
I don't think you can do that.	Mislim da to ne možeš.
He left.	Otišao je.
You know me better than that.	Znaš me bolje od toga.
I have to go now.	Moram da idem sada.
It was all he could do.	To je bilo sve što je mogao da uradi.
Maybe too much.	Možda previše.
It’s something he can never do.	To je nešto što on nikada ne može učiniti.
This is simply not true.	Ovo jednostavno nije istina.
Even if it is.	Čak i ako to.
I don't know anything.	Ne znam ništa.
There were many of them.	Bilo ih je mnogo.
We would be much better off without it.	Bilo bi nam mnogo bolje bez toga.
It can't be found now.	Sada se ne može naći.
I doubt that will happen.	Sumnjam da će se to dogoditi.
And it really is.	I zaista jeste.
I hope you like it!	Nadam se da vam se sviđa!
There were too many of them.	Bilo ih je previše.
He knows nothing about anything.	On ništa ne zna ni o čemu.
That's what we did.	To smo i uradili.
The guy who does the work.	Momak koji radi posao.
I know we have a lot of things.	Znam da imamo mnogo stvari.
But it was so simple that no one would want it.	Ali bilo je tako jednostavno da to niko ne bi želeo.
Very few are known to exist.	Za vrlo malo se zna da postoji.
I have no idea why exactly.	Nemam pojma zašto tačno.
I'm almost there.	Skoro sam tamo.
It's just who she is.	Jednostavno je ko je ona.
I just can't.	Jednostavno ne mogu.
Can you help me?	Možete li mi pomoći?
She told me that herself.	To mi je sama rekla.
So long.	Tako dugo.
If only it was a bad time for me.	Samo da je to bilo loše vrijeme za mene.
So far it hasn't.	Do sada nije.
He wanted to do more than that.	Želio je učiniti više od toga.
But there is no way to make that true.	Ali ne postoji način da to bude istina.
And it should be.	I trebalo bi da bude.
It was obviously not good.	Očigledno nije bilo dobro.
But now almost everything is going.	Ali sada ide skoro sve.
It works for both.	Radi za oboje.
Nobody expected that.	Niko to nije očekivao.
He knew it would be hard for him.	Znao je da će mu to biti teško.
I would never ask for something like that.	Nikad ne bih tražio tako nešto.
They said something.	Rekli su nešto.
We won't talk about it anymore.	Nećemo dalje o tome.
You have to come back and you have to come back quickly.	Morate se vratiti i morate se brzo vratiti.
Maybe even before that.	Možda čak i prije toga.
It seemed that too.	Činilo se i to.
I was just here.	Samo sam bio ovde.
She wouldn't know what to do next.	Ne bi znala kako dalje.
Yes, they knew about it.	Da, znali su za to.
You're here now.	Sada si ovdje.
If you want to say something, say it.	Ako želiš nešto da kažeš, reci.
I can't tell you now.	Ne mogu vam sada reći.
They had no idea when he would return.	Nisu imali pojma kada će se vratiti.
I think she knows something.	Mislim da ona nešto zna.
That would not be easy.	To ne bi bilo lako.
So he had to give	Tako da je morao dati
That's all this really is.	To je sve što ovo zaista jeste.
You may never get it.	Možda nikada nećeš dobiti.
But he didn't tell anyone.	Ali nikome ništa nije rekao.
I went and did it again.	Otišao sam i uradio to ponovo.
I had no idea what to do!	Nisam imao pojma šta da radim!
But that's how it happened.	Ali tako se dogodilo.
She just wants to talk.	Ona samo želi da priča.
But there is a reason for this.	Ali postoji razlog za ovo.
I need to know how he did it.	Moram da znam kako je to uradio.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
More than that.	Više od toga.
And it can be a good life.	I to može biti dobar život.
But what if.	Ali šta ako .
You can do more than that.	Možeš više od toga.
I didn't even go home.	Nisam čak ni otišao kući.
But I can't do that.	Ali ne mogu to učiniti.
He is just himself.	On je samo on sam.
There is no help for that.	Nema pomoći za to.
I mean, hard.	Mislim, teško.
This is up to us.	Ovo je na nama.
She just doesn't know anything.	Ona jednostavno ne zna ništa.
We can stay.	Možemo ostati.
That is what it really is to be me.	To je ono što je zaista biti ja.
He would be a friend for a long time.	On bi još dugo bio prijatelj.
But it may not be as difficult as it seems.	Ali možda i nije tako teško kao što se čini.
He still lives there.	I dalje živi tamo.
Maybe we'll stay here for a few more days.	Možda ćemo ostati ovdje još nekoliko dana.
I did not.	Ne, nisam.
He doesn't seem right to me.	On mi se ne čini u redu.
I see her.	Vidim je.
The question is whether that is really the case.	Pitanje je da li je to zaista tako.
It doesn't seem to work.	Čini se da ne radi.
He was right.	Bio je u pravu.
Maybe there was none of that.	Možda ništa od toga nije bilo.
I guess you weren't there.	Pretpostavljam da nisi bio tamo.
Something.	Nešto.
Now I usually do as I please so much.	Sada obično radim kako mi se tako više sviđa.
I am nobody but me.	Ja nisam niko, osim mene.
He didn't start talking.	Nije počeo da govori.
That's how it goes.	Tako to ide.
He thought he did it.	Mislio je da je to uradio.
I'm sure of so little.	Siguran sam u tako malo.
She must have told him something.	Mora da mu je nešto rekla.
That was a lot.	To je bilo puno.
Now nothing can be done about it.	Sada se ništa ne može učiniti za to.
Not even today.	Nije ni danas.
He was tired of being told what to do.	Bio je umoran od toga da mu se govori šta da radi.
Everyone was better off when she was here.	Svima je bilo bolje kada je ona bila ovdje.
I'm ready for that.	Spreman sam za to.
Good year.	Dobra godina.
In a good way.	Na dobar način.
He can do it.	On to može.
Everything here was and is.	Sve je ovdje bilo i jeste.
That's really her.	To je zaista ona.
We will help in any way.	Pomoći ćemo na bilo koji način.
He won't come to the party.	Neće doći na zabavu.
We have to go back.	Moramo se vratiti.
She certainly didn't want to.	Sigurno nije htela.
I'll know how.	Ja ću znati kako.
He had no idea where he was.	Nije imao pojma gdje je.
I'm working on it today.	Radim na tome danas.
Or for sure.	Ili na sigurno.
Nobody wants to stay here.	Niko ne želi ostati ovdje.
Three years earlier.	Tri godine ranije.
We need a new way.	Treba nam novi način.
There is better to have.	Ima bolje da se ima.
I'm not surprised you say no.	Nisam iznenađen što kažeš ne.
Maybe not even before that.	Možda čak ni prije toga.
There is nothing wrong with me.	Ništa nije u redu sa mnom.
She's with you.	Ona je sa tobom.
I think she loves you a little.	Mislim da te ona malo voli.
Everything he expected to happen is not.	Sve što je očekivao da će se dogoditi nije.
Something happened.	Nešto se dogodilo.
Like him.	Kao i on.
We have to go!	Moramo ići!
But it shouldn't be.	Ali to ne bi trebalo biti.
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
We are not.	Nismo.
I don't know who these people are.	Ne znam ko su ti ljudi.
Yes, we could.	Da, mogli bismo.
And you shouldn't.	I ne bi trebao.
It's not always good.	Nije uvijek dobro.
He's trying to get better.	Pokušava da bude bolje.
He didn't seem to hear.	Činilo se da nije čuo.
But you may want to keep it simple.	Ali možda želite da bude jednostavno.
I can do it, she said.	Ja to mogu, rekla je.
I brought him back.	Vratio sam ga.
They did this.	Ovo su uradili.
They had more time.	Imali su više vremena.
There was so much she didn't know.	Bilo je toliko toga što nije znala.
I just can't go there right now.	Jednostavno ne mogu ići tamo trenutno.
I say, not really.	Kažem, ne baš.
I would like to talk to you.	Htio bih razgovarati s tobom.
It's for me.	Za mene je to.
It was actually pretty simple.	Zapravo je bilo prilično jednostavno.
He went to the door.	Otišao je do vrata.
They couldn't, or they didn't.	Nisu mogli, ili nisu.
You were good.	Bio si dobar.
He actually knows.	On zapravo zna.
And he said yes.	I on je rekao da.
I'm always with you.	Ja sam uvek sa tobom.
I could tell right away.	Mogao sam odmah reći.
But that's all for good.	Ali to je sve za dobro.
We should talk.	Trebali bismo razgovarati.
It's hard to say.	Teško je to reći.
I am one.	Ja sam jedan.
He did a few things, but not many.	Uradio je nekoliko stvari, ali ne mnogo.
He wasn't a good father either.	Ni on nije bio dobar otac.
But only soon.	Ali samo skoro.
Now that is not the case.	Sada to nije tako.
The car was still there.	Auto je još bio tamo.
Probably something is not so good.	Verovatno nešto nije tako dobro.
No, he doesn't have to.	Ne, ne mora.
Do you think something will stay?	Mislite li da će nešto ostati?
I'm not saying it's bad.	Ne kažem da je loše.
He knew, not me.	On je znao, ne ja.
Or almost everyone.	Ili skoro svi.
Maybe so, and maybe not.	Možda je tako, a možda i nije.
He didn't need it.	Nije mu trebao.
You think you need to know.	Misliš da moraš znati.
Why would I.	Zašto bi.
This may not be true.	Ovo ne može biti tačno.
There is something else.	Ima još nešto.
Yes, it will be much better.	Da, to će biti mnogo bolje.
There was much more.	Bilo je mnogo više.
There is a lot of waiting.	Mnogo se čeka.
Which he didn't do.	Što on nije uradio.
Not so much anymore.	Ne više toliko.
But she never told me who he was.	Ali nikad mi nije rekla ko je on.
It didn't, and it couldn't.	Nije, a nije ni moglo.
I wasn't happy about that.	Nisam bio sretan zbog toga.
You obviously like it.	Očigledno ti se sviđa.
But you have it.	Ali ti ga imaš.
Maybe not.	Možda i ne.
Like you as a friend.	Kao i ti kao prijatelj.
Now we will have to go back to school.	Sada ćemo se morati vratiti u školu.
Just a job.	Samo posao.
It can be much more.	Može biti mnogo više.
I am very happy for you.	Veoma sam sretan zbog tebe.
It's simple.	To je jednostavno.
I thought it could be.	Mislio sam da bi mogao biti.
We did all that this morning.	Sve smo to uradili jutros.
And so it was.	Tako je i bilo.
He was the one to help me.	On je bio taj koji će mi pomoći.
I'm sure of it.	Siguran sam u to.
There was never a question of whether.	Nikada nije bilo pitanje da li.
I got it right.	Dobro sam shvatio.
Now there is.	Sada ima.
If she only knew what it was.	Kad bi samo znala šta je to.
So to speak.	Tako reći.
He could even be with me.	Mogao bi čak i sa mnom.
He's not here either.	Nije ni on ovde.
It certainly is.	Sigurno jeste.
There is time, and a lot of it.	Ima vremena, i to dosta.
I mean, he really knows what he's doing.	Mislim, on stvarno zna šta radi.
The business had a lot of problems.	Posao je imao mnogo problema.
And they won't give us money.	I neće nam dati novac.
We were fine today.	Danas smo bili dobro.
I asked what.	Pitao sam šta.
He should have come earlier.	Trebao je doći ranije.
I started like a few years ago.	Počeo sam kao prije nekoliko godina.
It's a job properly.	To je posao kako treba.
She knew nothing about it.	Nije znala ništa o tome.
He realized that very quickly.	Vrlo brzo je to shvatio.
Yes, this is still happening.	Da, ovo se još uvijek dešava.
Being too much.	Biti previše.
Just say yes.	Samo reci da.
But this is not the case here.	Ali ovdje nije tako.
And you're absolutely right.	I potpuno si u pravu.
It's a good day for him.	Dobar je dan za njega.
Not that he thought he would.	Nije da je mislio da hoće.
I don't think it's easy.	Mislim da nije lako.
She knew that.	Ona je to znala.
I still do not know.	Još ne znam.
I'm happy to be here.	Sretan sam što sam ovdje.
And there is more.	I ima još toga.
Someone had to do it.	Neko je to morao učiniti.
There are so many more!	Ima ih još toliko!
They wouldn't tell me.	Ne bi mi rekli.
Think, say more.	Misli, reci još.
He's not here.	On nije ovde.
I knew it was true.	Znao sam da je to istina.
She had known for a long time that this would happen.	Ona je dugo znala da će se to dogoditi.
You are not my father.	Ti nisi moj otac.
It wasn't even my idea.	To čak i nije bila moja ideja.
He was completely alone.	Bio je potpuno sam.
This, indeed, was true.	Ovo je, zaista, bila istina.
I do not want.	Ne želim.
We are completely alone.	Potpuno smo sami.
He doesn't see.	On ne vidi.
I should have seen him when he got home.	Trebao sam ga vidjeti kad je došao kući.
Obviously not.	Očigledno nije tako.
I need to see you.	Moram da te vidim.
I asked for it.	Tražio sam to.
I would say no.	Rekla bi ne.
That's her over there.	To je ona tamo.
That says a lot.	To puno govori.
But he says nothing.	Ali on ne govori ništa.
She must know they are there.	Ona mora znati da su tamo.
I know too much.	Znam previše.
He is not allowed to go there.	Nije mu dozvoljeno da ide tamo.
She knew what awaited her.	Znala je šta je čeka.
It just doesn't happen.	To se jednostavno ne dešava.
All of us .	Svi mi .
I had no idea it was this week until last night.	Nisam imao pojma da je to ove sedmice do sinoć.
And you can.	I možeš.
I know he does.	Znam da zna.
No, you should go.	Ne, trebao bi ići.
Besides, it's no longer a code.	Osim toga, to nije više kod.
But you are very good.	Ali ti si jako dobar.
How was it before?	Kako je bilo prije?
That's more than that.	To je više od toga.
And that was last week.	I to je bilo prošle sedmice.
I know how she works.	Znam kako ona radi.
A few years, maybe more.	Nekoliko godina, možda i više.
That money was nothing.	Taj novac nije bio ništa.
But it couldn't be easy.	Ali nije moglo biti lako.
She said no one was home.	Rekla je da nema nikoga kod kuće.
You can't just do both.	Ne možete samo oboje.
Everyone was still at home.	Svi su još bili kod kuće.
They are better than that.	Oni su bolji od toga.
And you had it.	I imali ste ga.
And it's better than good.	I bolje je nego dobra.
I don't know much about it.	Ne znam puno o tome.
In fact, we can do it, as we will see now.	U stvari, to možemo učiniti, kao što ćemo sada vidjeti.
We will surely come.	Sigurno ćemo doći.
I told him about you.	Rekao sam mu za tebe.
I don't like them anymore.	Ne volim ih više.
I hope you get better soon.	Nadam se da ćeš uskoro biti bolje.
I love those things too.	I ja volim te stvari.
I still love him.	I dalje ga volim.
But never this.	Ali nikad ovo.
He knew something was wrong with me.	Znao je da nešto nije u redu sa mnom.
But you don't have to stay if you don't want to.	Ali ne morate ostati ako ne želite.
That's right, another one.	Tako je, još jedan.
And there was a lot of that.	I bilo je mnogo toga.
I think so too.	I ja to mislim.
They were gone.	Više ih nije bilo.
They had very little money.	Imali su vrlo malo novca.
This is my life, this is it.	Ovo je moj život, to je to.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to učiniti.
He heard, but did not understand.	Čuo je, ali nije shvatio.
So it was with us.	Tako je bilo i sa nama.
And it's not easy.	A to nije lako.
But he's not really that busy.	Ali on zapravo nije toliko zauzet.
So you can stay at home.	Tako da možete ostati kod kuće.
It was good, really good.	Bilo je dobro, stvarno dobro.
He wasn't even my father.	Nije mi čak ni bio otac.
He was glad he could help.	Bilo mu je drago što je mogao pomoći.
I wish I could do as well as you.	Voleo bih da mogu tako dobro kao ti.
But it could have been.	Ali moglo je biti.
Now you are the one to help me.	Sada si ti taj koji će mi pomoći.
I hope they are right.	Nadam se da su u pravu.
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
But it was always there.	Ali uvijek je bilo tu.
Yes there is.	Da ima.
Not everyone is like that.	Nije svima tako.
There is nobody.	Nema nikoga.
Everything will be fine.	Sve će biti u redu.
She does it often.	Ona to radi često.
And this would be true.	I ovo bi bila istina.
Lots of problems.	Mnogo problema.
He was really alone now.	Sada je zaista bio sam.
I never had it.	Nikad ga nisam imao.
And some of it still works.	A nešto od toga još uvijek radi.
He had a job.	Imao je posao.
And we are not alone.	I nismo sami.
I needed.	Trebao sam.
I'm not my own right now.	Ja trenutno nisam svoj.
Without us, you would be nothing.	Bez nas, ti ne bi bio ništa.
I want you to know that for sure.	Želim da to sigurno znaš.
She still does.	Ona to i dalje čini.
Now he knew he wanted more.	Sada je znao da želi nešto više.
I don't know what this is about.	Ne znam o čemu se radi.
You did very well.	Uradili ste jako dobro.
There are too many.	Ima ih previše.
He said it was too much.	Rekao je da je previše.
It's working well now.	Sada radi dobro.
That's not why we're here.	Nismo zbog toga ovdje.
There was nothing that I could do.	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim.
And that is it.	I to je to.
He didn't see her.	Nije je vidio.
Or tomorrow.	Ili sutra.
I'm not sure which one.	Nisam siguran koji.
That didn't happen.	To se nije dogodilo.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
That was all me.	To sam bio sve ja.
We had too much.	Imali smo previše.
Just think of yourself.	Misli samo na sebe.
What do they know?	Šta oni znaju?
But he knew it.	Ali on je to znao.
That happened to him.	To mu se dogodilo.
The guy who doesn't.	Momak koji nema.
I usually work.	Ja obično radim.
We've had enough of him.	Dosta nam je njega.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
He couldn't do this for long.	Nije mogao ovo još dugo.
I was one.	Bio sam jedan.
What are you doing?.	Šta radiš?.
But now he couldn't.	Ali sada nije mogao.
These are.	Ovo su.
What is not likely will not.	Ono što nije vjerovatno neće.
That's for it.	To je za to.
He knows we're here.	On zna da smo ovde.
Or even the day before.	Ili čak i dan ranije.
No, it was pretty bad.	Ne, bilo je prilično loše.
And if not.	A ako ne .
Usually no one was.	Obično niko nije bio.
You did it.	Uradio si to.
There is a better way.	Postoji bolji način.
He could have done better.	Mogao je bolje.
The first day.	Prvi dan.
I wish it wasn't.	Voleo bi da nije.
I can not.	Ne mogu.
There are many more than us.	Ima ih mnogo više od nas.
It's time for work.	Vrijeme je za posao.
Like he's not even there.	Kao da nije ni tamo.
There is nothing simple here.	Ovdje nema ništa jednostavno.
I don't see how that will help.	Ne vidim kako će to pomoći.
Who we were.	Ko smo bili.
Not for the money.	Ne zbog novca.
It wasn't likely.	Nije bilo vjerovatno.
I do not know.	Ja ne znam.
Must be.	Mora biti.
I didn't want this.	Nisam htela ovo.
Today will be a good time.	Danas će biti dobro vrijeme.
You don't have to, you know.	Ne moraš, znaš.
I won't be here anymore.	Neću više biti ovdje.
He must have known.	Mora da je znao.
Maybe this will help you.	Možda će vam ovo biti od pomoći.
It was by itself.	Bilo je samo po sebi.
They shouldn't have.	Nisu trebali.
Obviously not.	Očigledno nije.
Not from him.	Ne od njega.
I never knew what.	Nikad nisam znao šta.
I love that too.	Volim i to.
I am his friend.	Ja sam mu prijatelj.
He still won't talk to me.	I dalje neće razgovarati sa mnom.
He said it was okay.	Rekao je da je u redu.
I hope you like the video !.	Nadam se da vam se sviđa video!.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo u redu.
He said he didn't even know why.	Rekao je da ni sam ne zna zašto.
Everything was as usual.	Sve je bilo kao i obično.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nisam uradio ništa loše.
I guess so.	Pretpostavljam da jeste.
That's right.	Tako je.
I've been here before.	Bio sam ovdje prije.
And someone loved him.	I neko ga je voleo.
She told me that herself.	Ona mi je to sama rekla.
We needed money.	Trebao nam je novac.
Have any of us.	Da li je bilo ko od nas.
My problem is this.	Moj problem je ovo.
There was nothing better when he got home.	Ništa bolje nije bilo kada je stigao kući.
I'm doing work for you.	Radim posao za vas.
Yes, he saw it now.	Da, sada je to video.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to učiniti.
Maybe not all.	Možda ne sve.
This is easy.	Ovo je lako.
How are you .	Kako si .
I saw someone.	Video sam nekoga.
It's just happening.	Samo se dešava.
I obviously didn't think it worked.	Očigledno nisam mislio da radi.
There is simply no way to do it.	Jednostavno, ne postoji način da se to uradi.
He didn't know about it.	Nije znao za to.
I think he was in it.	Mislim da je bio u tome.
It never should have been.	Nikad nije trebalo.
He doesn't say what.	Ne kaže šta.
This is for the door.	Ovo je za vrata.
Just how much they will give.	Samo koliko će oni dati.
They did nothing.	Nisu ništa uradili.
The truth was, yes.	Istina je bila, da.
Money is not everything, you know.	Novac nije sve, znate.
I know it's none of my business.	Znam da to nije moja stvar.
That's a lot of time.	To je puno vremena.
I just didn’t know how to do it.	Jednostavno nisam znao kako to da uradim.
Not you.	Ne ti.
Someone had to tell the truth about what happened.	Neko je morao reći istinu o tome šta se dogodilo.
But they won't see us right away.	Ali neće nas odmah vidjeti.
He says that.	On to govori.
He knew what was happening.	Znao je šta se dešava.
Not much anymore.	Ne više mnogo.
I have them.	Ja ih imam.
I seem to have a lot to say.	Izgleda da imam puno toga za reći.
A person cannot be what he wants.	Osoba ne može biti ono što želi.
Not everything was good.	Nije sve bilo dobro.
I have often wondered why.	Često sam se pitao zašto.
But there is a problem with that.	Ali u tome postoji problem.
We should do our best.	Trebali bismo dati sve od sebe.
We never knew.	Nikad nismo znali.
But that was not it.	Ali to nije bilo to.
This speaks for itself.	Ovo govori samo za sebe.
They were fine.	Bili su dobro.
But that's what they did.	Ali to je ono što su uradili.
And now she was.	A sada je bila i ona.
You're not well.	Nije ti dobro.
You didn't know.	Nisi znao.
All very well.	Sve vrlo dobro.
Maybe you know.	Možda znaš.
But probably not.	Ali vjerovatno nije.
Today it's just you.	Danas si samo ti.
That's how I understood it.	Ja sam to tako shvatio.
He came to me.	Došao je do mene.
I want to see you.	Želim da te vidim.
I want to do my best.	Želim dati sve od sebe.
That's the only way.	To je jedini put.
He didn't want to tell anyone.	Nije želio nikome reći.
We all knew this time would come.	Svi smo znali da će ovo vrijeme doći.
What happened is still there.	Šta je bilo, još je.
I've never been here before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio ovde.
I have us here.	Imam nas ovde.
That's the only way.	To je jedini put.
She said little during that time.	Za to vrijeme je malo rekla.
He had done it before.	Radio je to ranije.
Maybe me.	Možda mi.
Now the house is gone.	Sada kuće više nema.
Besides, it's okay.	Osim toga, u redu je.
This is clearly not the case here.	Ovdje očigledno nije tako.
But not for me.	Ali ne za mene.
I'm not sure how to do that.	Nisam siguran kako to da uradim.
She wasn't there.	Ona nije bila tamo.
That's not it.	To nije to.
I mean, good as.	Mislim, dobro kao.
He never came.	Nikad nije došao.
But now nothing could be done.	Ali sada se nije moglo ništa učiniti.
I can help.	mogu pomoći.
You're better at it than I am.	Ti si bolji u tome od mene.
I don't have to wonder.	Ne treba da se pitam.
Everything is going well so far.	Sve ide dobro do sada.
Any idea where the problem is.	Bilo koja ideja gdje je problem.
It's not going well.	Ne ide dobro.
But he wanted more than that.	Ali želio je više od toga.
She thinks good of me, she thinks good of you.	Ona misli dobro od mene, ona misli dobro od tebe.
Nobody knew we were there.	Niko nije znao da smo bili tamo.
For a while nothing happened.	Neko vrijeme se ništa nije dogodilo.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
Okay by me.	U redu od mene.
It's so easy !.	To je tako lako!.
I really didn't want anything more.	Zaista nisam htela ništa više.
That's real life.	To je pravi život.
Everything is nothing.	Sve je ništa.
He decided for you and for me.	On je odlučio za tebe i za mene.
I really love it.	Zaista volim.
He loves us.	On nas voli.
Never for that.	Nikad za to.
Bad, very bad.	Loše, veoma loše.
We did the job for you.	Uradili smo posao za vas.
I want to do it today.	Želim to učiniti danas.
Please someone come.	Molim vas da neko dođe.
In fact, many, many times.	U stvari, mnogo, mnogo puta.
Not in a bad way.	Ne na loš način.
Things you need to know.	Stvari koje morate znati.
Not for now.	Ne za sada.
I'm glad to be back.	Drago mi je što sam se vratio.
We could have done it ourselves.	Mogli smo to sami da uradimo.
There are a few things you can do.	Postoji nekoliko stvari koje možete učiniti.
But this problem still exists.	Ali ovaj problem i dalje postoji.
Will you.	Hoćeš li.
He had no problems.	Nije imao problema.
At the party.	Na zabavi.
But this was too much even for him.	Ali ovo je čak i za njega bilo previše.
But they will come.	Ali oni će doći.
I haven't had them in a while.	Nisam ih dobio neko vrijeme.
I see no reason why anyone should do this.	Ne vidim razlog zašto bi neko ovo uradio.
I don't have much time in the afternoon.	Nemam mnogo vremena popodne.
You need it now, and you need it fast.	Treba vam sada, i treba brzo.
In a few years it will be me.	Za nekoliko godina to ću biti ja.
This has always been my thing.	Ovo je uvek bila moja stvar.
They can't help it.	Oni ne mogu pomoći.
Maybe he won't say no.	Možda neće reći ne.
In fact, more than enough.	Zapravo, više nego dovoljno.
And he won't do it.	I on to neće učiniti.
I can do it better than you.	Ja to mogu bolje od tebe.
That says a lot.	To govori puno.
They could see him.	Mogli su ga vidjeti.
Why is this happening to us?	Zašto nam se to dešava?
That’s still not good, but it was obviously good enough.	To još uvijek nije dobro, ali je očigledno bilo dovoljno dobro.
We have him.	Imamo ga.
Just there.	Samo tamo.
Nobody really wants to do that.	Niko to zaista ne želi da uradi.
So simple for now.	Za sada tako jednostavno.
But that is not enough for us.	Ali to nam nije dovoljno.
It is not hard.	Nije teško.
That seems to be the problem.	Izgleda da je to problem.
You never heard that.	Nikad to nisi čuo.
That's enough for now.	To je dovoljno za sada.
He said he would.	Rekao je da hoće.
Which is fine.	Što je u redu.
About a lot of things.	O puno stvari.
And he will bring you home.	I on će te vratiti kući.
She was there alone.	Tamo je bila sama.
You can talk to me.	Možeš razgovarati sa mnom.
Someone has to.	Neko mora.
It just isn’t and you know why.	Jednostavno nije i znate zašto.
You've all done it, just to be sure.	Svi ste to uradili, da biste bili sigurni.
Maybe he was just his own.	Možda je samo bio svoj.
I didn't even know you had a car.	Nisam ni znao da imaš auto.
He just can't.	On jednostavno ne može.
For all that.	Za sve to.
It was true, just like life.	Bila je istina, baš kao i život.
They know it.	Oni to znaju.
Everyone should know this.	Ovo bi svi trebali znati.
It's really very simple.	Zaista je vrlo jednostavno.
I will not be those things.	Ja neću biti te stvari.
It's good to bring them back.	Dobro je vratiti ih.
You need more.	Treba ti više.
He really didn't want to be here.	On zaista nije želio biti ovdje.
Look, whether you want it or not.	Vidi, hoćeš to ili ne.
I am going home.	Idem kući.
It must be hard.	Mora biti teško.
He really is.	On zaista jeste.
I just want to see that she's fine.	Samo želim da vidim da je ona dobro.
I guess he's the only one.	Pretpostavljam da je on jedini.
But there is one problem.	Ali postoji jedan problem.
It's good to be back.	Dobro je vratiti se.
No, no, not this man.	Ne, ne, ne ovaj čovjek.
I can not.	Ne mogu.
But you can see that.	Ali to možete vidjeti.
There were only so many people.	Bilo je samo toliko ljudi.
She said it was very likely she was right.	Rekla je da je vrlo vjerovatno da je u pravu.
Soon no one is talking to me anymore.	Uskoro više niko sa mnom ne priča.
', was '.	', bio '.
Like your father before you.	Kao tvoj otac prije tebe.
I decided to work for myself.	Odlučio sam da radim za sebe.
I only came back for that.	Vratio sam se samo zbog toga.
Just a few.	Samo nekoliko.
She told me everything.	Rekla mi je sve.
I was pretty busy.	Bio sam prilično zauzet.
But she didn't want to.	Ali nije htela.
Maybe he's back by now.	Možda se vratio do sada.
He seemed to want to tell us something.	Činilo se da nam želi nešto reći.
There is nothing he can do now.	On sada ništa ne može učiniti.
I asked myself that.	I sam sam to pitao.
I couldn't get it.	Nisam je mogao dobiti.
We have to go back.	Moramo se vratiti.
And happy about that.	I sretan zbog toga.
But there are so few of them.	Ali ima ih tako malo.
Indeed, it was.	Zaista, bilo je.
I didn't want to have anything to do with it.	Nisam htela da nemam ništa s tim.
But neither is he.	Ali ni on to nije.
Something no one here can do.	Nešto niko ovde ne može da uradi.
That's it, isn't it.	To je to, zar ne.
Yes, that is exactly the problem.	Da, upravo u tome je problem.
I was there and I did it.	Bio sam tamo i uradio sam to.
She told me she couldn't stay long.	Rekla mi je da ne može dugo ostati.
They should have known.	Trebali su znati.
It is .	To je .
That's right.	Tako je.
Maybe you're right, she said.	Možda si u pravu, rekla je.
With you.	Sa tobom.
I wasn't here for that.	Nisam bio ovdje zbog toga.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Možda, možda, možda.
But he is.	Ali on jeste.
I really hope so.	Zaista se nadam da hoće.
We know you.	Znamo te.
I don't know why not.	Ne znam zašto nije.
I thought there was something.	Mislio sam da postoji nešto.
What was that good about?	Šta je to bilo dobro?
I can go back to school.	Mogu se vratiti u školu.
This is simply the case.	Ovo je jednostavno tako.
It will be better soon.	Sada će uskoro biti bolje.
I didn't mean to do that.	Nisam mislio to da uradim.
He never asked again.	Više nikoga nije pitao.
No, maybe it would be better not to.	Ne, možda bi bilo bolje da ne.
I had no idea what was going on.	Nisam imao pojma šta se dešava.
Many times, actually.	Mnogo puta, zapravo.
He wants to live.	On želi da živi.
He knew he was right.	Znao je da je u pravu.
But that is what it is.	Ali, to je ono što jeste.
I'll probably never see him.	Vjerovatno ga nikada neću vidjeti.
Life happens.	Život se dešava.
Whether it works or not.	Bilo da radi ili ne.
I need to talk to.	Moram razgovarati sa.
And it works.	I radi.
She didn't know who he was.	Nije znala ko je on.
There is nothing better to do.	Ne postoji ništa bolje da se uradi.
And he loved me. 	I on je mene volio. 
There are so many things.	Ima toliko stvari.
If they can do it, so can we.	Ako oni to mogu, možemo i mi.
We don't know why.	Ne znamo zašto.
I'm so scared.	Tako se bojim.
If it works for you, it works for.	Ako radi za vas, radi za.
With and.	Sa i.
But this is not the only one.	Ali ovo nije jedini.
A much better way.	Mnogo bolji način.
We've had enough of you.	Dosta nam je tebe.
And that's enough.	I to je dovoljno.
I asked him, and he said he wanted to do it.	Pitao sam ga, a on je rekao da želi to da uradi.
I wish this wasn't real.	Želim da ovo ne bude stvarno.
You have money.	Imaš novac.
It's more and more.	To je sve i više.
I'm not sure they were ever there.	Nisam siguran da su ikada bili tamo.
You can't be mine.	Ne možeš biti moj.
That was the reason why.	To je bio razlog zašto.
To the point.	Na stvar.
I did both.	Uradio sam oboje.
He doesn't tell me anything.	Ništa mi ne govori.
Nothing was simple.	Ništa nije bilo jednostavno.
It's just me.	Ja sam samo.
But he can't see you today.	Ali on te ne može vidjeti danas.
She has no money.	Ona nema novca.
It doesn't look right.	Ne izgleda u redu.
He just got back.	Upravo se vratio.
I do.	Ja to radim.
Say please.	Reci molim te.
We didn’t have the time we needed.	Nismo imali vremena koje nam je trebalo.
But that's always been the case.	Ali tako je uvijek bilo.
They just can't.	Oni jednostavno ne mogu.
Not what we said.	Nije ono što smo rekli.
I had to do it.	Morao sam to da uradim.
I like that about you.	Sviđa mi se to kod tebe.
The code is here.	Kod je ovdje.
I didn't leave either.	Nisam ni ja otišao.
You weren't there.	Ti nisi bio tamo.
We are all good here.	Ovde nam je svima dobro.
I could do better.	Mogao bih bolje.
That didn't actually happen.	To se zapravo nije dogodilo.
What is better, who will say?	Šta je bolje, ko će reći?
Do both.	Radite oboje.
This is very difficult to buy.	Ovo je veoma teško kupiti.
I actually know that.	Ja to zapravo znam.
And he doesn't know that.	I ne zna to.
My code should do these things.	Moj kod bi trebao raditi ove stvari.
I want to do this right.	Želim ovo da uradim kako treba.
he wanted to know.	želio je znati.
She doesn't look well.	Ona ne izgleda dobro.
He tried, really.	Pokušao je, zaista.
You probably had a job yourself.	Verovatno ste i sami imali posao.
How long do you have to go.	Koliko dugo moraš ići.
Apparently not.	Očigledno nije.
That would be like .	To bi bilo kao .
Sure, you need to know that.	Sigurno, to morate znati.
He was surprised that he was surprised.	Bio je iznenađen što je bio iznenađen.
In fact, we know it.	U stvari, mi to znamo.
That's really how it was.	Tako je zaista i bilo.
This is hope for me.	Ovo je nada za mene.
It's just a door.	To su samo vrata.
He's the one who asked you to do it.	On je taj koji te je zamolio da to uradiš.
If you haven’t, do them now.	Ako niste, uradite ih sada.
A lot could be said.	Mnogo toga bi se moglo reći.
He thought he would be safe.	Mislio je da će biti siguran.
I guess it should be something like that.	Pretpostavljam da bi trebalo biti tako nešto.
I just can't see why it doesn't work here.	Samo ne mogu da vidim zašto ovde ne radi.
I have to go.	Moram ići.
That won't be a problem.	To neće biti problem.
That's enough.	Dosta je.
That has been a long time.	To je bilo dugo vremena.
We could not.	Nismo mogli.
That was still not enough.	To još uvijek nije bilo dovoljno.
And even if you don’t, you should buy it.	A čak i ako ne, trebali biste ga kupiti.
I would love to.	Voleo bih.
He did nothing further.	Ništa dalje nije uradio.
It was supposed to be.	Trebalo je da bude.
It couldn't be no.	Nije moglo ne.
It was as if his life was over.	Kao da mu je život završio.
I didn't even know they were there.	Nisam ni znao da su tamo.
I'm fine with that.	U redu sam s tim.
But it is true.	Ali to je istina.
I've seen it before.	Video sam to ranije.
I don't know why or when.	Ne znam zašto ni kada.
I have to be there.	Moram biti tamo.
That's just not right.	To jednostavno nije u redu.
There's a little more.	Ima još malo toga.
I went to see you, but you were never there.	Otišao sam kod tebe, ali ti nikad nisi bio tamo.
I didn't know when you would be.	Nisam znao kada ćeš biti.
Yes, you're good at it.	Da, dobro si u tome.
I haven't decided yet.	Nisam se još odlučio.
This is a really good job.	Ovo je zaista dobar posao.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Nije želio razgovarati sa mnom.
And it was very difficult.	I bilo je veoma teško.
This man.	Ovaj čovjek .
I just work here.	Ja samo radim ovdje.
Maybe you don't want to be.	Možda ne želiš biti.
And this is for you.	A ovo je za vas.
It was better there.	Tamo je bilo bolje.
But there was nothing to see.	Ali nije bilo šta da se vidi.
It wouldn't be so bad.	Ne bi bilo tako loše.
In a little while.	Za malo.
But she wasn't, and she knew it.	Ali nije bila, i znala je to.
It used to be.	Nekada je bilo.
I wouldn't ask that of you.	Ne bih to tražio od vas.
Work with me.	Radi sa mnom.
I should have told you before.	Trebao sam ti reći prije.
I hope you're right.	Nadam se da si u pravu.
And no one heard anything.	I niko ništa nije čuo.
Just for you.	Samo za tebe.
I know how a man feels.	Znam kako se čovjek osjeća.
That's how it's done.	Tako se radi.
He was real.	Bio je pravi.
Are you sure you won't tell him.	Jesi li siguran da mu nećeš reći.
It could be much better.	Moglo bi biti mnogo bolje.
I don't know where we are now.	Ne znam gdje smo sada.
That would not be difficult to do.	To ne bi bilo teško uraditi.
He worked.	On je radio.
I expected to see him there.	Očekivao sam da ću ga tamo vidjeti.
They had none of that.	Nisu imali ništa od toga.
I won't say if you don't say.	Neću reći ako ne kažeš.
He will.	On će.
You have to give it to him.	Moraš mu to dati.
It wasn't him.	To nije bio on.
We always knew when he was there.	Uvek smo znali kada je on tu.
My father knew what was going on.	Moj otac je znao šta se dešava.
I may have to see her.	Možda ću morati da je vidim.
Or he really wouldn't want to know.	Ili on zaista ne bi želio da zna.
I have no better.	Nemam bolje.
That was not the case.	To nije bilo tako.
No, he was real.	Ne, bio je pravi.
But this is much more.	Ali ovo je mnogo više.
But just a little.	Ali samo malo.
I just wanted to know how you are today.	Samo sam htela da znam kako si danas.
I heard that.	Čuo sam to.
That's not quite true.	To nije baš tačno.
We will always know almost nothing.	Uvek ćemo znati skoro ništa.
Besides, we're safe here.	Osim toga, ovdje smo sigurni.
He just wasn't there.	On jednostavno nije bio tamo.
He was good.	Bio je dobar.
In fact, probably for sure.	Zapravo, vjerovatno sigurno.
It's like he's doing something.	Kao da to nešto radi.
I'm not at home.	Nisam kod kuće.
If you don't want to, don't.	Ako ne želiš, nemoj.
In fact, it was my job.	U stvari, to je bio moj posao.
No, that's not true.	Ne, to nije istina.
He'll usually just leave.	Obično će samo otići.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
I wish it was.	Voleo bih da jeste.
Surely it could only get better.	Sigurno bi moglo biti samo bolje.
He still goes to school.	I dalje ide u školu.
That's what I did.	To sam i uradio.
I didn't ask for anything.	Nisam tražio ništa.
Sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga.
He's been here before.	Bio je ovdje prije.
What happened is this.	Ono što se dogodilo je ovo.
More on who he was.	Više o tome ko je bio.
It’s not something you can buy.	To nije nešto što možete kupiti.
He will do it.	On će to učiniti.
I'm sure it is.	Siguran sam da je tako.
He just needs time.	Samo mu treba vremena.
That was for sure.	To je bilo sigurno.
You would never do such a thing.	Nikad ne biste uradili tako nešto.
But this morning.	Ali jutros.
More than you want!	Više nego što želite!
Yes I can be.	Da mogu biti.
I'm not sure.	Nisam baš siguran.
This is you.	Ovo si ti.
Never again.	Nikad više.
Not right, but it was true.	Nije u redu, ali je bila istina.
She loves it with everyone.	Ona to voli sa svima.
It seemed to be good with that.	Činilo se da je dobro s tim.
No one seems to know the truth.	Izgleda da niko ne zna istinu.
And that seems too much to me.	I to mi se čini previše.
Not that week.	Ne te sedmice.
What is a ?.	Šta je a?.
She has no one.	Ona nema nikoga.
To tell me he loves me.	Da mi kaže da me voli.
The job is not for tomorrow.	Posao nije za sutra.
You have to do what you have to do.	Moraš da uradiš ono što moraš.
And so we simply know.	I tako jednostavno znamo.
That's what he did.	Tako je i uradio.
I always do that.	Uvek to radim.
He has no money.	On nema novca.
I can't tell you what's going to happen.	Ne mogu vam reći šta će se dogoditi.
It can’t come fast enough for me.	Ne može doći dovoljno brzo za mene.
You're good for me too.	Dobar si i za mene.
You don't have to do everything.	Ne morate sve da radite.
I told everyone that.	Rekao sam to svima.
It took a while.	Trebalo je neko vrijeme.
We can't do it alone.	Ne možemo to sami.
He will be here.	On će biti ovdje.
It doesn't look like it will be anytime soon.	Čini se da neće biti uskoro.
I would say.	Rekao bi.
Good job.	Dobar posao.
Even if that someone is me.	Čak i ako sam taj neko ja.
He was not there.	Nije ga bilo.
I don't think anyone really knows.	Mislim da niko zaista ne zna.
No, not yet.	Ne, ne još.
But that was never for him.	Ali to nikada nije bilo za njega.
I can be.	Ja mogu biti.
I hope you come soon.	Nadam se da ćeš doći uskoro.
Not many, but several.	Ne puno, već nekoliko.
As an idea.	Kao ideja.
It was just too much for him.	To je jednostavno bilo previše za njega.
You'll probably be fine.	Vjerovatno ćeš biti dobro.
We didn't do it.	Mi to nismo uradili.
But there is more.	Ali ima još toga.
He'll probably be back, but it takes time for these things.	Vjerovatno će se vratiti, ali za ove stvari treba vremena.
It can work again.	Može ponovo da radi.
He shouldn't have.	Nije trebao.
I don't know anything about myself.	Ne znam ništa o sebi.
It was unlikely he would ever see her again.	Malo je vjerovatno da će je ikada više vidjeti.
He was too.	Bio je i on.
Tell us something about yourself.	Reci nam nešto o sebi.
He decided.	Odlučio se.
That should be enough.	To bi trebalo biti dovoljno.
I have to see him.	Moram da ga vidim.
Not mine, never.	Ne moj, nikad.
Very fast.	Vrlo brzo.
It works properly.	Radi kako treba.
We didn't know what to do.	Nismo znali šta da radimo.
Everything you want.	Sve što želiš.
Actually quite a long time.	Zapravo dosta dugo.
But that’s still not what you want.	Ali to još uvijek nije ono što želite.
I can't pray anymore.	Ne mogu više da se molim.
Certainly not one of us.	Sigurno ne jedan od nas.
It's not enough.	Nije dovoljno.
But that's not so bad either.	Ali ni to nije tako loše.
Maybe it was an idea.	Možda je to bila ideja.
I don't know what the problem is.	Ne znam u čemu je problem.
I don't know when that time will come.	Ne znam kada će to vrijeme doći.
It was too real.	Bilo je previše stvarno.
I mean, something happened to me.	Mislim, nešto mi se dogodilo.
We could have done a lot.	Mogli smo mnogo da uradimo.
What time will we meet?	U koje vrijeme ćemo se naći?
He was so good tonight.	Bio je tako dobar večeras.
He says.	On kaže.
Maybe he's even good.	Možda je čak i dobar.
Besides, he was right.	Osim toga, bio je u pravu.
He was sure of it.	Bio je siguran u to.
That's bad in a good way.	To je loše na dobar način.
A lot of people were there for me.	Mnogo ljudi je bilo tu za mene.
You have to do this.	Moraš ovo da uradiš.
I love myself.	Ja volim sebe.
He's been gone since this morning.	Od jutros ga nema.
I love her.	Volim je.
I'm sure of that.	U to sam siguran.
He says no, but he is.	Kaže da nije, ali jeste.
He's not coming to the party!	Neće doći na zabavu!
Neither we nor they.	Ni mi ni oni.
He's saying something.	On nešto govori.
It was so simple.	Bilo je tako jednostavno.
No, she didn't know where he might be.	Ne, nije znala gdje bi mogao biti.
He says he can't believe it.	Kaže da ne može vjerovati.
And that couldn't happen.	A to se nije moglo dogoditi.
He was there.	Bio je tamo.
Nobody knew exactly what he was going to do.	Niko nije znao šta će tačno uraditi.
He would be sure.	Bio bi siguran.
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
I had to see her.	Morao sam da je vidim.
For three months already.	Već tri mjeseca.
I didn't see why.	Nisam vidio zašto.
I shouldn't have gone there.	Nisam trebao ići tamo.
I've had it for a long time.	Imam ga dugo vremena.
But she will have to tell you about it.	Ali ona će morati da ti kaže o tome.
I want it now.	Želim to odmah.
She told me that earlier.	Rekla mi je to ranije.
But maybe not for you.	Ali, možda, ne za tebe.
There has never been a better time to live.	Nikada nije bilo bolje vrijeme za život.
I didn't like having nothing to do.	Nisam voleo da nemam šta da radim.
That's what you want to do.	To je ono što želiš da uradiš.
So we're still together.	Tako da smo i dalje zajedno.
This is not going to be a game.	Ovo neće biti igra.
I can't do that tonight.	Ne mogu to večeras.
He wasn't so sure.	Nije bio tako siguran.
I haven't even heard of it.	Nisam ni čuo za to.
For him and for me.	Za njega i za mene.
But in the right way.	Ali na pravi način.
I don't know this.	Ne znam ovo.
But he wouldn't lose today.	Ali danas ne bi izgubio.
I mean, he doesn't know.	Mislim, ne zna.
Yeah, maybe it's just a thing.	Da, možda je to samo stvar.
He is just for that.	On je upravo za to.
You can, you know.	Možeš, znaš.
It must be raining.	Mora da je kiša.
He shouldn't have done that either.	Ni to nije trebalo da uradi.
Is that all?	Da li je to sve?
You know they're in it for the money.	Znate da su u tome zbog novca.
Yes you are.	Da, jesi.
No one seemed to hear anything.	Činilo se da niko ništa nije čuo.
The code works well.	Kod radi dobro.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
Like my father.	Kao moj otac.
That was a lot of money.	To je bilo puno novca.
And it is.	I jeste.
Or maybe.	Ili možda.
You don't want that.	Ne želiš to.
It's just not true.	Samo nije istina.
He did a good job.	Uradio je dobar posao.
I don't think they can do it alone.	Mislim da oni to sami ne mogu.
I should.	Trebao bih.
It doesn't look real, none of it.	Ne izgleda stvarno, ništa od toga nije.
Nothing is real.	Ništa nije stvarno.
I don't need anything.	Ne treba mi ništa.
How many years? 	Koliko godina?
I would like him to say something, like what he knows.	Voleo bih da kaže nešto, kao ono što zna.
I guess that was and is not true.	Pretpostavljam da je to bilo i da nije istina.
Is that happening.	Da li se to dešava.
Maybe that was good too.	Možda je i to bilo dobro.
Nobody wants anything.	Niko ništa ne želi.
He never does that.	Nikad to ne radi.
That's not it.	To nije ono.
But I don't know why that is.	Ali ne znam zašto je to tako.
Nice to see him.	Bilo mi je drago da ga vidim.
That is what is happening here.	To je ono što se ovdje dešava.
Nothing would be easy.	Ništa ne bi bilo lako.
It is, indeed.	Jeste, zaista.
But I can say this.	Ali mogu reći ovo.
You should have talked to him.	Trebao si razgovarati s njim.
Are you sure we're allowed to do that?	Jeste li sigurni da nam je to dozvoljeno?
And it really is.	I zaista jeste.
We knew it wouldn't be.	Znali smo da neće biti.
All is not well.	Nije sve dobro.
But we'll see them soon.	Ali uskoro ćemo ih vidjeti.
It was just mine.	Bio je samo moj.
One more day, that was all he needed.	Još jedan dan, to je bilo sve što mu je trebalo.
Looks like it wasn't.	Izgleda da nije bilo.
Looks like they were just here.	Izgleda da su upravo bili ovdje.
I don't think that's true.	Mislim da to nije istina.
I just wanted to talk to you.	Samo sam htio razgovarati s tobom.
That was not all.	To nije bilo sve.
To do that, you have to know who it is.	Da biste to uradili, morate znati ko je to.
I hope you are too.	Nadam se da si i ti.
And it all happened so fast.	I sve se dogodilo tako brzo.
No one will help you.	Niko ti neće pomoći.
And they will never find us.	I nikada nas neće naći.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
Maybe all that.	Možda sve to.
A lot could happen from now until tomorrow.	Mnogo toga bi se moglo dogoditi od sada do sutra.
You didn't have it in you.	Nisi to imao u sebi.
This is not what we need.	Ovo nije ono što nam treba.
It wasn't fast enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno brzo.
Have fun.	Zabavi se.
I'm not sure what that was.	Nisam siguran šta je to bilo.
I have no idea.	Nemam pojma.
And that is true.	I to je tačno.
But it was difficult.	Ali bilo je teško.
We have to do something, she said.	Moramo nešto učiniti, rekla je.
I think that would be very difficult.	Mislim da bi to bilo veoma teško.
And now it's here.	A sada je tu.
It seems simple enough.	Čini se dovoljno jednostavno.
Everything you need.	Sve što ti treba.
It just wasn't us.	To jednostavno nismo bili mi.
I don't know myself from that.	Ne znam sebe od toga.
But that won't help.	Ali to neće pomoći.
I didn't see it that way.	Nisam to tako vidio.
I know they are there.	Znam da su tamo.
And that's exactly it.	I to je upravo to.
And I really wish I had it.	I zaista bih volio da ga imam.
Except today.	Osim danas.
I love her so much.	Toliko je volim.
This is what you need to do.	Ovo treba da uradite.
He promised to do it, but he didn't.	Obećao je da će to učiniti, ali nije.
For now.	Za sada.
You are doing well.	Dobro ti ide.
Money.	Novac.
I won't see it.	Neću to vidjeti.
You probably will be.	Verovatno ćeš biti.
You told me.	Rekao si mi.
She knew what it was now.	Znala je šta je sada.
You're right enough.	Dovoljno si u pravu.
I was very surprised.	Bio sam veoma iznenađen.
Don't say anything.	Ne govori ništa.
He would never.	Nikada ne bi.
If it works, good.	Ako radi, dobro.
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
It was just there.	Samo je bilo tamo.
My good friend.	Moj dobar prijatelj.
You were so busy.	Bio si tako zauzet.
I know how much he loved you.	Znam koliko te je volio.
That's what he loves.	To je ono što on voli.
Either way it can work.	Bilo koji način može raditi.
But not yet.	Ali još nisu.
Another problem.	Još jedan problem.
He plays like that.	On tako igra.
What will happen to us?	Šta će biti s nama?
Today is not that day.	Danas nije taj dan.
That was a few years ago.	Bilo je to prije nekoliko godina.
And that is true.	I to je istina.
I'm the only one who can do that.	Ja sam jedini koji to može.
Long time.	Dugo vremena.
He gave it his all.	Dao je sve.
Everything she was.	Sve što je bila.
If you haven’t, everyone will be able to say it.	Ako niste, svi će to moći reći.
There were many things.	Bilo je mnogo stvari.
I thought she would be good at it.	Mislio sam da će biti dobra u tome.
I tried to know what to say.	Pokušao sam da znam šta da kažem.
Maybe very good.	Možda veoma dobro.
And little by little, it was true.	I malo po malo, bila je istina.
I don't know what would have happened without it.	Ne znam šta bi bilo bez toga.
But it must be said.	Ali mora se reći.
I will continue.	Ja ću i dalje.
But how can this be good?	Ali kako ovo može biti dobro?
All but three.	Sve osim tri.
He was a good friend.	Bio je dobar prijatelj.
That is what we need to do.	To je ono što treba da radimo.
Even if someone was with me.	To i da je neko bio sa mnom.
No one can say no to us.	Niko nam ne može reći ne.
Not just this.	Ne samo ovo.
So far, it's so simple.	Do sada je to tako jednostavno.
And it's nothing more than that.	I nije ništa više od toga.
It wasn't hard.	Nije bilo teško.
It wasn't you.	To nisi bio ti.
He seemed to be sick.	Činilo se da mu je loše.
But do as you must.	Ali uradi kako moraš.
That's okay.	To je u redu.
I know it was mine.	Znam da je moj bio.
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
Like today.	Kao danas.
There is nothing to do, nothing to do.	Nema šta da se radi, šta da se radi.
I have a good job.	Imam dobar posao.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
They said they would never come for us, not now.	Rekli su da nikada neće doći po nas, ne sada.
He does his job.	On radi svoj posao.
She was gone for a long time.	Dugo je nije bilo.
It still was.	I dalje je bilo.
And he would tell me.	I on bi mi rekao.
No one is happy.	Niko nije sretan.
I decided.	Odlučio sam.
You do everything right, but these things can still happen.	Radite sve kako treba, ali ove stvari se i dalje mogu dogoditi.
Or maybe you don't want her to do it.	Ili možda ne želite da ona to uradi.
I need more.	Trebalo bi mi više.
That life was no longer mine.	Taj život više nije bio moj.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
Someone has to be a person who doesn’t.	Neko mora biti osoba koja to ne čini.
I had it.	Imao sam ga.
We didn't know what to find.	Nismo znali šta ćemo naći.
Yes, that must have happened.	Da, to se sigurno dogodilo.
We have to go home.	Moramo ići kući.
Maybe never.	Možda nikada neće.
But he could see.	Ali mogao je da vidi.
She told him so and he left.	Tako mu je rekla i on je otišao.
You might even say something.	Možda čak i nešto kažeš.
Something just happened, and he wants to tell me.	Nešto se upravo dogodilo, i on želi da mi kaže.
I have something to do.	Imam nešto da radim.
You can't do everything.	Ne možeš sve.
No time.	Nema vremena.
I know more than you.	Znam više od tebe.
It's not like he's out of his way or anything.	Nije kao da mu je s puta ili tako nešto.
I haven't heard that before.	Nisam to ranije čuo.
There were very few of them.	Bilo ih je vrlo malo.
And so are you.	A i ti si.
Even if you said it was okay.	Čak i ako si rekao da je u redu.
I knew that was not what it was supposed to be.	Znao sam da to nije ono što je trebalo da bude.
Yes if he did, it would be.	Da ako on to uradi, to bi bilo.
I did not know that.	Nisam to znao.
I know how it works.	Znam kako to radi.
And maybe you do.	I možda to radiš.
It was bad.	Bilo je loše.
Everyone seems to know everything about everyone.	Čini se da svi znaju sve o svima.
You gave me a lot more than you think you have.	Dao si mi mnogo više nego što misliš da imaš.
It was really quick and easy.	Bilo je stvarno brzo i jednostavno.
I do this for a living.	Ja to radim za život.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
He was human.	Bio je čovjek.
I know he knows.	Znam da zna.
Which she probably can't do with me.	Što ona vjerovatno ne može sa mnom.
But we already know these things.	Ali ove stvari već znamo.
Who lives here?	Ko živi ovde?
He realized she was right.	Shvatio je da je bila u pravu.
I love a lot of things.	Volim puno stvari.
That's pretty obvious.	To je prilično očigledno.
He can do anything.	Može sve.
He had seen it before.	Video je to ranije.
I know you didn't mean that.	Znam da nisi tako mislio.
You need to know.	Morate znati.
At the party.	Na zabavi.
He is not one of us.	On nije jedan od nas.
And what if.	A šta ako.
I know how real this can be.	Znam koliko ovo može biti stvarno.
But it won't be.	Ali to neće biti.
If no one sees it.	Ako ga niko ne vidi.
You are right in your own way.	U pravu ste na svoj način.
Who will do it first?	Ko će to prvi uraditi?
I mean, really.	Mislim, stvarno.
Or not.	Ili ne.
She just knew it was there.	Samo je znala da je tamo.
There was no one there.	Tamo nije bilo nikoga.
But there was more to it than that.	Ali bilo je više od toga.
He came back again and wanted more.	Ponovo se vratio i želio je još.
It wasn't necessary.	Nije trebalo.
Maybe a little.	Možda malo.
Maybe they didn't say anything.	Možda nisu ništa rekli.
We all know that already.	Svi to već znamo.
This man is not.	Ovaj čovjek nije.
This was real life.	Ovo je bio pravi život.
And she wanted to.	I htela je.
I say, not really.	Kažem, ne baš.
But that just can’t happen.	Ali to se jednostavno ne može dogoditi.
I haven't done that yet.	Nisam to još uradio.
And he does it.	I on to radi.
I had to be good.	Morao sam biti dobar.
It didn't seem to be.	Činilo se da nije.
I should have seen it before.	Trebao sam to vidjeti prije.
And he knew where he lived.	A znao je i gdje živi.
I love you and everything.	Volim te i sve.
No, not only that.	Ne, ne samo to.
But not that way.	Ali ne na taj način.
I had to do better, do more, do it right.	Morao sam da radim bolje, da radim više, da to uradim kako treba.
I wish you wouldn't do that.	Voleo bih da to ne radiš.
I really wish it couldn't be.	Mnogo želim da to ne može biti.
Tell me.	Reci mi.
It will be soon.	Uskoro će biti.
No, you didn't do anything wrong.	Ne, nisi uradio ništa loše.
You always knew he was there for the team.	Uvek si znao da je tu za tim.
He didn't get home last night.	Sinoć nije stigao kući.
We did what we could.	Uradili smo šta smo mogli.
You don't even know who you are.	Čak i ne znaš ko si.
That's what it was.	To je ono što je bilo.
The road is not safe yet.	Put još nije siguran.
I'm not ready.	Nisam spreman.
They didn't do that.	To nisu uradili.
It's just there.	Samo je tamo.
I do not know what.	Ne znam šta.
I had to see her.	Morao sam da je vidim.
It may never be.	Može biti da nikada neće biti.
That should help you.	To bi trebalo da ti pomogne.
He loves you very, very much.	Voli te jako, mnogo.
I don't think he had much.	Mislim da nije imao mnogo.
Until this year.	Do ove godine.
There's not much you can do.	Ne možete mnogo da uradite.
My life would no longer be mine.	Moj život više ne bi bio moj.
But that's it.	Ali to je to.
And that will be enough.	I to će biti dovoljno.
What did he mean? 	Šta je mislio?
It was good that he did that.	Bilo je dobro da je to uradio.
This is happening today.	Ovo se dešava danas.
I don't like that in me.	Ne sviđa mi se to u sebi.
I'll tell you the truth.	Reći ću ti istinu.
It's not.	Nije.
I have to go now.	Moram ići sada.
So it can't be much.	Tako da ne može biti mnogo.
He knows what really happened.	On zna šta se zaista dogodilo.
It's business, it's business.	To je posao, to je posao.
It was a bad job.	To je bio loš posao.
It just isn't.	Jednostavno nije.
We had no idea what we were doing.	Nismo imali pojma šta radimo.
Maybe more.	Možda i više.
You can probably do better.	Vjerovatno možeš bolje.
I haven't seen this before.	Nisam vidio ovo prije.
Soon everyone will.	Uskoro će svi.
That's always the way.	To je uvijek način.
He had never had to do that before.	Nikada prije to nije morao učiniti.
And they would be right.	I bili bi u pravu.
Nobody drives.	Niko ne vozi.
We don't know why.	Ne znamo zašto.
I don't like it here, you know.	Ne sviđa mi se ovde, znaš.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
Apparently, he didn't know what to do.	Očigledno, nije znao šta da radi.
We never did.	Nikad nismo.
If it goes, it goes.	Ako ide, ide.
None of us will.	Niko od nas neće.
He went to work.	Otišao je na posao.
He came to help us.	Došao nam je za pomoć.
There is no time like now.	Nema vremena kao sada.
It is.	Da, jeste.
The years will do it.	Godine će to učiniti.
Please say.	Molim te, reci.
We had no idea who he was.	Nismo imali pojma ko je on.
I don't have a car.	Ja nemam auto.
It's been years.	Prošle su godine.
I really love it.	Zaista volim to.
Are you sure you want to see this?	Jeste li sigurni da želite vidjeti ovo?
I'm not sure where he went.	Nisam siguran gdje je otišao.
And why not.	A zašto ne.
But that cannot be done.	Ali to se ne može učiniti.
There is nothing more.	Nema ništa više.
I've never done that before.	Nikad to još nisam uradio.
That was not good.	To nije bilo dobro.
Just do it.	Samo to uradi.
Maybe they are even better.	Možda su čak i bolji.
It's not for me.	Nije za mene.
There was nothing to see.	Nije bilo šta da se vidi.
You can say anything.	Možeš reći bilo šta.
We're not there yet.	Još nismo tamo.
She is not well at all.	Ona uopšte nije dobro.
You really can't help it.	Tu se zaista ne može pomoći.
There were many.	Bilo je mnogo.
He says.	On kaže.
That you are absolutely sure.	Da ste potpuno sigurni.
But he was fine.	Ali bio je dobro.
It wouldn't be hard.	Ne bi bilo teško.
I just couldn't believe myself.	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati sebi.
Too much going on, too much to do.	Previše toga se dešava, previše za uraditi.
In fact, that is not true.	U stvari, to nije istina.
It really isn't enough.	Zaista nije dovoljno.
Everyone said so.	Svi su tako rekli.
He would be right.	Bio bi u pravu.
Not this way.	Ne na ovaj način.
He wondered how old he was.	Pitao se koliko ima godina.
I want this.	Želim ovo.
It works very well.	Radi veoma dobro.
I'm sure of that.	Siguran sam u to.
No problem here.	Ovdje nema problema.
You want to tell me this isn't real?	Hoćeš da mi kažeš da ovo nije stvarno?
We'll just have to see.	Samo ćemo morati vidjeti.
I don't want that either.	Ni ja to ne želim.
So it doesn't work.	Tako da to ne radi.
I just would.	Samo bi.
I'd know that anywhere.	Znao bih to bilo gdje.
For both of you.	Za vas oboje.
But not just work.	Ali ne samo posao.
It was meant to be.	Tako je trebalo da bude.
That has to be done.	To se mora uraditi.
Which he himself wanted.	Što je i on sam želio.
I love it.	Volim to.
There are many things we can do.	Postoji mnogo stvari koje možemo učiniti.
He has to go now.	Mora da ide sada.
No one ever knows the truth.	Niko nikada ne zna istinu.
I think.	Mislim ja.
I never knew.	Nikad nisam znao.
And that is simply not true.	A to jednostavno nije istina.
He says exactly what he has to say.	Kaže tačno ono što treba da kaže.
I just wasn't.	Jednostavno nisam bio.
I can't say anything more.	Ne mogu reći ništa više.
That's the real problem.	To je pravi problem.
This is usually obvious.	To je obično očigledno.
There is nothing more to say.	Nema šta više da se kaže.
Not much.	Ne mnogo.
This is not right.	Ovo nije u redu.
I asked what it was, and he never told me.	Pitao sam šta je to, a on mi nikad nije rekao.
She didn't want to do anything.	Nije htela ništa da uradi.
She said she didn't see what she was doing.	Rekla je da ne vidi šta radi.
I’m just not sure if that’s wrong with me or not.	Samo nisam siguran da li to nije u redu od mene ili ne.
She wasn't there long.	Nije bila tamo dugo.
I'm so glad you came.	Tako mi je drago što si došao.
That you are here.	Da si ovde.
We are all much better off.	Svima nam je mnogo bolje.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
I was not completely surprised.	Nisam bio potpuno iznenađen.
And that's what you did.	I to je ono što si radio.
And it won't.	I neće.
he thought.	mislio je.
That wasn't it.	Nije to bilo to.
What you say may be true.	Ono što kažeš može biti istina.
I didn't know what.	Nisam znao šta.
It can't be true, it can't be true.	Ne može biti istina, ne može biti istina.
He does it more and more.	On to radi sve više i više.
A lot is happening.	Mnogo toga se dešava.
If we have to.	Ako moramo.
He won't be able to live without me.	Neće moći da živi bez mene.
I don't know how you did it.	Ne znam kako si to uradio.
Please, please, please.	Molim te, molim te, molim te.
Apparently they didn't.	Očigledno nisu.
And that's what's happening here.	I to se dešava ovde.
You can't help me.	Ne možeš mi pomoći.
I said too much about myself.	Rekao sam previše o sebi.
She can't tell us who he is.	Ona nam ne može reći ko je on.
But it shouldn't have been.	Ali nije trebalo biti.
All that.	Sve to.
We couldn't leave.	Nismo mogli otići.
He heard enough.	Čuo je dovoljno.
It looks like it will be the same this year.	Izgleda da će tako biti i ove godine.
It never has and it never will.	Nikad nije i nikada neće.
I'm doing this.	Ja ovo radim.
Nobody knew anything.	Niko ništa nije znao.
No more needs to be said.	Više od toga ne treba reći.
But it’s still bad for business.	Ali to je i dalje loše za posao.
Everything is as it should be.	Sve je kako treba.
But she wasn't.	Ali nije bila.
Someone had to say that.	Neko je to morao da kaže.
I mean, not really.	Mislim, ne baš.
What is.	Šta je.
But she didn't know it.	Ali ona to nije znala.
I know him, he won't do anything without it.	Znam ga, bez toga neće ništa.
Life has done it.	Život je to učinio.
No one can help you.	Niko ti ne može pomoći.
Probably still is.	Verovatno i dalje jeste.
It's just my life.	To je samo moj život.
This goes beyond help.	Ovo ide dalje od pomoći.
We couldn't believe what we had just done.	Nismo mogli vjerovati šta smo upravo uradili.
That day is here.	Taj dan je tu.
But it is much more than that.	Ali to je mnogo više od toga.
It was a happy day for everyone.	Bio je to sretan dan za sve.
It's true, you know.	Istina je, znaš.
I just know it's not.	Samo znam da nije.
You don't even know how it happened.	Ne znaš ni kako se to dogodilo.
Why would I?	Zašto bi?
But this one does.	Ali, ovaj ima.
This is her.	Ovo je ona.
This can't happen.	Ovo se ne može dogoditi.
No more days.	Nema više dana.
Very, very long.	Veoma, veoma dugo.
He doesn't want her right now.	Trenutno je ne želi.
And there seems to be only one way to do it.	A čini se da postoji samo jedan način da se to uradi.
And now they never would be.	A sada nikada ne bi ni bili.
If she only knew.	Kad bi samo znala.
I thought it was really good.	Mislio sam da je stvarno dobro.
This may be true.	Ovo je možda istina.
But they are not there yet.	Ali oni još nisu tamo.
As it was.	Kao što je bilo.
But soon.	Ali uskoro.
He told us everything.	On nam je sve rekao.
I can't do that now.	Ne mogu to sada.
He must have been right.	Mora da je bio u pravu.
Nobody had to say that.	Niko to nije morao da kaže.
I want them.	Želim ih.
who says so	ko tako kaže?
She doesn't want me there.	Ona me ne želi tamo.
This was as far as possible.	Ovo je bilo što dalje.
I didn't know why or how.	Nisam znao zašto ni kako.
We do it here.	Mi to radimo ovdje.
It was not easy to do.	To nije bilo lako učiniti.
But, but, but.	Ali, ali, ali.
You're not ready yet.	Još nisi spreman.
I didn't have.	Nisam imao.
And that is exactly what happened.	I upravo se to dogodilo.
I'm still not sure what to do.	Još uvijek nisam siguran šta da radim.
And why not.	A zašto ne bi.
I didn't do anything about it.	Nisam uradio ništa s tim.
It's just us here and nothing happened.	Ovdje smo samo mi i ništa se nije dogodilo.
We didn't know how or why.	Nismo znali kako ni zašto.
There was no one at home.	Nije bilo nikoga kod kuće.
He knew who it was.	On je znao ko je to.
She can stay.	Ona može ostati.
Until last night.	Do sinoć.
But they were all still alive.	Ali svi su još bili živi.
Maybe it really is.	Možda zaista jeste.
He said it many times.	Rekao je mnogo puta.
There is a lot of that.	Ima toga dosta.
Something is happening.	Nešto se dešava.
Nobody bought it for me.	Niko mi ga nije kupio.
I'm glad you're okay.	Drago mi je da si dobro.
Wear it.	Nosi se.
Don't talk too much.	Ne govori previše.
And neither are you.	A nisi ni ti.
We're doing a video.	Radimo video.
Even to this day.	Čak i do danas.
I never did.	Nikada nisam.
That's for sure.	To je sigurno.
They were all that was bad.	Oni su bili sve što je bilo loše.
I told you it wouldn't be like that.	Rekao sam ti da neće biti tako.
I wonder how that makes him feel.	Pitam se kako se zbog toga osjeća.
Let me tell you, it's not okay.	Da vam kažem, nije u redu.
I didn't know about all that.	Nisam znao za sve to.
You should know.	Trebao bi znati.
And everything is going well.	I sve ide kako treba.
I didn't know what he was talking about.	Nisam znao o čemu priča.
Did you have that.	Jeste li imali to.
I want to know everything.	Želim da znam sve.
But that's okay.	Ali to je u redu.
If only for a while.	Ako samo na neko vrijeme.
It's better that way.	Bolje je tako biti.
Looks good.	Izgleda dobro.
But she never knew why either.	Ali ni ona nikada nije znala zašto.
I will too.	I ja ću.
If they are not, they should be.	Ako nisu, trebali bi biti.
That's all, 'he said.	Samo to', rekao je.
It looks much better.	Mnogo bolje izgleda.
I should go get it really.	Trebao bih otići po to stvarno.
It's true.	To je tačno.
Maybe even three.	Možda čak tri.
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
You are my friend.	Ti si moj prijatelj.
It wasn't a problem.	Nije bio problem.
Nobody should have done that.	To niko nije trebao uraditi.
She said that.	Ona je to rekla.
But that doesn't happen often.	Ali to se ne dešava često.
But a lot of it.	Ali dosta toga.
Let me ask you.	Da te pitam.
This is still true.	Ovo je još uvijek istina.
I'm glad, because of you, that she has.	Drago mi je, zbog tebe, što ona ima.
I haven't seen him here before.	Nisam ga ranije vidio ovdje.
She does it alone.	Ona to radi sama.
He didn't know why.	Nije znao zašto.
I want you so much.	Toliko te želim.
Life for life.	Život za život.
And have they ever.	I da li su ikada.
Right here.	Upravo kod nas.
No one looked like him.	Niko nije izgledao kao on.
You won't be able to bring me back.	Nećeš me moći vratiti.
I think it should be you.	Mislim da bi to trebao biti ti.
And I say so.	I ja kažem da je tako.
That was my game.	To je bila moja igra.
It's been a long time.	Bilo je dugo.
I hope I can.	Nadam se da mogu.
I didn't hear anything from him.	Nisam čuo ništa od njega.
I haven’t been there yet and I won’t be for much longer.	Nisam još bio tamo i neću biti još dugo.
He won't know anything for a while.	Neće znati ništa neko vrijeme.
It will never happen.	Nikada se neće dogoditi.
I couldn't believe he wasn't there.	Nisam mogao vjerovati da ga nema.
And you are .	A ti si .
I really needed the money.	Stvarno mi je trebao novac.
You have to give me that too.	Moraš mi dati i to.
I can’t say much more about it here.	Ne mogu još puno reći o tome ovdje.
It didn’t happen in one day and it wasn’t easy.	To se nije dogodilo za jedan dan i nije bilo lako.
My father has a lot of money.	Moj otac ima mnogo novca.
That's okay.	To je u redu.
There is a problem.	Tu je problem.
What it seems.	Šta se čini.
He doesn't do bad things.	On ne radi loše stvari.
He likes it a lot.	Mnogo mu se sviđa.
But he's just gone.	Ali jednostavno ga više nema.
We knew that.	To smo znali.
It's not that easy.	Nije tako lako.
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
That's none of my business.	To nije moja stvar.
And they did just that.	I uradili su upravo to.
I haven't even been home yet.	Nisam još ni bio kući.
It's just a matter of time.	Samo je pitanje vremena.
All that was wrong was me.	Sve što nije bilo u redu, to sam bio ja.
He had to bring it back.	Morao je to vratiti.
But that would be too easy.	Ali to bi bilo previše lako.
He understood well.	Dobro je shvatio.
We were there.	Bili smo tamo.
I haven't seen her in days.	Nisam je vidio nekoliko dana.
I think you must have known.	Mislim da si morao znati.
Very much.	Jako puno.
I don't need it now.	Ne treba mi to sada.
You have to help.	Moraš pomoći.
And I was at the time.	I ja sam bio u to vrijeme.
It always will be.	Uvijek će biti.
I think so.	Mislim jeste.
I can get it.	Mogu ga dobiti.
He shouldn't.	Ne bi mu trebali.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
But they are there.	Ali oni su tu.
He arrived on time.	Stigao je na vrijeme.
I'm sure of it.	Siguran sam u to.
I didn't really want anything.	Nisam baš ništa želeo.
He couldn't be sure.	Nije mogao biti siguran.
She was everything to him.	Ona mu je bila sve.
We have him.	Imamo ga.
Probably because of the money.	Verovatno zbog novca.
Does not work.	Ne radi.
If she wants to.	Ako ona želi.
'from'.	'od'.
I guess you're right.	Pretpostavljam da si u pravu.
This is something we have to do.	Ovo je nešto što moramo da uradimo.
It's too easy.	Previše je lako.
It doesn't seem to work.	Čini se da ne radi.
Like this morning.	Kao jutros.
Everyone knows who you mean.	Svi znaju na koga mislite.
I just had to be sure.	Samo sam morao biti siguran.
He wondered what the man was thinking.	Pitao se o čemu taj čovjek misli.
As he expected.	Kao što je očekivao.
And you have it.	I imaš ga.
But she was here now.	Ali sada je bila ovdje.
No problem.	Nema problema.
And he wondered.	I on se pitao.
You will help tonight.	Večeras ćeš pomoći.
Long time no see.	Dugo te nije bilo.
That was not the case.	To nije bilo tako.
I have said that many times.	Rekao sam to mnogo puta.
I really decided that.	Zaista sam to odlučio.
They've been here for three years.	Ovdje su već tri godine.
It's simple.	To je jednostavno.
Or maybe you would too.	Ili bi možda i ti.
It can be done.	To se može uraditi.
You don't need anything.	Ne treba ništa.
It can't be helped now.	Ne može se sada pomoći.
It was the first time he had done so.	Bio je to prvi put da je to učinio.
Maybe that was all.	Možda je to bilo sve.
None of us.	Niko od nas.
It doesn’t seem to be seen today.	Čini se da se danas ne vidi.
Even that will be very difficult.	Čak i to će biti jako teško.
He could see that.	Mogao je to da vidi.
This is the first problem.	Ovo je prvi problem.
I didn't have a life before you.	Nisam imao život prije tebe.
Not now.	Sada nisu.
But it is.	Ali jeste.
Is there any help? 	Ima li pomoći?
That is simply not true.	To jednostavno nije tačno.
He did his job.	Uradio je svoj posao.
Yes, she's with me.	Da, sa mnom je.
It's that easy.	To je tako lako.
And heard again.	I ponovo čuo.
I doubt it.	Sumnjam u to.
It can't be helped.	Ne može se pomoći.
I guess he could still.	Pretpostavljam da bi još mogao.
I can never tell.	Nikad ne mogu reći.
This was really good.	Ovo je bilo stvarno dobro.
You have enough time.	Imaš dovoljno vremena.
It's just, it was there.	Samo, tu je bilo.
There is always something he can do.	Uvek postoji nešto što može da uradi.
I love those things.	Volim te stvari.
I hope to be back, but the question is when.	Nadam se da ću se vratiti, ali pitanje je kada.
Maybe a few years ago.	Možda prije nekoliko godina.
We should stay together.	Trebali bismo ostati zajedno.
He wouldn't tell me.	Ne bi mi rekao.
But we couldn't.	Ali nismo mogli.
This is not a problem for you.	To nije problem za vas.
My friend bought me this.	Moj prijatelj mi je ovo kupio.
It was better.	Bilo je bolje.
And we will win.	I mi ćemo pobijediti.
He won't give anything.	Neće ništa dati.
It was hard, hard, hard.	Bilo je teško, teško, teško.
I was a little surprised.	Bio sam malo iznenađen.
I love him but I don't know what to do.	Volim ga ali ne znam šta da radim.
That's really hard.	To je zaista teško.
She was gone for a long time.	Dugo je nije bilo.
I couldn't do anything about it.	Nisam mogao ništa s tim.
I don't want him alone.	Ne želim ga sam.
It didn't seem to be.	Činilo se da nije.
I just wanted to see something, anything, happen.	Samo sam htela da vidim da se nešto, bilo šta, dešava.
No one seems to be able to help him.	Čini se da mu niko ne može pomoći.
And so it was not enough to know.	I tako nije bilo dovoljno znati.
You are not the only one.	Nisi jedini.
This here, and there and there.	Ovo tu, i tamo i tamo.
But it wasn't good.	Ali nije bilo dobro.
He won't be safe there.	Tamo neće biti siguran.
He had no idea what he was going to say.	Nije imao pojma šta će reći.
She's fine.	Ona je dobro.
He has no job.	On nema posao.
That's not the real problem.	To nije pravi problem.
And maybe it's true.	I možda je tačno.
He's got you.	Ima tebe.
I haven't seen him in a while.	Nisam ga vidio neko vrijeme.
You don't have to.	Ne morate.
And she doesn't really want to be him.	A ona baš i ne želi da bude on.
So good for you !!.	Tako dobro za tebe!!.
But for everyone.	Ali za sve.
Many times.	Mnogo puta.
He knew he shouldn't.	Znao je da ne bi trebao.
They seem to know that we are here.	Čini mi se da znaju da smo ovdje.
The way he tells me he loves me.	Način na koji mi kaže da me voli.
But everything will be fine.	Ali sve će biti u redu.
He said he did.	Rekao je da jeste.
You look good.	Dobro izgledaš.
It should work properly now.	Sada bi trebalo da radi kako treba.
How could this happen? 	Kako se to moglo dogoditi?
How can you believe anything he tells you?	Kako možeš vjerovati bilo čemu što ti kaže?
I thought we did a really good job.	Mislio sam da smo uradili stvarno dobar posao.
Okay for now.	U redu za sada.
When will you return to work?	Kada ćete se vratiti na posao?
I didn't say that.	Nisam to rekao.
It never is and never will be.	Nikad nije i nikada neće.
That must be enough.	Mora biti dovoljno.
He had to know.	Morao je da zna.
I've never seen so much.	Nikad nisam vidio toliko.
Something needs to be done.	Nešto treba uraditi.
But no one could.	Ali niko nije mogao.
Who he was.	Ko je on bio.
I can give you a job.	Mogu ti dati posao.
On him, on himself.	Na njega, na sebe.
I wasn't sure what it was about.	Nisam bio siguran o čemu se radi.
But we all knew.	Ali svi smo znali.
I didn't know where we were.	Nisam znao gdje smo.
It's only for one day.	To je samo za jedan dan.
I'm done for the day.	Završio sam za taj dan.
I should know better.	Trebalo bi da znam bolje.
There is nothing in it.	Nema ništa u tome.
But there is still much to be done.	Ali ima još mnogo toga da se uradi.
I was as happy as I could be.	Bio sam sretan koliko mogu.
He left.	Otišao je.
There are so many of them.	Toliko ih je.
He never was.	Nikada ga nije bilo.
But something happened.	Ali nešto se dogodilo.
He had to know.	Morao je znati.
But often that is the only way.	Ali često je to jedini način.
They seem to be right.	Čini se da su u pravu.
That's obvious.	To je očigledno.
He says why.	On kaže zašto.
We really don't know much.	Zaista ne znamo mnogo.
But they can't do anything.	Ali oni ne mogu ništa.
That was my job.	To je bio moj posao.
People who may not exist.	Ljudi koje možda nema.
I love him and I still love him.	Volim ga i volim ga i dalje.
In fact, we are not.	U stvari, nismo.
This is simply not true.	Ovo jednostavno nije istina.
Nobody likes to wait in line.	Niko ne voli da čeka u redu.
I'm sure you know.	Siguran sam da znaš.
She wants nothing more from him.	Ona ne želi više ništa s njim.
And everyone, actually.	I svi, zapravo.
I am nothing without a home.	Ja sam ništa bez kuće.
I just wanted to be her.	Samo sam htela da budem ja.
I'm not doing anything.	Ne radim ništa.
I have a lot of them.	Imam ih dosta.
But you don't mean that.	Ali ne misliš to.
Something is going on here.	Nešto se dešava ovde.
He thinks you're alone.	On misli da si sam.
I think we need that.	Mislim da nam to treba.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
Except they're not.	Osim što nisu.
But now this is the real problem for you.	Ali sada je to pravi problem za vas.
And you like how it is.	I sviđa ti se kako je to.
All by itself.	Sve samo po sebi.
It's just like that.	Jednostavno je tako.
That should be it.	To bi trebao biti.
Apparently he was.	Očigledno je bio.
He gave it to me.	Dao mi je.
You can do this too.	Možete i ovo da uradite.
But not much.	Ali ne mnogo.
We need a few things.	Treba nam nekoliko stvari.
Yes, good question.	Da, dobro pitanje.
Nobody seems to want to do that.	Izgleda da to niko ne želi da uradi.
But I don't do everything either.	Ali ni ja ne radim sve.
Nothing is ever enough.	Ništa nikad nije dovoljno.
And tell him why.	I reci mu zašto.
I'm afraid.	Bojim se.
said the first.	rekao je prvi.
I just wasn't sure.	Samo nisam bio siguran.
It wasn't necessary.	Nije trebalo.
Don't tell me anything.	Ne govori mi ništa.
I mean, it is, but it's not.	Mislim, jeste, ali nije.
I don't know why that happened.	Ne znam zašto se to dogodilo.
That seems difficult.	To izgleda teško.
She wants to be here.	Ona želi biti ovdje.
I'll tell you tomorrow.	Reći ću ti sutra.
But she doesn't have to.	Ali ona ne mora.
Obviously it is.	Očigledno jeste.
That's not bad.	To nije loše.
We'll talk soon.	Uskoro ćemo razgovarati.
And it is still true.	I još uvijek je istina.
He has no idea what to do.	On nema pojma šta treba da uradi.
It will never be enough.	Nikada neće biti dovoljno.
They couldn't be sure what had happened.	Nisu mogli biti sigurni šta se dogodilo.
I heard that.	Čuo sam to.
You will too.	I ti ćeš.
Only they can do that.	Samo oni to mogu.
They said that at home.	To su rekli kod kuće.
Or he will find them.	Ili će ih naći.
But it doesn't work.	Ali ne radi.
In fact, nothing.	U stvari, ništa.
They are not like us.	Oni nisu kao mi.
No one can.	Niko ne može.
That's what she does.	To je ono što ona radi.
She, who knew that, said nothing.	Ona, koja je to znala, nije rekla ništa.
They had a lot.	Imali su mnogo.
This is really pretty simple.	Ovo je zaista prilično jednostavno.
Only, I wouldn't.	Samo, ne bi.
I know it is.	Znam da jeste.
Who he was looking for.	Koga je tražio.
I'm not sure what this is about.	Nisam siguran o čemu se radi.
You have to know everything.	Morate znati sve.
I'm telling you how.	Ja ti kažem kako.
I couldn't see him.	Nisam ga mogao vidjeti.
I don't want you to be sorry.	Ne želim da ti je žao.
He knew he should do something.	Znao je da bi trebao nešto učiniti.
Like him.	Kao i on.
I think you would know that.	Mislim da biste to znali.
Yes, just this.	Da, upravo ovo.
We could for a long time.	Mogli bismo još dugo.
I was pretty glad.	Bilo mi je prilično drago.
That's the only way.	To je jedini način.
We'll say home.	Reći ćemo kući.
I said.	Rekao sam.
It's just that it's not.	Samo što nije.
I am very happy.	Jako sam sretan.
He does what he wants.	Radi ono što želi.
But you were right.	Ali bio si u pravu.
No, he can't.	Neće, ne može.
You should have been there.	Trebao si biti tamo.
In fact, it is true.	U stvari, to je istina.
And it works pretty well.	I radi prilično dobro.
This has never happened before.	Ovo se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
But you were there.	Ali ti si bio tamo.
Say it.	Reći.
He had to say that.	Morao je to reći.
They will help you, he said.	Oni će vam pomoći, rekao je.
And no one really wants that.	I niko to zaista ne želi.
Yes, there were a few problems.	Da, bilo je nekoliko problema.
The thing is, or not.	Stvar jeste, ili nije.
They will come.	Oni će doći.
But it is not so.	Ali nije tako.
Just very hard.	Samo jako teško.
I really have nothing to do.	Zaista nemam šta da radim.
On this way.	Na ovaj način.
Probably you too.	Vjerovatno i ti.
Tell him again.	Reci mu ponovo.
They would be.	Bili bi.
I have my own car.	Imam svoj auto.
She told him a few things.	Rekla mu je nekoliko stvari.
He had to do what he had to do.	Morao je da uradi ono što je morao.
So everything will be fine.	Tako da će sve biti u redu.
No, it doesn't exist.	Ne, ne postoji.
They know what happened.	Oni znaju šta se dogodilo.
Like next week.	Kao i sljedeće sedmice.
I got.	Dobio sam.
You wouldn't know.	Ne biste znali.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
He is now doing what he loves.	On sada radi ono što voli.
I bought myself a new one.	Kupio sam sebi novi.
You have to believe this.	Ovo morate vjerovati.
And they were right.	I bili su u pravu.
Can she give herself time.	Može li ona sebi dati vremena.
Maybe it really is.	Možda zaista jeste.
He wanted to know more.	Želio je znati više.
But it's not like that with you.	Ali nije tako s tobom.
That should be it.	To bi trebalo biti.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
Nobody needs it anymore.	Nikome više ne treba.
I don't want him to know about this.	Ne želim da zna za ovo.
In truth, it never was.	Istina, to nikada nije bilo.
She wanted to leave.	Htela je da ode.
I knew he was bad.	Znao sam da je loš.
He doesn't even love me.	On me čak ni ne voli.
He never knew.	Nikada nije znao.
It's really good.	Zaista je dobro.
It seemed like a long time.	Činilo se kao dugo.
There was something before that.	Nešto je bilo i prije toga.
Maybe there are too many.	Možda ih je previše.
I am ready to give my life for you.	Spreman sam dati svoj život za tebe.
I know what his job is.	Znam šta mu je posao.
I have no idea what to do next.	Nemam pojma šta će dalje.
I mean,.	Mislim,.
I left at three.	Otišao sam u tri.
It just doesn’t work.	To jednostavno ne radi.
I'm sure, as am I.	Siguran sam, kao i ja.
But she does.	Ali ona to radi.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo dobro.
There was nothing he could do.	Nije mogao ništa učiniti.
But that was never an idea.	Ali to nikada nije bila ideja.
But he knew he had to do something.	Ali znao je da mora nešto učiniti.
Now we know more about it.	Sada znamo više o tome.
You do.	Pravi ti.
Do you mean that? 	Da li to misliš?
That's for him.	To je za njega.
Idea! 	Ideja!
He says.	On kaže.
Or maybe no more than.	Ili možda nema više od.
There should be many more.	Trebalo bi da ih ima mnogo više.
Don't do that if you don't like it.	Nemoj to ako ti se ne sviđa.
He is not going easy.	On ne ide na jednostavno.
That's it, as long as you're here just for that.	To je to, sve dok ste ovdje samo zbog toga.
Everyone knew who he was.	Svi su znali ko je on.
I just don't know why a guy would say that.	Samo ne znam zašto bi momak to rekao.
It could certainly be anything.	Sigurno bi moglo biti bilo šta.
No one lives here now.	Sada ovde niko ne živi.
I mean, you can.	Mislim, možeš.
The first is that there are so few of them.	Prvi je da ih je tako malo.
Maybe this is the first.	Možda je ovo prvi.
Not by itself.	Ne samo po sebi.
But there you are.	Ali tu si.
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to tačno.
There is nothing wrong with that at all.	Uopšte nema ništa loše u tome.
You should trust me.	Trebao bi mi vjerovati.
I will never believe that.	Nikad neću vjerovati u to.
But that is not the case.	Ali to nije tako.
But even without it.	Ali čak i bez toga.
That really happened.	To se zaista dogodilo.
It could be.	To bi moglo biti.
But that was not enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno.
And he will do it.	I on će to učiniti.
She never told me about this.	Nikad mi nije rekla za ovo.
I am three years old.	Imam tri godine.
Something is certainly better than nothing.	Nešto je sigurno bolje nego ništa.
You are human.	Vi ste ljudi.
And you know why.	I znaš zašto.
It's happening now.	To se dešava sada.
We have to be.	Moramo biti.
He was happy when he got a new job.	Bio je sretan kada je dobio novi posao.
He said he did.	Rekao je da jeste.
I usually work alone.	Obično radim sam.
You only have one life.	Imaš samo jedan život.
She said too much.	Previše je rekla.
I don't want anything more from him.	Ne želim više ništa s njim.
He had it now.	Imao ga je sada.
There are problems, yes.	Ima problema, da.
He says he is.	Kaže da jeste.
We won't be long.	Nećemo dugo.
It even has a door.	Čak ima i vrata.
This is difficult.	Ovo je teško.
I'm going very fast '.	Idem jako brzo'.
We seem to be doing well so far.	Čini se da nam za sada ide dobro.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
This time he said so.	Ovaj put je tako rekao.
Not very likely.	Nije baš vjerovatno.
No, that's not right either.	Ne, ni to nije u redu.
Not for long.	Ne dugo.
I know he's better.	Znam da mu je bolje.
This was my friend.	Ovo je bio moj prijatelj.
But those are speeches.	Ali to su govori.
I'm better now.	Sada sam bolje.
He is someone who cannot help you.	On je neko ko vam se ne može pomoći.
More than enough.	Više nego dovoljno.
They had problems too.	I oni su imali problema.
He has a friend who wants it.	Ima prijatelja koji to želi.
And that's probably a problem.	I to je vjerovatno problem.
More than that.	Više od toga.
I know it myself.	Znam to po sebi.
I have no idea how to do this.	Nemam pojma kako da ovo uradim.
No, you shouldn't.	Ne, ne bi trebao.
I can't do much.	Ne mogu puno.
You had me.	Imao si me.
I did exactly what you said.	Uradio sam tačno ono što si rekao.
Or it used to be.	Ili je to nekada bilo.
And so this is for you.	I tako je ovo za tebe.
There is a lot to do.	Ima dosta toga da se uradi.
I think you are.	Mislim da jesi.
Yes for that.	Da za to.
And she was alone.	I bila je sama.
He didn't seem to be eating at all.	Činilo se da uopšte ne jede.
It was my father.	Bio je to moj otac.
He simply knew without knowing why he knew.	Jednostavno je znao a da nije znao zašto je znao.
It works really well.	Radi zaista dobro.
I have to go, and so do you.	Moram da idem, a i ti.
Maybe he doesn't like himself much either.	Možda ni on sebe ne voli mnogo.
Not much, but little.	Ne mnogo, ali malo.
I mean, he never even asked me about it.	Mislim, nikad me nije ni pitao o tome.
But we are alone.	Ali mi smo sami.
Not so much for me.	Ne toliko za mene.
Do not tell me.	Nemoj mi reći.
Do this.	Radi ovo.
They never are and never will be.	Nikada nisu i nikada neće.
As if there was nothing to talk about.	Kao da nema o čemu da se priča.
It's a person.	To je osoba.
To be or not to be, that is the question.	Biti ili ne biti, to je pitanje.
What do you say?	Šta kažeš?
I See You.	Vidim te.
Okay, so we're not really going to do that.	U redu, tako da to zapravo nećemo učiniti.
I won't let him do that.	Neću mu dozvoliti da to uradi.
He had to come to that meeting.	Morao je doći na taj sastanak.
No one really knew what was going on.	Niko zapravo nije znao šta se dešava.
It's like you're the only thing that exists.	To je kao da ste jedina stvar koja postoji.
In fact, they were here.	U stvari, bili su ovdje.
I would never do that.	Nikad to ne bih uradio.
This will not be done in one day either.	Ni ovo se neće uraditi za jedan dan.
Everyone knew it, and everyone knew it at the time.	Svi to znaju, i svi su to znali u to vrijeme.
I have nothing to do.	Nemam šta da radim.
I haven't done that yet.	Nisam to još radio.
I have this.	Imam ovo.
And U.S.	I mi.
You can't say anything.	Ne možeš ništa reći.
It's not a game.	To nije igra.
And there were more problems.	I bilo je još problema.
I'm not asking anything more.	Ne pitam ništa više.
We have to do it for ourselves.	Moramo to učiniti za sebe.
I don't need that this morning.	Ne treba mi to jutros.
Nobody left.	Niko nije otišao.
If you want to work, work.	Ako želiš da radiš, radi.
That was the only reason.	To je bio jedini razlog.
It's not getting any better.	Ne ide na bolje.
That was the thing.	To je bila stvar.
You did everything.	Sve si uradio.
I do not have money.	Nemam novca.
There is only one problem.	Postoji samo jedan problem.
I know he knows.	Znam da on zna.
Now it's gone.	Sada ga nema.
No one would tell me why.	Niko mi ne bi rekao zašto.
And we are not there.	A mi nismo tamo.
It was the first time she had been there.	Bio je to prvi put da je bila tamo.
This does not happen today.	Ovo se danas ne dešava.
I'm glad it's you and not me.	Drago mi je da si to ti a ne ja.
You are the only one.	Ti si jedini.
I didn't have enough time.	Nisam imao dovoljno vremena.
I told the truth.	Rekao sam istinu.
But my problem is this.	Ali moj problem je ovo.
Now it was more.	Sada je bilo više.
Nothing is said for a while.	Neko vrijeme se ništa ne govori.
And that is all.	I to je sve.
And maybe there is still a person.	A možda još uvek postoji osoba.
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
You should do something about it. 	Trebao bi nešto učiniti s tim. 
This will be my job.	Ovo će biti moj posao.
Everything had to be done properly.	Sve je trebalo da se uradi kako treba.
That's exactly what we're going to do.	Upravo to ćemo i uraditi.
I just want to make sure that's what it is.	Samo želim da budem siguran da je to ono što jeste.
I would really love to see that.	Zaista bih to volio vidjeti.
It no longer exists.	To više ne postoji.
I should go back.	Trebao bih se vratiti.
I knew it was true.	Znao sam da je to istina.
But that's okay.	Ali to je u redu.
We could be that.	Mogli bismo biti to.
This is something we all have.	Ovo je nešto što svi imamo.
You need one.	Treba ti jedan.
He can't help himself.	Ne može si pomoći.
Now that's too much.	Sada je to previše.
I have enough for both of us.	Imam dovoljno za oboje.
And age is not really a problem.	A godine zapravo nisu problem.
I really love him.	Zaista ga volim.
As if nothing had happened.	Kao da se ništa nije dogodilo.
He wouldn't tell me the reason.	Nije mi htio reći razlog.
he asked.	pitao.
We can't now.	Sada više ne možemo.
When he got home.	Kada je stigao kući.
I know you now.	Znam te sada.
Looks like he had to.	Izgleda kao da je morao.
Nothing was enough.	Ništa nije bilo dovoljno.
I'm not sure we even know what that is.	Nisam siguran da uopšte znamo šta je to.
I had no help last year.	Prošle godine nisam imao pomoći.
I can do it myself.	Mogu sam.
That he was.	Da je bio.
I went there.	Otišao sam tamo.
There was no problem.	Nije bilo problema.
It will stay that way for a while longer.	Tako će ostati još neko vrijeme.
Like, more than like, like.	Kao, više nego kao, kao.
Like a meeting.	Kao sastanak.
It doesn't really work.	Ne radi baš.
What's happening to me? 	Šta mi se dešava?
I heard everything they said.	Čuo sam sve što su rekli.
Obviously, that's my job.	Očigledno, to je moj posao.
It won't do anything.	Neće ništa učiniti.
I can not today.	Ne mogu danas.
He would have a good job.	Imao bi dobar posao.
Apparently, it wasn't her.	Očigledno, to nije bila ona.
I didn't even know what it was.	Nisam ni znao šta je to.
Everyone said so.	Svi su tako rekli.
He looked good, she said.	Izgledao je dobro, rekla je.
And good.	I to dobar.
He would do it.	On bi to uradio.
I've been before.	Bio sam ranije.
They will tell you what cannot be done and why.	Oni će vam reći šta se ne može učiniti i zašto.
Jobs are hard to find.	Posao je teško naći.
This is a story.	Ovo je priča.
That is not happening.	To se ne dešava.
I hope it will.	Nadam se da hoće.
I couldn't stay.	Nisam mogao ostati.
He doesn't eat.	On ne jede.
We know what one looks like.	Znamo kako jedan izgleda.
And not much if you can.	I ne mnogo ako možeš.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
I'm the one right now.	Ja sam taj trenutno.
This can't be good.	Ovo ne može biti dobro.
They both knew the truth.	Oboje su znali istinu.
This is now.	Ovo je sada.
He was the first to arrive at the meeting.	On je prvi stigao na sastanak.
I'll say it again.	Reći ću ponovo.
If you are.	Ako ste.
I must be so sick.	Mora da mi je tako loše.
I really really want to.	Zaista zaista želim.
That could not have happened.	To se nije moglo dogoditi.
There was nothing that they could do.	Nisu mogli ništa učiniti.
That's exactly what happened.	Upravo se to dogodilo.
And he's right.	I u pravu je.
All you can be is you.	Sve što možeš biti si ti.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
But say you want more.	Ali reci da želiš više.
These were.	Ovo su bili.
Who knows, maybe he will.	Ko zna, možda i hoće.
He had little to say.	Imao je malo toga da kaže.
I'm not sure about that.	Nisam siguran u to.
I saw the truth.	Video sam istinu.
You're just doing your job.	Ti samo radiš svoj posao.
Yours will give you mine.	Tvoj će ti dati moj.
You knew it was her.	Znao si da je to ona.
And maybe it's better.	I možda je bolje.
I'll tell you something.	Reći ću ti nešto.
It's almost nothing.	To je skoro ništa.
I am very, very good.	Ja sam veoma, veoma dobar.
Now he knows.	Sada zna.
I'm sure they'll be some of that.	Siguran sam da će oni biti nešto od toga.
Not even last year.	Nije bilo ni prošle godine.
Maybe who she was.	Možda ko je bila.
And yes, that's the story.	I da, to je priča.
But I’m just not good at it.	Ali jednostavno nisam dobar u tome.
I'm sure actually.	Siguran sam zapravo.
And there was probably nothing.	I vjerovatno nije bilo ništa.
What should we do? 	Šta da radimo?
It's never that simple.	Nikad nije tako jednostavno.
They will return.	Oni će se vratiti.
He had nothing to say about it.	Nije imao šta da kaže o tome.
We're just in it.	Samo smo u tome.
It was like a game.	Bilo je to kao igra.
He often works from home.	Često radi kod kuće.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Nisam siguran u čemu je problem.
He's a good guy.	On je dobar momak.
If they can be found.	Ako se mogu naći.
And I like everything.	I sviđa se i sve.
There is something wrong here.	Ovdje nešto nije u redu.
It's easy to see why.	Lako je vidjeti zašto.
This is no longer true.	Ovo više nije istina.
not yet.	ne još.
Don't tell anyone.	Ne govori to nikome.
More will come.	Doći će još.
But it doesn't seem likely.	Ali ne izgleda vjerovatno.
The problem was, he couldn't tell.	Problem je bio u tome što nije mogao reći.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda i nije.
I wish I had more time.	Voleo bih da sam imao više vremena.
It's been so long.	Bilo je tako dugo.
That time is now.	To vrijeme je sada.
I needed what they could give me.	Trebalo mi je ono što su mi mogli dati.
He should know that by now.	On bi to do sada trebao znati.
Three days ago.	Prije tri dana.
That was my mi.	To je bio moj mi.
That is certainly true.	To je sigurno tačno.
I know who.	Znam ko.
You're not there yet.	Još niste tamo.
I'm much better.	Mnogo mi je bolje.
But there is a good reason for that.	Ali postoji dobar razlog za to.
I know, neither do I.	Znam, ni ja.
I know you're not.	Znam da nisi.
I don't like this.	Ne sviđa mi se ovo.
If anyone can, it's you.	Ako neko može, to si ti.
He did this.	On je ovo uradio.
I never worked with him.	Nikad nisam radio sa njim.
And live it.	I živi to.
I'm sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog.
But no one does that.	Ali to niko ne radi.
He couldn't go beyond that.	Nije mogao ići dalje od toga.
That will be good.	To će biti dobro.
You are my only hope.	Ti si moja jedina nada.
That, as we know, did not happen.	To se, kao što znamo, nije dogodilo.
There is a lot to say.	Ima puno toga za reći.
Please tell me what happened.	Molim te reci mi šta se dogodilo.
That would be a really good story.	To bi bila zaista dobra priča.
But it won't.	Ali neće.
I'll stay with you.	Ja ću ostati s tobom.
I am thirty years old.	Imam trideset godina.
Does anyone know anything?	Da li neko zna nešto?
I still loved her.	I dalje sam je voleo.
No, we said.	Ne, rekli smo.
Maybe a good idea.	Možda dobra ideja.
It's really that bad.	Zaista je tako loše.
I'm here for you.	Ovde sam zbog tebe.
It's not.	Nije.
That couldn't be helped.	Tome se nije moglo pomoći.
The money is not mine.	Novac nije moj.
But now you know.	Ali sada znaš.
What more do we need, actually.	Šta nam više treba, zapravo.
You are a man.	Ti si čovjek.
He thought no one knew.	Mislio je da niko ne zna.
No, they are not and never have been.	Ne, nisu i nikada nisu bili.
You didn't say that.	Vi to niste rekli.
Not for yourself.	Ne za sebe.
What should we do.	Šta da radimo.
I'm sure it is.	Siguran sam da jeste.
But that's not it.	Ali to nije to.
I have something to say.	Imam nešto da kažem.
I want to see you.	Želim da te vidim.
You can't be both.	Ne možete biti oboje.
But it's such a simple thing.	Ali to je tako jednostavno nešto.
She didn't know what he wanted to say.	Nije znala šta želi da kaže.
It was really hard.	Bilo je zaista teško.
I never want to be friends with you!	Nikada ne želim da budem prijatelj sa tobom!
That's the idea.	To je ideja.
I just lost a friend.	Izgubio sam samo prijatelja.
He doesn’t want fun or anything.	On ne želi zabavu ili bilo šta.
No one ever told me.	Niko mi nikad nije rekao.
I can do this.	Mogu ovo uraditi.
It can be one or more.	Može biti jedan ili više.
This is to be you and be sure.	Ovo je biti ti i biti siguran.
I thought it was you.	Mislio sam da si to ti.
But that is what is happening.	Ali, to je ono što se dešava.
I was fine with that.	Bio sam u redu sa tim.
We still have this.	Još uvek imamo ovo.
Almost all of us.	Skoro svi mi.
They knew and they were right.	Znali su i bili su u pravu.
But it's only true if you want it to be.	Ali istina je samo ako to želiš.
He certainly didn't have time.	Sigurno nije imao vremena.
Maybe nothing could.	Možda ništa nije moglo.
He's gone now.	Sada ga nema.
In fact, it is very simple.	U stvari, vrlo je jednostavno.
Nobody knows the reason.	Niko ne zna razlog.
There was no money for that.	Nije bilo novca za to.
So it has been until this year.	Tako je bilo do ove godine.
There is only one problem.	Postoji samo jedan problem.
It was hard to say.	Bilo je teško reći.
You have to go now.	Morate ići odmah.
He was almost right.	Bio je skoro u pravu.
No one could do anything about it except me.	Niko nije mogao ništa s tim osim mene.
You would too.	I ti bi.
But this is not true.	Ali ovo nije tačno.
And she was.	I bila je.
There was something to say.	Bilo je nešto za reći.
That's it for today.	To je to za danas.
This was bad enough for him.	Ovo je bilo dovoljno loše za njega.
She doesn't love us.	Ona nas ne voli.
What she said is true.	Ono što je rekla je istina.
But that day never came.	Ali taj dan nikad nije došao.
So they don't know.	Tako da ne znaju.
Be.	Biti.
But he didn't do much.	Ali nije radio mnogo.
I know him so well.	Znam ga tako dobro.
Yes.	Je.
I'm not sure there's anything else.	Nisam siguran da postoji još nešto.
'has'.	' ima '.
It's hard to say.	Teško je reći.
But that's not the point.	Ali ne radi se o tome.
What you need is what you need.	Ono što ti treba je ono što ti treba.
If you do it right.	Ako to uradiš kako treba.
I don't even know what it is.	Ne znam ni šta je to.
This will happen soon.	Ovo će se brzo dogoditi.
If he says he hasn't yet, he means it.	Ako kaže da još nije, to i misli.
But he was not the only one.	Ali to nije bio jedini.
It may not be good, but it exists.	Možda nije dobar, ali postoji.
Not good so far.	Nije dobro do sada.
It was true.	Bilo je tačno.
He's just a bad guy.	On je samo loš momak.
So far it is a '.	Do sada je a'.
I can't do it alone.	Ne mogu sam.
She will come for it when there are none.	Ona će doći po to kad ih ne bude.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
I thought not.	Mislio sam da ne.
Sam never did.	Sam nikad nije.
I should have stayed with him.	Trebao sam ostati s njim.
There is much more you can do.	Ima još mnogo toga što možete učiniti.
Don't think.	Ne misli se.
Nothing too please.	Ništa previše molim.
You are the one who is not.	Ti si taj koji nije.
You can never tell.	Nikad ne možeš reći.
Work when you want.	Radite kada želite.
It's pretty simple.	Prilično je jednostavno.
So we would have that.	Tako da bismo to imali.
Nobody knew what to do.	Niko nije znao šta da radi.
It will do.	To će učiniti.
She still does.	Ona to i dalje čini.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
He has a job.	On ima posao.
Not even that.	Ne ni to.
Tell me the real reason.	Reci mi pravi razlog.
I love you, you know that.	Volim te, znaš to.
The weather was still bad.	Vrijeme je još uvijek bilo loše.
Better believe it.	Bolje vjerovati.
You don't even know.	Čak ni ne znaš.
And we will do that.	I to ćemo uraditi.
That's very much.	To je veoma.
There are too many.	Ima ih previše.
He needed her to know that.	Trebalo mu je da ona to zna.
I'm really sorry.	Zaista mi je žao.
Can anyone help me in a better way.	Može li mi neko pomoći na bolji način.
You have to do it yourself.	To morate sami da uradite.
It's hard to talk to so many people.	Teško je razgovarati sa toliko ljudi.
And we knew what we needed to do.	I znali smo šta treba da radimo.
We're just doing our job.	Mi samo radimo svoj posao.
We will help as much as we can.	Pomoći ćemo koliko možemo.
But you did this to me.	Ali ti si mi ovo uradio.
And we know it works.	I znamo da radi.
But it wasn't much.	Ali nije bilo mnogo.
Only one can help.	Samo jedan može pomoći.
Not even a little.	Čak ni malo.
I was there myself.	I sam sam bio tamo.
No problem.	Nema problema.
But he never really left.	Ali zapravo nikada nije otišao.
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
I couldn't even see it.	Nisam to mogao ni vidjeti.
Maybe she would know something.	Možda bi ona nešto znala.
That should help.	To bi trebalo da pomogne.
That was all.	To je bilo sve.
It’s so easy that you can do it right now.	Toliko je lako da to možete učiniti upravo sada.
I'll tell you when.	Reći ću ti kada.
Not much, but we like it.	Nije puno, ali nam se sviđa.
This must have happened to you a lot.	Mora da ti se ovo dogodilo dosta.
I mean, we have, but no.	Mislim, imamo, ali ne.
Maybe it was more than that.	Možda je bilo više od toga.
Why is this happening?	Zašto se ovo dešava?
It was not easy to get to work today.	Danas nije bilo lako doći na posao.
Much, much, more.	Mnogo, mnogo, više.
I would really like that.	Ja bih to jako želio.
It's not just an idea.	To nije samo ideja.
I can't give the code.	Ne mogu dati kod.
And he knew I was too.	I znao je da sam i ja.
You'll know soon enough.	Uskoro ćeš znati.
It should be difficult.	Trebalo bi biti teško.
I did something you didn't want to do.	Uradio sam nešto što nisi želeo.
There is no way it cannot reach us.	Ne postoji način na koji ne može doći do nas.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
We all have to work together.	Svi moramo da radimo zajedno.
He knew he couldn't win.	Znao je da ne može pobijediti.
You're alone.	Sam si.
I have to tell you everything.	Moram ti sve reći.
We didn’t really know where we were.	Nismo zapravo znali gdje smo.
I said if that was true.	Rekao sam da li je to tačno.
He doesn't eat much.	Ne jede mnogo.
And maybe she was.	A možda je i bila.
I would love to see them both again.	Voleo bih da ih oboje ponovo vidim.
I can't even say you were right.	Ne mogu reći ni da ste bili u pravu.
It should still be no.	I dalje bi trebao biti ne.
Nobody saw him do that.	Niko ga nije video da to radi.
I got my life back.	Vratio sam svoj život.
If you don't know.	Ako ne znaš.
This day will be good.	Ovaj dan će biti dobar.
That's all I want.	Samo to želim.
Probably still waiting for him.	Verovatno ga još čeka.
I need to know who did this.	Moram da znam ko je ovo uradio.
Probably too much.	Verovatno previše.
It's just.	To je samo.
I don't want them here yet.	Ne želim ih još ovdje.
It was much, much more.	Bilo je mnogo, mnogo više.
Even more times.	Čak i više puta.
He wasn't ready for that.	Nije bio spreman za to.
We are not doing this at the moment.	Ne radimo ovo trenutno.
I.	I.
She knew better.	Znala je bolje.
From now on.	Od sada.
No one has ever seen him.	Niko ga nikada nije video.
Here’s a thing he’s never seen before.	Ovdje je stvar koju nikada prije nije vidio.
You said so.	Tako ste rekli.
I've heard so much.	Čuo sam toliko toga.
This may have been true.	Ovo je možda bila istina.
If only they could.	Kad bi samo mogli.
It's not.	Nije.
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
Nice to see you again.	Drago mi je da te ponovo vidim.
She told herself he would be fine.	Rekla je sebi da će on biti dobro.
There is nothing and he is not working on anything.	Nema ništa i ne radi ni na čemu.
There is no one here.	Ovde nema nikoga.
The only thing.	Jedina stvar.
She looks really bad, you know.	Ona izgleda jako loše, znaš.
That's how we do it.	Tako mi to radimo.
Just to see what he would say.	Samo da vidim šta bi rekao.
You know that's true.	Znaš da je to istina.
I know what they did.	Znam šta su uradili.
I won't be.	Neću biti.
You can still come back.	Još uvijek se možeš vratiti.
They're not quite sure what's going on.	Nisu baš sigurni šta se dešava.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
You have to believe.	Moraš vjerovati.
You're a busy man.	Ti si zauzet čovjek.
I hope it will.	Nadam se da hoće.
Really, it's not that bad.	Zaista, nije tako loše.
They didn't have time for this.	Nisu imali vremena za ovo.
A person.	Osoba .
He didn't want me to tell you.	Nije želio da ti kažem.
But he knew what to do.	Ali znao je šta da radi.
You will see this.	Ovo ćeš vidjeti.
But she wasn't.	Ali nije bila.
They couldn't help us.	Nisu nam mogli pomoći.
But that's how it was.	Ali, tako je bilo.
The question is whether we can believe it.	Pitanje je možemo li tome vjerovati.
You don't like that.	Ne sviđa ti se to.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
Nobody knows why.	Niko ne zna zašto.
She doesn't have it.	Ona ga nema.
I'm not sure how that happened.	Nisam siguran kako se to dogodilo.
I just didn't know.	Jednostavno nisam znao.
I've never seen anything like it.	Nikada nisam video tako nešto.
I know you know how.	Znam da znaš kako.
I don't know if that's true or not.	Ne znam da li je to istina ili nije.
He was so tired.	Bio je tako umoran.
But it was, and it was.	Ali jeste, i bilo je.
Now he was sure something had happened.	Sada je bio siguran da se nešto dogodilo.
I don't want to do that.	Ne želim to da radim.
He would see.	On bi video.
I hope so.	Nadam se.
Yes, that was obvious yesterday.	Da, to je bilo očigledno juče.
I know he's just doing his job.	Znam da radi samo svoj posao.
Not my friend.	Ne moj prijatelj.
You can only do this so many times.	To možete učiniti samo toliko puta.
We all have to work together.	Moramo svi zajedno da radimo.
Yes you are right.	Da u pravu si.
He knows why.	On zna zašto.
We have to do it.	Moramo to uraditi.
And got them.	I dobio ih.
But that's it.	Ali to je to.
But it doesn't do any good.	Ali to ne čini ništa dobro.
There were more, many more.	Bilo ih je više, mnogo više.
I didn't want to say anything.	Nisam htela ništa da kažem.
She has lived here for many years.	Ona živi ovdje mnogo godina.
You came and did something.	Došao si i uradio nešto.
Here and there.	Tu i tamo.
We never will be.	Nikada nećemo biti.
What are these things?	Šta su to stvari?
This is for you.	To je za vas.
I would be in favor of that.	Ja bih bio za to.
I wasn't very happy to see me.	Nije mi bilo baš drago što me vidi.
What did he say?	Šta je rekao?
She didn't want to know.	Nije htela da zna.
But you can never be too sure.	Ali nikada ne možete biti previše sigurni.
I still didn't get it.	I dalje nisam shvatio.
Let me tell you.	Da ti kažem.
He won't.	Neće.
He didn't want anything.	Nije htio ništa.
He came soon.	Uskoro je došao.
If you do, you are not.	Ako to uradite, niste.
I have to help.	Moram pomoći.
I thought you might come and do it.	Mislio sam da ćeš možda doći i uraditi to.
They will tell you.	Oni će ti reći.
Here.	Ovdje.
It won't be enough.	Neće biti dovoljno.
He had to say something.	Morao je nešto reći.
We are here to work on ourselves.	Tu smo da radimo na sebi.
I can't tell you now.	Ne mogu ti sada reći.
That was my first real job, you know.	To je bio moj prvi pravi posao, znaš.
I can go there.	Mogu ići tamo.
That was not what he expected.	To nije bilo ono što je očekivao.
I want to be sure.	Želim da budem siguran.
That man was that.	Taj čovjek je bio taj.
He felt sorry for me.	Bilo mu je žao mene.
i.	i .
I was just working.	Samo sam radio.
We're not sure what exactly.	Nismo sigurni šta tačno.
It wasn't him.	To nije bio on.
I've never seen him before.	Nikad ga prije nisam vidio.
They are	Oni su
I wish this day hadn’t arrived yet.	Volio bih da ovaj dan još nije stigao.
This is a new day.	Ovo je novi dan.
This was something more.	Ovo je bilo nešto više.
Mine isn't.	Moj nije.
He knows the way.	On zna put.
I hope you can help me.	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći.
I'm not sure.	Nisam baš siguran.
Not very good.	Ne vrlo dobar.
I'm sure he has it.	Siguran sam da ga ima.
I had nothing to see.	Nisam imao šta da vidim.
I couldn't tell what happened next.	Nisam mogao reći šta se dalje dogodilo.
Or it used to be.	Ili je nekada bilo.
It was hard for him to eat.	Bilo mu je teško da jede.
We can do better.	Možemo bolje.
That is much more than that.	To je mnogo više od toga.
Nice to see you.	Drago mi je da vas vidim.
Either he will or he will not.	Ili hoće ili neće.
She always knew what to say.	Uvek je znala šta da kaže.
They are gone now.	Sada ih nema.
We couldn't be sure how much he told you.	Nismo mogli biti sigurni koliko vam je rekao.
You just can't.	Jednostavno ne možeš.
It was him or us.	Bio je on ili mi.
Too happy for a while.	Previše sretan neko vrijeme.
I have no idea what will happen to me next.	Nemam pojma šta će mi se dalje dogoditi.
I have to be first.	Moram biti prvi.
I would never say something like that.	Nikad ne bih rekao tako nešto.
I know you're right.	Znam da si u pravu.
He couldn't talk to me.	Nije mogao razgovarati sa mnom.
If so, do nothing.	Ako jeste, ne radite ništa.
Now you can get it all.	Sada možete dobiti sve.
I wish he was here.	Voleo bih da je ovde.
She knew her father was waiting for her.	Znala je da je otac čeka.
You have to give me something.	Moraš mi nešto dati.
I had to go for it.	Morao sam ići na to.
This is the one.	Ovo je taj.
She told him everything.	Rekla mu je sve.
That should help.	To bi trebalo da pomogne.
We don't have to know.	Ne moramo znati.
I just had to ask.	Samo sam morao da pitam.
I just had to do it.	Jednostavno sam to morao učiniti.
For a while.	Za neko vrijeme.
You must	Ti moraš
So far everything seems fine.	Za sada sve izgleda u redu.
I'm sorry, I can't.	Žao mi je, ne mogu.
I didn't know what it was.	Nisam znao šta je to.
I see that happening.	Vidim da se to dešava.
She doesn't want to look like that.	Ona ne želi da izgleda tako.
I want to know who did it.	Želim da znam ko je to uradio.
I really have to work on it.	Stvarno moram da radim na tome.
The story is here.	Priča je tu.
It just wasn't mine.	Jednostavno nije bio moj.
It should be good.	Trebalo bi da je dobro.
He wasn't sure how it happened.	Nije bio siguran kako se to dogodilo.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I don't know where it could have gone.	Ne znam gdje je moglo otići.
Say what you need to say.	Reci šta treba da kažeš.
They had nothing to do.	Nisu imali šta dalje.
I have no idea what the problem could be.	Nemam pojma šta može biti problem.
Only for many years.	Samo za mnogo godina.
I know mine has.	Znam da moj ima.
But he can't.	Ali ne može.
He may have some time.	Možda ima malo vremena.
Maybe I can be one of you, he said.	Možda mogu biti jedan od vas, rekao je.
It seems to be working fine so far.	Čini se da za sada radi dobro.
That's really the problem here.	To je zaista problem ovdje.
This does not exist, and probably never will.	Ovo ne postoji, i vjerovatno nikada neće.
It took a while.	Trebalo je neko vrijeme.
None of us are.	Niko od nas nije.
But we don't have to be those people.	Ali mi ne moramo biti ti ljudi.
He probably will.	Verovatno će to i uraditi.
You think.	Misliš.
You could say.	Mogli biste reći.
That's exactly what he wanted.	To je upravo ono što je želio.
I can't find myself.	Ne mogu se naći.
Nothing was ever good enough.	Nikad ništa nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
No one could come back to him.	Niko mu se nije mogao vratiti.
I have some money.	Imam nešto novca.
But this question is not about that.	Ali ovo pitanje nije o tome.
And there's nothing you can do about it.	I tu ništa ne možete učiniti.
Not for nothing.	Ne za ništa.
If you want to do that, fine.	Ako želiš to da uradiš, u redu.
It was about time.	Bilo je i vrijeme.
Many times.	Mnogo puta.
She was alone in the house with him.	Bila je sama u kući s njim.
You can help me more.	Možete mi pomoći više.
It's a good game!.	To je dobra igra!.
That's something to see.	To je nešto za vidjeti.
I know who this is.	Znam ko je ovo.
He saw nothing.	Nije video ništa.
I just see you as myself.	Ja te samo vidim kao sebe.
More, more than me.	Više, više od mene.
Nobody knew anything.	Niko ništa nije znao.
And often they won't.	A često i neće.
It wasn't us.	To nismo bili mi.
What is certain is.	Ono što je sigurno je.
I wish you would.	Voleo bih da bi.
Maybe even today.	Možda čak i danas.
This can't go on.	Ovo ne može dalje.
That was very difficult for me.	To mi je bilo jako teško.
And he is.	I on je.
I'm just thinking.	Samo mislim.
But it can't be.	Ali to ne može biti.
But that's not good enough.	Ali to nije dovoljno dobro.
I hope to see them sometime.	Nadam se da ću ih nekada vidjeti.
I never wanted anyone again.	Nikada više nisam želeo nikoga.
He didn't say that.	On to nije rekao.
I can do it alone.	Mogu sama.
It ever was.	To je ikada bilo.
It was bad.	Bilo je loše.
It couldn't be there.	Nije moglo biti tamo.
As long as she wants to.	Sve dok ona želi.
The truth is.	Istina je.
This will not be a problem for me.	Ovo neće biti problem za mene.
I asked for help.	Tražio sam pomoć.
It didn't happen overnight and it wasn't easy.	To se nije dogodilo za jedan dan i nije bilo lako.
I couldn't see.	Nisam mogao da vidim.
For now, no one can.	Za sada niko ne može.
Does he really look like that?	Da li on zaista tako izgleda?
And we do.	I mi to radimo.
And you know me.	I ti znaš mi.
We still have it.	Još ga imamo.
You can help us here.	Ovdje nam možete pomoći.
I never, ever thought you would.	Nikada, nikad nisam mislio da hoćeš.
He never knew exactly why.	Nikada nije tačno znao zašto.
He will go there again this year.	I ove godine će ići tamo ponovo.
I know what you want.	Znam šta želiš.
I thought it was her.	Mislio sam da je to ona.
I was usually the only one.	Obično sam bio jedini.
When he saw you there.	Kad te je vidio tamo.
I didn’t think she was really going to leave.	Nisam mislio da će ona zaista otići.
We do everything together.	Sve radimo zajedno.
I'm not sure why it doesn't work.	Nisam siguran zašto ne radi.
It shouldn't have.	Nije trebalo.
It looks pretty good.	Izgleda prilično dobro.
Say you will.	Reci da hoćeš.
She knows that.	Ona to zna.
He was much more than that.	Bio je mnogo više od toga.
The first good.	Prvi dobar.
Nobody asked him anything.	Niko ga ništa nije pitao.
It's done.	To se radi.
He wants a team.	On želi tim.
She can't do anything.	Ona ne može ništa.
For real for real for real.	Za stvarno za stvarno za stvarno.
It was too hard to say.	Bilo je previše teško reći.
It looks pretty simple.	Izgleda prilično jednostavno.
He must have been here before.	Mora da je već bio ovde.
But it actually happened.	Ali to se zapravo dogodilo.
And about that.	I o tome.
I really need to talk to him.	Zaista moram razgovarati s njim.
He would buy, buy, buy.	Kupio bi, kupio, kupio.
But we have a lot of time together.	Ali imamo dosta vremena zajedno.
She is, in fact.	Ona je, u stvari.
He was there for a long time.	Bio je tamo dugo vremena.
Except he is.	Osim, on jeste.
You’re pretty sure right now.	Trenutno ste prilično sigurni.
You could too.	I ti bi mogao.
As if nothing had happened.	Kao da se ništa nije dogodilo.
There are many of them.	Ima ih mnogo.
You must know what it is.	Morate znati šta je to.
No, we are alone.	Ne, sami smo.
I'm sure someone will come to that.	Siguran sam da će neko doći do toga.
If not today, tomorrow, soon.	Ako ne danas, sutra, uskoro.
He is here with us.	On je ovdje sa nama.
I think both are true.	Mislim da je oboje istina.
That actually happened.	To se zapravo dogodilo.
All of you.	Svi vi.
It must be there.	Sigurno je tu.
He shouldn't have come, he thinks.	Nije trebao doći, misli on.
You can stay.	Možeš ostati.
Nothing for now.	Za sada ništa.
You just knew that.	Samo si to znao.
I didn't know there were still people there.	Nisam znao da tamo još ima ljudi.
I wasn't tired either.	Ni ja nisam bio umoran.
This is not strong enough yet.	Ovo još nije dovoljno jako.
Or, perhaps, ever.	Ili, možda, ikada.
It wasn't just today.	Nije to bilo samo danas.
Not before, not now.	Ni prije, ni sada.
I wondered if he was that.	Pitao sam se da li je on to.
Maybe she'll come tomorrow.	Možda će ona doći sutra.
That must be it.	To mora da je to.
I brought him back.	Vratio sam ga.
Nothing really happened.	Ništa se zaista nije dogodilo.
That's your problem.	To je tvoj problem.
No more to say.	Ne treba više da se kaže.
I didn't ask her why.	Nisam je pitao zašto.
He should know better.	Trebalo bi da zna bolje.
There weren't enough people.	Nije bilo dovoljno ljudi.
I’m actually pretty good at it.	Zapravo sam prilično dobar u tome.
I can easily do this job.	Lako mogu da radim ovaj posao.
That was a very good idea.	To je bila jako dobra ideja.
Is she.	Je li ona.
And this should be easy.	A ovo bi trebalo biti lako.
I hope you are happy.	Nadam se da si sretan.
I was like.	Bio sam kao.
There was someone.	Bio je neko.
He knows what you need.	On zna šta ti treba.
This is really hard.	Ovo je zaista teško.
I love them a lot.	Mnogo ih volim.
Or us.	Ili nas.
I still haven't bought it.	I dalje ga nisam kupio.
You will be too.	I ti ćeš biti.
That is if you want it.	To je ako je želiš.
It could be both.	Moglo bi biti oboje.
My father knew that.	Otac je to znao.
Tell me what you want me to be.	Reci mi šta želiš da budem.
Except you never got around to telling me.	Osim što mi nikad nisi stigao reći.
Not at all.	Ni malo toga.
Everyone was fine.	Svi su bili dobro.
I thought he would go alone.	Mislio sam da će otići sami.
They did it for me.	Uradili su to za mene.
That will tell you if you will be okay.	To će vam reći da li ćete biti dobro.
So it doesn't work either.	Tako da ni to ne radi.
I am very glad.	Veoma mi je drago.
Not the first time.	Nije prvi put.
He would still try.	I dalje bi pokušao.
I couldn't go back to that.	Nisam se mogao vratiti na to.
And that was it.	I to je bilo to.
But it doesn't work.	Ali to ne radi.
Mine was even better.	Moj je bio još bolji.
He didn't do everything right.	Nije uradio sve kako treba.
Obviously more to come.	Očigledno će doći još više.
We have dinner.	Imamo večeru.
He does nothing to help.	On ne čini ništa da pomogne.
Earlier this week.	Ranije ove sedmice.
Everything seems to be working well.	Čini se da sve radi dobro.
It was there before.	Bilo je tu i prije.
I can do it better than him.	Ja to mogu bolje od njega.
But even this has problems.	Ali čak i ovo ima problema.
He'll tell you anything.	Reći će ti bilo šta.
You probably are.	Vjerovatno jesi.
I really hope so.	Stvarno se nadam.
I went to school.	Otišao sam u školu.
You can always talk to me.	Uvijek možeš razgovarati sa mnom.
Maybe not.	Možda i nisu.
That's good enough for me.	To je dovoljno dobro za mene.
I'm going on.	Idem na.
That wasn't even supposed to be.	Čak ni to nije trebalo biti.
And it is.	I jeste.
I told him there would be no more.	Rekao sam mu da više neće biti.
Now the problem is this.	Sada je problem ovo.
I'm fine, really.	Dobro sam, stvarno.
How much you loved them.	Koliko si ih volio.
Maybe it will give you more.	Možda će vam dati više.
But there was simply no money for that.	Ali za to jednostavno nije bilo novca.
I really love my job.	Zaista volim svoj posao.
They both knew it.	Oboje su to znali.
She would tell me and she was always right.	Rekla bi mi i uvijek je bila u pravu.
I had to go there.	Morao sam ići tamo.
But it was very good for me.	Ali to je bilo jako dobro za mene.
We will all leave.	Svi ćemo otići.
He wondered now.	Pitao se sada.
He has no friends.	On nema prijatelja.
He didn't know why he did it to himself.	Nije znao zašto je to sebi učinio.
We had nothing to do with it.	Nismo imali ništa s tim.
I'm not sure about that either.	Nisam siguran ni u to.
She really, really didn't know what to say to him.	Zaista, zaista nije znala šta da mu kaže.
I will help you.	Ja ću ti pomoći.
Of many things.	Od mnogo stvari.
I really don't know anything about that.	Ja stvarno ne znam ništa o tome.
It wasn't that bad either.	Nije bilo ni tako loše.
But he is not there.	Ali nema ga.
He's not too happy, but there's nothing to do.	Nije previše sretan, ali nema šta dalje.
But this takes time.	Ali za ovo treba vremena.
I don't even know if I'm doing it right.	Ne znam ni da li radim kako treba.
I was surprised he didn't ask about it.	Bio sam iznenađen što nije pitao za to.
That's what she does.	To je ono što ona radi.
I can find him again.	Mogu ga ponovo naći.
Nothing is going well tonight.	Večeras ništa ne ide kako treba.
She didn't know what to do with it.	Nije znala šta bi s tim.
And she sees.	I ona vidi.
I heard about it.	Čuo sam za to.
He couldn't see anything.	Nije mogao ništa da vidi.
He didn't want to leave.	Nije želio otići.
I know it's not.	Znam da nije.
But what he knew now was enough.	Ali ono što je sada znao bilo je dovoljno.
It was almost a few years ago.	Skoro da je bilo prije nekoliko godina.
I thought he would come back.	Mislio sam da će se vratiti.
But they couldn't help themselves.	Ali nisu si mogli pomoći.
I was the only one who could help me.	Ja sam jedini mogao da mi pomogne.
She told him she had something to tell him.	Rekla mu je da ima nešto da mu kaže.
Tell me.	Reci mi.
But you wouldn't know that.	Ali ti to ne bi znao.
It seems to work for us.	Izgleda da radi za nas.
Maybe you are.	Možda jesi.
You can't help everyone.	Ne možeš pomoći svima.
That's what he needs more.	To je ono što mu treba više.
I said that.	Rekao sam to.
It looks like rain today.	Danas izgleda kao kiša.
That would be safe money for both of them.	To bi bio siguran novac za oboje.
There is a lot of time.	Ima dosta vremena.
Like yesterday.	Kao juče.
And that may be happening now.	I to se možda dešava sada.
I love a lot of things.	Volim puno stvari.
The only question is when and how.	Pitanje je samo kada i kako.
There was a man here.	Ovdje je bio čovjek.
Nothing seemed to happen.	Činilo se da se ništa nije dogodilo.
And she's not.	A ona nije.
But it was easy.	Ali bilo je lako.
But obviously it's hard.	Ali očigledno je to teško.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
That's not your problem.	To nije tvoj problem.
Or I should have done.	Ili je trebalo da radim.
He didn't really want to talk about it.	Nije baš želio da priča o tome.
And so it goes.	I tako to ide.
I love seeing them there.	Volim da ih vidim tamo.
Business is business, and money is money.	Posao je posao, a novac je novac.
I'm not the only one.	Nisam jedini.
He wasn't there at the moment.	Trenutno nije bio tamo.
Everyone said yes.	Svi su rekli da.
I had to buy for myself too.	Morao sam kupiti i sebi.
It probably was.	Vjerovatno je bilo.
He probably didn't have time to leave.	Verovatno nije imao vremena da ode.
In fact, there is.	U stvari, ima.
You just have to do it.	Samo treba da to uradiš.
We never work.	Nikada ne radimo.
And you asked for this.	A ti si tražio ovo.
He doesn't have it.	On ga nema.
It didn't take me long to do that.	Nije trebalo dugo da to uradim.
But he will.	Ali hoće.
It works this way.	Radi na ovaj način.
There was so much.	Bilo je toliko toga.
I wouldn't wish it was me.	Ne bih voleo da sam to bio ja.
It could really work.	Moglo bi stvarno raditi.
She knows something is up.	Ona zna da se nešto dešava.
How you want.	Kako želiš.
More than last year.	Više nego prošle godine.
Maybe you should.	Možda bi trebalo.
They knew it.	Oni su to znali.
I don't want that.	Ne želim to.
Or you think it is.	Ili mislite da jeste.
I quite like it.	Prilično mi se sviđa.
To the point.	Na stvar.
It seems to be working now.	Čini se da sada radi.
There is much more.	Ima još mnogo toga.
It's much better.	Mnogo je bolje.
There was so much to see.	Bilo je toliko toga za vidjeti.
It was them.	To su bili oni.
We would find him.	Naći bismo ga.
I doubt he'll ever come back.	Sumnjam da će se ikada više vratiti.
I heard about this.	Čuo sam za ovo.
Do it for yourself.	Uradi to za sebe.
What are you doing tonight?	Šta radiš večeras?
I want it for you.	Želim to za tebe.
You did very well.	Uradio si veoma dobro.
This can't be real.	Ovo ne može biti stvarno.
You can go now if you want.	Možete ići sada, ako želite.
Very, very bad.	Veoma, veoma loše.
I know what this looks like, but.	Znam kako ovo izgleda, ali.
And everyone knew it.	I svi su to znali.
He lives.	Živi.
Nobody says that.	Niko to ne govori.
I told you, that's the thing.	Rekao sam ti, to je stvar.
I know how to do it.	Znam kako to da uradim.
They were fine.	Bili su u redu.
But probably not.	Ali vjerovatno ne.
Nothing happens without her knowing.	Ništa se ne dešava a da ona ne zna.
I just did my job.	Samo sam uradio svoj posao.
And that is something that cannot be.	A to je nešto što ne može biti.
That could not be done.	To se nije moglo uraditi.
He had had enough.	Bilo mu je dosta.
It's been here long enough.	Dovoljno je dugo ovdje.
That's what he means.	To on misli.
But I don't think you will.	Ali mislim da nećeš.
Wear it if you have to.	Nosi ga ako moraš.
The thing itself.	Sama stvar.
They just aren't.	Oni jednostavno nisu.
Now, about why you are here.	Sada, o tome zašto ste ovdje.
We couldn't do that.	Nismo to mogli.
He's the one.	On je taj.
This is something that has been under construction for some time.	Ovo je nešto na čemu se radi već neko vrijeme.
I do not know how.	Ne znam kako.
Is that really all you have to say?	Je li to zaista sve što imaš da kažeš?
I don't want this.	Ne želim ovo.
I knew it was you.	Znao sam da si to ti.
He was happy.	Bio je sretan.
Not that you won't already.	Nije da već nećeš.
You could find anything there.	Mogli biste tamo naći bilo šta.
And so it was.	I tako je bilo.
But he has no idea what it is about.	Ali on nema pojma o čemu se radi.
There are a lot of them there.	Ima ih puno tamo.
It's more like.	To je više kao.
There were none now.	Sada ih nije bilo.
He did just that.	On je uradio upravo to.
You can easily give it to him.	Možete mu lako dati.
You think you know what you want.	Mislite da znate šta želite.
Yes, that's it.	Da, to je to.
I just don't.	Ja jednostavno ne.
I knew what was going on.	Znao sam šta se dešava.
I wonder which one.	Pitam se koji.
I didn't know anything.	Nisam znao ništa.
It wasn't hard to find someone.	Nije bilo teško naći nekoga.
And he won't get anything tonight.	I večeras neće dobiti ništa.
She doesn't even look bad.	Ona čak i ne izgleda loše.
In the House.	U kući.
Hard for anyone, probably.	Teško za bilo koga, vjerovatno.
That may not be true.	To ne može biti tačno.
There is nothing to say.	Nema šta da se kaže.
Nobody ever loved me.	Niko me nikada nije voleo.
I just don't know how.	Samo ne znam kako.
He would do anything for me.	On bi sve uradio za mene.
He thought he wouldn't.	Mislio je da neće.
It will not be easy.	To neće biti lako.
It just doesn't look good.	Jednostavno ne izgleda dobro.
They are themselves, but more.	Oni su oni sami, ali više.
He just thought it was.	Samo je mislio da jeste.
He saw things.	Video je stvari.
We don't even have to stay.	Ne moramo čak ni ostati.
There wasn't much to say.	Nije bilo puno toga za reći.
I would have to say no.	Morao bih da kažem ne.
I didn't get the job because of it.	Nisam dobio posao zbog toga.
It's not like he needed to say that.	Nije kao da je trebao to reći.
You have to go your own way.	Moraš ići na svoj način.
We weren't there.	Nismo bili tamo.
I didn't tell anyone about this.	Nisam nikome rekao za ovo.
It will happen in its own way.	To će se dogoditi na svoj način.
And you are.	A ti si.
I don't think so.	Ne mislim tako.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ne zna se šta bi se moglo dogoditi.
but really, it was a good day.	ali zaista, bio je to dobar dan.
I didn't like to say that.	Nisam voleo da to kažem.
No, not much happens.	Ne, ne dešava se mnogo.
Nobody knows.	Niko ne zna.
I was there for a while.	Bio sam tamo neko vrijeme.
I'm there.	Ja sam tamo.
So it was difficult.	Tako da je bilo teško.
Until they are no more.	Sve dok više nisu.
And this is really saying something.	I ovo zaista nešto govori.
He wouldn't get it.	Ne bi to dobio.
If not for me.	Ako ne za mene.
Or for yourself.	Ili za sebe.
They usually were.	Obično su bili.
But neither is life.	Ali nije ni život.
And who knows, maybe it is.	A ko zna, možda i jeste.
And I don't know.	I ne znam.
I think she was right.	Mislim da je bila u pravu.
There is another.	Postoji još jedan.
That question was difficult enough.	To pitanje je bilo dovoljno teško.
I didn't think you were.	Nisam mislio da jesi.
What do you do for a living?	Šta radiš za život?
But this was not enough.	Ali, ovo nije bilo dovoljno.
And it is.	I jeste.
And not just us.	I ne samo nas.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
I can't reach him.	Ne mogu do njega.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisam mogao vjerovati.
Someone might like to live like that.	Neko bi možda voleo da živi tako.
It could be anywhere.	Moglo bi biti bilo gdje.
Here and there.	Tu i tamo.
Maybe she was there too.	Možda je i ona bila tamo.
But that wasn't right.	Ali to nije bilo u redu.
So good.	Tako dobro.
But he seems to like it.	Ali izgleda da mu se sviđa.
She will most likely never see him again.	Vrlo vjerovatno ga nikada više neće vidjeti.
That may not be enough.	To možda neće biti dovoljno.
You know he'll be right back there.	Znaš da će se odmah vratiti tamo.
How good you look tonight.	Koliko dobro izgledaš večeras.
It's good.	To je dobro.
I just won't.	Jednostavno neću.
We have to give time.	Moramo dati vremena.
Why me? 	Zašto ja?
he thought.	mislio je.
We don't know when.	Ne znamo kada.
I would go.	Ja bih otišao.
It won't be good.	Neće biti dobro.
Yes, if only.	Da, ako samo.
It doesn't work anymore.	Više ne radi.
Must be.	Mora biti.
What does he look like?	Kako on izgleda?
Nothing will happen.	Ništa se neće dogoditi.
He would never say such a thing.	Nikad ne bi rekao tako nešto.
I don't know why this is happening.	Ne znam zašto se to dešava.
None of us knew why.	Niko od nas nije znao zašto.
Don't tell anyone.	Nemoj nikome reći.
And it works really well.	I radi jako dobro.
They may be better for you.	Oni mogu biti bolji za vas.
And they did.	I oni su to uradili.
She wants so badly to see you again.	Ona toliko želi da te ponovo vidi.
And she knows it.	I ona to zna.
Unless it was bad.	Osim ako nije bilo loše.
What was it, he wondered.	Šta je bilo, pitao se.
Still not.	I dalje ne.
It seems to me that you would be a man who would know.	Čini mi se da bi ti bio čovjek koji bi znao.
Nothing, and never.	Ništa, i nikad.
There is something wrong with that.	Nešto nije u redu s tim.
We've been there before.	Bili smo tamo ranije.
I realized you were busy.	Shvatio sam da si zauzet.
He won't buy them.	Neće ih kupiti.
You know what they are.	Znaš šta su oni.
But that is simply not true.	Ali to jednostavno nije istina.
I see you know.	Vidim da znaš.
Maybe she didn't know that either.	Možda ni ona to nije znala.
No one can do it alone.	Niko ne može sam.
He has this.	On ima ovo.
But that didn’t really happen.	Ali to se zapravo nije dogodilo.
Let me see.	Da vidim.
I would too.	I ja bih.
But he goes further.	Ali on ide dalje.
What did you do.	Šta si uradio.
You gave me life.	Dao si mi život.
I know it's not easy for any of you.	Znam da nikome od vas nije lako.
We were fine.	Bili smo u redu.
They said little.	Malo su rekli.
He couldn't believe what he had just done.	Nije mogao vjerovati šta je upravo uradio.
All these things and more.	Sve ove stvari i više.
He didn't seem to know what was going on either.	Činilo se da ni on nije znao šta se dešava.
He's a 'I can' guy.	On je 'mogu' momak.
Until it is.	Sve dok nije.
So it is now.	Tako je i sada.
And we were.	I mi smo bili.
I can't tell him.	Ne mogu mu reći.
This is not easy.	Ovo nije lako.
It happened here.	To se dogodilo ovdje.
And they were.	I bili su.
I really wouldn't.	Zaista ne bih.
He just can't.	On jednostavno ne može.
Tell me, tell me.	Reci mi, reci mi.
He’s good enough and he’s sure to be good enough.	Dovoljno je dobar i sigurno će biti dovoljno dobar.
he asked.	pitao.
I don't think he's here yet.	Mislim da još nije tu.
It didn't take long.	Nije dugo trebalo.
We did a little.	Malo smo uradili.
And so we do nothing.	I tako ništa ne radimo.
Nothing and everything.	Ništa i sve.
I want to be better tomorrow.	Želim da budem bolji sutra.
I think we can be much better.	Mislim da možemo biti mnogo bolji.
You were there, and so were you.	Bio si tamo, a i ti si bio.
He won't be able to do that.	On to neće moći da uradi.
But that never happened.	Ali to se nikada nije dogodilo.
She said she could immediately say something was wrong.	Rekla je da odmah može reći da nešto nije u redu.
I have this.	Imam ovo.
Tell yourself everything will be okay.	Reci sebi da će sve biti u redu.
Maybe I don't have much time.	Možda nemam puno vremena.
I lost too.	I ja sam izgubio.
I didn't try.	Nisam pokušao.
But it should be what it really is.	Ali, treba biti ono što zaista jeste.
We know what we can do here.	Znamo šta možemo da uradimo ovde.
Not with me.	Ne sa mnom.
That's what we did.	To je ono što smo uradili.
I'm so glad you're here.	Tako mi je drago što si ovdje.
It was so good to be home, he told us.	Bilo je tako dobro biti kod kuće, rekao nam je.
I think she wanted to.	Mislim da je htela.
I think she was.	Mislim da je bila.
That is the right way.	To je pravi put.
I have no idea how to do that.	Nemam pojma kako to da uradim.
And maybe he was right.	I možda je bio u pravu.
I'm sorry if that's not enough for you.	Žao mi je ako ti to nije dovoljno.
That was real.	To je bilo stvarno.
He wanted more, much more.	Želeo je više, mnogo više.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I really wasn’t sure if it was good or not.	Zaista nisam bio siguran da li je to dobro ili ne.
It is good.	Dobro je.
But it doesn't have to be.	Ali ne mora biti.
Yes.	Da.
Everyone knew that.	Svi su to znali.
That's how it was with me.	Tako je bilo sa mnom.
I have one.	Ja imam jedan.
She doesn't want to go.	Ona ne želi da ide.
It didn't happen that way.	Nije se tako dogodilo.
.	.
And she wouldn't know that unless she left.	A ona to ne bi znala osim da ne ode.
He should have left.	Trebao je da ode.
And no more.	I ne više.
Nobody knows what happened there.	Niko ne zna šta se tamo dogodilo.
I don't want to say anything.	Ne želim ništa da kažem.
There really aren't any.	Zaista ih nema.
I was a person.	Bio sam osoba.
I'm done.	Završio sam posao.
Maybe you can make him like it more.	Možda možete učiniti da mu se to više sviđa.
And that is it.	I to je to.
I'm sure you're tired.	Siguran sam da si umoran.
But this was too much for me to take in.	Ali ovo je bilo previše da bih shvatio.
I need to know that you can do it.	Moram da znam da ti to možeš.
I was too.	I ja sam bio.
But not in the way you think.	Ali ne na način na koji mislite.
Don't do it that way.	Ne radite to tako.
I know this is it.	Znam da je ovo.
But there is something else.	Ali postoji još nešto.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
Maybe you should stay home today.	Možda bi danas trebao ostati kod kuće.
Maybe he's busy.	Možda je zauzet.
If it doesn’t exist, nothing has happened.	Ako ne postoji, ništa se nije dogodilo.
I want to know what she said.	Želim da znam šta je rekla.
You could, but you didn't.	Mogao si, ali nisi.
I know that's the way it is.	Znam da je to način.
He must.	On mora.
Or there is.	Ili ima.
He was very good.	Bio je veoma dobar.
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
He didn't want to say.	Nije želio reći.
I ask her why.	Pitam je zašto.
Until a few years ago.	Do prije nekoliko godina.
Next question.	Sljedeće pitanje.
I know her.	Znam je.
It couldn't.	Nije moglo.
Do it really this time.	Uradite to stvarno ovaj put.
You work a lot.	Radiš dosta.
I just won't do it.	Jednostavno neću to učiniti.
Not just here, but anywhere.	Ne samo ovdje, nego bilo gdje.
There was no one there.	Tamo nije bilo nikoga.
So I'm not sure what he's doing.	Tako da nisam siguran šta radi.
I saw him today.	Video sam ga danas.
It must be.	Mora da jeste.
I could do all that.	Mogao bih sve to.
We were right.	Bili smo u pravu.
It wasn't enough, but it was better.	Nije bilo dovoljno, ali je bilo bolje.
Would you please do this for me?	Da li biste, molim vas, uradili ovo za mene?
That's what it looks like.	Tako izgleda ali.
There were few people.	Bilo je malo ljudi.
I still love you.	Još uvijek te volim.
This has never happened before.	To se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
Whether he loves money.	Bilo da voli novac.
He was ready for me.	Bio je spreman za mene.
We will help you with that.	Mi ćemo vam pomoći u tome.
As you may know.	Kao što možda znate.
What did he just say?	Šta je upravo rekao?
We could too.	Mogli bismo i mi.
But now there is no time.	Ali sada nema vremena.
I just love him.	Samo ga volim.
We can't say yes.	Ne možemo reći da.
It will do just that.	Upravo će to učiniti.
So he had to know.	Tako da je morao znati.
I couldn't do that.	Nisam to mogao.
But not both.	Ali ne oboje.
They said that to him and themselves.	Rekli su to sa njim i sami.
He'll find us this time too.	Naći će nas i ovaj put.
She doesn't eat.	Ona ne jede.
Everything was as it should be.	Sve je bilo kako treba.
But I didn't know he was gone.	Ali nisam znao da je otišao.
Not just you.	Ne samo ti.
And it really was like that.	I zaista je bilo tako.
People know that.	Ljudi to znaju.
Maybe it's true.	Možda je istina.
Not all is bad either.	Nije ni sve loše.
But good.	Ali dobro.
But there is much more to it than that.	Ali ima mnogo više od toga.
It is very likely that they will not.	Vrlo je vjerovatno da neće.
But this was good for him.	Ali ovo je bilo dobro za njega.
It was just a game.	Bila je samo igra.
No one went to see.	Niko nije otišao da vidi.
I even wonder if.	Čak se pitam da li.
But only for you.	Ali samo za tebe.
He works there.	On tamo radi.
I'm glad you like it.	Drago mi je da ti se sviđa.
Not that at all.	Ne to uopšte.
Nothing but that.	Ništa osim toga.
She wouldn't be helpful.	Ona ne bi bila od pomoći.
I'm not the only one who can do that.	Nisam jedini koji to može.
It's not really obvious how to do it.	Nije baš očigledno kako se to radi.
But we probably shouldn't.	Ali vjerovatno ne bismo trebali.
You just have to trust me.	Samo mi moraš vjerovati.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
To work, she said.	Na posao, rekla je.
I went to him.	Otišao sam do njega.
There was really nothing anyone could do for him.	Zaista niko ništa nije mogao učiniti za njega.
But it was there.	Ali to je bilo tamo.
I've never been there before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio tamo.
I don't see how we can do that.	Ne vidim kako to možemo.
He seemed to like it.	Činilo se da mu se sviđa.
I would really like to help.	Zaista bih želio pomoći.
And there is.	I postoji.
It's okay now.	Sada je u redu.
I'm sorry it won't happen.	Žao mi je što se neće dogoditi.
Very good indeed.	Vrlo dobro zaista.
He wanted both.	Želio je oboje.
Nobody loves him.	Niko ga ne voli.
They just weren’t for me.	Oni jednostavno nisu bili za mene.
That was a really good thing.	To je bila stvarno dobra stvar.
Maybe we won't.	Možda nećemo.
I just went to see what was going on.	Otišao sam samo da vidim šta se dešava.
No, one is not.	Ne, jedan nije.
You did well.	Dobro si uradio.
There is nothing to do now.	Sada nema šta da se radi.
They are like you and me.	Oni su kao ti i ja.
But that's not much.	Ali to nije baš puno.
But you have to get back to work.	Ali morate se vratiti na posao.
They would be at home.	Bili bi kod kuće.
That's it.	To je to.
But, in fact, it is not right.	Ali, zapravo, nije u redu.
I don't think anyone did.	Mislim da niko nije.
It's very easy.	Veoma je lako.
He didn't even have to say that.	Nije ni morao to da kaže.
Please, just do it.	Molim te, samo uradi to.
I asked him why he was doing it.	Pitao sam ga zašto to radi.
The man didn't seem to hear him.	Činilo se da ga čovjek nije čuo.
He probably did a lot more.	Vjerovatno je uradio još mnogo toga.
But he knew too much.	Ali znao je previše.
And you never know about these things.	I nikad se ne zna za ove stvari.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
But that will not happen.	Ali to se neće dogoditi.
But that's not a problem.	Ali to nije problem.
Everything was as usual.	Sve je bilo kao i uvek.
There was probably nothing.	Verovatno nije bilo ništa.
That will surely be soon.	To će sigurno biti uskoro.
I mean, good enough.	Mislim, dovoljno dobro.
Now you know how to do it.	Sada znate kako to učiniti.
I don't know exactly what's going on.	Ne znam baš šta se dešava.
And yours will be.	I tvoj će biti.
We do this for you as much as for ourselves.	Ovo radimo za vas koliko i za sebe.
Nobody saw anything.	Niko ništa nije video.
But there were problems.	Ali bilo je problema.
It happened again.	Ponovo se dogodilo.
As we will now do.	Kao što ćemo sada učiniti.
And so it goes on.	I tako to ide dalje.
But so are all of them.	Ali i svi oni.
It was a trip and a half.	Bio je to put i po.
Maybe we should talk together.	Možda bismo trebali razgovarati zajedno.
Not bad.	Nije loše.
And he was good at it.	I on je bio dobar u tome.
It's happening.	To se dešava.
And I need that.	I to mi treba.
Say what you want about it.	Reci šta želiš o tome.
We'll get to that.	Doći ćemo do toga.
Maybe there really was something there.	Možda je tu zaista nešto bilo.
But I'm not sure which one.	Ali nisam siguran koje.
He's gone now.	Sada je otišao.
Very good indeed.	Vrlo dobro zaista.
We don’t know how long that will go.	Ne znamo koliko dugo će to ići.
You can talk about it if you want.	Možete razgovarati o tome ako želite.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to da uradim.
I did not know.	Nisam znao.
I can say he is a pretty good person.	Mogu reći da je prilično dobra osoba.
Like everyone.	Kao i svi.
You're safe with me.	Sa mnom si siguran.
He wished he had.	Želio je da jeste.
But they are there.	Ali oni su tamo.
I have no spells.	Nemam čini.
It seemed like a year.	Činilo se kao godina.
Which ones do you have?	Koje su kod vas?
He doesn't want much.	Ne želi mnogo toga.
But this is the first time.	Ali ovo je prvi put.
I'm glad he'll be there with me.	Drago mi je da će biti tamo sa mnom.
I'm the only one who can do this.	Ja sam jedini koji ovo može.
He really wanted to be there.	Jako je želio da bude tamo.
But not like you.	Ali ne kao ti.
In fact, he even feels better.	Zapravo, čak se i osjeća bolje.
That was bad enough.	To je bilo dovoljno loše.
I think that will be a very good thing.	Mislim da će to biti jako dobra stvar.
But you first.	Ali ti prvi.
I saw it in myself.	Video sam to u sebi.
And I want to do that.	I ja to želim da uradim.
I need to know everything.	Moram da znam sve.
You have to do it.	Moraš to uraditi.
But for now, it will be you.	Ali za sada ćeš to biti ti.
I'm not coming back.	Neću se vratiti.
We should have done it.	Trebali smo to uraditi.
That is probably true.	To je vjerovatno istina.
He had no idea what to say.	Nije imao pojma šta da kaže.
She knew that much.	Toliko je znala.
Just wear one.	Samo nosi jedan.
Very good in fact.	Vrlo dobro u stvari.
He was very busy.	Bio je veoma zauzet.
On with you now.	Dalje s tobom sada.
But certainly not anymore.	Ali sigurno ne više.
I know it was you.	Znam da si to bio ti.
Are you with us?	Jesi li sa nama?
He plays pretty well.	Igra prilično dobro.
That wasn't so bad, was it? 	To nije bilo tako loše, zar ne?
I was as surprised as you.	Bio sam iznenađen kao i ti.
They know nothing, really.	Oni ne znaju ništa, zaista.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
No one can leave.	Niko ne može otići.
You don't mean that.	Ne misliš to.
Nothing here for him.	Ništa ovde za njega.
He didn't mean it.	Nije mislio.
It's really pretty simple.	Zaista je prilično jednostavno.
Now everything should work as it should.	Sada bi sve trebalo da radi kako treba.
It won't be easy.	Neće biti lako.
And so it should be.	I tako bi trebalo da bude.
He will never do that again.	Nikad to više neće učiniti.
I don't know why exactly.	Ne znam zašto tačno.
You have to trust me, please.	Moraš mi vjerovati, molim te.
There was none of that here.	Ovde nije bilo ništa od toga.
I can't stay here anymore.	Ne mogu više ostati ovdje.
It's just none of my business.	To jednostavno nije moja stvar.
I'm glad you're here.	Drago mi je da si ovdje.
I shouldn't even be here.	Uopšte ne bih trebao biti ovdje.
We really do.	Zaista to radimo.
What more can be said.	Šta više da se kaže.
I'm back to working alone.	Vratio sam se da radim sam.
We'll find her.	Naći ćemo je.
We couldn't help ourselves.	Nismo si mogli pomoći.
Someone would leave.	Neko bi otišao.
But he said he would meet me.	Ali rekao je da će se naći kod mene.
Too many people.	Previše ljudi.
I saw things.	Video sam stvari.
She did not say how it happened.	Nije rekla kako se to dogodilo.
I'm fine and I'm happy.	Dobro sam i sretan sam.
It's neither here nor there.	Nije ni ovdje ni tamo.
That shouldn't be the case, but it is.	To ne bi trebalo da bude, ali tako je.
I know it and you know it.	Ja to znam i ti to znaš.
She would be there.	Ona bi bila tamo.
But it doesn't do anything.	Ali ne radi ništa.
All that.	Sve to.
She will be here.	Ona će biti ovdje.
Or maybe it wasn't that at all.	Ili možda to uopšte nije bilo to.
What it is and where it is, he cannot say.	Šta je i gdje je, ne može reći.
Nobody.	Niko.
But you can do it.	Ali ti to možeš.
But that is never the case.	Ali to nikada nije tako.
But you should go.	Ali trebao bi ići.
People who were there at the time.	Ljudi koji su bili tu u to vrijeme.
I know we know.	Znam da znamo.
That's his job.	To mu je posao.
Why are you here?	Zašto si ovdje?
I hope he can't get it.	Nadam se da ga ne može dobiti.
That is never the case.	To nikad nije tako.
Maybe it wasn't him.	Možda to nije bio on.
In that way.	Na taj način.
But it was.	Ali bilo je.
This is a game, he told himself.	Ovo je igra, rekao je sebi.
We can't find our way home.	Ne možemo naći put kući.
There doesn't have to be anything wrong with that.	U tome ne mora biti ništa loše.
We both knew why.	Oboje smo znali zašto.
Maybe even more.	Možda čak i više.
He obviously isn't either.	Ni on, očigledno, nije.
He is for you.	On je za tebe.
I asked her what the problem was.	Pitao sam je u čemu je problem.
She didn't know how to cope.	Nije znala kako da se nosi.
Maybe I should try it.	Možda bih to pokušao.
That's the only reason he's here.	To je jedini razlog zašto je ovdje.
I've had both for several years.	Imam oboje već nekoliko godina.
Very good.	Vrlo dobar.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
That you never will.	Da nikad nećeš.
I hope you don't know.	Nadam se da ne znate.
He didn't have that last year.	Prošle godine to nije imao.
She was there.	Bila je tamo.
This is very true.	Ovo je veoma tačno.
I won't say anything more.	Neću reći ništa više.
He knew what he would do.	Znao je šta bi uradio.
I can't not.	Ne mogu ne.
We all can.	Svi mi možemo.
I told him to go get it.	Rekao sam mu da ode po to.
This is you.	Ovo si ti.
This is the only way.	Ovo je jedini način.
It should be good, right?	Trebalo bi biti dobro, zar ne?
I think this is a good idea.	Mislim da je ovo dobra ideja.
Nothing more than that.	Ništa više od toga.
That never happens.	To se nikada ne dešava.
That just doesn’t look right.	To jednostavno ne izgleda u redu.
I tried to move on.	Pokušao sam da idem dalje.
I can't help him.	Ne mogu mu pomoći.
And that's right, so much.	I to je tako, toliko.
And yes, you are right.	I da, u pravu ste.
Even if you're not.	Čak i ako nisi.
I never thought this day would come.	Nikad nisam mislio da će ovaj dan doći.
The times are good.	Vremena su dobra.
He never saw any of that.	Nikad nije video ništa od toga.
I could not.	Nisam mogao.
I just need a little.	Treba mi samo malo.
I know too.	Znam i ja.
He was everything to me.	On mi je bio sve.
But the way she said it.	Ali način na koji je to rekla.
That will not happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
Good team there, good team here.	Dobar tim tamo, dobar tim ovde.
It's enough.	Dosta mi je.
That's how it is now.	Tako je to sada.
He's heard it all before.	Sve je to već čuo.
He's doing a little.	Pomalo mu ide.
But it's not just that.	Ali nije samo to.
I went to the house.	Otišao sam do kuće.
I'm glad no one saw it.	Drago mi je da to niko nije video.
You can never be completely sure.	Nikada ne možete biti potpuno sigurni.
It's just.	To je samo.
I didn't really want to know.	Nisam baš htela da znam.
I can't tell you why.	Ne mogu vam reći zašto.
Everything he said is true.	Sve što je rekao je istina.
He told you about me.	Rekao ti je za mene.
If only you had more money.	Da samo imaš više novca.
He needs money.	Treba mu novac.
I didn't say anything more.	Nisam rekao ništa više.
There is so much you can do with it.	Toliko toga možete učiniti s njim.
And we did that.	I to smo uradili.
It simply could not be done.	To jednostavno nije moglo da se uradi.
This is pretty easy.	Ovo je prilično lako.
It's just better.	Jednostavno je bolje.
That's not a good idea.	To nije dobra ideja.
He just left.	Jednostavno je otišao.
Not so much here, but.	Ne toliko ovde, ali.
Neither is he.	Nije ni on.
But you have to know.	Ali morate znati.
And we should.	I trebali bismo.
You know how it happens and why.	Znate kako se to dešava i zašto.
I would be glad.	Bilo bi mi drago.
My team was bad.	Moj tim je bio loš.
There would be time for that, she knew.	Za to će biti vremena, znala je.
I'm afraid he's right.	Bojim se da je u pravu.
He went to work and did his job.	Otišao je na posao i radio svoj posao.
I'm just wondering.	Samo se pitam.
Who did this?	Ko je ovo uradio?
He can't get home.	Ne može doći do kuće.
I need to see him now.	Moram da ga vidim odmah.
I see a video there.	Vidim video tamo.
You have to stay home.	Morate ostati kod kuće.
If he knows what to do, he should tell us.	Ako zna šta da radi, treba da nam kaže.
I'm too tired right now.	Trenutno sam previše umoran.
He should leave now.	Trebao bi sada da ode.
It's more believable.	Prije je za vjerovati.
I'm one of the people.	Ja sam jedan od ljudi.
Probably a lot.	Verovatno mnogo.
Not just for me, but for anyone.	Ne samo za mene, nego za bilo koga.
And he knows why.	I on zna zašto.
He told me today why.	Danas mi je rekao zašto.
Do everything now.	Uradite sve sada.
They will come to you soon.	Uskoro će oni doći kod vas.
His father didn't tell him anything.	Otac mu nije ništa rekao.
Not much, but something.	Ne puno, ali nešto.
She must have known.	Sigurno je znala.
Obviously there is something to it.	Očigledno ima nešto za to.
It can't be.	Ne može biti.
We'll be there soon!	Uskoro ćemo biti tamo!
We had time.	Imali smo vremena.
I don't have time to say much more.	Nemam vremena da kažem mnogo više.
I don't want you to think that.	Ne želim da to misliš.
But both happened.	Ali oboje se dogodilo.
Nobody likes him.	Niko ga ne voli.
A little.	Malo.
I know someone knows what I was looking for.	Znam da neko zna šta sam tražio.
A little, but unlikely.	Malo, ali malo vjerovatno.
I want to work with you.	Želim da radim sa tobom.
I'm not alone.	Ne sam.
Good times there.	Dobra vremena tamo.
There are a lot.	Ima ih puno.
It's not us.	Nismo mi.
That's my car.	To je moj auto.
There is no problem here either.	Ni tu nema problema.
Can we.	Možemo li.
He couldn't help it, really.	Nije mogao pomoći, zaista.
I never knew which one.	Nikad nisam znao koji.
I would never have that much money.	Nikad ne bih imao toliko novca.
And he did just that.	I uradio je upravo to.
Something bad would have happened by now.	Nešto loše bi se do sada dogodilo.
Door to door.	Od vrata do vrata.
But they didn't, she knew.	Ali nisu, znala je.
At the moment, nothing can be done.	Trenutno se ništa ne može učiniti.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
It can't be her.	To ne može biti ona.
There are too many people.	Ima previše ljudi.
He probably doesn't know about you either.	Verovatno ni on ne zna za tebe.
But it wouldn't.	Ali ne bi.
It was really too much.	Bilo je stvarno previše.
I mean, a little, good.	Mislim, malo, dobro.
She doesn't know.	Ona ne zna.
It could not be done, so simply.	To se nije moglo uraditi, tako jednostavno.
Nothing could be done.	Ništa se nije moglo učiniti.
There are actually a lot of them.	Zapravo ih ima mnogo.
We were not alone.	Nismo bili sami.
He'll be back soon.	Uskoro će se vratiti.
Nobody saw it.	Niko to nije vidio.
You can't stay here!	Ne možeš ostati ovdje!
I can't stay.	Ne mogu ostati.
But that doesn't say much.	Ali to ne govori mnogo.
But it was one.	Ali to je bio jedan.
I don't want to give anything away.	Ne želim ništa dati.
Anything.	Bilo šta.
I need money.	Treba mi novac.
But what do you think?	Ali šta ti misliš?
She told us you would come.	Rekla nam je da ćeš doći.
I asked who it was.	Pitao sam ko je to.
I've never been there.	Nikada nisam bio tamo.
There was no one there.	Tamo nije bilo nikoga.
This is a very good thing.	Ovo je veoma dobra stvar.
The man was working on it.	Čovjek je radio na tome.
We can't go back.	Ne možemo se vratiti.
You are a good guy.	Ti si dobar momak.
It's true.	To je tačno.
But she won't be here for long.	Ali ona neće biti ovde dugo.
He had no idea how.	Nije imao pojma kako.
I had to go home.	Morao sam da idem kući.
I'm not good.	Nisam dobro.
But he will return.	Ali on će se vratiti.
I love him, you know.	Ja ga volim, znaš.
He was here first.	On je bio ovde prvi.
But he can see you.	Ali on te može vidjeti.
I made this myself.	Sam sam ovo napravio.
I asked them.	pitao sam ih.
You can find it for me.	Možeš mi ga naći.
I didn't mean to do that.	Nisam mislio to da uradim.
I saw this.	Video sam ovo.
He had them.	Imao ih je.
He usually didn't do anything.	Obično ništa nije radio.
I'm sorry.	Žao mi je.
I love you for that.	Volim te zbog toga.
Not as a job.	Ne kao posao.
We have this.	Imamo ovo.
It almost works.	Skoro to radi.
I mean, really, it was.	Mislim, stvarno, bilo je.
I'm not saying anything.	Ne kažem ništa.
And, I've heard of it.	I, čuo sam za to.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
He decided not to do that.	Odlučio je da to ne uradi.
He won't be a problem anymore.	On više neće biti problem.
Maybe he's gone.	Možda ga nema.
Do not do that!	Ne radi to!
I think this can help.	Mislim da ovo može pomoći.
Yes I want that.	Da to želim.
They said so.	Oni su tako rekli.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
I know you did some of that.	Znam da si uradio nešto od toga.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu ide.
I just want to go.	Samo želim da idem.
You are more.	Ti si više.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
He didn't really know what he was doing.	Nije baš znao šta radi.
My job is good.	Moj posao je dobar.
You shouldn't do that.	Ne bi trebalo to da radiš.
But he wasn't tonight.	Ali večeras nije bio.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
But he doesn't say anything.	Ali on ne govori ništa.
We are allowed to do that.	To nam je dozvoljeno.
Maybe it will work for you too.	Možda će to raditi i za vas.
But no.	Ali ne.
They had time.	Imali su vremena.
It won't be right away.	Neće biti odmah.
I have a few.	Imam ih nekoliko.
I'm not sure why this is happening.	Nisam siguran zašto se to dešava.
I know what he's going to say.	Znam šta će reći.
And I'm sorry.	I žao mi je.
We have to do something.	Moramo nešto da uradimo.
Or maybe it's not good.	Ili možda nije dobro.
I'm afraid.	Bojim se.
I had a pretty good life.	Imao sam prilično dobar život.
Maybe he even loves me.	Možda me čak voli.
More this time.	Više ovaj put.
And why not.	A zašto ne.
He didn't say that, but he shouldn't have.	Nije to rekao, ali nije ni trebao.
But it certainly is.	Ali sigurno jeste.
Did you.	Da li si.
He couldn't, or he certainly would have done something.	Nije mogao, ili bi sigurno nešto uradio.
He should have been there.	Trebao je biti tamo.
People could see it now.	Ljudi su to sada mogli vidjeti.
I don't want to see him ever again.	Ne želim da ga vidim više ikada.
We have done much more.	Uradili smo mnogo više.
I'm surprised, actually.	Iznenađen sam, zapravo.
Is this your car?	Je li ovo tvoj auto?
I don't think you even want help.	Mislim da čak i ne želiš pomoć.
Do you have something you want to talk about?	Imaš li nešto o čemu želiš razgovarati?
Nobody knows.	Niko ne zna.
That was my first job.	To je bio moj prvi posao.
I just realized she was gone.	Jednostavno sam shvatio da je više nema.
It's just me.	To sam samo ja.
I'm working on it too.	I ja radim na tome.
Like, real.	Kao, pravi.
They will be back.	Oni će se vratiti.
I couldn't do it as well as she did.	Nisam to mogao tako dobro kao ona.
And you are.	A ti si.
I don't really like it.	Ne sviđa mi se baš.
There were still problems.	I dalje je bilo problema.
This didn't get any better for me.	Ovo mi nije bilo bolje.
I didn't ask and she didn't tell me.	Nisam pitao i nije mi rekla.
He is much better one on one.	On je mnogo bolji jedan na jedan.
No, no.	Nisam, ne.
We have where and how, now we need when.	Imamo gdje i kako, sada nam treba kada.
How are you.	Kako si.
There was simply nothing that could be done.	Jednostavno se ništa nije moglo učiniti.
No one can really say.	Niko zaista ne može reći.
Yes, everything.	Da, sve.
But it was time to go.	Ali bilo je vrijeme da ode.
Yes, we needed you.	Da, trebali ste nam.
I don't have this problem anymore.	Više nemam ovaj problem.
Not to lose.	Nije da bi izgubio.
But that will not happen.	Ali to se neće dogoditi.
I can't help him.	Ne mogu mu pomoći.
I hope it helps you.	Nadam se da će vam pomoći.
The reason you're there.	Razlog zašto ste tamo.
You said he gave it to you.	Rekao si da ti ga je dao.
It feels good.	Osjeća se dobro.
But it's pretty easy.	Ali to je prilično lako.
But this is not going to work.	Ali ovo neće raditi.
Today he is busy, busy, busy.	Danas je zauzet, zauzet, zauzet.
Isn't there.	Zar nema.
I want to know too.	I ja želim da znam.
It is unlikely to happen.	Malo je vjerovatno da će se to dogoditi.
It must be obvious.	Sigurno je očigledno.
No, it's for you.	Ne, za tebe je.
Where he was, there was something real.	Tamo gdje je on bio, bilo je nešto stvarno.
This is from me.	Ovo je od mene.
And he could.	I mogao je.
If so, you are right.	Ako jeste, u pravu ste.
That's how it goes.	Tako to ide.
Yes, but that was yesterday.	Da, ali to je bilo juče.
That is obviously not true.	To očigledno nije istina.
I was life.	Bio sam život.
I did something for you, and you know what it is.	Uradio sam nešto za tebe, i znaš šta je to.
She really wanted that.	Ona je to jako htela.
It takes time !.	Treba vremena!.
It's a job.	To je posao.
She never says anything bad about anyone.	Ona nikada nema loše da kaže o nikome.
I want to do so many things.	Želim da radim toliko stvari.
It is, and it is not.	Jeste, i nije.
He had nothing to do here.	Nije imao šta da radi ovde.
He shouldn't say that.	Ne bi trebao to da kaže.
It wouldn't be the first time.	Ne bi bilo prvi put.
He decided to leave.	Odlučio je da ode.
And he came.	I došao je.
But life is safe here.	Ali život je ovdje siguran.
None of you can do anything.	Niko od vas ništa ne može učiniti.
He and I.	On i ja.
I just wish him a better life.	Samo mu želim bolji život.
It wasn't hard.	Nije bilo teško.
So no one left.	Tako da niko nije otišao.
This afternoon, probably.	Danas popodne, verovatno.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
They knew why.	Znali su zašto.
I had to work for it.	Morao sam da radim za to.
That's not bad.	To nije loše.
It seems easy, but it’s not.	Čini se lako, ali nije.
A lot of people are currently.	Mnogo ljudi je trenutno.
He'll be here soon.	Doći će uskoro.
No more of that.	Nema više toga.
It seems no.	To čini ne,.
More on that next week.	Više o tome sljedeće sedmice.
It wasn't right.	Nije bilo u redu.
There is a good reason for that.	Za to postoji dobar razlog.
It's work now.	Sada je posao.
I don't know how it happened.	Ne znam kako se to dogodilo.
That doesn't work here.	To ovde ne radi.
I do not know what to say.	Ne znam šta da ti kažem.
You won't be able to see him again.	Nećeš ga moći više vidjeti.
I had to return them.	Morao sam ih vratiti.
And that just won’t happen.	A to se jednostavno neće dogoditi.
We know better.	Znamo bolje.
He doesn't want to leave without it.	Ne želi da ode bez toga.
We both were.	Oboje smo bili.
But we still don't know why or what happened.	Ali još ne znamo zašto se ni šta se dogodilo.
I knew he would come.	Znao sam da će doći.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
No, it's not happening.	Ne, ne dešava se.
Just like she was.	Baš kao što je i bila.
He wasn't good either.	Ni on nije bio dobar.
So that's not a problem.	Tako da to nije problem.
It is no longer what it used to be.	Više nije ono što je bilo.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
He's fine.	On je dobro.
They can tell you.	Oni vam mogu reći.
That's it.	To je to.
And you can tell me what happened.	I možeš mi reći šta se dogodilo.
I wish we had time.	Voleo bih da smo imali vremena.
I hope not.	Nadam se da ne.
No one can help me.	Niko mi ne može pomoći.
Even from you.	Čak i od tebe.
But if you have to go, you have to.	Ali ako moraš ići, moraš.
It took him so little for this, it seemed to him.	Tako mu je malo trebalo za ovo, činilo mu se.
I mean, it just isn't.	Mislim, jednostavno nije.
This is all we can do.	Ovo je sve što možemo.
He is his own again.	On je ponovo svoj.
That's how we work.	Tako i mi radimo.
Nothing, really.	Ništa, zaista.
I needed him to know that.	Trebalo mi je da to zna.
Right away.	Odmah.
Who will win this year?	Ko će pobijediti ove godine?
I just wonder the reason for that.	Pitam se samo razlog tome.
If he had, he would have done it sooner.	Da jeste, uradio bi to ranije.
He can be anything.	On može biti bilo šta.
I wish it was me.	Voleo bih da sam to ja.
She didn't know what had happened.	Nije znala šta se dogodilo.
That is so true.	To je tako istina.
Please help me at any time.	Molim bilo koga da mi pomogne.
And we are, as far as we can tell.	I mi smo, koliko možemo reći.
I left.	Otišao sam.
Yes he did.	Da uradio je.
But we've been here a while.	Ali mi smo ovdje neko vrijeme.
And they won't know.	I neće znati.
Just like that, like that.	Samo tako, tako.
But there is more, much more.	Ali ima još, mnogo više.
I never have to know that.	Nikada to ne moram znati.
He didn't have to.	Nije morao.
He will surely win.	Sigurno će pobijediti.
I mean, it has to be.	Mislim, mora biti.
They would have known for a while that it wasn't.	Već neko vrijeme bi znali da nije to.
In any way.	Na bilo koji način.
I had to a little.	Morao sam malo.
He knew he looked good.	Znao je da dobro izgleda.
I don't have to work.	Ne moram da radim.
I don't think that will ever happen.	Mislim da se to nikada neće dogoditi.
He had a problem with me.	Imao je problem sa mnom.
We are here.	Mi smo tu.
He started his business and finished it.	Počeo je svoj posao i završio ga.
No problem.	Nije problem.
Just look, this was you.	Samo vidi, ovo si bio ti.
This was real.	Ovo je bilo stvarno.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Nisam siguran kako da to uradim.
That's what you said.	To ste rekli.
This must be done properly.	To se mora uraditi kako treba.
It wasn't enough for me.	Nije mi bilo dovoljno.
Done.	Uradio.
Mine was the first.	Moj je bio prvi.
He got home.	Stigao je kući.
I expected too much.	Očekivao sam previše.
And not just this.	I ne samo ovo.
I think that's it for me.	Mislim da je on to za mene.
And I want to know why.	I želim znati zašto.
And it works.	I to radi.
I lost him.	Izgubio sam ga.
This has happened several times.	To se dogodilo nekoliko puta.
You couldn't do that.	Ne bi mogao to da uradiš.
Now it will be a story.	Sada će to biti priča.
Everything happens so fast.	Sve se dešava tako brzo.
We all do that.	Svi mi to radimo.
I probably shouldn't.	Verovatno ne bih trebao.
I needed both.	Trebalo mi je oboje.
Has it ever been.	Da li je ikada.
No, that's not true.	Ne, to nije istina.
It's so good to be back.	Tako je dobro vratiti se.
I was pretty glad.	Bilo mi je prilično drago.
We really like it.	Zaista nam se sviđa.
But he thinks they shouldn't have been.	Ali on misli da nisu trebali biti.
I hope you like it !.	Nadam se da vam se sviđa!.
It's always been like that.	Uvijek je bilo tako.
She was still with him.	I dalje je bila s njim.
I could say that much.	Toliko bih mogao reći.
We are here now.	Sada smo tu.
I never told anyone.	Nikad nikome nisam rekao.
Or don't say anything.	Ili ne reci ništa.
I don't know anything about that.	Ne znam ništa o tome.
I really wanted to.	Zaista sam htela.
You what ?.	Ti šta?.
The man knew nothing.	Čovjek ništa nije znao.
You have to work for what you want.	Morate raditi za ono što želite.
It's bad.	Loš je.
It won't be hard.	Neće biti teško.
Not really.	Zapravo nije.
And I think he's right.	I mislim da je u pravu.
And it's real.	I to je stvarno.
I don't have money now.	Sada nemam novca.
You're a really good friend.	Ti si stvarno dobar prijatelj.
I was too good for anyone.	Bila sam previše dobra za bilo koga.
I'm sorry, you say.	Žao mi je, kažeš.
You've been alone long enough.	Dovoljno ste dugo bili sami.
Who did this to him.	Ko mu je ovo uradio.
Not these things.	Ne ove stvari.
I got the job.	Dobio sam posao.
He never did these things.	Nikada nije radio ove stvari.
I couldn’t believe it was happening to me.	Nisam mogao vjerovati da mi se to dešava.
But no.	Ali ne.
But there is actually a good reason.	Ali zapravo postoji dobar razlog.
I don't know which one.	Ne znam koji.
I'm happy for you.	Drago mi je zbog tebe.
It's very real.	Veoma je stvarno.
She was fine.	Bila je dobro.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
I can't now.	Sada ne mogu.
I've always wanted to go.	Uvek sam želeo da idem.
It's just hard for me.	Samo mi je teško.
But maybe that was true.	Ali možda je to bila istina.
It would be hard to say.	Bilo bi teško reći.
I see it today.	Vidim to i danas.
That's what we do.	To je ono što mi radimo.
This is obviously the way.	Ovo je očigledno način.
But that's good.	Ali to je dobro.
He wanted to leave.	Želio je da ode.
So he did what he had to do.	Tako da je uradio ono što je trebalo.
He was glad he had.	Bilo mu je drago što je imao.
He says.	On kaže.
No.	Neću.
I saw it right away.	Odmah sam to vidio.
Someone else with him.	Još neko sa njim.
All right, right.	U redu, tako.
But she wasn't here.	Ali ona nije bila ovdje.
Actually.	Zapravo.
This is really very simple.	Ovo je zaista vrlo jednostavno.
He lost everything.	Izgubio je sve.
He's going there.	On ide tamo.
That's pretty good.	To je prilično dobro.
It shouldn't be a problem for you.	Ne bi trebao biti problem za tebe.
That's all I can say.	Toliko mogu reći.
I hope you could help me.	Nadam se da biste mi mogli pomoći.
It wouldn't be long.	Ne bi bilo dugo.
I wonder what will happen?	Pitam se šta će se dogoditi?
They didn't even know where she lived.	Nisu znali ni gdje ona živi.
That's very much.	To je veoma.
You don't know how.	Ne znaš kako.
And you were alone.	I bio si sam.
All right, he said.	U redu, rekao je.
You look good.	Izgledaš dobro.
I needed this today.	Trebalo mi je ovo danas.
It shouldn’t be too hard.	Ne bi trebalo biti previše teško.
I have it now.	Imam ga sada.
I've never been there before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio tamo.
This works well.	Ovo dobro radi.
It could happen tomorrow.	Moglo bi se dogoditi sutra.
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
Really good times.	Zaista dobra vremena.
I do not have it.	Nemam ga.
It's here.	Tu je.
He would really try.	Zaista bi pokušao.
He wondered what she looked like.	Pitao se kako ona izgleda.
Unless you are.	Osim ako nisi.
But it was still difficult.	Ali i dalje je bilo teško.
We will both still be there.	Oboje ćemo i dalje biti tu.
But no one will.	Ali niko neće.
He loves this.	On voli ovo.
And it seems to work.	I čini se da radi.
So it wasn't easy.	Tako da nije bilo lako.
He lost.	Izgubio je.
I really like the idea.	Zaista mi se sviđa ideja.
He never did.	Nikad nije.
he said.	on je rekao.
That makes us.	To nas čini.
I can't do everything.	Ne mogu sve.
It was a matter of power.	To je bila stvar moći.
But you can't be with us.	Ali ne možeš sa nama.
That will not happen to us.	To nam se neće dogoditi.
You mean well.	Misliš dobro.
I haven't seen this.	Nisam video ovo.
What more could it be?	Šta bi više moglo biti?
I was sure.	Bio sam siguran.
It wasn't bad.	Nije bilo loše.
Everything is yes or no.	Sve je da ili ne.
She didn't know what she was doing.	Nije znala šta radi.
I know that's enough.	Znam da je dosta toga.
It is obvious that this cannot be so.	Očigledno je da to ne može biti tako.
I guess they shouldn't.	Pretpostavljam da ne bi trebali.
That is no longer true.	To više nije istina.
This doesn't work.	Ovo ne radi.
But we just can't do that.	Ali to jednostavno ne možemo učiniti.
Yes, that was the thing.	Da, to je bila stvar.
I hope to see you soon.	Nadam se da ću te uskoro vidjeti.
Now he realized it.	Sada je to shvatio.
I think the man is trying.	Mislim da čovjek pokušava.
Very bad.	Veoma loše.
I was ready.	Bio sam spreman.
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
Lots of times.	Puno puta.
And from myself.	I od sebe.
He does a job that very few people do.	On radi posao koji radi vrlo malo ljudi.
We can leave.	Možemo otići.
It's not the right way.	Nije pravi put.
Not us, they.	Ne mi, oni.
I should go now.	Trebao bih sada da idem.
And today it is.	I danas jeste.
They will know you were here.	Oni će znati da ste bili ovdje.
You don't want to do this.	Ne želiš ovo da radiš.
It could be done.	Moglo bi se uraditi.
No one said much.	Niko nije rekao mnogo.
This is not enough.	Ovo nije dovoljno.
Not helpful.	Nije od pomoći.
I know him better than anyone.	Znam ga bolje od bilo koga.
Maybe you couldn't.	Možda nisi mogao.
He's working on it.	On radi na tome.
Or maybe you.	Ili možda ti.
There was none of that.	Nije bilo ništa od toga.
I am a very good person.	Ja sam jako dobra osoba.
It's not always like that.	Nije uvijek tako.
He had to go.	Morao je da ode.
I will never go back.	Nikad se neću vratiti.
This one had.	Ovaj je imao.
I was thinking this too.	I ja sam mislio na ovo.
Better without it.	Bolje bez toga.
I don't see how he could live.	Ne vidim kako je mogao da živi.
That it was time.	Da je bilo vrijeme.
There was more to come.	Još je trebalo doći još.
It's true.	To je tačno.
I hope it's not you.	Nadam se da to nisi ti.
It was not easy to come and go.	Nije bilo lako doći i otići.
I know it's hard, but that's what we have to do.	Znam da je teško, ali to je ono što moramo da uradimo.
If I can do that, I can do anything.	Ako to mogu, mogu sve.
The problem was how.	Problem je bio kako.
Nothing happened to him.	Ništa mu se nije dogodilo.
Not both.	Ne oboje.
I have to help.	Moram pomoći.
He's still here.	Još uvijek je ovdje.
But what we don't know is why.	Ali, ono što ne znamo je zašto.
He said for sure.	Rekao je sigurno.
I hope you get better soon.	Nadam se da ćeš brzo biti bolje.
They don't know what it is.	Oni ne znaju šta je to.
She said nothing.	Nije rekla ništa.
But that everything is nothing.	Ali da je sve ništa.
There is a reason.	Postoji razlog.
But someone won't.	Ali neko neće.
This is me!	Ovo sam ja!
Really, really bad.	Stvarno, stvarno loše.
It happens probably a lot more than people know.	To se dešava verovatno mnogo više nego što ljudi znaju.
The more you do it, the better you do.	Što više to radite, to vam bolje ide.
And he's still with me.	I još je sa mnom.
We don't need that anymore.	Ne treba nam više toga.
And rain.	I kiša.
I loved her too.	I ja sam je volio.
He did it, you know.	On je to uradio, znaš.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to da uradim.
But tell him to do something more.	Ali reci mu da uradi nešto više.
But no, it shouldn't have been.	Ali ne, nije trebalo biti.
There is nothing to see here.	Ovde nema šta da se vidi.
But we will be together soon.	Ali uskoro ćemo biti zajedno.
It's started now.	Sada je počeo.
what should be done	šta treba učiniti?
He doesn't need to.	On ne treba.
That's what I wanted.	Tako sam htela.
And it has to stay that way.	I to tako mora i ostati.
It is so.	To je tako.
And it will not be easy.	A to neće biti lako.
I was glad for that.	Bilo mi je drago zbog toga.
I figured things out.	Shvatio sam stvari.
I think that's all for now.	Mislim da je to sve za sada.
This is unlikely.	Ovo je malo vjerovatno.
This is my code, and this is what's wrong.	Ovo je moj kod, i to je ono što nije u redu.
He likes it.	Sviđa mu se.
He loved you, you know.	Voleo te je, znaš.
It couldn't have been better.	Nije moglo biti bolje.
We'll just stay here.	Samo ćemo ostati ovdje.
Could this be done better.	Može li se ovo bolje uraditi.
I'm sure you know these things.	Siguran sam da znaš ove stvari.
You know who you are.	Znate da ste ko.
I don't think anyone can.	Mislim da niko ne može.
He seems to like it.	Čini se da mu se sviđa.
We know what they did.	Znamo šta su uradili.
There's not much left.	Nema još puno toga.
No.	Nema.
As you wish, she said.	Kako hoćeš, rekla je.
He hasn't said enough yet.	Još nije dovoljno rekao.
I'm sorry to say that, but it's true.	Žao mi je što to kažem, ali to je istina.
But this is not the day.	Ali ovo nije taj dan.
It was just them or me.	Bili smo jednostavno oni ili ja.
And you.	I ti si.
But he's not here yet.	Ali još nije ovdje.
You should trust me.	Trebao bi mi vjerovati.
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
That couldn't happen.	To se nije moglo dogoditi.
Maybe I'm wrong.	Možda nisam u pravu.
You won't be well.	Neće ti biti dobro.
If it works.	Ako radi.
So it’s easy to get too.	Tako da je lako dobiti previše.
Yes, he loved him.	Da, volio ga je.
He had it.	Imao je to.
I can work with that.	Mogu raditi s tim.
It just won’t happen.	To se jednostavno neće dogoditi.
I just have to.	Samo moram.
I like that I don't know.	Volim da ne znam.
Good for both.	Dobro za oboje.
If not now, when ?.	Ako ne sada, kada?.
This is the only one.	Ovo je jedina.
We need more of that.	Treba nam više toga.
What is today.	Što je danas.
And indeed, it still is.	I zaista, još uvijek je.
I'm surprised by you.	Iznenađen sam tobom.
But that's a good idea.	Ali to je dobra ideja.
It was really good.	Bilo je stvarno dobro.
It doesn't look bad.	Ne izgleda loše.
Yes, they are there.	Da, tamo su.
It was easy.	Bilo je lako.
Nobody told him anything.	Niko mu ništa nije rekao.
I'm just not going.	Ja jednostavno ne idem.
I know how it is.	Znam kako je.
We could move on.	Mogli bi dalje.
I asked him.	pitao sam ga.
He doesn't want money.	On ne želi novac.
They won't believe me.	Neće mi vjerovati.
I know that for sure.	Znam to sigurno.
I'm really sorry.	Zaista mi je žao.
I'm a good friend.	Ja sam dobar prijatelj.
He wanted her to have it all.	Želio je da ona ima sve.
That was on time.	To je bilo na vrijeme.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
She was fine with that.	Bila je u redu s tim.
She is fine.	Ona je dobro.
All those things.	Sve te stvari.
It was if.	Bilo je ako.
They couldn't do enough for you.	Nisu mogli učiniti dovoljno za tebe.
As can be.	Kao što može biti.
Do what you want.	Radi šta hoćeš.
I wasn't there.	Nisam bio tamo.
Which was little more than nothing.	Što je bilo malo više od ništa.
It's not trying to be.	To ne pokušava biti.
They may not be sure of what they know.	Možda nisu sigurni u ono što znaju.
That's what the team does.	To je ono što tim radi.
I have more than enough.	Imam više nego dovoljno.
But they couldn't.	Ali nisu mogli.
How right you are.	Kako si u pravu.
They could leave.	Mogli bi otići.
She wasn't.	Nije bila.
I'm not going to do it that way.	Neću to uraditi na taj način.
But something was wrong.	Ali nešto nije bilo u redu.
I was glad to have it.	Bilo mi je drago da ga imam.
He brought it back.	Vratio ga.
He has a lot of friends.	Ima puno prijatelja.
She didn't know why.	Nije znala zašto.
I'm glad to have you.	Drago mi je da te imam.
Too good, actually.	Previše dobro, u stvari.
This can't really be done.	Ovo se zapravo ne može uraditi.
I am so and that is fine.	Tako sam i to je u redu.
Sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga.
That's your job.	To je tvoj posao.
It just has to be.	To jednostavno mora biti.
I don't know exactly how to tell you this.	Ne znam tačno kako da vam ovo kažem.
Not obviously.	Neće očigledno.
She was somewhat fine.	Bila je pomalo dobro.
I wonder what you think about that.	Pitam se šta mislite o tome.
That's him.	To je on.
I am so glad.	Tako mi je drago.
That was easy to do.	To je bilo lako učiniti.
We didn't do it.	Mi to nismo uradili.
She still loves you.	Ona te i dalje voli.
What she didn't want to do, not yet.	Što nije htela da uradi, ne još.
They are not what we are.	Oni nisu ono što smo mi.
She was right and he knew it.	Bila je u pravu i on je to znao.
That's it.	To je to.
You.	Vi.
He was pretty busy.	Bio je prilično zauzet.
That's what life is really about.	To je ono o čemu se zapravo živi.
Things are bad there.	Stvari su loše tamo.
Love me, love me, love me.	Voli me, voli me, voli me.
As it was.	Kao što je bilo.
This was very difficult for me.	Ovo mi je bilo veoma teško.
He will never be there again.	Nikada više neće biti tamo.
He would ask her if he was a father.	Pitao bi je da li je on otac.
How much more for me.	Koliko više za mene.
Let's do it right.	Uradimo to kako treba.
You should have seen her.	Trebao si je vidjeti.
I will find time for this.	Naći ću vremena za ovo.
It's good to be good.	Dobro je biti dobar.
Which will be soon.	Što će biti uskoro.
The problem is that you need to know how to do it.	Problem je u tome što morate znati kako to učiniti.
Certainly not tonight.	Sigurno nije večeras.
He wasn't even tired.	Nije bio ni umoran.
And neither are you.	A nisi ni ti.
I saw what he could do.	Video sam šta on može.
I'll find a way.	Naći ću način.
It's that simple.	Toliko je jednostavno.
But he had no idea why that was.	Ali nije imao pojma zašto je to tako.
It wasn't always easy.	Nije uvek bilo lako.
I never left again.	Nikada više nisam otišao.
I just can't tell.	Jednostavno ne mogu reći.
If not, don't.	Ako ne, nemoj.
And it's always for the better.	I uvek je na bolje.
But these people are wrong.	Ali ti ljudi nisu u pravu.
He had what he needed.	Imao je šta mu je trebalo.
We almost had it.	Skoro smo ga imali.
He was the only one here who could see it.	On je jedini ovdje mogao to vidjeti.
That is not life.	To nije život.
You know it's true.	Znaš da je istina.
Like three times.	Kao tri puta.
But do it.	Ali uradi to.
I never told him.	Nikad mu nisam rekla.
He is more than good.	On je više nego dobro.
I guess he doesn't want to tell me.	Pretpostavljam da ne želi da mi kaže.
So let's work on that.	Tako da radimo na tome.
I was never good at it.	Nikada nisam bio dobar u tome.
I don't know how to tell you what happened.	Ne znam kako da ti kažem šta se dogodilo.
Maybe I did this.	Možda sam ovo uradio.
No one should be here.	Niko ne bi trebao biti ovdje.
He was here last night.	Bio je ovdje sinoć.
I'm pretty sure.	Prilično sam siguran.
There is, even so.	Postoji, čak i tako.
How long.	Koliko dugo.
I'll be able to meet.	Moći ću se naći.
But that was my only hope.	Ali to je bila moja jedina nada.
I think that might be the problem for this.	Mislim da bi to moglo biti problem za ovo.
Nothing will happen.	Ništa se neće dogoditi.
Yes, why would you.	Da, zašto bi.
Nobody even knew he was there.	Niko nije ni znao da je tamo.
We know where you work.	Znamo gdje radite.
And a little.	I malo.
What happened to him?	Šta je bilo s njim?
Hope, for a better life.	Nada, za bolji život.
Maybe he's the only one.	Možda je on jedini.
And now here.	A sada ovdje.
I didn't want to be here.	Nisam htela da budem ovde.
You did well.	Dobro si uradio.
You can do these things.	Možeš raditi ove stvari.
He couldn't help him there, he realized.	Tu mu ne može pomoći, shvatio je.
What would she say?	Šta bi ona rekla.
Nobody wants that !.	Niko to ne želi!.
He heard, but did not understand.	Čuo je, ali nije shvatio.
Not enough for life.	Nije dovoljno za život.
IT IS.	TO JE.
We have more than that to do.	Imamo više od toga da uradimo.
He had never seen them before.	Nikad ih prije nije vidio.
Nobody knew.	Niko nije znao.
I'm absolutely sure.	Potpuno sam siguran.
But now it has begun.	Ali sada je počeo.
He can if he wants to.	Može ako želi.
I never told you.	Nikad ti nisam rekao.
I don't have time for myself.	Nemam vremena za sebe.
She knew so little about herself.	I sama je tako malo znala.
And maybe not.	A možda i ne bi.
I'm sure she knows who it is.	Siguran sam da ona zna ko je to.
I do it very well.	Ja to radim veoma dobro.
Maybe he knew.	Možda je znao.
Everyone who was anyone was there.	Svi koji su bili bilo ko bili su tamo.
He will come again tonight, he said.	Doći će ponovo večeras, rekao je.
I've never been.	Nikad nisam bio.
Just never enough.	Samo nikad dosta.
Like, everything.	Kao, sve.
And we shouldn't.	I ne bismo trebali.
I have no idea what they are.	Nemam pojma šta su.
He wants to do things.	On želi da radi stvari.
I see what's happening to me.	Vidim šta mi se dešava.
I like this?	Volim ovo?
It was a good thing.	Bila je to dobra stvar.
She knew what she was talking about.	Znala je o čemu govori.
Now he knew what it was.	Sada je znao šta je to nešto.
Now you can see exactly what you want.	Sada možete vidjeti tačno ono što želite.
Just do everything you can.	Samo uradite sve što možete.
And I couldn't see anything.	I ništa nisam mogao vidjeti.
But not all.	Ali ne sve.
But he could talk.	Ali mogao je da priča.
You are all in it together.	Svi ste zajedno u tome.
It was just raining.	Bila je samo kiša.
But even so.	Ali čak i tako.
The problem is that someone is.	Problem je u tome što neko jeste.
That's right here.	Tako je ovde.
I don't want this.	Ne želim ovo.
I have a lot more to say.	Imam još mnogo toga da kažem.
And the people who are still here.	I ljudi koji su još uvijek ovdje.
No one like him.	Niko kao on.
I'm sure there must be several.	Siguran sam da ih mora biti nekoliko.
GOOD IDEA.	DOBRA IDEJA.
I'm glad to be home.	Drago mi je što sam kod kuće.
He would too.	I on bi.
And something else.	I još nešto.
That's what he's doing now.	To je ono što sada radi.
Everything would be better for you.	Sve bi ti bilo bolje.
So much has happened this year.	Toliko se toga dogodilo ove prošle godine.
I don't think he loves you.	Mislim da te i ne voli.
He was.	Bio je.
That could be better discussed.	O tome bi se moglo bolje razgovarati.
That would be a problem.	To bi bio problem.
He couldn't stay here.	Nije mogao ostati ovdje.
And when he's right, he's right.	A kad je u pravu, u pravu je.
He wasn't sure how he was going to do it.	Nije bio siguran kako će to učiniti.
She didn't know this was happening.	Nije znala da se ovo dešava.
She won't talk to him.	Neće razgovarati s njim.
True, none of this could have happened.	Istina, ništa nije moglo biti od toga.
But it won't always be.	Ali neće uvek biti.
He has nothing more to give.	On više nema šta da da.
It almost is.	Skoro da jeste.
We have .	Imamo .
I love this team.	Volim ovaj tim.
And we can.	I možemo.
A lot has happened.	Mnogo toga se dogodilo.
You must know this.	Morate znati ovo.
Not even here.	Čak ni ovde.
I wouldn't be here without him.	Ne bih bio ovdje da nije bilo njega.
So on and so forth.	Tako dalje i tako dalje.
But this never happens properly.	Ali ovo se nikada ne dešava kako treba.
But she's trying to get to me.	Ali ona pokušava doći do mene.
I don't have to do anything.	Ne moram ništa da radim.
No, no, not for me.	Ne, ne, ne za mene.
And they knew when he would be there.	I znali su kada će on biti tamo.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I would say so.	Ja bih tako rekao.
We can't go back.	Ne možemo se vratiti.
Everyone is fine.	Svi su dobro.
Is that it.	Je li to to.
She said so.	Ona je tako rekla.
It's not there.	Nije tamo.
I wasn't ready.	Nisam bio spreman.
I thought about you a lot.	Mnogo sam mislio na tebe.
He's doing well now.	Sada mu ide dobro.
She has nothing there.	Ona tamo nema ništa.
And just, you know.	I samo, znaš.
I'm just sick of you, that's all.	Samo mi je dosta od tebe, to je sve.
He won't even come back.	Neće se ni vratiti.
No, not that one.	Ne, ne taj.
They are there for me.	Oni su tu za mene.
And that's exactly what they did.	I upravo su to uradili.
Let me ask you again.	Da te pitam ponovo.
I'm afraid you can't come back.	Bojim se da se ne možeš vratiti.
She has a job.	Ona ima posao.
He would be back tomorrow.	Sutra bi se vratio.
We can do something.	Možemo nešto da uradimo.
Still no one came.	I dalje niko nije došao.
Everything he needed.	Sve što mu je trebalo.
He didn't know what she said.	Nije znao šta je rekla.
There seemed to be nothing he could do.	Činilo se kao da ništa ne može učiniti.
You knew your way.	Znao si svoj put.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
But you're not really here.	Ali ti zapravo nisi ovdje.
Someone has to say something.	Neko mora nešto reći.
I didn't think he would leave.	Nisam mislio da će otići.
I was just sorry for you.	Samo mi te je bilo žao.
It's time now.	Vrijeme je sada.
And now it's happening at home.	A sada se to dešava kod kuće.
And he didn't want her to leave again.	I nije želio da ona ponovo ode.
I have a few.	Imam nekoliko.
We needed to work together.	Trebalo je raditi zajedno.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
I know this is true.	Znam da je ovo istina.
I know for sure they didn't.	Znam sigurno da nisu.
Hard, he said.	Teško, rekao je.
This is not a person.	Ovo nije osoba.
I could believe it myself.	Mogao sam i sam vjerovati.
I couldn't either.	Nisam mogao ni ja.
He no longer had anything to go home.	Nije više imao šta da ide kući.
But it has it all.	Ali sve ima.
She was so right.	Bila je tako u pravu.
We can do it, they said.	Mi to možemo, rekli su.
You don't want to tell me, you don't have to.	Ne želiš da mi kažeš, ne moraš.
s.	s.
He had little money.	Imao je malo novca.
I'm glad he said.	Drago mi je da je rekao.
We can't stay and talk.	Ne možemo ostati i razgovarati.
Maybe for dinner.	Možda na večeru.
But without it.	Ali bez toga.
She was usually alone.	Obično je bila sama.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Nije prvi put da se to dogodilo.
They should have talked.	Trebali su razgovarati.
I knew how to do it.	Znao sam kako to da uradim.
He won't tell you.	Neće ti reći.
If anyone can do this.	Ako neko može ovo da uradi.
In fact, we know very little about it.	U stvari, znamo samo malo o tome.
But it seems likely.	Ali izgleda vjerovatno.
In fact, it is not.	U stvari, nije.
He was your father.	On je bio tvoj otac.
He knows many things.	On zna mnogo stvari.
He ended well.	Završio je dobro.
That was for sure.	To je bilo sigurno.
He's not here.	On nije ovde.
I need one.	Treba mi jedan.
He never saw him.	Nikad ga nije vidio.
This man was everything to me.	Ovaj čovjek mi je bio sve.
But there is.	Ali postoji.
Only, nothing happens.	Samo, ništa se ne dešava.
I can't do it alone.	Ne mogu sam.
Today could have been a really bad day.	Danas je mogao biti zaista loš dan.
She was still not at home.	Još uvijek nije bila kod kuće.
My father was right.	Otac je bio u pravu.
It was her.	Bila je to ona.
And the father never knew.	A otac nikad nije znao.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Siguran sam da znaš šta je to.
No problem, he said.	Nema problema, rekao je.
He gave me money.	Dao mi je novac.
And he says.	I kaže .
I asked her about it today.	Pitao sam je o tome danas.
And this must be done.	I ovo se mora uraditi.
Suffice it to say, it works.	Dovoljno je reći, radi.
Just not quite so happy.	Samo ne baš tako sretan.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I came back in time.	Vratio sam se na vrijeme.
This is true today as never before.	To je istina danas kao nikada ranije.
things are fine there.	tamo su stvari u redu.
Sure, they would do it this time.	Sigurno, ovaj put bi to uradili.
It almost happened last year.	To se skoro dogodilo prošle godine.
It's too simple.	To je previše jednostavno.
All this together.	Sve ovo zajedno.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
It really was.	Zaista je bilo.
I guess he can do it.	Pretpostavljam da on to može.
I've never had a problem before.	Nikad prije nisam imao problema.
I was busy.	Bio sam zauzet.
Everything good takes time.	Za sve dobro treba vremena.
I can do that.	Mogu s tim.
That was it, she told herself.	To je bilo to, rekla je sebi.
It can happen anywhere.	To se može dogoditi bilo gdje.
She wants to see me.	Ona želi da me vidi.
Now may be the time.	Sada je možda vrijeme.
This is really still very simple.	Ovo je zaista i dalje vrlo jednostavno.
I was happy to be done with it.	Bio sam sretan što sam završio s tim.
Apparently not.	Izgleda da nije.
If you want better, you can.	Ako želite bolje, možete.
All but three.	Sve osim tri.
I know you wouldn't.	Znam da ne bi.
It is difficult to say what exactly the problem is.	Teško je reći šta je tačno problem.
I would do it.	Ja bih to.
Like yes.	Kao da.
He was right, as usual.	Bio je u pravu, kao i obično.
Not like last night.	Ne kao sinoć.
But here you can do the right thing.	Ali ovdje možete učiniti pravu stvar.
I've seen it many times.	Vidio sam to mnogo puta.
He wanted a life without me.	Želio je život bez mene.
It's hard to know what to believe.	Teško je znati u šta vjerovati.
Time for fun!	Vrijeme za zabavu!
Just a few.	Samo nekoliko.
They did it very well.	Oni su to uradili veoma dobro.
I left before something bad could happen.	Otišao sam prije nego što se nešto loše moglo dogoditi.
But now we know why.	Ali sada znamo zašto.
You are here.	Ti si ovdje.
And he's right.	I on je u pravu.
She was no longer human.	Više nije bila čovjek.
Good story.	Dobra priča.
It can't be said.	Ne može se reći.
I would love nothing more.	Ništa više ne bih volio.
If you want to know.	Ako želiš znati.
We shouldn't say.	Ne bismo trebali reći.
He has a good job.	Ima dobar posao.
The job looked good.	Posao je izgledao dobro.
I hope it will be sooner.	Nadam se da će to biti ranije.
I hope you find something you like.	Nadam se da ćeš naći nešto što ti se sviđa.
Nobody could do anything.	Niko ništa nije mogao.
We didn't know what it was.	Šta je to bilo nismo znali.
That is something we know better.	To je nešto što znamo bolje.
She is she.	Ona je ona.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
But she hadn't been with him long.	Ali nije bila dugo s njim.
And it was good.	I bilo je dobro.
And there are many of them.	A ima ih mnogo.
That's a good question.	To je dobro pitanje.
He really looks like a good, good person.	Zaista izgleda kao dobra, dobra osoba.
And it won't be.	I neće biti.
He was sure of it.	Bio je siguran u to.
We don't know who he could really be.	Ne znamo ko bi on zaista mogao biti.
You're not doing this for me.	Ne radiš to zbog mene.
Or a friend.	Ili prijatelja.
In fact, enough.	U stvari, dosta.
But it's not, and it's not.	Ali nije, i nisu.
I'm not sure what that is exactly.	Nisam siguran šta je to tačno.
You have to.	Morati.
Everything is true.	Sve je tačno.
He had had enough.	Bilo mu je dosta.
I know what he wants.	Znam šta želi.
And there aren't that many of us.	A nema nas toliko.
You're better than me.	Bolji si od mene.
There was so much, maybe too much.	Bilo je toliko, možda i previše.
And that was him.	I to je bio on.
We can bring it back.	Možemo to vratiti.
I do not see anything wrong with it.	Ne vidim ništa loše u tome.
That's okay.	To je u redu.
It's hard to say.	Teško je reći.
He had no idea something was wrong.	Nije imao pojma da nešto nije u redu.
Even before.	Čak i prije.
It can't be him.	To ne može biti on.
This is, perhaps, obvious.	Ovo je, možda, očigledno.
Can anyone help please?	Može li neko pomoći molim vas?
If you want something, work for it.	Ako želite nešto, radite za to.
They will either buy it or not.	Ili će ga kupiti ili neće.
And now.	I sada.
But there is more.	Ali ima još toga.
She really means it.	Ona to zaista misli.
Now I can be my true self.	Sada mogu biti svoj pravi ja.
But it was better than that.	Ali bilo je bolje od toga.
That's not the life for you.	To nije život za tebe.
Maybe he's right.	Možda je u pravu.
I'm not going to school.	Ne idem u školu.
Maybe it doesn’t have to be money.	Možda to ne mora biti novac.
They are more like us.	Oni su više kao mi.
We are no longer sure.	Više nismo sigurni.
I want to see it.	Želim to vidjeti.
This was not easy.	Ovo nije bilo lako.
I said that.	Rekao sam to.
Just my thing.	Samo moja stvar.
Or it should be so.	Ili bi trebalo da bude tako.
You brought him back.	Ti si ga vratio.
I'm glad you're here today.	Drago mi je da si danas ovdje.
Just not right away.	Samo ne odmah.
This was very difficult for me.	Ovo mi je bilo jako teško.
I'm pretty happy now.	Sada sam prilično sretan.
I know exactly what he means.	Znam tačno šta misli.
She's not that.	Ona nije to.
But maybe you're right.	Ali možda si u pravu.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
Don't say you don't know.	Nemoj reći da ne znaš.
Probably not a good idea.	Verovatno nije dobra ideja.
There was nothing last year.	Prošle godine nije bilo ništa.
And that would be him.	A to bi bio on.
But it's okay.	Ali u redu je.
I knew that at the time.	Znao sam to u to vrijeme.
And it wouldn't be easy.	I ne bi bilo lako.
You were very good.	Bio si veoma dobar.
He was there.	Bio je tamo.
I said it's not bad.	Rekao sam da nije loš.
he said.	on je rekao.
But this never happened.	Ali ovo se nikada nije dogodilo.
I don't have time for this right now.	Nemam vremena za ovo sada.
This is probably what you want.	Ovo je vjerovatno ono što želite.
But not really.	Ali ne zapravo.
Nobody knew much about it.	Niko nije znao mnogo o tome.
I've been.	Bio sam.
You have to.	Morate.
But that is not even talked about.	Ali o tome se i ne govori.
I will definitely be back again soon.	Sigurno ću se vratiti ponovo uskoro.
They can leave.	Oni mogu otići.
Only now there is a question about it.	Samo sada postoji pitanje o tome.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
I wouldn't try again.	Ne bih pokušao ponovo.
For the umpteenth time.	Po ko zna koji put.
I like this.	Sviđa mi se ovo.
It's not always what seems obvious.	Nije uvijek ono što izgleda očigledno.
I just saw him.	Upravo sam ga vidio.
He needs me.	Trebao bih mu.
You could talk to him.	Mogao bi razgovarati s njim.
But even this may not be enough.	Ali ni ovo možda neće biti dovoljno.
And he came and you know.	I on je došao i znaš.
I don't think you told me everything he said.	Mislim da mi nisi rekao baš sve što je rekao.
Where we were when.	Gdje smo bili kada.
Now everything is fine.	Sada je sve u redu.
That can never be enough.	To nikada ne može biti dovoljno.
Not with me, by itself.	Ne sa mnom, samo po sebi.
We couldn't say it better ourselves.	Ni sami to ne bismo mogli bolje reći.
Or maybe.	Ili možda.
He did it for himself.	Uradio je to za sebe.
I'm.	Ja sam.
And so on and on and on.	I tako dalje i dalje, i dalje.
He will be really good.	On će biti stvarno dobar.
It is what it was.	To je ono što je bilo.
I didn't have to.	Nisam imao.
But you don't know.	Ali ti ne znaš.
Actually, none of us did.	Zapravo, niko od nas nije.
You have so much.	Imaš toliko toga.
You usually didn't know who they were.	Obično niste znali ko su.
I have so much to tell you.	Imam toliko toga da ti kažem.
I could do it if you want.	Mogao bih to uraditi ako želiš.
Video.	Video.
We've all been here.	Ovdje smo svi bili.
Not sure what you're doing?	Niste baš sigurni šta radite?
Probably me too.	Vjerovatno i ja.
You said that.	Ti si to rekao.
This is not a game.	Ovo nije igra.
That was none of my business.	To nije bila moja stvar.
Now there is one.	Sada postoji jedan.
There won't be a next one.	Sljedećeg neće biti.
But the truth must live.	Ali istina mora da živi.
This seemed better.	Činilo se da je ovo bolje.
Not my father.	Ne moj otac.
You will see it soon.	Uskoro ćete to vidjeti.
I just don't see it happening.	Jednostavno ne vidim da se to dešava.
What if it wasn't tomorrow?	Šta ako ne bi bilo sutra?
They were here, now they are not.	Bili su ovdje, sada nisu.
It was you.	Bio si ti.
That didn't seem right.	To se nije činilo u redu.
I did it last year.	Uradio sam to prošle godine.
That's bad for you.	To je loše za tebe.
I'm tired.	Umoran sam.
I hope to get back to that tomorrow.	Nadam se da ću se vratiti na to sutra.
I mean, he's so happy.	Mislim, on je tako sretan.
If he still had.	Ako je još imao.
Not as bad as you think.	Nije tako loše kao što mislite.
That is exactly the reason.	Upravo je to razlog.
I would have.	Imao bih.
But they knew.	Ali oni su znali.
These are real people.	Ovo su pravi ljudi.
We were there.	Bili smo tamo.
There was so little to see.	Bilo je tako malo za vidjeti.
Let me tell you, it's not like that.	Da vam kažem, nije tako.
Something that could be safe could be at home.	Nešto što bi moglo biti sigurno, moglo bi biti kod kuće.
I arrived first and did it right.	Prvi sam stigao i uradio to kako treba.
There are so many of them.	Toliko ih je.
We all have to stay together tonight.	Večeras moramo svi ostati zajedno.
You know how good it was.	Znaš kako je bilo dobro.
He said so much.	Toliko je rekao.
It's pretty hard, isn't it?	Prilično je teško, zar ne?
I don't want that anymore.	Ne želim to više.
Maybe you could now.	Možda bi sada mogao.
I needed to see you.	Trebao sam da te vidim.
That he is who you are.	Da je on tvoj ko je.
I had nothing to say.	Nisam imao šta da kažem.
She didn't tell anyone why, and no one knew.	Nikome nije rekla zašto, i niko nije znao.
But she said nothing.	Ali nije ništa rekla.
But not so bad.	Ali nije tako loše.
You shouldn't be here.	Ne bi trebao biti ovdje.
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
I don't know why we're here.	Ne znam zašto smo ovde.
I did not know.	Nisam znao.
I never had it.	Nikada ga nisam imao.
They are gone today.	Danas ih nema.
He is absolutely right.	On je potpuno u pravu.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
He didn't know it was going to be something he needed to do.	Nije znao da će to biti nešto što treba da uradi.
But there really was nothing for it.	Ali zaista nije bilo ništa za to.
He'll be like you soon.	Uskoro će biti kao ti.
I'm pretty sure it was you.	Prilično sam siguran da si to bio ti.
I like it that way.	Sviđa mi se tako.
He had heard it before.	Čuo je to ranije.
He decided to work.	Odlučio je da radi.
I didn't ask you to!	Nisam ti to tražio!
That was probably good, but it wasn't good.	To je vjerovatno bilo dobro, ali nije bilo dobro.
There's nothing we can do.	Ne možemo ništa.
I knew that well.	Znao sam to dobro.
That was all he needed.	To je bilo sve što mu je trebalo.
What were you doing last night?	Šta si radio sinoć?
I expected that.	Očekivao sam to.
Tomorrow, for sure, tomorrow.	Sutra, sigurno, sutra.
But it's something, maybe.	Ali to je nešto, možda.
It seemed simple.	Činilo se jednostavno.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
I love them a lot.	Mnogo ih volim.
Now we knew why.	Sada smo znali zašto.
Who knew he had it.	Ko je znao da ga ima.
I'm sorry to say that.	Žao mi je što to kažem.
It is very difficult.	Veoma je teško.
In a bad way.	Na loš način.
It doesn't work as well as you think.	Ne radi tako dobro kao što mislite.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim da je to dobra stvar.
Someone like you.	Neko kao ti.
And now he's so tired.	A sada je tako umoran.
It is not even said that it is not.	Čak se i ne kaže da nije.
What happens happens.	Ono što se dešava se dešava.
I'm not so sure.	Nisam tako siguran.
That's it now.	To je to sada.
So it can hardly be said that he is wrong.	Tako da se za njega teško može reći da nije u pravu.
It never was, never would be.	Nikada nije bilo, nikad ne bi bilo.
What do you think of the house?	Šta mislite o kući?
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
And now there is.	I sada ima.
That's all the video should be.	To je sve što video treba da bude.
I mean, you can stay with me.	Mislim, možeš ostati sa mnom.
What he says is so.	Ono što on kaže je tako.
I know she was.	Znam da je bila.
But there is no one.	Ali nema nikoga.
Someone came to the door.	Neko je došao do vrata.
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
I am him.	Ja sam on.
I know you did the job.	Znam da si radio posao.
Why would I.	Zašto bi.
But we really, really can't say what we're going to do.	Ali, zaista, zaista ne možemo reći šta ćemo učiniti.
How is it going.	Kako ide.
Is that really it.	Da li je to zaista ono.
This can be done.	Ovo se može uraditi.
I know how it works.	Znam kako radi.
You're the one.	Ti si taj.
The more people talk about it, the better.	Što više ljudi priča o tome, to bolje.
I really can't say.	Zaista ne mogu reći.
He would never have them.	Nikada ih ne bi imao.
That's probably a good thing.	Verovatno je to dobra stvar.
We can't know.	Ne možemo znati.
Not bad.	Nije loše.
I should know.	Trebalo bi da znam.
They really were in it.	Stvarno su bili u tome.
We probably won't.	Verovatno nećemo.
Let me tell you this.	Da ti kažem ovo.
She would be fine now.	Sada bi bila dobro.
He should have eaten more.	Trebalo je da jede više.
So is this.	Tako je i ovo.
We are not there.	Mi nismo tamo.
You have to see it.	Morate to vidjeti.
You just said that.	Upravo si to rekao.
You know that by now.	Znaš to do sada.
Everything seemed to be fine.	Činilo se da je sve u redu.
Nobody knows when.	Niko ne zna kada.
You can't leave.	Ne možeš otići.
You just don't do it.	Vi to jednostavno ne radite.
He doesn't want that anymore.	On to ne želi dalje.
He lives alone.	Živi sam.
It's just not that easy.	To jednostavno nije tako lako.
Tell me why.	Reci mi zašto.
Nobody saw him.	Niko ga nije video.
They both look good to me.	Oboje mi izgleda dobro.
I'm telling you this.	Kažem ti ovo.
Everything is fine, they told him.	Sve je u redu, rekli su mu.
But it won't hurt you.	Ali to vam neće biti loše.
If there are people.	Ako ima ljudi.
So much, and we don't know what they are.	Toliko, a mi ne znamo šta su.
We knew we had to do something.	Znali smo da moramo nešto učiniti.
We were.	Bili smo.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
How can I do this.	Kako mogu ovo da uradim.
I wish we could.	Voleo bih da možemo.
There is nothing.	Ne postoji ništa.
One of us, now.	Jedan od nas, sada.
The one that was	Ona, koja je bila
But nothing more.	Ali ništa više.
He said 'probably not'.	Rekao je 'vjerovatno ne'.
That's who he is.	To je ko je on.
I'm afraid there's only one.	Bojim se da postoji samo jedan.
And there was more to it than that.	I bilo je više od toga.
I am very happy for myself.	Veoma sam sretan za sebe.
None of us have ever done that.	Niko od nas to nikada nije uradio.
The man had none of that.	Čovjek nije imao ništa od toga.
I work so hard for you.	Toliko radim za tebe.
It's true.	To je istina.
When you left.	Kad si otišao.
This works.	Ovo radi.
Now he's gone too.	Sada je i on otišao.
Is that really allowed?	Da li je to zaista dozvoljeno?
He has to do it.	On to mora da uradi.
It seemed so to me.	Tako mi se činilo.
This was no longer true.	Ovo više nije bila istina.
But that's not for me.	Ali to nije za mene.
And you have to do it.	I to morate učiniti.
He really was there.	On je zaista bio tamo.
I'm sorry about that, but there's a reason.	Žao mi je zbog toga, ali postoji razlog.
This makes me me now.	Ovo me sada čini mi.
I just wanted you to know it's okay to do that.	Samo sam želio da znaš da je u redu to učiniti.
I need to see her.	Moram da je vidim.
That was always his problem.	To mu je uvijek bio problem.
You don't know what's going on.	Ne znaš šta se dešava.
And we need another one.	I treba nam još jedan.
It seems.	Izgleda.
Or maybe it happened.	Ili se to možda i dogodilo.
You can do anything that any man has done.	Sve što je bilo koji čovjek uradio možete i vi.
But now it's okay with that.	Ali sada je u redu s tim.
He's just there.	On je samo tamo.
It should, but it isn't.	Trebalo bi, ali nije.
And a man.	I čovjek.
And that's all, you know.	I to je sve, znaš.
And a little surprised.	I malo iznenađen.
I knew how.	Znao sam kako.
I asked who it was.	Pitao sam ko je to.
He was a bad man.	Bio je loš čovjek.
I never expected this to happen.	Nikada nisam očekivao da će se ovo dogoditi.
And here.	I ovdje.
I was so ready.	Bio sam tako spreman.
She will be back.	Ona će se vratiti.
He lives there while working.	On tamo živi dok radi.
You don't know what's in there.	Ne znaš šta je tamo.
You would go.	Ti bi otišao.
You can do better than that.	Možeš i bolje od toga.
Or if you do.	Ili ako to uradite.
Now we were in it together.	Sada smo zajedno bili u tome.
You have to stay human.	Moraš ostati čovjek.
I have to bring you back.	Moram te vratiti.
He didn't work with anyone.	Nije radio ni sa kim.
I wonder who they might be.	Pitam se ko oni mogu biti.
But he was right.	Ali bio je u pravu.
I didn't think so, he said.	Nisam tako mislio, rekao je.
There is only so much you can do.	Postoji samo toliko toga što možete učiniti.
Yes, we were.	Da, bili smo.
I really didn't want to go.	Zaista nisam htela da idem.
How many years.	Koliko godina.
Obviously we can see how that happened.	Očigledno možemo vidjeti kako se to dogodilo.
I know the way.	Znam put.
I know it's going to happen.	Znam da će se to dogoditi.
She told us she knew nothing.	Rekla nam je da ništa nije znala.
He had no problem with that.	Nije imao problema s tim.
I am now going.	Idem sada.
He could live with that.	Mogao je da živi sa tim.
I'm sure this will be quick.	Siguran sam da će ovo biti brzo.
You don't need much.	Ne treba ti puno.
He had little time.	Imao je malo vremena.
More than happy.	Više nego sretan.
It was good to see.	Bilo je dobro vidjeti.
We are still working.	Još uvijek radimo.
It was all better than nothing.	Sve je to bilo bolje nego ništa.
But they knew better.	Ali oni su znali bolje.
He was my friend.	Bio mi je prijatelj.
There is a lot to do here.	Ima mnogo toga da se uradi ovde.
Let's see again.	Da vidim ponovo.
I heard you say something.	Čuo sam da si rekao nešto.
You don't have to believe me.	Ne morate mi vjerovati.
All this here.	Sve ovo ovde.
I was not surprised.	Nisam bio iznenađen.
It seems there is.	Čini se da postoji.
Now we know what's going on.	Sada znamo šta se dešava.
This is clearly not the case here.	Ovdje očigledno nije tako.
Can you help.	Možete li pomoći.
There is a way to do both.	Postoji način da se uradi oboje.
We're right there.	Upravo smo tamo.
He should be here very soon.	Trebao bi biti ovdje vrlo brzo.
I told him.	Rekao sam mu.
He brought it back.	Vratio ga je.
The problem was that he didn't know what to do.	Problem je bio u tome što nije znao šta da radi.
You have to work on yourself.	Morate raditi na sebi.
He didn't have a car.	Nije imao auto.
He knew that.	To je on znao.
You were better.	Bio si bolji.
And that's okay.	I to je u redu.
What must be done.	Šta je ono što se mora uraditi.
For now, this is my code.	Za sada je ovo moj kod.
Besides, only we will be there.	Osim toga, tamo ćemo biti samo mi.
They said it would not be a problem.	Rekli su da to neće biti problem.
I wasn't sure which one.	Nisam bio siguran koji.
Or they could have done it as a team.	Ili su to mogli uraditi kao tim.
The only job we know.	Jedini posao koji znamo.
But it just wasn't him.	Ali to jednostavno nije bio on.
We never know what will happen.	Nikad ne znamo šta će se dogoditi.
I didn't know what to think.	Nisam znao šta da mislim.
You are alone now.	Sada ste sami.
He must have known that.	On je to sigurno znao.
And you know that.	I ti to znaš.
He is nothing to me.	On mi nije ništa.
The way it works.	Način na koji radi.
That's okay.	Za to je u redu.
I arrived on time!	Stigao sam na vrijeme!
It is not known exactly why.	Ne zna se tačno zašto.
And do it really.	I uradi to stvarno.
It was there for three years.	Tamo je bilo tri godine.
Not a very good friend, but a friend.	Nije baš dobar prijatelj, ali prijatelj.
This is not a.	Ovo nije a.
I am glad.	Drago mi je.
He would know what was going on.	Znao bi šta se dešava.
I was so happy and said yes.	Bio sam tako sretan i rekao da.
He is absolutely right.	On je to potpuno u pravu.
Just tell him he looks good.	Samo mu reci da dobro izgleda.
We did very little.	Uradili smo jako malo.
He is with us.	On je sa nama.
And you're on.	I ti si na.
He's such a good guy.	On je tako dobar momak.
I would never say never.	Nikad ne bih rekao nikad.
You have to go to him.	Moraš otići do njega.
But he could tell she didn't feel like herself.	Ali mogao je reći da se ne osjeća kao ona sama.
All these years together.	Sve ove godine zajedno.
She tells me she loves me.	Ona mi kaže da me voli.
We got you.	Imamo te.
Like a few, actually.	Kao i nekoliko, zapravo.
I can't talk about it.	Ne mogu o tome.
He knew what he wanted.	Znao je šta želi.
I thought you said you wanted to help.	Mislio sam da si rekao da želiš pomoći.
I did more.	Uradio sam više.
.	.
That was not easy, let me tell you.	To nije bilo lako, da vam kažem.
I don't even know who you are.	Ne znam ni ko si ti.
That would actually be pretty easy.	To bi zapravo bilo prilično lako.
But we don't know that.	Ali mi to ne znamo.
We are sorry.	Žao nam je.
I can’t believe she will really be mine.	Ne mogu vjerovati da će ona zaista biti moja.
That's enough.	Dosta je bilo.
Or both.	Ili oboje.
Is that happening to us now.	Da li nam se to sada dešava.
Maybe that was true.	Možda je to bila istina.
But you know it's happening.	Ali znaš da se to dešava.
I never came back.	Nikad se nisam vratio.
They had me and they knew it.	Imali su me i znali su to.
He would have time.	Imao bi vremena.
That happened.	To se dogodilo.
He can't help it.	On ne može pomoći.
You have a lot of money.	Imaš puno novca.
I love it.	Volim to.
That can still happen.	To se još može dogoditi.
There is nothing to do.	Nema šta da se uradi.
We both needed it.	Oboje smo trebali.
We had a good one.	Imali smo dobar.
he wondered.	pitao se.
She said she didn't know why.	Rekla je da ne zna zašto.
I can't say it is.	Ne mogu reći da jeste.
I can never be her.	Nikada ne mogu biti ona.
And say it again.	I reci to ponovo.
No one will be tired.	Niko neće biti umoran.
I bought it.	Kupio sam ga.
That was before.	To je bilo prije.
It won't work.	Neće raditi.
That was not a problem.	To nije bio problem.
My car worked well.	Moj auto je radio dobro.
I'm not sure why that is.	Nisam siguran zašto je to tako.
Now, today we know that is not true.	Sada, danas znamo da to nije istina.
Who else feels that way?	Ko se još tako osjeća?
I made up my mind, the man says.	Odlučio sam se, kaže čovjek.
And not just me.	I ne samo ja.
She likes to live alone.	Ona voli da živi sama.
It can be a help.	Može biti pomoć.
He knows nothing wrong.	Ne zna ništa loše.
No one can tell him what to do.	Niko mu ne može reći šta da radi.
That was the question.	To je bilo pitanje.
My first in three years.	Moj prvi u tri godine.
It could have been me.	Mogao sam biti ja.
This must be a	Ovo mora biti a
But there is nothing we can do.	Ali ne možemo ništa učiniti.
He's there.	On je tamo.
And he wasn't the first.	I nije bio prvi.
I will never tell anyone.	Nikad nikome neću reći.
He can't help himself.	Ne može si pomoći.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
Everyone knew that.	Svi su to znali.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda ne.
I could tell it wasn't.	Mogao sam reći da nije.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
You made it.	Ti si ga napravio.
You're coming, aren't you?	Doći ćeš, zar ne?
I'm not sure about that either.	Nisam baš siguran u to i.
You need someone.	Treba ti neko.
But it was not easy.	Ali nije bilo jednostavno.
Money, money, money!	Novac, novac, novac!
And we will do it.	I mi ćemo to učiniti.
I had to know who did it.	Morao sam da znam ko je to uradio.
That was more than wrong.	To je bilo više nego ne u redu.
And that's the story.	I to je priča.
I'm not ready.	Nisam spreman.
She knew nothing.	Nije znala ništa.
He still is.	On je još uvek.
He might even want to bring them back.	Možda bi ih čak želio vratiti.
But we were very glad to have her.	Ali bilo nam je jako drago što je imamo.
All that.	Sve to.
My car is fine.	Moj auto je u redu.
I heard about it this morning.	Čuo sam za to jutros.
You too.	I ti.
And not now.	I ne sada.
I'm sure it's not without your help.	Siguran sam da ti nije bez pomoći.
But he didn't know.	Ali nije znao.
She knew that now.	Sada je to znala.
He knew it was time to go.	Znao je da je vrijeme da ide.
Not so bad.	Nije tako loše.
You don't have to do anything else.	Ne morate ništa dalje da radite.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
This is nothing.	Ovo nije ništa.
But we did that three years ago.	Ali to smo uradili prije tri godine.
And that may have been true.	I to je možda bila istina.
So she really wanted that.	Tako da je to jako htela.
But he couldn't.	Ali nije mogao.
But if not, that's fine.	Ali ako ne, u redu je.
And he couldn't see.	I nije mogao da vidi.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
I didn't have a team.	Nisam imao tim.
I never doubt myself.	Nikad ne sumnjam u sebe.
That's the phrase.	Tako se kaže.
You are nobody.	Ti nisi niko.
I thought it was pretty good.	Mislio sam da je prilično dobro.
Apparently not.	Očigledno nije.
As none of us really know.	Kao što niko od nas zaista ne zna.
I didn't say much.	Nisam puno rekao.
That was hard.	To je bilo teško.
He was home alone, so there was no problem.	Bio je sam kod kuće, tako da nije bilo problema.
I don't really like doing that.	Zapravo ne volim to da radim.
I won't be there.	Neću biti tamo.
It's true.	To je istina.
Could it be better.	Može li biti bolje.
And that is all.	I to je sve.
I need money.	Treba mi novac.
Yes, maybe so.	Da, možda je tako.
I don't think it would be that hard.	Mislim da ne bi bilo tako teško.
How do you think this should be done?	Šta mislite kako bi ovo trebalo da se uradi?
He really wanted this job.	Zaista je želio ovaj posao.
That's a lot of money.	To je mnogo novca.
I don't know what to think.	Ne znam šta da mislim.
I don't have time for everything.	Nemam vremena za sve.
It's still there.	Još uvijek je tu.
I have tried so many times.	Toliko puta sam pokušao.
That was my problem.	To je bio moj problem.
I didn't want to go.	Nisam htela da idem.
I should have known he would.	Trebao sam znati da hoće.
It was a job for him.	Za njega je to bio posao.
This can be done in any way.	To se može učiniti na bilo koji način.
That was not my idea.	To nije bila moja ideja.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žao.
And completely surprised to be here.	I potpuno iznenađen što sam ovdje.
And maybe more.	A možda i više.
They don't know who you are yet.	Oni još ne znaju ko ste.
If only that were true.	Samo da je to istina.
I'll go with him.	Otići ću s njim.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Nisam baš siguran kako da ovo uradim.
But it really was from.	Ali to je zaista bilo od.
And don't ever do that again.	I nemoj to više nikada raditi.
Say what he wants you to say.	Govori ono što želi da kažeš.
Which you probably would.	Što bi vjerovatno i htio.
But there was nothing you could do.	Ali niste mogli ništa učiniti.
Very very good.	Jako jako dobar.
This team is ready.	Ovaj tim je spreman.
You can leave now.	Sada možete otići.
There are a lot.	Ima ih puno.
We don't know yet.	Ne znamo još.
That you are not a good person.	Da nisi dobra osoba.
It was a good job.	Bio je to dobar posao.
We can't stay here.	Ne možemo ostati ovdje.
I can tell you.	Mogu vam reći.
We have to do it now.	Moramo to uraditi sada.
She probably knew that too.	Vjerovatno je i ona to znala.
It was life for this.	Za ovo je bio život.
That's your job, too.	To je i tvoj posao.
We know she will leave.	Znamo da će ona otići.
Maybe he said more.	Možda je rekao više.
We had nothing to do with it.	Nismo imali ništa s tim.
He gave us everything we have.	Dao nam je sve što imamo.
If only I had it.	Samo da ga imam.
No one can do everything.	Niko ne može sve.
I lost everything because of it.	Izgubio sam sve zbog toga.
It just does so.	To jednostavno čini tako.
So simple.	Tako jednostavno.
Why not, he said.	Zašto ne, rekao je.
There is something there now.	Nešto tamo sada postoji.
I was like, really.	Bio sam kao, stvarno.
There is more going on than you want to know.	Dešava se više nego što želite da znate.
He said he would.	Rekao je da hoće.
That was fine.	To je bilo u redu.
But she said they didn't.	Ali ona je rekla da nisu.
I'm not sure if that's the reason.	Nisam siguran da li je to razlog.
He wants to go home.	On želi da ide kući.
They will help you there.	Oni će ti pomoći tamo.
You think so too.	I ti misliš.
I really don't want to.	Ja stvarno ne želim.
Good job with that.	Dobar posao s tim.
This is not that day.	Ovo nije taj dan.
The story is nothing.	Priča nije ništa.
Not fast enough.	Ne dovoljno brzo.
Indeed, that is exactly what happened.	Zaista, upravo se to dogodilo.
I was ready to party.	Bio sam spreman za zabavu.
Do this now!	Uradi ovo sada!
That's obvious.	To je očigledno.
The car drives very fast.	Auto vozi veoma brzo.
Like everyone.	Kao i svi.
Yes, they are here.	Da, ovdje su.
I knew how much you wanted something like that.	Znao sam koliko želiš tako nešto.
That may not be true.	To možda nije istina.
It's probably the way it should be.	Verovatno je tako kako bi trebalo da bude.
Where? 	Gdje?
We need to talk.	Moramo razgovarati.
That's none of my business.	To nije moja stvar.
No one was home.	Nikoga nije bilo kod kuće.
This could be a problem.	Ovo bi mogao biti problem.
I love everything.	Volim sve.
I don't have much yet.	Nemam još mnogo.
We'll see.	Ćemo vidjeti.
You lost me.	Izgubio si me.
He's done with it.	Završio je s tim.
It's hard to reach him.	Teško je doći do njega.
Even to myself.	Čak i sebi.
It could be better.	Moglo bi biti bolje.
I'm not afraid of you.	Ne bojim te se.
But that, in fact, is not the case.	Ali to, u stvari, nije tako.
And so it happened.	I tako se dogodilo.
There were many of them.	Bilo ih je mnogo.
Maybe it was nothing.	Možda nije bilo ništa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
That's not your job.	To nije tvoj posao.
Can you give me more money?	Možete li mi dati još novca?
I don't want to be his friend.	Ne želim da mu budem prijatelj.
But that is not the reason.	Ali to nije razlog.
Who's first?	Ko je prvi?
But you already know that.	Ali ti to već znaš.
I have done that.	Uradio sam to.
And he knows it.	I on to zna.
Life is as good as it can be.	Život je dobar koliko može biti.
Simple and easy.	Jednostavno i jednostavno.
More soon.	Više uskoro.
I'm not good.	Nisam dobro.
Even you were.	Čak si i ti bio.
They really needed to know better.	Zaista su trebali znati bolje.
In fact, we can move on.	U stvari, možemo ići dalje.
It can't be, he told himself.	Ne može biti, rekao je sebi.
And it doesn't look good.	I ne izgleda dobro.
You will too.	I ti ćeš.
You weren't there.	Nisi bio tamo.
They really were nothing.	Zaista nisu bili ništa.
I think this is the right path.	Mislim da je ovo pravi put.
You want to get to that sooner.	Želiš doći do toga prije.
That is very difficult to do.	To je veoma teško uraditi.
I can't say.	Ne mogu reći.
It is possible, but it is not easy.	Može se, ali nije lako.
And it could.	I moglo bi.
Not everyone would.	Ne bi svi.
I'm not sure.	Nisam siguran.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
I can't do better.	Ne mogu bolje.
That was my problem.	To je bio moj problem.
Someone would come.	Neko bi došao.
It is difficult to say exactly which year.	Teško je tačno reći koje godine.
so will we.	tako ćemo i mi.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
This just can't be right.	Ovo jednostavno ne može biti u redu.
You had to be ready for anything.	Morao si biti spreman na sve.
Pretty simple, really, you just have to get there.	Prilično jednostavno, zaista, samo treba doći do toga.
Okay so far.	U redu do sada.
This was usually difficult.	Ovo je obično bilo teško.
He could still be the first.	I dalje bi mogao biti prvi.
There was something wrong with that.	Nešto nije bilo u redu s tim.
No, this was not a good idea.	Ne, ovo nije bila dobra ideja.
But this is not the right path.	Ali ovo nije pravi put.
You know this.	Ti znaš ovo.
Probably a good thing.	Verovatno dobra stvar.
And he could.	A mogao bi.
But he can't.	Ali ne može.
How many more are there?	Koliko ih ima još?
He wanted this.	Želio je ovo.
It must be you.	Mora da si ti.
You are right.	U pravu ste.
That is not happening.	To se ne dešava.
It just doesn't work.	Jednostavno ne radi.
It can be very difficult.	Može biti jako teško.
What should you not do?	Šta ne bi trebalo da radiš?
There was nothing more he could do here.	Ništa više nije mogao učiniti ovdje.
I needed more money.	Trebalo mi je više novca.
I really don't see it.	Ja to zaista ne vidim.
I really want to see her.	Zaista želim da je vidim.
I'm sorry it had to be you.	Žao mi je što si to morao biti ti.
Yes, she says.	Da, kaže ona.
I was glad to see her.	Bilo mi je drago da je vidim.
I really like it.	Jako mi se sviđa.
And all that, like everyone else, works.	I sve to, kao i svi, radi.
That way, he said.	Na taj način, rekao je.
I needed you.	Trebao si mi.
I really didn't know what to say.	Zaista nisam znao šta da kažem.
This is not true!	To nije istina!
It should be.	Trebalo bi da bude.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
You had.	Imao si.
He wanted to leave.	Želio je da ode.
There is no tomorrow here.	Ovdje ne postoji sutra.
I told you.	Rekao sam ti.
Which often happens.	Što se često dešava.
I knew it was her.	Znao sam da je ona.
Very not good.	Vrlo ne dobro.
You've probably been here before.	Vjerovatno ste već bili ovdje.
Yes, everyone knew that well.	Da, svi su to dobro znali.
Not many friends.	Nema puno prijatelja.
But it's not true.	Ali nije istina.
Do a good job.	Uradite dobar posao.
Too much here.	Previše ovde.
And that's what you wanted too.	I to je ono što si i ti htela.
I don't want anything more from you.	Ne želim ništa više od tebe.
Probably would.	Verovatno bi.
That's what he said.	To je on rekao.
I expected that.	Očekivao sam to.
I'm fine.	Dobro sam.
All right, you're real.	U redu, pravi si.
It does not exist.	Ne postoji.
You know you are.	Znaš da jesi.
He is my friend.	On je moj prijatelj.
It's not about that.	Ne radi se o tome.
No one really does.	Niko to zaista ne radi.
I never asked him to do something he didn’t want to do.	Nikada ga nisam tražio da uradi nešto što ne želi.
I saw this.	Video sam ovo.
I should have plenty of time.	Trebalo bi da imam dosta vremena.
That's the real problem.	To je pravi problem.
But we're still here.	Ali još smo tu.
Nobody did that.	Niko to nije uradio.
I know why you came.	Znam zašto si došao.
That shouldn't be a problem.	To ne bi trebalo da bude problem.
I didn't even want to see it.	Nisam ni htela da to vidim.
That wasn't your job.	To nisi bio tvoj posao.
He knew.	Znao je.
It wasn't hard enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno teško.
We did it.	Uradili smo to.
And none of that was true.	I ništa od toga nije bilo istina.
We work together from time to time.	Radimo zajedno s vremena na vrijeme.
I don't know what he's doing.	Ne znam šta radi.
You're bad.	Ti si loš.
It was easy to find.	Bilo je lako naći.
This year is even better.	Ove godine je još bolje.
You can do it fast.	Možeš brzo.
But that's him.	Ali to je on.
But not yet.	Ali ne još.
He couldn't see her, but he didn't have to.	Nije mogao da je vidi, ali nije morao.
No one would tell me anything.	Niko mi ništa ne bi rekao.
But we have to move on.	Ali moramo ići dalje.
If only we could see her now.	Kad bi je sada mogli vidjeti.
We really needed the money.	Stvarno nam je trebao novac.
Do it for us, you know.	Uradite za nas, znate.
It's simple.	To je jednostavno.
That is much more than that.	To je mnogo više od toga.
I think something is wrong.	Mislim da nešto nije u redu.
In that.	U tome.
He hasn't arrived yet.	Još nije stigao.
But it was so hard for him.	Ali bilo mu je tako teško.
He knew he would be safe.	Znao je da će biti siguran.
There were a lot of them.	Bilo ih je dosta.
That was all he said.	To je bilo sve što je rekao.
Live for now.	Živi za sada.
But he still goes.	Ali on i dalje ide.
But no.	Ali ne.
He knew it was too easy.	Znao je da je bilo previše lako.
I expected as much.	Toliko sam i očekivao.
I'm just leaving.	Upravo idem.
It shouldn't be that hard.	Ne bi trebalo biti tako teško.
We could see that.	To smo mogli vidjeti.
It must.	Mora.
He doesn't seem to be doing anything.	Čini se da ništa ne radi.
There is so much to say, and fast.	Toliko toga treba reći, i to brzo.
And it works really well.	I radi jako dobro.
But it can't be.	Ali to ne može biti.
I didn't want to.	Nisam htela.
And maybe they're nothing to you.	A možda za tebe nisu ništa.
That's not a good thing.	To nije dobra stvar.
I don't even know if it was a game anymore.	Ne znam ni da li je to više bila igra.
It's not easy.	Nije lako.
Maybe he didn't know what it was.	Možda nije znao šta je to.
There and not there.	Tamo a ne tamo.
But it's too bad.	Ali previše je loše.
Oh no.	O ne.
Things about yourself.	Stvari o sebi.
He's really good.	On je stvarno dobar.
And I need something to do.	I treba mi nešto za raditi.
But no one did.	Ali niko nije.
They had.	Oni su imali.
Or even do it.	Ili čak to radiš.
He's been there before.	Bio je tamo ranije.
Or not you now.	Ili ne ti sada.
It could be more than that.	Moglo bi biti više od toga.
She actually said that.	Ona je to zapravo rekla.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo u redu.
None of us asked to do that.	Niko od nas nije tražio da to uradimo.
It's just a question of when.	Samo je pitanje kada.
I already knew that.	I ja sam to već znao.
I'll tell you about it.	Reći ću ti o tome.
He seems to be waiting for someone.	Čini se da čeka nekoga.
I've seen it before.	Video sam to ranije.
Nobody knows what will happen.	Niko ne zna šta će se dogoditi.
How many.	Koliko ima.
It was actually very simple.	Zapravo je bilo vrlo jednostavno.
You may have to, or you may not have to.	Možda ćete to morati, a možda i ne morate.
He said we wouldn't do it.	Rekao je da to nećemo uraditi.
To know.	Da bi znali.
It's hard to say which is better.	Teško je reći koji je bolji.
I'll know now.	Sada ću znati.
I did it for a lot of people.	Uradio sam to za mnogo ljudi.
All this is still being done.	Sve ovo se još radi.
I asked him what was going on.	Pitao sam ga šta se dešava.
He didn't know how he knew it.	Nije znao kako je to znao.
That may have been difficult.	To je možda bilo teško.
He wouldn't have to do that.	On to ne bi morao da uradi.
He didn't have time before, but now he would.	Prije nije imao vremena, ali sada bi.
They must know better.	Sigurno znaju bolje.
Everything looks much better.	Sve izgleda mnogo bolje.
I can't be the only person here.	Ne mogu biti jedina osoba ovdje.
Oh no, oh no, oh no.	O ne, o ne, o ne.
But there it is.	Ali tu je.
I'm.	Ja sam.
If so, fine.	Ako jeste, u redu.
That's good for you.	To je dobro za tebe.
You don't have to say anything.	Ne moraš ništa da kažeš.
I'm sure of it now.	Sada sam siguran u to.
She is only three years old.	Ona ima samo tri godine.
You will obviously get more than that.	Očigledno ćete dobiti više od toga.
I don't know, not really.	Ne znam, ne baš.
We can't go back now.	Ne možemo se sada vratiti.
I thought you could talk a little.	Mislio sam da bi mogao malo razgovarati.
To the house.	Do kuće.
He should have left.	Trebao je da ode.
But none of that was true.	Ali ništa od toga nije bilo istina.
He knew he couldn't win.	Znao je da ne može pobijediti.
I've seen her do that before.	Video sam je ranije da to radi.
We didn't know.	Nismo znali.
No, that's not true.	Ne, to nije istina.
Where do you work?	Gdje radiš?
This was not easy.	Ovo nije bilo lako.
He would have done it if he could.	Uradio bi to da je mogao.
For no one.	Ni za koga.
It's like doing something.	To je kao nešto što biste uradili.
It's not that hard.	Nije tako teško.
Do you want it now?	Želiš li to sada?
Good job!	Dobar posao!
See where he is.	Vidi gdje je.
She said nothing.	Nije rekla ništa.
This should be.	Ovo bi trebalo da bude.
How it really was.	Kako je to zaista bilo.
He did a lot of it.	Mnogo je to radio.
The problem is that he was actually right.	Problem je što je on zapravo bio u pravu.
Except that's not quite right either.	Osim što ni to nije baš u redu.
Only he doesn't want her that much.	Samo da je ne želi toliko.
He knows who he is.	On zna ko je on.
That would be .	To bi bilo .
And this is happening.	I ovo se dešava.
You're not that bad.	Nisi tako loš.
You don't have to work for it.	Ne morate raditi za to.
We need to get the money.	Moramo dobiti novac.
It has to be done.	To se mora uraditi.
He was safe.	Bio je siguran.
This works really well.	Ovo radi jako dobro.
I would like to.	Volio bih.
He never will.	Nikad neće.
Enough of that.	Dosta toga.
It's okay now.	Sada je u redu.
It's for nothing.	Nije ni za šta.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
I see what you're doing.	Vidim šta radiš.
Maybe it's better.	Možda je bolje.
But that's what he did.	Ali to je ono što je uradio.
Maybe not.	Možda neće.
It was simple.	To je bilo jednostavno.
How right they were.	Kako su bili u pravu.
Yes even more.	Da još više.
He knows that too.	Zna i to.
There were many of them.	Bilo ih je mnogo.
I got what you asked for.	Dobio sam šta si tražio.
I didn't mean to tell you.	Nisam htela da ti kažem.
It must be true.	Mora biti istina.
I certainly never have.	Ja sigurno nikad nisam.
He is a man of power.	On je čovjek od moći.
There should be a lot of them.	Trebalo bi da ih ima dosta.
But you have to go.	Ali moraš otići.
It certainly wasn't that bad.	Sigurno nije bilo tako loše.
I'm a little busy.	Malo sam zauzet.
, i.	, i.
Just do it.	Samo to uradi.
I would like to tell myself that this can never happen.	Voleo bih da kažem sebi da se to nikada ne može dogoditi.
You know it was good.	Znaš da je bilo dobro.
That was a few years ago.	To je bilo prije nekoliko godina.
He is so good.	On je tako dobar.
He heard more than he saw.	Više je čuo nego vidio.
We are in it.	Mi smo u tome.
He loved him, you know.	Voleo ga je, znaš.
Is there anyone who can, please?	Ima li neko ko može, molim vas?
Which was a very long time.	Što je bilo jako dugo.
In a little while.	Za malo.
Do it the way you want.	Uradite to na način na koji želite.
He talks about nothing but himself.	On ne govori ni o čemu osim o sebi.
But he never came.	Ali nikada nije došao.
Besides, there was money.	Osim toga, tu je bio novac.
It was just.	Bilo je samo.
I've said that before.	Rekao sam to ranije.
He was safe for today.	Bio je siguran za danas.
Not even for you.	Čak ni za tebe.
When exactly did he arrive?	Kada je tačno stigao?
Maybe he'll see them soon.	Možda će ih uskoro vidjeti.
He never wants that.	On to nikada ne želi.
It always will be.	Uvek će biti.
When we have more, it is never enough.	Kada imamo više, nikada nije dovoljno.
But you have to stay here.	Ali moraš ostati ovdje.
He was almost there.	Bio je skoro tamo.
He already knows that.	On to već zna.
I don't like this.	Ne sviđa mi se ovo.
Not a bad job.	Nije loš posao.
I decided not to.	Odlučio sam da neću.
I'm not sure.	Nisam siguran.
I said this.	Rekao sam ovo.
I need to know that he really always loved me.	Moram da znam da me je zaista uvek voleo.
We should talk.	Trebali bi razgovarati.
Not just for me but for you.	Ne samo za mene nego i za tebe.
We couldn't this time.	Ovaj put nismo mogli.
I feel sorry for you.	Žao mi je zbog tebe.
Bad.	Loše.
No one ever knew why it happened.	Niko nikada nije znao zašto se to dogodilo.
How can anyone be sure of that?	Kako neko može biti siguran u to?
Or so and more.	Ili tako i više.
That was true.	To je bilo tačno.
I'm sure of this.	Siguran sam u ovo.
And that, he thought, was exactly what he wanted.	A to je, mislio je, upravo ono što je želio.
who did this	ko je ovo uradio?
I never knew why.	Nikad nisam znao zašto.
I'm sorry.	Žao mi je.
It was all probably true.	Sve je to vjerovatno bila istina.
What do you say.	Šta kažeš.
That would never happen.	To se nikada ne bi dogodilo.
She was him.	Ona je bio on.
Not really, no.	Ne baš, ne.
It doesn't seem like it.	Ne izgleda tako.
I know it's bad for me.	Znam da je loše za mene.
I can't say how it was.	Ne mogu reći kako je bilo.
She said it herself.	Ona je to sama rekla.
If it's nothing, it's nothing.	Ako nije ništa, nije ništa.
But that will not happen.	Ali to se neće dogoditi.
This was hard for me.	Ovo mi je bilo teško.
I just love it.	Samo volim to.
She didn't know what to do.	Nije znala šta da radi.
He must be told he is there.	Mora mu se reći da je tamo.
I'm sure she wouldn't either.	Siguran sam da ne bi ni ona.
But he knew who she was.	Ali on je znao ko je ona.
I just have to tell you.	Samo ti moram reći.
Now, very much.	Sada, veoma.
And you know what she looks like.	I znaš kako ona izgleda.
He said nothing but that.	Nije rekao ništa osim toga.
It still exists.	Još uvek postoji.
You don't want anything to do with him.	Ne želiš ništa s njim.
And I never even knew that.	I nikad to nisam ni znao.
But today is not a good day.	Ali danas nije dobar dan.
That it's wrong.	Da nije u redu.
Everything happened by itself.	Sve se dogodilo samo od sebe.
This looks good to me.	Ovo mi izgleda dobro.
I didn't want to.	Nisam htela.
We'll find him.	Naći ćemo ga.
We cannot say them better than we can do them.	Ne možemo ih reći bolje nego što ih možemo učiniti.
Or anything, really.	Ili bilo šta, zaista.
If you haven’t, you still shouldn’t.	Ako niste, još uvijek ne biste trebali.
Nothing was a problem.	Ništa nije bilo problem.
We like that.	To nam se sviđa.
I think he sees it better.	Mislim da on to bolje vidi.
We'll find him.	Naći ćemo ga.
She goes together.	Ona ide zajedno.
It looks much better.	Izgleda mnogo bolje.
But it was still pretty good.	Ali i dalje je bilo prilično dobro.
He can't do that.	On to ne može učiniti.
He does the work for you.	On radi posao za vas.
And he asked you what you were doing.	I pitao te šta radiš.
They were here now.	Sada su bili ovdje.
I heard.	Čuo sam.
I have to tell you.	Moram ti reći.
It's just who you are.	To je samo ko si.
She said she hoped he would get better soon.	Rekla je da se nada da će mu uskoro biti bolje.
I mean, it was a story.	Mislim, bilo je priča.
It's a little good.	Malo je dobro.
We have so much to do together.	Toliko toga moramo uraditi zajedno.
Real work.	Pravi posao.
He never did anything to us.	Nikada nam ništa nije uradio.
This is just to get someone started.	Ovo je samo da bi neko počeo.
I wondered how she got it.	Pitao sam se kako to ona ima.
Everything should be fine now.	Sada bi sve trebalo biti u redu.
We could work here.	Mogli bismo raditi ovdje.
Is that you? 	Jesi li to ti?
But this is not happening.	Ali ovo se ne dešava.
We got it.	Imamo to.
That was where help was needed.	Tu je trebalo pomoći.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
He is the one he really loves.	On je ona koju on zaista voli.
I really don't know.	Zaista ne znam.
This can be good and bad.	Ovo može biti dobro i loše.
I do not need.	Ne treba mi.
It can be anyone.	To može biti bilo ko.
He didn't want to see it.	On to nije želio vidjeti.
I don't know your life.	Ne znam tvoj život.
And simply, it was really hard.	I jednostavno, bilo je zaista teško.
There will certainly be problems.	Sigurno će biti problema.
I really tried.	Zaista sam pokušao.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
We are here.	Ovde smo.
When this is not, it is not.	Kad ovo nije, to nije.
Tell the truth.	Reci istinu.
And now it works.	I sada radi.
Tell me this.	Reci mi ovo.
Not here.	Ne ovde.
You are nothing to me.	Ti mi nisi ništa.
In fact, there was no one.	U stvari, nije bilo nikoga.
That's what really happened.	To se u stvari i dogodilo.
But they didn't do that.	Ali oni to nisu uradili.
We need to be together again.	Moramo ponovo biti zajedno.
It wasn't much.	Nije bilo puno.
I never asked.	Nikada nisam pitao.
But we still don’t know how to do it.	Ali još uvijek ne znamo kako to učiniti.
I mean it.	Mislim to.
I want to say.	Želim reći.
But he didn't come back.	Ali nije se vratio.
Now he could do a little more.	Sada je mogao učiniti malo više.
Us, you and me.	Nas, ti i ja.
I have to go first.	Moram prvi.
We couldn't do that.	To nismo mogli.
It could be.	To bi moglo biti.
You don't have to do anything.	Ne moraš ništa da radiš.
Now they never will.	Sada nikad neće.
And the man left.	I čovjek je otišao.
He just thought it was.	Samo je mislio da jeste.
We need more money.	Treba nam više novca.
Not like him.	Ne kao on.
That year.	Te godine.
We knew we were doing the right thing.	Znali smo da radimo pravu stvar.
It's not my truth.	Nije moja istina.
Your father is back?	Tvoj otac se vratio?
I know so much.	Toliko znam.
We can do it our way.	Možemo to učiniti na svoj način.
And that tomorrow.	I to sutra.
You can stay there.	Možete ostati tamo.
I don't like this.	Ne volim ovo.
I thought it was you.	Mislio sam da si to ti.
He still was.	I dalje je bio.
That would be a good thing.	To bi bila dobra stvar.
Not that way.	Ne na taj način.
I think it could be more than that.	Mislim da može biti više od toga.
Sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga.
From ????????? 	Od ?????????
I'm not your father.	Ja nisam tvoj otac.
I've done it so many times.	Uradio sam to toliko puta.
It just works.	To jednostavno radi.
He knew what had to be done.	Znao je šta mora da se uradi.
Life goes on .	Život ide dalje .
I think that's how it should be done.	Mislim da tako treba da se radi.
And it actually has been for a while.	I zapravo je već neko vrijeme.
That was the thing to do.	To je bila stvar koju treba uraditi.
That's me.	Da, to sam ja.
I went alone.	Otišao sam sam.
This one wasn't good.	Ovaj nije bio dobar.
Who knows why.	Ko zna zašto.
Now there is none.	Sada nema.
Good times, good times.	Dobra vremena, dobra vremena.
But they could not stay.	Ali nisu mogli ostati.
And you are absolutely right.	I potpuno ste u pravu.
Don't tell anyone about us.	Ne govori nikome o nama.
You are not right.	Nisi u pravu.
Everything happened very quickly.	Sve se dogodilo veoma brzo.
It's not safe, but it's better.	To nije sigurno, ali bolje.
You do your job.	Vi radite svoj posao.
I do not know what to do.	Ne znam šta da radim.
He does a good job.	On radi dobar posao.
That would be just for.	To bi bilo samo za.
I don't love myself.	Ne volim sebe.
But she doesn't speak either.	Ali ni ona ne govori.
But no, it doesn't exist.	Ali ne, ne postoji.
Very little is known about it.	O tome se vrlo malo zna.
It was hard to say.	Bilo je teško reći.
There are not many of them.	Nema ih mnogo.
It all took time.	Za sve je to trebalo vremena.
I didn't want to.	Nisam htela.
Sam got the money.	Sam je došao do novca.
He knows too much.	On zna previše.
Obviously, you can tell us more about that.	Očigledno, možete nam reći nešto više o tome.
It's just a problem.	To je samo problem.
He was there.	Bio je tamo.
I was expecting	Očekivao sam
I'm here for you too.	Tu sam i za tebe.
So no one will.	Tako da niko neće.
This is not my life.	Ovo nije moj život.
But he did it.	Ali on je to uradio.
No problem with that.	Nema problema s tim.
He must know.	Mora da zna.
But we have to.	Ali moramo.
I'm too busy to go.	Previše sam zauzet da idem.
I just wanted to make sure it was there.	Samo sam htio biti siguran da je to tamo.
He didn't know when it was enough.	Nije znao kada je dovoljno.
To be or not to be.	Biti ili ne biti.
She knew it was true.	Znala je da je to istina.
We've been there a long time.	Bili smo tamo dugo vremena.
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
He wouldn't like it.	Ne bi volio.
I knew what you wanted.	Znao sam šta želiš.
It can't but be.	Ne može a da ne bude.
And maybe there was more.	A možda je bilo i više.
He's still here.	On je još uvijek ovdje.
I never thought he would do something like that.	Nikada nisam mislio da će tako nešto uraditi.
I didn't even know she was still there.	Nisam ni znao da je još uvijek tu.
I just thought you might know.	Samo sam mislio da možda znaš.
You can work where you want and when you want.	Možete raditi gdje želite i kada želite.
These are the times that are real life for me.	Ovo su vremena koja su za mene pravi život.
And you know it.	I ti to znaš.
I'm tired.	Umoran sam.
He saw us, he saw something.	Video nas je, video nešto.
You can come.	Možeš doći.
She loves you.	Ona te voli.
Something seems to be waiting.	Čini se da nešto čeka.
But before that, nothing.	Ali prije toga ništa.
Nobody did anything.	Niko ništa nije uradio.
She looks really good.	Ona izgleda stvarno dobro.
Nobody goes there.	Tamo niko ne ide.
Nothing happened last week.	Prošle sedmice se ništa nije dogodilo.
It just tells us yes and.	To nam samo govori da i.
She knew how it felt.	Znala je kako se to osjeća.
Maybe there is.	Možda postoji.
He was glad of that.	To mu je bilo drago.
It's true.	To je istina.
I needed you there.	Trebao si mi tamo.
I don't.	Ja ne.
I'm better.	Bolje mi je.
But it seems so to me.	Ali tako mi se čini.
It's just, there you are.	Samo, tu si.
Maybe that's not true.	Možda to nije istina.
Something really, really, really bad.	Nešto stvarno, stvarno, jako loše.
He wouldn't want to live.	Ne bi želio da živi.
There is no one there.	Tamo nema nikoga.
And now you.	A sada ti.
They had it.	Imali su ga.
He himself never had it.	On sam ga nikada nije imao.
We can do our best.	Možemo dati sve od sebe.
She told him that.	To mu je rekla.
It was really good.	Bilo je stvarno dobro.
You can too.	Možeš i ti.
I don't know how you could ever leave.	Ne znam kako si ikada mogao otići.
He never was and never will be.	Nikada nije bio i nikada neće biti.
I said.	Ja sam rekao.
He promised to do his best.	Obećao je da će dati sve od sebe.
It's true.	To je tačno.
He will leave.	On će otići.
But I can.	Ali mogu.
She certainly doesn't know herself.	Ona sigurno ne zna ni sama.
So very, very true.	Tako vrlo, veoma tačno.
There were a lot of them.	Bilo ih je dosta.
We are a good team.	Mi smo dobar tim.
Someone should have known how old he was.	To je trebao znati neko koliko on ima godina.
They just weren't there.	Oni jednostavno nisu bili tamo.
She has her own way of doing it.	Ona ima svoj način na koji to radi.
I'm sorry.	Žao mi je.
Like, a lot.	Kao, puno.
We will go alone.	Ići ćemo sami.
Don't make me sick.	Nemoj da mi bude loše.
This may be okay for you.	Ovo ti može biti u redu.
A lot of people.	Puno ljudi.
No problem.	Nema problema.
I knew he was playing, but I never heard him.	Znao sam da svira, ali ga nikad nisam čuo.
I will find the right way.	Naći ću pravi put.
I hope it will.	Nadam se da hoće.
They don't know it exists.	Oni ne znaju da postoji.
She said she was alone this afternoon.	Danas popodne je rekla da je sama.
You are not them, and they are not you.	Vi niste oni, a oni nisu vi.
It's just a lot better.	Jednostavno je mnogo bolje.
I'm not him.	Ja nisam on.
So much.	Toliko mnogo.
.	.
He thinks of nothing but work.	Ne misli ni na šta osim na posao.
There is no time for that now.	Nema vremena za to sada.
You are good.	Dobro si.
It's not that easy.	To nije baš tako lako.
That was not the question.	To nije bilo pitanje.
Who were these people?	Ko su bili ti ljudi?
And this works.	I ovo radi.
The problem is obvious.	Problem je u tome očigledno.
She actually wanted to know.	Ona je zapravo htela da zna.
And we didn't.	I nismo.
What you think is true.	Ono što mislite je istina.
And they were, for a while.	I bili su, neko vrijeme.
You went home.	Otišao si kući.
There is still plenty of time.	Ima još dosta vremena.
It never is and never will be.	Nikad nije i nikada neće.
They are still human.	Oni su još uvek ljudi.
Unless you want to.	Osim ako ne želiš.
I just wanted to see.	Samo sam htela da vidim.
You can stay here if you want.	Možeš ostati ovdje ako želiš.
He thought it was something.	Mislio je da je nešto.
There was no idea.	Nije bilo pojma.
I did it three years ago.	Uradio sam to prije tri godine.
That is a good job.	To je dobar posao.
And it's pretty simple, really.	I prilično je jednostavno, zaista.
If so, fine.	Ako je tako, u redu.
Which is not!	Što nije!
That was my job.	To je bio moj posao.
No one had done that to him before.	Niko mu to ranije nije uradio.
Which he had already heard.	Što je već čuo.
You can never tell.	Nikad ne možeš reći.
I didn't want to do that now.	Nisam htela to sada da uradim.
It wasn't him.	To nije bio on.
I didn't like doing this.	Nisam volio ovo da radim.
I can't find my way.	Ne mogu naći svoj put.
In fact, you are the first.	Zapravo, ti si prvi.
For now, he'll just talk to me.	Za sada će razgovarati samo sa mnom.
life.	život.
Not much.	Nema puno toga.
But that could not have happened.	Ali to se nije moglo dogoditi.
The friend is absolutely right.	Prijatelj je potpuno u pravu.
We didn't really know what we were doing.	Nismo baš znali šta radimo.
I don't know who you are.	Ne znam ko si ti.
We were right.	Bili smo u pravu.
You're fine too.	I ti si dobro.
But it may not be as difficult as it seems.	Ali možda i nije tako teško kao što se čini.
Maybe too many times.	Možda previše puta.
And you are the first.	A ti si prvi.
If that's the question.	Ako je to pitanje.
Nobody really knows much about it.	Niko zapravo ne zna mnogo o tome.
This was three times too much.	Ovo je bilo tri puta previše.
This is not how it should be.	Ovo nije kako bi trebalo da bude.
You have to do what you have to.	Morate raditi ono što morate.
You are the father.	Ti si otac.
We don't know enough about what's going on.	Ne znamo dovoljno o tome šta se dešava.
I need it fast.	Treba mi brzo.
He knew so much to do.	Toliko je znao da uradi.
In fact, this may already be happening.	Zapravo, ovo se možda već dešava.
Nobody goes anymore.	Niko više ne ide.
To know really, very well.	Da znaju stvarno, jako dobro.
More than that, there are many.	Više od toga, ima ih mnogo.
But it shouldn't have been.	Ali nije trebalo da bude.
I was nothing and nobody.	Bio sam ništa i niko.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
They are not.	Oni nisu.
So good.	Tako dobro.
He was sure of this.	Bio je siguran u ovo.
It's not that simple.	Nije tako jednostavno.
She can't do that.	Ona to ne može.
He didn't know what to say.	Nije znao šta da kaže.
I just don't know what.	Samo ne znam šta.
You know they should be there for you.	Znate da bi oni trebali biti tu za vas.
Or I thought you were.	Ili sam mislio da jesi.
That would not be correct.	To ne bi bilo tačno.
I just didn't know.	Samo nisam znao.
And it's not.	I nije.
I still couldn't say what it was about.	Još uvijek nisam mogao reći o čemu se radi.
And she said we have to talk now.	I rekla je da sada moramo razgovarati.
There is no one here.	Ovde nema nikoga.
I'm sorry you're not sure.	Žao mi je što niste sigurni.
He just wants to work.	On samo želi da radi.
I do this at home.	Ja ovo radim kod kuće.
In fact, I didn’t ask him to do much.	Zapravo, nisam tražio od njega da uradi mnogo.
I have something to tell you.	Imam nešto da ti kažem.
That is the question.	To je pitanje.
He was gone this morning.	Jutros ga nije bilo.
That was my life.	To je bio moj život.
Indeed, there is none of that.	Zaista, nema ništa od toga.
You're welcome.	Nema na čemu.
What is true?	Šta je tačno?
But even that was not enough.	Ali ni to nije bilo dovoljno.
Did she just want to know.	Da li je samo htela da zna.
No one but me.	Niko osim mene.
He didn't have much to say.	Nije imao puno toga da kaže.
I was fine.	Dobro mi je bilo.
Currently my code has both.	Trenutno moj kod ima oboje.
My job is what happens next.	Moj posao je ono što se dalje dešava.
Something else is going on here.	Ovde se još nešto dešava.
She is no longer alive.	Ona više ne živi.
When it was.	Kad je bilo.
I could see it happening.	Mogao sam da vidim da se to dešava.
And it will probably stay that way for a while.	I vjerovatno će tako ostati još neko vrijeme.
It looks like a meeting.	Izgleda kao sastanak.
He needed a friend.	Trebao mu je prijatelj.
They are.	Oni su.
And it's now or never.	I to je sada ili nikad.
I've never had a friend like you.	Nikad nisam imao prijatelja kao ti.
It can, and it may never come.	Može, a možda nikada neće doći.
There must be something wrong.	Mora da tu nešto nije u redu.
She always does well.	Ona uvek radi dobro.
He had a lot of money and did nothing.	Imao je mnogo novca i ništa nije radio.
In fact, no one can.	U stvari, niko ne može.
We will never do that again.	Nikad to više nećemo učiniti.
We can be here.	Možemo biti ovdje.
It shouldn't be like that.	Ne bi trebalo da bude tako.
That would be bad for business.	To bi bilo loše za posao.
You don't have to know now.	Ne morate znati sada.
He can be both.	On može biti oboje.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
And she has it.	I ona ga ima.
But it doesn't work here.	Ali ovde ne radi.
Nobody told me that.	Niko mi to nije rekao.
It's just that.	To je jednostavno to.
But there is something else.	Ali postoji još nešto.
I don't ask her why.	Ne pitam je zašto.
We can go.	Možemo otići.
What does he see now?	Šta sada vidi?
I mean, it's not just me.	Mislim, nisam samo ja.
Certainly not.	Sigurno nije.
It was all true.	Sve je to bila istina.
I hope you come back soon.	Nadam se da ćeš se uskoro vratiti.
We only have today.	Imamo samo danas.
You didn't do anything to me.	Nisi mi ništa uradio.
I need to talk to you.	Moram razgovarati s tobom.
As it should be.	Kako treba.
I would know that anywhere.	Znao bih to bilo gdje.
I want it very much.	Želim to jako.
You were a friend.	Bio si prijatelj.
They knew about it.	Znali su za to.
Yes, sure.	Da, sigurno.
I needed someone.	Trebao sam nekoga.
I know what I see.	Znam šta vidim.
Looks like he doesn't love me either.	Izgleda da me ni on više ne voli.
But that is not going to happen here.	Ali to se ovdje neće dogoditi.
It doesn't work at all.	Uopšte ne radi.
That more money does not go to everyone.	To više novca ne ide svima.
So much.	Tako puno.
Nothing better to do.	Ništa bolje za uraditi.
Even when we are doing well, we can't really believe it.	Čak i kada nam ide dobro, ne možemo baš vjerovati.
But now he had something to do.	Ali sada je imao nešto što je mogao učiniti.
He wears it well.	Dobro ga nosi.
We have to go there.	Moramo ići tamo.
I don't know what she's going to do.	Ne znam šta će ona da uradi.
He never said what he planned to do.	Nikada nije rekao šta planira da uradi.
He said it himself.	On je to sam rekao.
But good.	Ali, dobro.
It's not what you think, he says.	Nije kao što mislite, kaže.
He would know.	Znao bi.
We won't find them again.	Nećemo ih ponovo naći.
And he.	I on.
But if it's not for you, that's fine too.	Ali ako nije za vas, i to je u redu.
I hope you will too.	Nadam se da ćeš i ti.
Never.	Nikad.
I don't think so.	Mislim ne baš.
I do not know what is happening.	Ne znam šta se dešava.
You need to talk to him.	Moraš razgovarati s njim.
I had no idea what to say.	Nisam imao pojma šta da kažem.
None of us said anything.	Niko od nas nije ništa rekao.
Obviously we really needed it.	Očigledno nam je to zaista trebalo.
I mean, you just look better.	Mislim, samo izgledaš bolje.
You have to trust me.	Moraš mi vjerovati.
But anything you can tell me could help.	Ali sve što mi možete reći moglo bi pomoći.
But that's the way it is.	Ali to je tako.
They will help us.	Oni će nam pomoći.
He did this now.	Ovo je sada uradio.
That was a few years ago.	To je bilo prije nekoliko godina.
And maybe she was right.	I možda je bila u pravu.
You can do it.	Možeš ti to.
She often did not want to play.	Često nije htela da se igra.
That day never came.	Taj dan nikad nije došao.
Everything we needed.	Sve što nam je trebalo.
She won't tell anyone.	Ona neće nikome reći.
We've known each other long enough.	Znamo se dovoljno dugo.
Not exactly.	Ne baš tako.
I can't even talk to you.	Ne mogu ni razgovarati s tobom.
Who knew you had so many.	Ko je znao da ih imaš toliko.
That's not what this is.	To nije ono što je ovo.
So far it has been very common.	Do sada je bilo vrlo obično.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Nije htio razgovarati sa mnom.
I'm here and you're there.	Ja sam ovde a ti si tamo.
I got it.	Shvatio sam to.
She didn't know how bad it was.	Nije znala koliko je loše.
It was hard, so hard.	Bilo je teško, tako teško.
I certainly don't.	Ja sigurno ne.
Let me ask you something.	Da te pitam nešto.
I thought he would be back by now.	Mislio sam da će se do sada vratiti.
I mean, that's fine.	Mislim, to je u redu.
Get back on track.	Vratiti na pravi put.
I'm not sure how much.	Nisam siguran koliko.
That was last month.	To je bilo prošlog mjeseca.
It doesn't have to be you or me anymore.	To više ne morate biti vi ili ja.
In fact, she may be the only one.	Zapravo, možda je i jedina.
Even at home.	Čak i kod kuće.
Maybe no one knew.	Možda niko nije znao.
He himself had another problem.	On sam je imao još jedan problem.
He obviously loved the job.	Očigledno je volio posao.
And that needed to be done quickly.	I to je trebalo brzo da se uradi.
You have to help me.	Moraš mi pomoći.
She wants me, not him.	Ona želi mene, a ne njega.
She has been alone for a very long time.	Ona je sama već jako dugo.
And it's not.	I nije.
It’s so good it can’t be real.	Toliko je dobro da ne može biti stvarno.
I doubt it was one of us.	Sumnjam da je to bio jedan od nas.
There seemed to be only one.	Činilo se da je samo jedan.
He doesn't do any of that.	On ne radi ništa od toga.
But something was wrong.	Ali nešto nije bilo u redu.
She didn't say anything.	Nije rekla ništa.
You say it for yourself.	Kažeš to za sebe.
But he didn't hear her.	Ali on je nije čuo.
I didn't hear anything he said.	Nisam čuo ništa što je rekao.
I wish I had one.	Voleo bih da imam jedan.
That could be a problem.	To bi mogao biti problem.
And heard a few stories.	I čuo nekoliko priča.
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
That is obviously not true.	To očigledno nije tačno.
I need that.	Treba mi to.
That year.	Te godine.
That will not happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
The problem is it doesn't work.	Problem je što ne radi.
I'm not sure how he did it.	Nisam siguran kako je to uradio.
I lost a friend.	Izgubio sam prijatelja.
I don't think he just knew what to do.	Mislim da jednostavno nije znao šta da radi.
We've never been here before.	Nikad prije nismo bili ovdje.
He had to go there.	Morao je da ode tamo.
Even one life is too many.	Čak i jedan život je previše.
Yes, for quite some time.	Da, prilično dugo.
But yes, if it's an idea.	Ali da, ako je ideja.
It could be so bad.	Moglo bi biti tako loše.
It's none of those things.	Nije ništa od toga.
I would do anything for you.	Sve bih uradio za tebe.
It was my first.	Bio je to moj prvi.
We will now.	Sada ćemo.
She is very	Ona je veoma.
And they didn't.	I nisu.
It could be any of us.	To bi mogao biti bilo ko od nas.
I should be fine.	Trebalo bi da budem dobro.
So how are you .	I kako si .
Just this one.	Samo ovaj.
We just need more.	Samo nas treba više.
he asked.	pitao.
I know better.	Znam bolje.
She knew it, even if he didn't.	Ona je to znala, čak i ako on nije.
We are safe here.	Ovdje smo sigurni.
Now he doesn't want it at all.	Sada to uopšte ne želi.
There for a long time.	Tamo dugo vremena.
I already tried.	Već sam pokušao.
But here's the problem.	Ali ovdje je problem.
You know you want to!.	Znaš da želiš!.
All we have to do is work well together.	Sve što treba da uradimo je da dobro radimo zajedno.
I was not feeling well.	Nije mi bilo dobro.
They are no longer here.	Oni više nisu ovdje.
We know what it's like.	Znamo kako je to.
But they know it.	Ali oni to znaju.
I can't say why.	Ne mogu reći zašto.
It's here.	Tu je.
I saw him before, many years ago.	Vidio sam ga prije, prije mnogo godina.
Maybe we never did.	Možda nikada nismo.
He loves school.	On voli školu.
You brought me back to life.	Vratio si me u život.
I'll give them now.	Sada ću ih dati.
I can not believe.	Ne mogu vjerovati.
You should do it when you can.	Trebao bi to da uradiš kad možeš.
Maybe he really didn't want to know.	Možda on zaista nije želeo da zna.
He can't believe it's me.	Ne može vjerovati da sam to ja.
We needed better.	Trebali smo bolje.
I couldn't work.	Nisam mogao da radim.
It shouldn't be like that.	Ne bi trebalo da bude tako.
He won't know how to proceed.	Neće znati kako dalje.
We couldn't do this anymore.	Ovo više nismo mogli.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
That's how money worked.	Tako je novac radio.
But that was not true.	Ali to nije bila istina.
That's really bad.	To je stvarno loše.
Like everything you want.	Kao i sve što želiš.
They are you.	Oni su ti.
She didn't know the truth.	Nije znala istinu.
I didn't get everything.	Nisam sve dobio.
There you are.	Tu si.
I have no idea where we are.	Nemam pojma gdje smo.
And you're better off.	I bolje ti je.
And people were.	I ljudi su bili.
But there are not enough of us.	Ali nema nas dovoljno.
I have to go soon.	Moram da idem uskoro.
Maybe you won't be.	Možda nećeš biti.
I have to be good.	Moram biti dobar.
He wanted to.	Želeo je.
But not fast enough.	Ali ne dovoljno brzo.
He just.	On samo.
You just want something more.	Samo želiš nešto više.
I was gone.	Nije me više bilo.
They are gone.	Nema ih više.
He asked if you might have time for him today.	Pitao je da li možda danas imaš vremena za njega.
I know things.	Znam stvari.
No, it's not good enough.	Ne, nije dovoljno dobro.
I'm glad you're both.	Drago mi je da ste oboje.
He knew it better than himself.	Znao je to bolje od sebe.
More than enough.	Više nego dovoljno.
You're doing what you're supposed to.	Radiš ono što bi trebao.
And you want what he wants.	A ti želiš ono što on želi.
He knows that.	On to zna.
He shouldn't have.	Nije trebao.
Now is the time.	Sada je vrijeme.
We have to.	Moramo.
It's all over.	Sve je završio.
It's already there, always.	Već je tu, uvek.
No, so fast.	Ne, tako brzo.
In fact, that was not true.	Zapravo, to nije bila istina.
There were a lot of people.	Bilo je puno ljudi.
I was ready for it.	Bio sam spreman za to.
Everyone there knows her.	Tamo je svi znaju.
She knows she's not the only one.	Ona zna da nije jedina.
Nobody knows what to say.	Niko ne zna šta da kaže.
I thought so too.	I ja sam tako mislio.
You don't need this.	Ne treba ti ovo.
I didn't need it.	Nije mi trebalo.
Really hard time, actually.	Zaista teško vrijeme, zapravo.
He thought he had been there for some time.	Mislio je da je tamo već neko vrijeme.
It still wasn't enough.	I dalje nije bilo dovoljno.
I bought a new car today.	Danas sam kupio novi auto.
It seemed too easy.	Činilo se previše lako.
How did he get this job?	Kako je dobio ovaj posao?
I've never seen him, you know.	Nikad ga nisam vidio, znaš.
He can't allow that.	On to ne može dozvoliti.
Have fun while you can.	Zabavi se dok možeš.
You can hardly believe it.	Teško možete vjerovati.
There wasn't much to it.	Nije bilo mnogo u tome.
There was no time.	Nije bilo vrijeme.
He couldn't work.	Nije mogao da radi.
That is the true path to power.	To je pravi put do moći.
I did well too.	I ja sam dobro uradio.
Please just see me.	Molim te samo me vidi.
That's just it.	To je samo to.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
But, he said, there was more.	Ali, rekao je, bilo je više.
We are not like you.	Mi nismo kao vi.
I know how bad it is now.	Znam koliko je loše sada.
But he didn't want to believe it.	Ali nije htio vjerovati u to.
And something is happening.	I nešto se dešava.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
She was alone.	Bila je sama.
But that doesn't have to be the case.	Ali to ne mora biti tako.
You know that can't happen.	Znaš da se to ne može dogoditi.
Maybe not right away, but soon.	Možda ne odmah, ali uskoro.
I know what is true.	Znam šta je istina.
You have to do both.	Morate uraditi oboje.
There were problems.	Bilo je problema.
That was her, too.	To je bila i ona.
He wondered how many more awaited them.	Pitao se koliko ih još čeka.
And not just here.	I ne samo ovdje.
It would seem that it does not work.	Činilo bi se da to ne radi.
It was really good.	Bilo je stvarno dobro.
He never told the truth.	Nikad nije rekao istinu.
But it won't get any better.	Ali neće biti bolje.
Maybe you would too.	Možda bi i ti.
There is another.	Postoji još jedan.
There is nothing to come.	Nema šta da dođe.
This is a difficult question.	Ovo je teško pitanje.
He was quite surprised.	Bio je prilično iznenađen.
I like that.	Sviđa mi se to.
Do nothing for a few days.	Ne radite ništa, nekoliko dana.
The more the better.	Što je više to bolje.
I love everything at home.	Volim sve kod kuće.
I have a job for you.	Imam posao za tebe.
He had nothing to say.	Nije imao šta da kaže.
But it is something.	Ali to je nešto.
And he does it.	I radi to.
But he was a good person.	Ali on je bio dobra osoba.
Nothing bad.	Ništa loše.
It didn't look good to me.	Nije mi izgledao dobro.
There is only this.	Ima samo ovo.
I think that was it.	Mislim da je to bilo.
This is simply not the case.	Ovo jednostavno nije tako.
But now we are together.	Ali sada smo zajedno.
Nothing.	Ništa.
He was first in line.	Bio je prvi u redu.
I couldn't do it.	Nisam mogao to da uradim.
You can't be much better than that.	Ne možeš biti mnogo bolji od toga.
That's better.	To je bolje.
Now and now and now, what is really here.	Sada i sada i sada, šta je zapravo ovdje.
There is only one problem.	Postoji samo jedan problem.
And he left.	I otišao.
Not too much.	Ne previše.
I didn't think anything about it.	Nisam mislio ništa o tome.
Will you come with me?	Hoćeš li sa mnom?
They had time.	Imali su vremena.
And maybe never.	A možda nikad.
How fast can you leave?	Koliko brzo možeš otići?
I was on my own again.	Ponovo sam bio svoj.
So even that is a good thing.	Tako da je čak i to dobra stvar.
But there is nothing we can do.	Ali ne možemo ništa učiniti.
Nobody likes to be told what to do.	Niko ne voli da mu se govori šta da radi.
You don't need to do anything else.	Ne morate ništa više da radite.
I like this one much more.	Ovaj mi se mnogo više sviđa.
You have to believe me in that.	Morate mi vjerovati u to.
Not yet.	Ne još.
This is the one who says yes, and he says no.	Ovo je ona koja kaže da, a on kaže ne.
I don't see him.	Ne vidim ga.
You can't believe what he says.	Ne možete vjerovati šta kaže.
But she says nothing.	Ali ona ne govori ništa.
One too.	Jedan previše.
He's not quite right.	Nije baš u pravu.
Not the way we needed him.	Ne na način na koji nam je trebao.
Maybe he had had enough of me.	Možda mu je bilo dosta od mene.
In fact, you should do it now.	U stvari, trebalo bi to da uradite sada.
It wasn't instantaneous.	Nije bilo trenutno.
It was all too true.	Sve je to bilo previše tačno.
No it didn't work.	Ne nije radio.
It was my life.	Bio je to moj život.
That won't help.	To neće pomoći.
This was really too easy.	Ovo je zaista bilo previše lako.
I think he expected that.	Mislim da je to očekivao.
Today everyone needs a car!	Danas svima treba auto!
It's not that easy.	Nije tako lako.
We can't stay here.	Ne možemo ostati ovdje.
You never saw me.	Nikada me nisi video.
But she was more than that.	Ali ona je bila više od toga.
It is still waiting.	Još se čeka na to.
Yes, you're just the man for it.	Da, ti si samo čovjek za to.
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to istina.
It just doesn't work.	To jednostavno ne radi.
This can be done for quite a long time.	To se može raditi prilično dugo.
But maybe it was enough.	Ali možda je bilo dovoljno.
If he could see.	Da je mogao da vidi.
There was another man there.	Tamo je bio još jedan čovjek.
But there are none.	Ali nema ih.
I think that is correct.	Mislim da je to tačno.
Don't tell anyone what's really going on.	Ne govori nikome šta se zaista dešava.
He does it to everyone.	On to radi svima.
It works for me !.	Radi za mene!.
You should trust me.	Trebao bi mi vjerovati.
But there is something else.	Ali tu je još nešto.
That may not be true!	To ne može biti tačno!
I wish you were here.	Volio bih da si tu.
It's hard to say.	Teško je reći.
But not today.	Ali ne danas.
Everyone knows what it looks like.	Svi znaju kako to izgleda.
Not a single team.	Ni jedan tim.
He understood why they didn't.	Shvatio je zašto nisu.
Obviously not.	Očigledno nisu.
That's what you do.	To je ono što radiš.
You can’t bring it back, even if you could.	Ne možete ga vratiti, čak i kad biste mogli.
I love it so much.	Toliko volim.
Yes, and it must.	Da, i mora.
I am a person.	Ja sam osoba.
If you can.	Ako može.
I'm still in it.	I dalje sam u tome.
He told me no.	Rekao mi je ne.
It was just a job.	Bio je to samo posao.
The problem is that they never are.	Problem je što nikada nisu.
Now he knew what it was.	Sada je znao šta je to.
There was nothing, really.	Nije bilo ništa, zaista.
Yes it was.	Da je bilo.
But now we have to work too hard.	Ali sada moramo previše raditi.
And you're right.	I u pravu si.
I would love to do it again.	Voleo bih to da uradim ponovo.
He wasn't happy, but he didn't say anything.	Nije bio sretan, ali nije rekao ništa.
I've never heard of it.	Nikad nisam čuo za to.
No one knows but us.	Niko ne zna osim nas.
It was probably hard for everyone.	Vjerovatno je svima bilo teško.
Do not do that to me.	Ne radi mi to.
And I think what he said is actually what he really feels.	I mislim da je ono što je rekao zapravo ono što se zaista osjeća.
But that's not true.	Ali to nije tačno.
He wasn't ready, he wasn't ready.	Nije bio spreman, nije bio spreman.
Just last year, it was.	Samo prošle godine, bilo je.
Maybe a lot of things.	Možda puno stvari.
I know exactly.	Znam tačno.
I love them a lot.	Mnogo ih volim.
He had something to say about this.	Imao je nešto da kaže za ovo.
I shouldn't have come to work today.	Nisam trebao doći na posao danas.
It is the only life there is.	To je jedini život koji postoji.
He knows what she's going to say before she says it.	On zna šta će ona reći prije nego što to kaže.
We do it a lot.	Mi to radimo puno.
I'm not saying anything bad happened to him.	Ne kažem da mu se ništa loše dogodilo.
This may or may not be true.	Ovo može biti istina, a možda i nije.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda ne.
I think the story may have been a little too much.	Mislim da je priča možda bila malo previše.
I don't really like it.	Ne sviđa mi se baš.
Except he didn't say that.	Osim što to nije rekao.
I wonder what he needs so much?	Pitam se šta mu toliko treba?
And it was.	I bilo je.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
I just wanted to say.	Samo sam želio reći.
I told you that earlier.	Rekao sam ti to ranije.
Behind me.	I za mene.
I knew better.	Znao sam bolje.
You are my only true friend.	Ti si moj jedini pravi prijatelj.
Tomorrow on time.	Sutra na vrijeme.
Maybe it's not so bad.	Možda to i nije tako loše.
And maybe not.	A možda i nije.
You know she told us the truth.	Znate da nam je rekla istinu.
That's something to see.	To je nešto za vidjeti.
It's true.	To je istina.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
Nothing could be better than that.	Ništa ne može biti bolje od toga.
In fact, it is.	U stvari, jeste.
That was bad.	To je bilo loše.
What are you going.	Šta ćeš.
It's not that.	Nije to.
That's what they are for, so to speak.	Oni su zbog toga, kako bi rekli.
But you can't stay that way.	Ali to ne možete ostati.
But she was.	Ali ona je bila.
Like today.	Kao i danas.
I love being me.	Volim biti ja.
You can’t beat time or years.	Ne možete pobijediti vrijeme ili godine.
Today was that day.	Danas je bio taj dan.
Obviously, there is a lot to talk about.	Očigledno, ima mnogo toga o čemu se može razgovarati.
He arrived on time.	Došao je na vrijeme.
I shouldn't have said anything.	Nisam trebao ništa reći.
I was everything to him.	Bio sam mu sve.
But we didn't know that.	Ali mi to nismo znali.
That's none of my business.	To nije moja stvar.
Maybe there is.	Možda postoji.
He will stay here, with me.	On će ostati ovde, sa mnom.
You can't do anything.	Ne možeš ništa.
I knew he would.	Znao sam da hoće.
Very good of him.	Vrlo dobro od njega.
It's not all right.	Nije sve u redu.
But he should be happy to see her.	Ali trebao bi biti sretan što je vidi.
He's working on it.	Radi na tome.
But it's not good.	Ali nije dobro.
They were because of me.	Zbog mene su bili.
I didn't.	Nisam.
Maybe he never would be.	Možda nikada ne bi bio.
It's bad.	Loše je.
Not even for me, really.	Nije čak ni za mene, zaista.
Bad for him.	Loše za njega.
I hope it's just me.	Nadam se da sam to samo ja.
He looked so good.	Tako je dobro izgledao.
I know he's right.	Znam da je u pravu.
There were enough of them.	Dosta ih je bilo.
So here too.	Tako i ovdje.
It's not easy for me now.	Sada mi nije lako.
She really knows how to drive.	Ona zaista zna da vozi.
There's money.	Tu je novac.
Probably more.	Vjerovatno više.
I need to talk to him.	Moram razgovarati s njim.
You probably will too.	Vjerovatno ćeš i ti.
He said it should be this.	Rekao je da bi trebalo biti ovo.
But that is not entirely true.	Ali to nije potpuno tačno.
That never happened to me.	To mi se nikada nije dogodilo.
Besides, you never do what you're told.	Osim toga, nikad ne radiš ono što ti se kaže.
This tells me it can be done.	Ovo mi govori da se to može uraditi.
That's how it was supposed to be.	Tako je trebalo biti.
We were only a few years old.	Imali smo samo nekoliko godina.
Everyone he loved.	Svi koje je volio.
But that does not exist.	Ali to ne postoji.
It never was.	Nikada nije bilo.
But you didn't say.	Ali nisi rekao.
I wouldn't want to.	Ne bih htela.
I never bought it for you.	Nikad je nisam kupio za tebe.
No one has ever seen that.	Niko to nikada nije video.
I looked like him.	Izgledao sam kao on.
He wasn't actually there.	Zapravo nije bio tamo.
It's just money.	To je samo novac.
He will go to school.	Ići će u školu.
I want you to know that.	Želim da to znaš.
Don't tell anyone who told you.	Ne govori nikome ko ti je rekao.
Nobody loves her.	Niko je ne voli.
It's all you.	To si sve ti.
There was so much she didn't know.	Bilo je toliko toga što nije znala.
He knows it won't be easy.	Zna da neće biti lako.
I love it.	Volim to.
We can't say anything.	Ne možemo ništa reći.
If you know what you're doing and why, that's fine.	Ako znate šta radite i zašto, u redu je.
He needed money.	Trebao mu je novac.
He had a job now, a real one.	Sada je imao posao, pravi.
You shouldn't.	Ne bi trebali.
He has to do everything himself.	Mora sve sam da uradi.
I see it now.	Vidim to sada.
That's how he worked.	Tako je radio.
They were just there.	Samo su bili tamo.
But he was sure.	Ali bio je siguran.
I think that's it.	Mislim da je to to.
We can never.	Nikada ne možemo.
That might have been the first time.	To je možda bilo prvi put.
And they are right.	I u pravu su.
They knew what he had done.	Znali su šta je uradio.
I have no time.	Nemam vremena.
That's what you have to do.	To je ono što moraš da uradiš.
It's actually one.	To je zapravo jedan.
What more.	Što više.
That should be safe enough.	To bi trebalo biti dovoljno sigurno.
Only you can do that.	Samo ti to možeš.
But not here or now.	Ali ne ovdje ili sada.
They won't find him.	Neće ga naći.
I don't see it.	Ja to ne vidim.
Very good indeed.	Veoma dobro zaista.
But that was fine.	Ali to je bilo u redu.
The problem is that they are not.	Problem je što nisu.
No one has ever done that.	To niko nikada nije uradio.
But no, he was sorry.	Ali ne, bilo mu je žao.
He didn't seem to understand that.	Činilo se da to nije shvatio.
It should not exist.	Ne bi trebalo da postoji.
Even if that were true, it wouldn't help much.	Čak i da je to tačno, neće mnogo pomoći.
You can stay at home with us.	Možete ostati kod kuće sa nama.
Good day?	Dobar dan?
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
No one could have already been there at that time.	Niko nije mogao već biti tamo u to vrijeme.
Maybe he didn't hear her well.	Možda je nije dobro čuo.
Who said what.	Ko je šta rekao.
We were here.	Bili smo ovdje.
Life is very, very good !.	Život je veoma, veoma dobar!.
He wouldn't have anything now.	Sada ne bi imao ništa.
She was right.	Bila je u pravu.
It just looks good.	Samo izgleda dobro.
Neither can I.	Ne mogu ni ja.
I know what you need.	Znam šta ti treba.
There are so many of them.	Ima ih toliko.
Probably he did.	Vjerovatno i on jeste.
I'm not like anyone here.	Ja nisam kao niko ovde.
And you are.	A ti si.
I lost money.	Izgubio sam novac.
That simply cannot be true.	To jednostavno ne može biti istina.
The man was not happy.	Čovjek nije bio sretan.
I want you to tell me everything.	Želim da mi sve kažeš.
We needed that from him.	To nam je trebalo od njega.
This was for me.	Ovo je bilo za mene.
He would come.	Doći bi.
I want to say that we know what to do.	Želim da kažem da znamo šta da radimo.
I do that too.	I ja to radim.
I just couldn't believe it.	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati.
I will not buy a new car.	Neću kupiti novi auto.
You have to tell the truth.	Moraš reći istinu.
He knows it's not.	On zna da nije.
Live a better life.	Živi bolji život.
No, that couldn't have happened.	Ne, to se nije moglo dogoditi.
Not even your life.	Čak ni tvoj život.
I thought, yes.	Mislio sam, da.
I'm back.	Vratio sam se.
It was a team, people.	To je bio tim, ljudi.
I'm pretty sure that's it.	Prilično sam siguran da je to to.
They did things to him.	Uradili su mu stvari.
Even if it is.	Čak i da jeste.
But that is not enough.	Ali to nije dovoljno.
There is something wrong.	Nešto tu nije u redu.
First time.	Prvi put.
He couldn't do it.	On to nije mogao učiniti.
That's not good for anyone.	To nije dobro ni za koga.
But do you know?	Ali, znate li?
It seemed as if she could see into him.	Činilo se kao da može vidjeti u njega.
I've never seen him before today.	Nikad ga prije danas nisam vidio.
But maybe that was a good thing.	Ali možda je to bilo dobro.
Can you give me.	Možete li mi dati.
This can be found here.	Ovo se može naći ovdje.
That's what you want.	To želiš.
Where it was supposed to be.	Gdje je trebalo biti.
Like.	Kao .
But it won't be so bad for you.	Ali neće biti tako loše za tebe.
It was hard, it was hard.	Bilo je teško, bilo je teško.
Please live a few more days.	Molim te, živi još nekoliko dana.
But it wasn't just that.	Ali nije bilo samo to.
That's not what I want.	To nije ono što želim.
Maybe he couldn't.	Možda nije mogao.
Maybe it's not as bad as it looks.	Možda nije tako loš kao što izgleda.
It was nothing.	To nije bilo ništa.
We are sorry.	Žao nam je.
See if this is still true.	Vidi da li je ovo još uvijek istina.
I told him the truth.	Rekao sam mu istinu.
It may not be so bad.	Možda neće biti tako loše.
I really think he meant what he said.	Zaista mislim da je mislio ono što je rekao.
No, that's not right.	Ne, to nije u redu.
That's a good idea, actually.	To je dobra ideja, zapravo.
Maybe everyone should be.	Možda bi svi trebali biti.
I have no problem with him.	Ja nemam problema sa njim.
It's like home.	To je kao kod kuće.
When he returned, he was not feeling well.	Kada se vratio nije mu bilo dobro.
Now there is a problem.	Sada postoji problem.
As it could be.	Kao što je i moglo biti.
It's much better now.	Sada je mnogo bolje.
There is no time now.	Sada nema vremena.
What is it.	O čemu se radi.
It would be like that here.	Ovdje bi bilo tako.
But that is not happening.	Ali to se ne dešava.
He's a really good guy.	On je stvarno dobar momak.
Something or someone.	Nešto ili neko.
I don't like that.	Ne sviđa mi se to.
I have no one to help me.	Nemam ko da mi pomogne.
That's it! 	To je to!
He doesn't see things well.	Ne vidi stvari dobro.
The game does it for you.	Igra to radi za vas.
I can handle that.	Mogu s tim.
I have to do something.	Moram nešto da uradim.
And so here.	I tako ovdje.
It was my first time there.	Bio je to moj prvi put tamo.
I don't know how she does it.	Ne znam kako ona to radi.
I i i.	I i i.
I didn't mean any of that.	Nisam mislio ništa od toga.
But no, you know, not very often.	Ali ne, znate, ne baš često.
But the man did not hear.	Ali čovjek nije čuo.
He knows something is wrong.	Zna da nešto nije u redu.
I loved working on it.	Volio sam raditi na tome.
This happened quite quickly.	Ovo se dogodilo prilično brzo.
And so on and so forth.	I tako dalje i tako dalje.
I should do it.	Trebao bih to učiniti.
It's just you and me now.	Sada smo samo ti i ja.
There was more.	Bilo je više.
But he didn't ask me about it.	Ali on me nije pitao o tome.
He is a man.	On je čovjek.
I say no.	Ja kažem da nije.
I don't want to see this.	Ne želim da vidim ovo.
They were alone.	Bili su sami.
Not so now.	Sada nije tako.
One.	Jedan.
I thought that's how it should have been done.	Mislio sam da je tako trebalo da se uradi.
These are.	Ovo su.
Maybe a little too much.	Možda malo previše.
He would know it was.	Znao bi da jeste.
But for now.	Ali, za sada.
I told you what happened.	Rekao sam ti šta se dogodilo.
Is anyone there?	Ima li nekoga tamo?
And it ever will be.	I ikada će biti.
I ask again.	Pitam ponovo.
No one knew how to deal with him.	Niko nije znao kako da se nosi sa njim.
You really shouldn't do that.	Zaista to ne bi trebao raditi.
We didn't have time.	Nismo imali vremena.
He had to see the truth.	Morao je da vidi istinu.
But that is no longer the case.	Ali to više nije tako.
It really has to be seen.	Zaista se mora vidjeti.
If so, so be it.	Ako je tako, tako je.
But not much.	Ali ne puno.
He doesn't have to tell me again.	Ne mora mi ponovo reći.
You have to go.	Moraš ići.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikome nije rekao.
I wanted you.	Želeo sam te.
They did it.	Oni su to uradili.
But that is not quite true.	Ali to nije baš tačno.
It still looks good.	I dalje izgleda dobro.
What happens, happens.	Šta se dešava, dešava se.
And that doesn't happen.	A to se ne dešava.
I don't know how, but it is.	Ne znam kako, ali jeste.
That really happened.	To se zaista dogodilo.
I thought of all these things.	Mislio sam na sve ove stvari.
But that would not be true.	Ali to ne bi bila istina.
Very little about it.	Vrlo malo o tome.
She said she was fine.	Rekla je da je dobro.
See something.	Vidi nešto.
That's how it is here.	Ovde je tako.
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
But you won't.	Ali nećeš.
He was a really good man.	On je zaista bio dobar čovjek.
He had to do something.	Morao je nešto da uradi.
We'll find them.	Naći ćemo ih.
And she didn't know you knew.	A ona nije znala da ti znaš.
Not so long.	Ne tako dugo.
I have to say.	moram reći.
But he couldn't say that.	Ali on to nije mogao reći.
And that is the job we are doing now.	I to je posao koji sada radimo.
He will never know.	On nikada neće znati.
It could be a good deal.	Moglo bi biti dobar posao.
So it was supposed to be nothing.	Tako da je trebao biti ništa.
I'm so scared for him.	Tako se bojim za njega.
Now it can be anyone.	Sada to može biti bilo ko.
They should be there in a day.	Trebali bi biti tamo za jedan dan.
We have what you need.	Imamo ono što vam treba.
This was not the way.	Ovo nije bio način.
He wanted them to know he was there too.	Želio je da znaju da je i on tamo.
Much more than that.	Mnogo više od toga.
But it works very well.	Ali radi jako dobro.
And I can do without me for a few days.	I mogu bez mene nekoliko dana.
This is so.	Ovo je tako.
This has never happened to me before.	To mi se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
It works for us.	Radi za nas.
But she is.	Ali ona jeste.
You have to stay.	Moraš ostati.
I am very happy to be here.	Veoma sam sretan što sam ovdje.
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
Even now he didn't know why.	Ni sada nije znao zašto.
There is only one problem.	Postoji samo jedan problem.
This is not a good idea.	Ovo nije dobra ideja.
It's there.	To je tamo.
I don’t know why, but it was good.	Ne znam zašto, ali to je bilo dobro.
Is that what you want.	Da li je to ono što želiš.
You never did.	Nikad nisi.
It was so bad.	Bilo je tako loše.
This will certainly not be easy.	Ovo sigurno neće biti lako.
Not bad, just not very good.	Nije loše, samo nije baš dobro.
Lots to say, but did very little.	Puno za reći, ali uradio vrlo malo.
That's what it is.	To je ono što je.
It was a lot.	Bilo je puno.
You should go if you can.	Trebao bi ići ako možeš.
They just had no idea what they were up to.	Jednostavno nisu imali pojma u čemu su.
There were still things he needed to do.	Još je bilo stvari koje je trebao uraditi.
Which was the thing.	Što je bila stvar.
This is a new path.	Ovo je novi put.
Maybe he's really good.	Možda je stvarno dobar.
But we probably already know that too.	Ali vjerovatno i mi to već znamo.
There's not much we can do.	Ne možemo mnogo da uradimo.
Everything would be fine.	Sve bi bilo u redu.
He was very good at it.	Bio je veoma dobar u tome.
It wasn't there.	Tamo nije bilo.
So that was so.	Tako da je to bilo tako.
I see him.	Vidim ga.
I have a lot of money.	Imam puno novca.
Not yet.	Ne još.
Another better way.	Još jedan bolji način.
He didn't have time.	Nije imao vremena.
But you know.	Ali znaš.
Maybe I wasn't there.	Možda nisam bio tamo.
That was enough for me.	To mi je bilo dovoljno.
He returned the question.	Vratio je pitanje.
Too many problems.	Previše problema.
Be there for me.	Biti tu za mene.
We know how it is.	Znamo kako je.
You couldn't trust him and you shouldn't.	Nisi mu mogao vjerovati i ne bi trebao.
It wouldn't be for a few days.	Ne bi bilo za nekoliko dana.
Nobody told me that like you.	Niko mi to nije rekao kao ti.
He knew what to do.	Znao je šta treba učiniti.
But for dinner.	Ali za večeru.
He said a lot of that was true.	Rekao je da je mnogo toga istina.
And for a long time.	I već dugo vremena.
I don't want to be.	Ne želim biti.
She knew why he had come.	Znala je zašto je došao.
You did your best.	Dao si sve od sebe.
He told us himself.	On nam je sam rekao.
He went there.	Otišao je tamo.
He did it himself, no one told him.	To je uradio sam, niko mu nije rekao.
We have it and here we are.	Imamo ga i tu smo.
Maybe something is wrong with me.	Možda nešto nije u redu sa mnom.
There was a lot to do and see.	Bilo je mnogo toga za raditi i vidjeti.
It was a difficult time for us there.	Bilo je to teško vrijeme za nas tamo.
He's only here this week.	Ovdje je samo ove sedmice.
Okay, it's better than nothing.	Dobro, bolje je nego ništa.
This should not be done.	Ovo ne bi trebalo da se radi.
It has everything you need to know.	Ima sve što treba znati.
If you did, you wouldn't have a friend for long.	Da jeste, ne biste dugo imali prijatelja.
I'm not done.	Nisam završio.
Now, friend.	Sada, prijatelj.
He was obviously fine.	Očigledno je bio dobro.
Someone must have told you.	Mora da ti je neko rekao.
He is.	On je.
He asked me for money.	Tražio mi je novac.
I just loved you.	Samo sam te voleo.
He just wasn't ready to see it.	Jednostavno nije bio spreman da to vidi.
But tell me this.	Ali reci mi ovo.
It's not.	Nije.
She didn't want to want him.	Nije htela da ga želi.
That's what he said.	Tako je i rekao.
I'm really happy about that.	Zaista sam sretan zbog toga.
He started talking.	Počeo je da govori.
Nobody really knows what happened.	Niko zaista ne zna šta se dogodilo.
Don't say that now.	Ne govori to sada.
That's all we can do.	To je sve što možemo.
He realized he had arrived.	Shvatio je da je stigao.
No one was here but us.	Niko nije bio ovde osim nas.
It wasn't like that anymore.	Više nije bio tako.
I loved him very much.	Mnogo sam ga voleo.
There is not much to say about it.	Nema puno za reći o tome.
I guess that's true.	Pretpostavljam da je to istina.
There was very little time to do anything.	Bilo je vrlo malo vremena da se nešto uradi.
We don't know what will happen.	Ne znamo šta će se dogoditi.
And so simple.	I tako jednostavno.
You don't even have to talk to him.	Ne moraš čak ni razgovarati s njim.
I wouldn't do something like that, I wouldn't.	Ne bi tako nešto, ne bi.
Maybe they know something.	Možda oni nešto znaju.
But that was not good enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
He must be afraid of you.	Mora da te se boji.
I thought you were right.	Mislio sam da si u pravu.
This is simply not true.	Ovo jednostavno nije tačno.
I really don't want to know.	Zaista ne želim da znam.
Even bad.	Čak i loše.
I told him things, but not the truth.	Rekao sam mu stvari, ali ne i istinu.
It works.	To radi.
I heard her.	Čuo sam je.
I am me.	Ja sam ja.
And you don't just want him.	I ne želiš samo njega.
I had no idea what was waiting for me.	Nisam imao pojma šta me čeka.
This was enough.	Ovo je bilo dovoljno.
We needed that.	To nam je trebalo.
Life does not happen that way.	Život se ne dešava tako.
There are only three of them.	Ima ih samo tri.
You like it.	Sviđa ti se.
It was like that.	Bilo je tako.
He will be here tomorrow.	On će biti ovdje sutra.
He wanted it.	Želio je to.
It was still there.	Još je bilo tamo.
But we know what we know.	Ali znamo šta znamo.
But I don't know what they are.	Ali ne znam šta su.
You're from that.	Od toga si.
I would like to talk more about that.	Voleo bih da se o tome više priča.
He just told the truth.	Samo je rekao istinu.
I'm happy here so far.	Sretan sam ovdje do sada.
He didn't know what to say.	Nije znao šta da kaže.
But he already knew.	Ali on je već znao.
But he still couldn't do it.	Ali on to i dalje nije mogao.
No one could know about it.	Niko nije mogao znati za to.
It was the first time.	Bio je to prvi put.
It was enough.	Bilo je dovoljno.
Nothing good can come of it.	Ništa dobro ne može biti od toga.
You look good too.	I ti izgledaš dobro.
He won't do anything.	On neće ništa da uradi.
That is simply not true.	To jednostavno nije istina.
I would be very happy if you would.	Bio bih veoma sretan ako biste.
This was too much for me.	Ovo je bilo previše za mene.
Nobody heard anything.	Niko ništa nije čuo.
It still doesn't work.	I dalje ne radi.
This doesn't work.	Ovo ne radi.
But there was someone there.	Ali tamo je bio neko.
But they won't be there.	Ali oni neće biti tamo.
He doesn't seem to be sure of himself.	Čini se da nije siguran u sebe.
He didn't know what.	Nije znao šta.
I really wanted to go with him.	Zaista sam htela da idem sa njim.
I was the only one.	Bio sam jedini.
I'm not sure if that's what you need.	Nisam siguran da li je to ono što ti treba.
But he didn't want to talk to anyone much.	Ali nije mnogo želio ni sa kim razgovarati.
It won't be hard.	Neće biti teško.
Nothing is wrong.	Ništa nije u redu.
She told you exactly what to do.	Rekla ti je tačno šta treba da uradi.
He came yesterday.	Došao je juče.
Who was that?	Ko je to bio.
I want to talk to him.	Želim razgovarati s njim.
You know how that would be.	Znaš kako bi to bilo.
He left.	Otišao je.
It's pretty safe.	Prilično je sigurno.
I said now.	rekao sam sada.
Not just this one.	Ne samo ovaj.
She didn't know why he would do such a thing.	Nije znala zašto bi tako nešto uradio.
I don't know anymore.	Ne znam više.
I'm sure there are more.	Siguran sam da ih ima još.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Jeste li sigurni da to želite učiniti?
He has something.	On ima nešto.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
I'm sorry about him.	Žao mi je zbog njega.
He was on it now.	Sada je bio na tome.
They said a few.	Rekli su nekoliko.
All right, let's do this.	U redu, uradimo ovo.
Except they're not.	Osim što nisu.
But he was not alone.	Ali nije bio sam.
I've seen you before.	Video sam te ranije.
It's right.	Tačno je kako treba.
He should be home.	Trebao bi biti kod kuće.
I was surprised by that.	Bio sam iznenađen tome.
Being prepared for almost anything is a good idea.	Biti spreman na skoro sve je dobra ideja.
Nobody said that was the case.	Niko nije rekao da je tako.
You won't see it.	Nećeš to vidjeti.
She was today.	Bila je danas.
It's here.	Ovde je.
She knows what you are.	Ona zna šta si ti.
As he said, it was not.	Kako je rekao, nije to bio.
He never asked for her.	Nikada je nije tražio.
But we have to go.	Ali moramo ići.
Now he knew why.	Sada je znao zašto.
Nothing was certain.	Ništa nije bilo sigurno.
So many times.	Toliko puta.
We don't have to see it again.	Ne moramo to ponovo vidjeti.
Do it your way.	Uradi to na svoj način.
He wasn't so sure.	Nije bio tako siguran.
I was sorry about that.	Bilo mi je žao zbog toga.
Maybe he wasn't my real father.	Možda mi nije bio pravi otac.
Here it is the only way you can do this or that.	Ovdje je to jedini način na koji možete učiniti ovo ili ono.
Which was probably a good thing.	Što je vjerovatno bilo dobro.
I had to talk to him.	Morao sam razgovarati s njim.
No, he had to tell the truth.	Ne, morao je da govori istinu.
I guess she just didn’t know any better.	Pretpostavljam da jednostavno nije znala za bolje.
It could be.	Moglo bi biti.
He said he would come tomorrow.	Rekao je da će doći sutra.
He is such a good man.	On je tako dobar čovjek.
I haven't seen them.	Nisam ih vidio.
You know how it goes.	Znaš kako to ide.
I want everything, please.	Želim sve, molim te.
He finished his work.	Završio je svoj posao.
And not for the first time.	I to ne prvi put.
I didn't go.	Nisam otišao.
I asked her what she liked.	Pitao sam je šta voli.
You know who he is.	Znaš ko je on.
That will help.	To će pomoći.
Maybe for now.	Možda za sada.
I want to be a guy.	Želim da budem momak.
That was fine.	To je bilo u redu.
Do it fast.	Uradi i to brzo.
But he doesn't want me.	Ali on me ne želi.
That hardly happened today.	Teško da se to danas dogodilo.
He didn't tell me much at all.	Uopšte mi nije mnogo rekao.
He decided not to try.	Odlučio je da ne pokušava.
Mine very bad.	Moj jako loš.
Just not now.	Samo ne sada.
And it was like that.	I to je bilo tako.
You didn't do things the right way.	Nisi uradio stvari na pravi način.
She said she wanted to talk.	Rekla je da želi razgovarati.
I think we'll both get what we need.	Mislim da ćemo oboje dobiti ono što nam treba.
I know of a few.	Znam za nekoliko.
But you will get it today.	Ali danas ćeš ga dobiti.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.	Činilo se da ništa nije u redu.
He could do anything.	Mogao bi uraditi bilo šta.
He was not helpful.	On nije bio od pomoći.
He will come tomorrow.	Sutra će doći.
She never did.	Ona to nikad nije.
They said we need help.	Rekli su da nam treba pomoć.
What day was it? 	Koji je dan bio?
he would ask.	pitao bi.
His father never loved him either.	Ni otac ga nikada nije volio.
I don't think she knows either.	Mislim da ni ona ne zna.
Not much, that's for sure.	Ne mnogo, to je sigurno.
But you like that about him.	Ali to ti se sviđa kod njega.
That's what you said.	To ste rekli.
That was the reason.	To je bio razlog.
I didn't know who he really was.	Nisam znao ko je on zapravo.
But it wasn't always easy.	Ali to nije uvijek bilo lako.
Maybe you know about me.	Možda znaš za mene.
I wish they weren't.	Voleo bih da nisu.
We can help you with this.	Možemo vam ovo pomoći.
And maybe they're right.	I možda su u pravu.
She knew from him.	Znala je od njega.
That's what you'll find.	To je ono što ćeš naći.
I don't know what will happen next.	Ne znam šta će se dalje dogoditi.
Not good enough.	Nije dovoljno dobro.
She did not want to come.	Ona nije htela da dođe.
I really wish he was here.	Zaista bih volio da je ovdje.
I know he will.	Znam da hoće.
.	.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nisam uradio ništa loše.
But it is not so.	Ali nije tako.
My father brought me back.	Otac me je vratio.
I think that's good.	Mislim da je to dobro.
I did it.	Ja sam to radio.
I'll tell him he doesn't have to talk to me.	Reći ću mu da ne mora razgovarati sa mnom.
We have to help.	Moramo pomoći.
This is for sure.	Ovo je sigurno.
We are not the only ones.	Nismo jedini.
But he had nothing to do.	Ali nije imao šta da radi.
Really good job.	Zaista dobar posao.
A friend was with me.	Prijatelj je bio sa mnom.
One of us had to go.	Jedan od nas je morao da ide.
Those were good times.	Bila su to dobra vremena.
Too many people are just waiting.	Previše ljudi samo čeka.
But nothing.	Ali ništa.
This is good.	Ovo je dobro.
It will be there.	Tamo će biti.
I am not a person.	Ja nisam osoba.
I think I can.	Mislim da mogu.
I can't tell you to do that.	Ne mogu ti reći da to uradiš.
On the very day it happened.	Na sam dan kada se to dogodilo.
It wasn't a job.	To nije bio posao.
I need money fast.	Treba mi novac brzo.
We have to be together.	Moramo biti zajedno.
This was much better.	Ovo je bilo mnogo bolje.
I knew it was safe.	Znao sam da je sigurno.
He decided to tell the truth.	Odlučio je da kaže istinu.
I was a little sorry for them.	Bilo mi ih je malo žao.
I'm not going any further with you.	Ne idem dalje s tobom.
Just your money, and that's it.	Samo tvoj novac, i to je to.
He still wasn't sure about it.	Još uvijek nije bio siguran u to.
She still didn't know.	I dalje nije znala.
Tell me what the problem is.	Reci mi u čemu je problem.
This was not like me.	Ovo nije bilo kao ja.
I only have you.	Imam samo tebe.
We will never leave.	Nikada nećemo otići.
Maybe not, she said.	Možda ne, rekla je.
It's just not here.	To jednostavno nije ovdje.
I'm not going to do something like that.	Neću uraditi tako nešto.
I'm doing well.	Dobro mi ide.
And last year was bad.	A prošle godine je bilo loše.
He will never be with me.	Nikad neće biti sa mnom.
That seems to be fine.	Izgleda da je to u redu.
I never wanted you.	Nikad te nisam želeo.
As well as	Kao i
Is that correct?.	Je to tačno?.
I hope it will.	Nadam se da hoće.
He'll be here soon.	Doći će uskoro.
are you okay now	jesi li dobro sada?
She is my life, this is my life.	Ona je moj život, ovo je moj život.
I hope you will.	Nadam se da hoćeš.
I'm sure that's the case.	Siguran sam da je to tako.
But there was something to do.	Ali bilo je nešto za uraditi.
I went with him.	Otišao sam s njim.
I don't want him to leave.	Ne želim da ode.
That's for sure.	To je sigurno.
I knew it was him.	Znao sam da je to on.
It doesn't go fast.	Od toga se ne ide brzo.
I could be anyone.	Mogao bih biti bilo ko.
I have enough.	Imam dosta.
And that was hard enough.	I to je bilo dovoljno teško.
My father was that now.	Moj otac je sada bio to.
I could never do anything right.	Nikad nisam mogao ništa da uradim kako treba.
And you should.	I trebao bi.
But only if you want to.	Ali samo ako to želite.
Someone is talking.	Neko priča.
A few of us.	Nas nekoliko.
You're good.	Dobar si.
I'm pretty tired of it.	Prilično sam umoran od toga.
No, they said, you're doing a good job.	Ne, rekli su, radiš dobar posao.
I do it for myself.	Radim to za sebe.
And he knows it.	I on to zna.
We never did.	Nikad nismo.
We will all be there.	Svi ćemo biti tamo.
And they knew.	I oni su znali.
And that's what you should do.	I to je ono što treba da uradite.
Now there was nothing left to see.	Sada više nije bilo šta da se vidi.
A good team would be good without me.	Dobar tim bi bio dobar i bez mene.
And he did.	I on je to uradio.
Now she knew what was going to happen.	Sada je znala šta će se dogoditi.
It can even be returned.	Može se čak i vratiti.
Actually, never on time.	Zapravo, nikad na vrijeme.
Who had it.	Ko ga je imao.
And it doesn’t look like that’s going to happen.	I ne izgleda da će se to dogoditi.
It was a little further.	Bilo je malo dalje.
But they are safe.	Ali oni su sigurni.
Don't you think we need this?	Zar ne mislite da nam ovo treba?
And this is good.	I ovo je dobro.
You know what needs to be done.	Znate šta se mora uraditi.
I want, I want, I want !.	Želim, želim, želim!.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
We just haven’t been here that long.	Jednostavno nismo bili ovdje toliko dugo.
So many people couldn't and didn't.	Toliko ljudi nije moglo i nije.
But there was more.	Ali tu je bilo više.
I went to see.	Otišao sam da vidim.
But it is something.	Ali to je nešto.
She is in all of us.	Ona je u svima nama.
But you should.	Ali trebalo bi.
But she doesn't look good.	Ali ona ne izgleda dobro.
She never said anything.	Nikad ništa nije rekla.
But not only that.	Ali ne samo to.
It's just a job.	To je samo posao.
You can't tell who people are.	Ne možete reći ko su ljudi.
I don't want any of that.	Ne želim ništa od toga.
Or they knew something we didn't.	Ili su znali nešto što mi nismo.
But no one seemed to be able to tell me.	Ali činilo se da niko nije mogao da mi kaže.
And so it was.	Tako je i ovo bilo.
who was she 	ko je ona bila?
he wondered.	pitao se on.
It wouldn’t happen to us the first time.	Ne bi nam se to dogodilo prvi put.
Yes, that's it.	Da, to je to.
That would never happen today, he told me.	To se danas nikada ne bi dogodilo, rekao mi je.
He was inside himself.	Bio je u sebi.
Where are you.	Gdje si ti.
I didn't want to go.	Nisam htela da idem.
But they shouldn't know that.	Ali oni to ne bi trebali znati.
he asked.	pitao.
I don't want to know the years.	Ne želim da znam godine.
That is indeed true.	To je zaista istina.
That may not be the case.	Toga zapravo možda i nema.
He said good.	Rekao je dobro.
I do not have to.	Ne moram.
Not doing much right now.	Trenutno ne radi mnogo.
He loved both.	Voleo je oboje.
Which isn't so bad.	Što i nije tako loše.
In a few years we would be gone.	Za nekoliko godina nas više ne bi bilo.
I wasn't sure what to do.	Nisam bio siguran šta da radim.
But we couldn’t talk, we both knew it well.	Ali nismo mogli razgovarati, oboje smo to dobro znali.
Probably nothing.	Verovatno nije ništa.
I could not.	Nisam mogao.
He didn't know.	Nije znao.
I should be able to do that.	Trebalo bi da mogu to da uradim.
Maybe no one can help you.	Možda ti niko ne može pomoći.
You can do it here.	To možete učiniti ovdje.
That was quite a few years ago.	To je bilo prije dosta godina.
That's what he wanted.	To je ono što je želio.
I hope you like it.	Nadam se da vam se sviđa.
I'm very sorry.	Jako mi je žao.
Which is a good idea.	Što je dobra ideja.
I was busy.	Bio sam zauzet.
I was surprised.	Bio sam iznenađen.
Not new.	Ne novi.
Go to work.	Ići na posao.
I do not know.	Ne znam.
There are very few of them now.	Sada ih je vrlo malo.
As much as it was before.	Koliko je to bilo prije.
It must be.	Mora da je.
If he doesn't know, he won't.	Ako ne zna, neće.
We didn't do anything to him.	Nismo mu ništa uradili.
I didn't say he could.	Nisam rekao da može.
For that day.	Za taj dan.
But he heard what happened.	Ali čuo je šta se dogodilo.
We are it.	Mi smo to.
Maybe that’s why it’s so hard.	Možda je to razlog što je tako teško.
This happens quite often.	To se dešava prilično često.
We are still not sure what will happen to us.	Još uvijek nismo sigurni šta će nam se dogoditi.
He came with me.	Došao je sa mnom.
You have to do everything.	Moraš sve da uradiš.
But I can't say how it happens.	Ali ne mogu reći kako se to dešava.
I know how it's done.	Znam kako se to radi.
It doesn't currently.	Trenutno to ne čini.
Even a little.	Čak i pomalo.
It was something that did not happen.	Bilo je to nešto što se nije dogodilo.
No.	Neću.
He understood this.	On je ovo shvatio.
I don't know how we do it.	Ne znam kako to radimo.
You have to work with me.	Morate raditi sa mnom.
It's good.	To je dobro.
No, not that.	Ne, ne to.
And I guess they will.	I pretpostavljam da hoće.
He was only home for a few days.	Bio je kući samo nekoliko dana.
They will not be what you think.	Oni neće biti ono što mislite.
It's true.	To je tačno.
They wouldn't tell me anything about it.	Ne bi mi ništa rekli o tome.
This almost works.	Ovo skoro da radi.
We can do both.	Možemo oboje.
That was never good.	To nikad nije bilo dobro.
Much of this is true.	Mnogo toga je istina.
He seems to be having a hard time.	Čini se da mu je teško.
Everything is still here.	Sve je još ovdje.
Just what are you doing to me.	Samo, šta mi to radiš.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
You will tell me.	Ti ćeš mi reći.
Everyone said that.	Svi su to rekli.
We didn't know any better.	Nismo znali ništa bolje.
That's one.	To je jedan.
But it's usually not that bad.	Ali obično nije tako loše.
I didn't even understand why.	Nisam ni shvatio zašto.
And everything will be better.	I sve će biti bolje.
But she always knew.	Ali ona je uvek znala.
That may be true.	To je možda istina.
He still does.	I dalje to radi.
I don't know how to say that.	Ne znam kako da to kažem.
Are you sure this is the right path?	Jeste li sigurni da je ovo pravi put?
I know it was for me.	Znam da je bilo za mene.
That's my idea.	To je moja ideja.
We like it.	Sviđa nam se.
I never knew that.	Nikad to nisam znao.
This is the first.	To je prvi.
Could that be true?	Može li to biti istina?
Tell us that.	Reci nam to.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
And he came.	I došao je.
He lost his job, and he should have.	Izgubio je posao, a trebao je.
Why did he have to come?	Zašto je morao doći?
But what he wanted was something more.	Ali ono što je želeo bilo je nešto više.
And it really is.	I zaista jeste.
But really.	Ali stvarno.
I don't think anyone should.	Mislim da niko ne bi trebao.
It has to stay that way.	Tako mora i ostati.
That's not you.	To nisi ti.
It's all right, really.	Sve je u redu, zaista.
She told you what to do.	Rekla ti je šta da radiš.
We can do that here too.	To možemo i ovdje.
No, it must be true.	Ne, mora biti tačno.
That's what he has.	To je ono što on ima.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
This happens to everyone.	Ovo se dešava svima.
I love it so much.	Toliko volim.
There was no way there.	Tamo nije bilo puta.
I need it now.	Treba mi sada.
That's not the way to go.	To nije pravi put.
I am not the father.	Ja nisam otac.
They knew when they would probably find us and where.	Znali su kada će nas vjerovatno naći i gdje.
My friend had enough money this time.	Moj prijatelj je ovaj put imao dovoljno novca.
We did the right thing.	Uradili smo pravu stvar.
So he says.	Tako on kaže.
It's really that simple.	Zaista je tako jednostavno.
I don't have it.	Ja ga nemam.
He couldn't really believe it.	Nije mogao baš vjerovati.
And I.	I ja.
I'm fine with that.	Dobro sam s tim.
Besides you.	Osim tebe.
But this was not the first time.	Ali to nije bilo prvi put.
That's the problem here.	To je problem ovdje.
I didn't know what to think.	Nisam znao šta da mislim.
In fact, not at any time.	Zapravo, ne u bilo koje vrijeme.
I am glad.	Drago mi je.
That's next.	To je sljedeće.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
It seemed like it was, but maybe it wasn't.	Činilo se kao da jeste, ali možda i nije.
Maybe it's just both.	Možda je samo oboje.
I don't want to leave.	Ne želim otići.
Nobody about it.	Niko o tome.
I'm the one who loves it.	Ja sam taj koji to voli.
You will go home soon.	Uskoro ćeš ići kući.
She left.	Ona ode.
Besides, no one knows we're here.	Osim toga, niko ne zna da smo ovde.
I think.	Mislim da.
It's enough.	Dosta mi je.
This is difficult.	Ovo je teško.
The question is what happens next.	Pitanje je šta se dalje dešava.
But this will be good.	Ali ovo će biti dobro.
He was completely surprised.	Bio je potpuno iznenađen.
There is nothing for me here.	Ovde nema ništa za mene.
You are my good friend.	Ti si moj dobar prijatelj.
I'm really for him.	Zaista sam za njega.
We are fine.	Mi smo dobro.
You should be too.	I ti bi trebao biti.
There is, and there certainly is.	Ima, i sigurno ima.
How many people can say that?	Koliko ljudi to može reći?
He never told me.	Nikad mi nije rekao.
I never did that.	Nikad to nisam uradio.
I wish he could help me.	Voleo bih da mi može pomoći.
He prefers to live alone.	Više voli da živi sam.
Nothing better could have happened.	Ništa bolje se nije moglo dogoditi.
She said again.	Ponovo je rekla.
You had me there.	Imao si me tamo.
Never heard of him, I have no idea who he is.	Nikad čuo za njega, nemam pojma ko je on.
That was enough.	To je bilo dovoljno.
I didn't get a day.	Nisam dobio dan.
And it works well on that.	I dobro radi na tome.
If so.	Ako jeste.
I tried to tell you that.	Pokušao sam to da ti kažem.
She told me something.	Rekla mi je nešto.
But how good you look.	Ali, kako dobro izgledaš.
He says he won't.	Kaže da neće.
That's your reason !.	To je tvoj razlog!.
It could go either way.	Moglo bi ići na bilo koji način.
There is no one there.	Tamo nema nikoga.
That's what he looks like to me.	Tako mi on izgleda.
That was three years ago.	To je bilo prije tri godine.
He said it's better not to.	Rekao je da je bolje ne.
I was ready.	Bio sam spreman.
We'll find them.	Naći ćemo ih.
You'll be home soon.	Uskoro ćeš biti kući.
And that is exactly what happened.	I upravo se to dogodilo.
I got it.	Shvatio sam to.
It was so hard.	Bilo je tako teško.
You could see that.	Mogli ste to vidjeti.
I feel sorry for you.	Žao mi je zbog tebe.
There is nothing a man should not know.	Ne postoji ništa što čovjek nije trebao znati.
He was there several times.	Bio je tamo nekoliko puta.
I worked a lot.	Radio sam puno.
I wish he never would.	Voleo bih da nikada neće.
Now we were safe.	Sada smo bili sigurni.
I don't think he really means it.	Mislim da on to zaista ne misli.
There's a lot going on with it.	Mnogo toga se dešava sa tim.
I thought of everything.	Mislio sam na sve.
I saw it here, here and here.	Vidio sam to ovdje, ovdje i ovdje.
But it's not just that.	Ali nije samo to.
He did and saw nothing.	Uradio je i nije video ništa.
No problem about that.	Nema problema o tome.
It was life as usual.	Bio je to život kao i obično.
These things can be seen.	Ove stvari se mogu vidjeti.
It could have been much better.	Moglo je biti mnogo bolje.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
But it really is.	Ali zaista jeste.
Wasn't it good.	Zar nije bilo dobro.
It works well.	Radi dobro.
I have to do this.	Moram ovo da uradim.
I did my best.	Dao sam sve od sebe.
He has no one who loves him.	On nema nikoga ko ga voli.
They should be very good.	Vrlo dobro bi trebali biti.
I heard her last night.	Čuo sam je sinoć.
It wasn't much.	Nije bilo mnogo.
Nobody can see us.	Niko nas ne vidi.
We are working now.	Sada radimo.
I know you are.	Znam da jesi.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
She wants to talk.	Ona želi da priča.
I have a lot.	Imam puno.
It's not long.	To nije dugo.
Or a day.	Ili dan.
That's the only thing with it.	To je jedina stvar s tim.
He never asked for more.	Nikad nije tražio više.
But it's not that simple.	Ali to nije tako jednostavno.
We need to know what's going on there.	Moramo znati šta se tamo dešava.
You could see why.	Mogli ste vidjeti zašto.
They just.	Oni samo .
Got it, got it.	Shvatio, shvatio.
You do that too.	I ti to radiš.
She will tell you that it is true.	Ona će vam reći da je to istina.
He just couldn't help it. 	Jednostavno nije mogao pomoći. 
They are not a problem.	Oni nisu problem.
You need to see this.	Morate vidjeti ovo.
He is safe.	On je siguran.
Nothing is ever right, and nothing is ever enough.	Nikad ništa nije u redu, i nikad ništa nije dovoljno.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I don't do that.	Ja to ne radim.
So he was busy.	Tako da je bio zauzet.
Just say you think so.	Samo reci da to misliš.
He was right about you.	Bio je u pravu za tebe.
This is more than that.	Ovo je više od toga.
We have the money to do it.	Imamo novca da to uradimo.
But no one could tell me what it was.	Ali niko mi nije mogao reći šta je to.
They can help.	Oni mogu pomoći.
Don’t do it often enough.	Ne radite to dovoljno često.
I'm not sure how to do that.	Nisam siguran kako to da radim.
Maybe he knows.	Možda on zna.
Really, really fast.	Zaista, jako brzo.
We knew there would be nothing wrong with that.	Znali smo da od toga neće biti ništa loše.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
That's too much for you.	To je previše za tebe.
But she knew everything.	Ali ona je sve znala.
I am everything.	Sve sam.
If money is not an issue,	Ako novac nije problem,
Let me ask you.	Da te pitam.
This is very good.	Ovo je vrlo dobro.
He really was one of us.	Zaista je bio jedan od nas.
It seems to me that this is not working properly.	Čini mi se da to ne radi kako treba.
I hope to see you soon.	Nadam se da ću te uskoro vidjeti.
I can buy a new car.	Mogu kupiti novi auto.
I think he will be able to again.	Mislim da će moći ponovo.
And it's just like that.	I to je jednostavno tako.
I heard her.	Čuo sam je.
You should leave.	Trebao bi otići.
I heard her.	Čuo sam je.
I said he could go.	Rekao sam da može ići.
I can't see her very well.	Ne vidim je dobro.
It really doesn't happen that way.	To se zaista ne dešava tako.
Maybe never.	Možda nikad.
I felt sorry for them both.	Bilo mi ih je žao oboje.
You're right.	U pravu si.
I'm always alone.	Uvek sam.
This was not like home.	Ovo nije bilo kao kod kuće.
He loves it.	On to voli.
No, they didn't.	Ne, nisu.
And now he has done it.	I sada je to uradio.
For a long time.	Za dugo vremena.
But not really.	Ali ne baš.
Better than nothing, for sure.	Bolje nego ništa, sigurno.
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije.
It was probably good, but he really didn't want to leave.	Vjerovatno je bilo dobro, ali on zaista nije želio da ode.
He was either not here or he was gone.	On ili nije bio ovdje ili je bio i otišao.
I knew what he liked.	Znao sam šta voli.
He couldn't go there with anyone.	Ni sa kim tamo nije mogao ići.
I never wanted to be.	Nikad nisam želeo da budem.
It should do that.	To bi trebalo da uradi.
This is not it.	Ovo nije to.
He told me that.	On mi je to rekao.
Maybe he'll never talk to me again.	Možda više nikada neće razgovarati sa mnom.
Not that it ever was.	Nije da je ikada.
I want more than that.	Želim više od toga.
This takes time.	Za ovo treba vremena.
When we were both human.	Kad smo oboje bili ljudi.
This is my boyfriend.	Ovo je moj momak.
If something seems to be wrong, it probably is.	Ako se čini da nešto nije u redu, vjerovatno jeste.
They don't know how we do things here.	Oni ne znaju kako mi radimo stvari ovdje.
But there was no time for that.	Ali nije bilo vremena za to.
I'd love to know what you think about it.	Voleo bih da znam šta mislite o tome.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
But something has to happen.	Ali nešto se mora dogoditi.
Now we have enough money for the trip.	Sada imamo dovoljno novca za put.
Actually, that was the first way.	Zapravo, to je bio prvi način.
I think everyone knows that.	Mislim da to svi znaju.
But that's a good thing.	Ali to je dobra stvar.
She knew the reason why she didn't.	Znala je razlog zašto nije.
I was supposed to be something.	Trebao sam biti nešto.
He just wants to talk.	On samo želi da priča.
It's probably already there.	Verovatno je već tamo.
I do what she never did.	Radim ono što ona nikad nije.
Why is it like that?	Zašto je to tako?
I didn't have time for that.	Nisam imao vremena za to.
I tried to be.	Pokušao sam da budem.
This is fine.	Ovo je u redu.
Not very good.	Ne baš dobro.
For nothing, to anyone, never.	Ni za šta, nikome, nikad.
Nobody knows what he's doing.	Niko ne zna šta radi.
I have to do this for myself.	Moram ovo da uradim za sebe.
I could have done without it.	Mogao sam i bez toga.
I was looking for something.	Tražio sam nešto.
Maybe it's not safe.	Možda nije sigurno.
That didn't happen right away.	To se nije dogodilo odmah.
I don't even know what it was.	Ne znam ni šta je to bilo.
Maybe there is another reason.	Možda postoji još jedan razlog.
But only for a while.	Ali samo na neko vrijeme.
But we couldn't find him.	Ali nismo ga mogli naći.
Maybe you should.	Možda bi trebao.
Maybe she'll know.	Možda će ona znati.
Now he knew.	Sada je znao.
That is easy.	To je lako.
That's not a good thing.	To nije dobra stvar.
I'm just glad you're okay.	Samo mi je drago da si dobro.
Maybe yes, maybe no.	Možda da, možda ne.
I gave it back to him.	Vratio sam mu ga.
But that's how it is.	Ali tako je.
I'm not sure what's wrong with you.	Nisam siguran šta nije u redu s tobom.
This is actually not that bad.	Ovo zapravo i nije tako loše.
No, he had to stay.	Ne, morao je ostati.
Yes, she would say.	Da, rekla bi.
Everything works and works as it is.	Sve radi i radi kako je.
What do you think?	Šta vi mislite?
You're.	Ti si.
That was never a problem.	To nikada nije bio problem.
This is my life.	Ovo je moj život.
Like this day.	Kao ovaj dan.
And it does.	I to ga čini.
And she.	I ona.
Or something like that.	Ili tako nešto.
I only did it a few times.	Uradio sam to samo nekoliko puta.
I don’t see them anymore, or maybe in a few years.	Više ih ne vidim, ili možda za nekoliko godina.
It works, but not in the right way.	Radi, ali ne na pravi način.
This is a video game.	Ovo je video igra.
And it works well.	I dobro radi.
I never wanted that.	Nikada to nisam želio.
He knew something was wrong.	Znao je da nešto nije u redu.
I had it.	Imao sam ga.
Just one bad day.	Samo jedan loš dan.
.	.
In fact, maybe you could help too.	U stvari, možda biste i vi mogli pomoći.
I didn't know whether to hope or not.	Nisam znao da li da se nadam ili ne.
That's what I told myself.	To sam sebi rekao.
That's if he wants help.	To je ako želi pomoć.
Could this be this?	Može li to biti ovo?
That was actually for us.	To je zapravo bilo za nas.
It shouldn't have been.	Nije trebao biti.
I can't really say.	Ne mogu baš reći.
He could go.	Mogao je da ide.
.	.
So I'm going to do it today.	Tako da ću to učiniti danas.
He might not be there.	Moglo bi i da ga nema.
This is not difficult.	Ovo nije teško.
I have a few too.	I ja imam nekoliko.
Nothing, it seemed like a long time.	Ništa nije, činilo se kao dugo vremena.
I love doing it, actually.	Volim to da radim, zapravo.
He is also my friend.	On je i moj prijatelj.
Everyone here knows that.	Svi ovde to znaju.
That's what I thought.	To sam i mislio.
They are not a problem.	Oni nisu problem.
But it didn't.	Ali nije.
If not, you won't.	Ako nije, nećeš.
He was happy	Bio je sretan
I do not have money.	Nemam novca.
We can't do that yet.	To još ne možemo.
How can that be?	Kako to može biti?
There is only one way.	Ima samo jedan put.
It could even be you.	To bi čak mogao biti i ti.
The problem is that no one really knows what he wants.	Problem je što niko zapravo ne zna šta želi.
You want him to do you harm.	Želiš da ti učini loše.
I know they know.	Znam da znaju.
And I did it.	I uradio sam to.
They don't even know.	Čak ni ne znaju.
I'm really working on it.	Zaista radim na tome.
But that's how it goes.	Ali tako to ide.
It was him.	Bio je to on.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
Maybe there are more.	Možda ih ima još.
That will come in handy for both of us.	To će nam oboje dobro doći.
It simply exists.	Jednostavno postoji.
He doesn't love me.	On me ne voli.
I never had it.	Nikad ga nisam imao.
No, that was not enough.	Ne, to nije bilo dovoljno.
We really need it.	Jako nam treba.
It wasn't real.	Nije bilo stvarno.
I knew he wouldn't.	Znao sam da neće.
I have no idea how fast this car will go.	Nemam pojma koliko brzo će ovaj auto ići.
Apparently, nothing seemed to work much.	Očigledno, nije se činilo da ništa mnogo radi.
You could say that.	Moglo bi se reći.
I want him to leave.	Želim da ode.
I know you are.	Znam da jesi.
He does it well.	On to dobro radi.
You have to trust me.	Morate mi vjerovati.
The question is why and why now?	Pitanje je zašto i zašto sada?
That's right.	Tako ti je.
It works for a long time.	Radi dugo vremena.
I saw him here.	Video sam ga ovde.
It is unlikely to happen.	Malo je vjerovatno da će se to dogoditi.
You really can do it.	Ti to zaista možeš.
You can do it yourself if you know how.	To možete učiniti i sami ako znate kako.
A lot of that.	Mnogo toga.
I saw it.	Video sam to.
For real work.	Za pravi posao.
There is no one to see.	Nema nikoga da vidi.
Why he did it, no one knows now.	Zašto je to uradio, sada niko ne zna.
There is a lot to do.	Mnogo toga treba uraditi.
It doesn't work.	To ne radi.
In fact, a few.	U stvari, nekoliko.
Maybe this wasn't his question.	Možda mu ovo nije bilo pitanje.
I don't want this life anymore.	Ne želim više ovaj život.
You probably know that.	Vjerovatno to znate.
You can't do both.	Ne možeš oboje.
But not in the way he thought.	Ali ne na način na koji je mislio.
They could help us.	Mogli bi nam pomoći.
Now tell me more.	Sada mi reci više.
I like yours much more.	Tvoj mi se mnogo više sviđa.
There is none of that.	Ne postoji ništa od toga.
When do you want this?	Kada želiš ovo?
When something works, that’s it.	Kad nešto radi, to je to.
It was her.	Bila je ona.
That says something.	To govori nešto.
But that will not happen.	Ali to se neće dogoditi.
She told the truth.	Rekla je istinu.
And that is true today.	I to je istina i danas.
She never told me about it.	Nikad mi nije rekla za to.
There were people in the house.	U kući je bilo ljudi.
yes'.	ja '.
I may have done some of that.	Nešto od toga sam možda napravio.
My friend.	Moj prijatelj.
And no one knows why.	I niko ne zna zašto.
Maybe he saw it, and maybe he didn't.	Možda je video, a možda i nije.
I don't want to stay here.	Ne želim ostati ovdje.
Or maybe it's you.	Ili si to možda ti.
It could be good.	Moglo bi biti dobro.
They were both right.	Oboje su bili u pravu.
No it's not.	Ne je ne.
We all did it pretty well.	Svi smo to uradili prilično dobro.
She just is.	Ona jednostavno jeste.
But no one knew what to do with it.	Ali niko nije znao šta da radi s tim.
You really have to.	Zaista se mora.
Something has to be done.	Nešto se mora uraditi.
Maybe he even has friends.	Možda čak ima i prijatelja.
They would do it, he knew.	Oni bi to uradili, znao je.
I know it's not.	Znam da nije.
That's how it can happen.	Tako se to može dogoditi.
I didn't know you could do this.	Nisam znao da možeš ovo da uradiš.
But you're wrong.	Ali nisi u pravu.
Which is true.	Što je istina.
Wasn't that true.	Zar to nije bila istina.
He says.	On kaže.
They know the job he did.	Oni znaju posao koji je radio.
He will return.	On će se vratiti.
He won't tell us why.	Neće nam reći zašto.
I don't want them.	Ne želim ih.
It wasn't hard.	Nije bilo teško.
He had no idea before.	Prije toga nije imao pojma.
To work.	Na posao.
It was not easy.	Nije bilo lako.
He still didn't know why he asked.	Još uvijek nije znao zašto je pitao.
It must be new.	Mora da je novi.
She is not a good person.	Ona nije dobra osoba.
This may not be true.	Ovo ne može biti tačno.
I got this this morning.	Dobio sam ovo jutros.
But now, no.	Ali sada, ne.
For me, it's nothing.	Za mene to nije ništa.
I know you should.	Znam da bi trebalo.
I wish they had done better, actually.	Voleo bih da su to uradili bolje, zapravo.
I saw him do it.	Video sam ga kako to radi.
Who knew, probably did.	Ko je znao, verovatno jeste.
She said that could not be true.	Rekla je da to ne može biti istina.
In fact, it is.	U stvari jeste.
If he's still here, we'll find him tomorrow.	Ako je još uvijek ovdje, naći ćemo ga sutra.
There is a reason for that.	Postoji razlog za to.
I expected that.	Očekivao sam to.
He was sure it was her.	Bio je siguran da je to ona.
Much more could have been done.	Moglo se učiniti mnogo više.
It's your only job.	To je tvoj jedini posao.
He's just an idea now.	On je sada samo ideja.
They didn't do it.	Oni to nisu uradili.
No, that's not it.	Ne, to nije to.
That it happened.	Da se to dogodilo.
And he knew.	I on je znao.
We work here as a team.	Ovdje radimo kao tim.
I can't even.	Ne mogu čak.
He never told us about this!	Nikad nam nije rekao za ovo!
He does everything he says he does.	Radi sve što kaže da radi.
No one should buy this.	Ovo niko ne bi trebao kupiti.
Can you help?	Možete li pomoći?
He asked about you.	Pitao je za tebe.
This would be good.	Ovo bi bilo dobro.
I'm the one he needs.	Ja sam taj koji mu treba.
You’ve done it too many times.	Uradili ste to previše puta.
And so on.	I tako dalje.
He did things.	Uradio je stvari.
I could talk to anyone about anything.	Mogao sam razgovarati sa bilo kim o bilo čemu.
This one is for everyone.	Ovaj je za sve.
You must have needed it.	Mora da ti je trebao.
I really don't need this.	Ovo mi stvarno ne treba.
Are you with me?	Jesi li sa mnom?
I don't want to talk to you.	Ne želim razgovarati s tobom.
He can't not.	Ne može ne.
It was hard to say exactly what he meant.	Bilo je teško reći šta tačno misli.
There is still work to be done.	Ima još toga da se uradi.
But now was not the time.	Ali sada nije bilo vrijeme.
It was good to be back.	Bilo je dobro vratiti se.
And we can't bring that back.	I to ne možemo vratiti.
You have to trust me.	Moraš mi vjerovati.
He thought not.	Mislio je da nije.
He already has it for you.	On to već ima za tebe.
We know what to do.	Znamo šta da radimo.
So we have.	Tako imamo.
If you do, this is for you.	Ako to uradite, ovo je za vas.
Who can help me?	Ko mi može pomoći?
You can work alone.	Možete raditi sami.
He did this.	Ovo je uradio.
He said it to himself.	Rekao je to sebi.
I saw it.	Video sam to.
You're not well.	Nisi dobro.
There was no time for more.	Nije bilo vremena za više.
She will be fine.	Ona će biti dobro.
This was so.	Ovo je bilo tako.
I want to do things for myself.	Želim da radim stvari za sebe.
I'll give him that much.	Toliko ću mu dati.
For any of us.	Za bilo koga od nas.
I would expect that to be done.	Očekivao bih da se to uradi.
But only a little.	Ali samo malo.
The truth is the truth.	Istina je istina.
I never wanted to go there.	Nikada nisam želeo da idem tamo.
I won't get it.	Neću dobiti.
You know you want one.	Znaš da želiš jedan.
But he never said much.	Ali nikad nije rekao mnogo.
I can believe it.	Mogu vjerovati.
But what if.	Ali šta ako.
But there may be more to it.	Ali možda ima više toga.
The game is everything.	Igra je sve.
You are not the first.	Nisi prvi.
I came to tell you something.	Došao sam da ti kažem nešto.
He did just that.	On je uradio upravo to.
This can't be it.	Ovo ne može biti to.
He never does that.	On to nikad ne čini.
He must want better.	Mora da želi bolje.
In fact, he didn't know if something was really going on.	U stvari, nije znao da li se nešto zaista dešava.
Other than that, there probably weren’t a lot of things.	Osim toga vjerovatno nije bilo puno stvari.
No, more than that.	Ne, više od toga.
But it's not good.	Ali nije dobro.
I think you're right.	Mislim da si u pravu.
Which is not happening.	Što se ne dešava.
If he wants something, he will find it.	Ako nešto želi, naći će.
Or even what he is.	Ili čak šta on jeste.
I knew you would come back.	Znao sam da ćeš se vratiti.
I guess so.	Pretpostavljam da jeste.
And she didn't know why.	I nije znala zašto.
That was my job.	To je bio moj posao.
There is a new one.	Postoji novi.
I never knew what to say.	Nikad nisam znao šta da kažem.
I'll tell you now.	Reći ću ti sada.
I know what to do.	Znam šta da radim.
All if it is.	Sve ako jeste.
I do not have to.	Ne moram.
A first for any of us.	Prvi za bilo koga od nas.
He saw the truth about himself.	Vidio je istinu o sebi.
I asked how long he had been there.	Pitao sam koliko je dugo bio tamo.
Now is the time to say.	Sada je vrijeme da kažem.
You never know.	Nikad se ne zna.
This was supposed to be.	Ovo je trebalo da bude.
I'm not sure if it's good or bad.	Nisam siguran da li je to dobro ili loše.
I'm not so sure.	Nisam tako siguran.
She knew what she was planning.	Znala je šta planira.
What we knew to be true is not true.	Ono što smo znali da je istina nije istina.
That is unlikely here.	To ovdje nije vjerovatno.
What if.	Šta ako .
Does anyone know how to do this.	Zna li neko kako to treba uraditi.
You shouldn't go alone.	Ne bi trebao ići sam.
I can't do this.	Ne mogu ovo da uradim.
It just couldn’t have happened.	To se jednostavno nije moglo dogoditi.
And you know.	I ti znaš.
Like, everyone knows that.	Kao, svi to znaju.
This could be it.	Ovo bi moglo biti to.
The code works.	Kod i radi.
It took me a while.	Trebalo mi je malo vremena.
What would anyone want.	Šta bi ko želeo.
I didn't ask to be.	Nisam tražio da budem.
It was very likely.	Vrlo vjerovatno je bilo.
That will help.	To će pomoći.
So neither are they.	Tako da nisu ni oni.
He will help us.	On će nam pomoći.
Time moves on.	Vrijeme ide dalje.
It's here.	Tu je.
I just had you.	Upravo sam te imao.
Or it was true.	Ili je bilo istina.
It just couldn’t have happened.	To se jednostavno nije moglo dogoditi.
They know it.	Oni to znaju.
What is, is.	Šta jeste, jeste.
She didn't know.	Nije znala.
And we have to.	I moramo.
I want to know.	Želim da znam.
That's very good.	To je jako dobro.
I didn't want to.	Nisam htela.
But no one wanted that.	Ali niko to nije želeo.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
I think how bad it can be.	Mislim koliko loše može biti.
He was just a guy.	Bio je samo momak.
See what he says.	Vidi šta kaže.
This and much more.	Ovo i mnogo više.
The only friend in the house.	Jedini prijatelj u kući.
But that was her.	Ali to je bila ona.
He knows how to do it, so many things.	On to zna da radi, toliko stvari.
It almost looks like it's not there.	Skoro da izgleda kao da ga nema.
No one said anything, she told herself.	Niko ništa nije rekao, rekla je sebi.
That may not be the case.	To možda i nije.
Now the problem is that this is always true.	Sada je problem da je to uvijek istina.
In fact, it was.	U stvari, bilo je.
Which should be enough.	Što bi trebalo biti dovoljno.
I didn't mean what you meant.	Nisam mislio ono što si mislio.
Doing is my thing.	Raditi je moja stvar.
I am still one of ‘us’.	I dalje sam jedan od 'nas'.
It could be.	To bi moglo biti.
That shouldn't be there.	To ne bi trebalo biti tamo.
That maybe he left this time.	Da je možda ovaj put otišao.
Like yours.	Kao i tvoj.
We know how to do it better than anyone.	Znamo kako to učiniti bolje od bilo koga.
You don't have to do anything.	Ne moraš ništa da radiš.
You need it now.	Treba ti odmah.
And he thought so.	I on je to mislio.
There's just something else.	Samo postoji još nešto.
This hasn't happened here in a long time.	Ovo se ovdje dugo nije dogodilo.
He did a lot for me.	Učinio je mnogo za mene.
You want something better.	Želiš nešto bolje.
I'm not afraid of anyone.	Ne bojim se nikoga.
More to give.	Više za dati.
I couldn't tell.	Nisam mogao reći.
I knew it would be good.	Znao sam da će biti dobro.
She said she did.	Rekla je da jeste.
He wanted you.	Želio je tebe.
I already know who it is.	Ja već znam ko je to.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
It wears well.	Dobro se nosi.
I don't know, something more.	Ne znam, nešto više.
I would be glad.	Bilo bi mi drago.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I do not know either.	Ne znam ni ja.
This is the first time.	Ovo je prvi put.
Nobody knows anything.	Niko ništa ne zna.
It just so happens.	To se jednostavno tako dešava.
This was bad.	Ovo je bilo loše.
I didn't expect it.	Nisam očekivao.
You had.	Imali ste.
And if so, it could be true.	A da je tako, moglo bi biti istina.
What we have is real.	Ono što imamo je stvarno.
He probably thought he did.	Verovatno je i sam mislio da jeste.
You know how it is.	Znaš kako je.
I didn't work at all.	Nisam uopšte radio.
I don't think anyone will.	Mislim da niko neće.
It's pretty bad now.	Sada je prilično loše.
I didn't buy anything.	Nisam ništa kupio.
He couldn't help himself.	Nije si mogao pomoći.
I won't see you tonight.	Neću te vidjeti večeras.
Even that is fine.	Čak je i to u redu.
No one can say.	Niko ne može reći.
And he came back.	I vratio se.
She is no longer afraid of him.	Ona ga se više ne boji.
Was it really you?	Jesi li to stvarno bio ti?
He was still good.	I dalje je bio dobar.
But if he knew.	Ali kad bi znao.
I don't know if he will.	Ne znam da li hoće.
And he still had his life.	I još je imao svoj život.
Just one more.	Samo još jedan.
Or maybe earlier.	Ili možda ranije.
That’s exactly the way we did it.	To je upravo način na koji smo to uradili.
She probably doesn't know.	Ona vjerovatno ne zna.
He's still here.	On je još uvijek ovdje.
It's the first day.	Prvi je dan.
Is that one.	Je li to jedan.
It's a game.	To je igra.
But here we were.	Ali tu smo bili.
Someone was at home.	Neko je bio kod kuće.
I already have the money.	Već imam novac.
It was probably good.	Vjerovatno je bilo dobro.
I'm not even sure.	Nisam ni siguran.
And he was right.	I on je bio u pravu.
It's about what he does.	Radi se o tome šta radi.
She was alone.	Bila je sama.
I didn't see that either.	Ni ja to nisam vidio.
As you can see.	Kao što možete vidjeti .
Nobody would buy it.	Niko to ne bi kupio.
It is anything but.	To je sve samo ne.
But he was ready for me.	Ali bio je spreman za mene.
And you need something like that.	I treba ti tako nešto.
It was just one, you could say.	Bio je to samo jedan, moglo bi se reći.
If you haven’t had it in a while, it’s really good.	Ako ga niste imali neko vrijeme, zaista je dobar.
I just did that.	Upravo sam to uradio.
And no one tells us.	I niko nam ne govori.
I'm not sure if much more.	Nisam siguran da li još mnogo toga.
I just said.	Upravo sam rekao.
I've been.	Bio sam.
I knew everything.	Sve sam znao.
I hope you like it.	Nadam se da vam se sviđa.
You are the father of all.	Ti si otac svima.
I don't know how they will be able to do that.	Ne znam kako će oni to moći.
But live today.	Ali živi danas.
But it's time to say that's enough.	Ali vrijeme je da se kaže da je dosta.
Obviously this is still not true.	Očigledno to još uvijek nije istina.
Not like us.	Ne kao mi.
But we knew who knew.	Ali znali smo ko zna.
I won't say which one.	Neću reći koji.
He needed people.	Trebali su mu ljudi.
The sooner he comes, the better for us.	Što prije dođe, to bolje za nas.
I think more people should be like that.	Mislim da bi više ljudi trebalo da bude tako.
I can't find it right now.	Ne mogu ga naći trenutno.
This is just the way it should be.	Ovo je baš kako treba da bude.
So good.	Tako dobro.
I have no idea if he will.	Nemam pojma da li hoće.
But it's hard for him to be with us.	Ali teško mu je biti sa nama.
And it never will be.	I nikada neće biti.
We have everything we need here.	Ovde imamo sve što nam treba.
It looks very good.	Vrlo dobro izgleda.
But maybe you will.	Ali možda hoćeš.
You can say that again, and again.	To možete reći ponovo, i ponovo.
I can't do this alone.	Ne mogu ovo sam.
But the problem was still there.	Ali problem je i dalje bio tu.
You're doing this.	Ti radiš ovo.
He tried again.	Pokušao je ponovo.
This cannot be true.	Ovo ne može biti istina.
Everything is going well for us here.	Ovdje nam ide sve kako treba.
I think it was just me.	Mislim da sam to bio samo ja.
I could talk.	Mogao bih razgovarati.
They didn't do it.	Oni to nisu uradili.
He couldn't say why he thought so.	Nije mogao reći zašto tako misli.
I couldn't do this.	Nisam mogao ovo da uradim.
You had a bad day.	Imao si loš dan.
There was something wrong with what happened.	Nešto nije bilo u tome što se dogodilo.
It's a video game.	Je video igra.
None of us were ready for that.	Niko od nas nije bio spreman za to.
I didn't work with him.	Nisam radio sa njim.
But we knew, when you left, that you would return.	Ali znali smo, kada si otišao, da ćeš se vratiti.
That's what he said.	Tako je rekao.
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
I think he thought not.	Mislim da je mislio da nije.
He didn't mean to do that.	Nije mislio to učiniti.
Not much time, but maybe enough.	Ne baš puno vremena, ali možda dovoljno.
That's too much, too much.	To je previše, previše.
It's not as easy as you think.	Nije tako lako kao što mislite.
But today it will be.	Ali danas će biti.
I don't want him either.	Ni ja ga ne želim.
I'm not here to be friends with anyone.	Nisam ovde da bih bio prijatelj sa bilo kim.
This is a better job.	Ovo je bolji posao.
I will never say ‘maybe’.	Nikada neću reći 'možda'.
And there are a lot of them.	A ima ih puno.
It was a very good job.	Bio je to veoma dobar posao.
He has a lot of friends.	Ima puno prijatelja.
And so it is.	I tako je.
You should come.	Trebali biste doći.
But now you're safe.	Ali sada si siguran.
This is really bad.	Ovo je stvarno loše.
Again and again and again.	Ponovo i ponovo i ponovo.
But they didn't know enough.	Ali nisu znali dovoljno.
That was this.	To je bilo ovo.
He knows how.	On zna kako.
I am nothing anymore.	Ja više nisam ništa.
I did a good job.	Uradio sam dobar posao.
Nothing is easy.	Ništa nije lako.
I'm there.	Tamo sam.
It has always been so, and probably always will be.	Tako je uvijek bilo, a vjerovatno će uvijek i biti.
I wouldn't know.	Ne bih znao.
I know what you're going to say.	Znam šta ćeš reći.
I did something.	Uradio sam nešto.
And it works for me.	I radi za mene.
It would be good not to see her.	Bilo bi dobro da je ne vidi.
And there were plenty of them.	A bilo ih je dosta.
Except me.	Osim mene.
He could have been here.	Mogao je biti ovdje.
That would be really bad.	To bi zaista bilo loše.
He has to give something, and soon.	Nešto mora dati, i to uskoro.
I never understood this.	Ovo nikad nisam shvatio.
It could be anyone.	Mogao bi biti bilo ko.
But that should happen soon.	Ali to bi se uskoro trebalo dogoditi.
You do what you are told.	Radiš šta ti se kaže.
Now she knew she would have to.	Sada je znala da će morati.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
It was a little while ago.	Bilo je to malo prije.
And I wanted to go there.	I ja sam htela da idem tamo.
We won't do anything.	Nećemo ništa učiniti.
I got there.	Stigao sam tamo.
It works well enough.	Radi dovoljno dobro.
He tried to see.	Pokušao je da vidi.
She said she had no money.	Rekla je da nema novca.
I can't go home.	Ne mogu se vratiti kući.
I could go.	Mogao bih otići.
But that is not happening.	Ali to se ne dešava.
The problem may not be as bad as it seems.	Problem možda i nije tako loš kao što se čini.
I just want to be alone, today.	Samo želim da budem sama, danas.
But this is happening.	Ali ovo se dešava.
I like it very much.	Sviđa mi se jako.
Actually it doesn't exist at all.	Zapravo uopšte ne postoji.
That is what we should talk about.	To je ono o čemu bismo trebali razgovarati.
He didn't ask if she was alone.	Nije pitao da li je sama.
And yes, it can go anywhere.	I da, može ići bilo gdje.
But it doesn't have to be.	Ali ne mora biti.
No, we can't do that.	Ne, ne možemo to da uradimo.
You can trust us.	Možete nam vjerovati.
But, you know, that's okay.	Ali, znaš, to je u redu.
Now it's like it never was.	Sada kao da nikad nije bilo.
Like it's never enough.	Kao da nikad nije dosta.
She has no more.	Ona nema više.
In fact, she still works.	U stvari, ona i dalje radi.
Even more times.	Čak i više puta.
Nothing was as it seemed.	Ništa nije bilo kako se činilo.
If it did, it would work.	Da jeste, radio bi.
It's nothing.	Nije ništa.
I'm not saying it's easy, but it can be done.	Ne kažem da je lako, ali se može.
I did not get.	Nisam dobio.
They were none of those things.	Nisu bili ništa od toga.
I like the idea.	Sviđa mi se ideja.
This is simply not true.	Ovo jednostavno nije istina.
He went there.	Otišao je tamo.
It works well.	Radi dobro.
He had problems when he started.	Imao je problema kada je počeo.
You did well.	Dobro si uradio.
She wants to see.	Ona želi da vidi.
It seems to be working.	Izgleda da radi.
He just needs help.	Jednostavno mu treba pomoć.
I can't see her now.	Ne mogu je sada vidjeti.
You said it yourself.	Sam si to rekao.
Never enough talk.	Nikad dosta priča.
Real.	Pravi.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
I wouldn't give this to anyone.	Ne bih ovo dao nikome.
That's very, very bad.	To je veoma, veoma loše.
We don't need it now.	Ne treba nam sada.
Nobody had it.	Niko ga nije imao.
It works well.	Dobro radi.
I shouldn't say that.	Ne bih to trebao reći.
This has never happened to me before.	Ovo mi se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
He could stay with us tonight.	Mogao bi ostati kod nas večeras.
It was just as he expected.	Bilo je baš kako je očekivao.
It looks bad, and it's bad.	Izgleda loše, i to je loše.
I've never worked as hard as I do now.	Nikada nisam toliko radio kao sada.
If you want me, that's it.	Ako hoćeš mene, to je.
And always will be.	I uvek će biti.
That's what he's doing here.	To je ono što on radi ovdje.
Do what she says.	Uradi šta ona kaže.
He needed to do a lot of things.	Trebao je uraditi mnogo stvari.
Maybe even your life.	Možda čak i tvoj život.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
What if it's just.	Šta ako je samo.
That's a lot more.	To je mnogo više.
I want more.	Želim još.
I am happy to be able to come and help.	Sretan sam što mogu doći i pomoći.
I can't go back.	Ne mogu se vratiti.
She is, indeed.	Ona je, zaista.
He knows what he's doing.	On zna šta radi.
That's all, but much more.	Sve je to, ali mnogo više.
I know this, you know this.	Ja znam ovo, ti znaš ovo.
And now me.	A sada ja.
He! ' 	On!'
he said.	on je rekao.
This one does the job.	Ovaj radi posao.
I would too.	I ja bih bio.
I told him it was a game.	Rekao sam mu da je to igra.
The day before.	Dan ranije.
I'm glad for that.	Drago mi je zbog toga.
I just decided.	Upravo sam odlučio.
I think you can help me, even find him.	Mislim da mi možeš pomoći, čak i naći ga.
You're not me.	Ti nisi ja.
Missing!	Ne, dosta je!
I'm totally on it.	Potpuno sam na tome.
You don't have to tell anyone.	Ne moraš nikome reći.
He just isn't there.	Jednostavno ga nema.
We usually do something simple.	Obično radimo nešto jednostavno.
We have to move on.	Moramo dalje.
It is still true.	I dalje je istina.
He came back again.	Ponovo se vratio.
There are a lot of things.	Ima dosta stvari.
It doesn't always work.	Ne radi uvijek.
I know that's true.	Znam da je to istina.
No one wanted to talk to me anymore.	Niko više nije htio razgovarati sa mnom.
And so they did.	I tako su i uradili.
There are very few of them.	Vrlo malo ih je.
Surely they are safe here.	Sigurno su ovdje sigurni.
That may not be the case.	To možda nije tako.
He is back.	Vratio se.
He knew where he was.	Znao je gdje je.
He was fine.	Bio je dobro.
That was quite difficult for me.	To mi je bilo prilično teško.
But we will find a way.	Ali naći ćemo način.
He really tried.	On je zaista pokušao.
I've never been home.	Nikad nisam bio kod kuće.
He didn't really seem to have many friends.	Čini se da zapravo nije imao mnogo prijatelja.
I'll tell you what we'll do.	Ja ću vam reći šta ćemo učiniti.
Maybe there is.	Možda ima.
But it doesn't work for everyone.	Ali ne radi svima.
He wants you to tell him all about it.	Želi da mu kažeš sve o tome.
I thought this could be them.	Mislio sam da bi ovo mogli biti oni.
This could not be allowed.	Ovo se nije moglo dozvoliti.
A friend had to tell me it wasn’t my story.	Prijatelj mi je morao reći da to nije moja priča.
Just me.	Samo mi.
He will always be with us.	Uvek će biti sa nama.
This is the time.	Ovo je vrijeme.
I didn't have to.	Nisam morao.
This is a long question.	Ovo je dugo pitanje.
No one can be sure.	Niko ne može biti siguran.
We know each other.	Znamo se.
Not here, obviously.	Ne ovde, očigledno.
That would be a.	To bi bilo a.
I just don't know what to do.	Samo ne znam šta da radim.
You're doing this.	Ovo radiš.
Not my team.	Ne moj tim.
Everyone there knows me.	Tamo me svi znaju.
All right, so far.	U redu, do sada.
That was all.	Sve je to bilo.
Lots of someone.	Puno nekoga.
Long enough for both.	Dovoljno dugo za oboje.
He got what he wanted.	Dobio je šta je želeo.
He needed a job.	Trebao mu je posao.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
He came and went.	Došao je i otišao.
But that just hasn’t happened yet.	Ali to se jednostavno još nije dogodilo.
Not anymore.	Ne više.
He must have heard.	Mora da je čuo.
In fact, you can do it right now.	Zapravo, možete to učiniti upravo sada.
I don't see it as a problem.	Ne vidim to kao problem.
And we need that.	I to nam treba.
And in that.	I u tome.
Maybe nothing is here.	Možda ništa nije ovde.
He wasn't sure what he was going to do.	Nije bio siguran šta je mislio da uradi.
Maybe he would.	Možda bi.
No one can leave.	Niko ne može otići.
It wasn't the first time.	Nije bilo prvi put.
I didn't want to know if he could do it.	Nisam htela da znam da li on to može.
You know you have a day.	Znaš da imaš dan.
That never happened.	To se nikada nije dogodilo.
Indeed, he was.	Zaista, bio je.
We have to go now.	Moramo ići odmah.
That is completely true.	To je potpuno tačno.
And, yes, that was me.	I, da, to sam bio ja.
That's not enough.	Toga nema dovoljno.
You have to come back.	Morate se vratiti.
Which is neither here nor there.	Što nije ni ovdje ni tamo.
You will know better than me.	Ti ćeš znati bolje od mene.
Nobody told me how to do it.	Niko mi nije rekao kako da to uradim.
What is it.	Što je.
This is fine.	Ovo je u redu.
I wonder what he thinks.	Pitam se šta on misli.
Obviously you will have to do more.	Očigledno ćete morati učiniti više.
Some of it.	Nešto od toga.
But he wants more.	Ali želi više.
He said he had to go back to work.	Rekao je da se morao vratiti na posao.
He went home.	Otišao je kući.
That is not a question.	To nije pitanje.
He was a good man, and he was my friend.	Bio je dobar čovjek, i bio mi je prijatelj.
He didn't expect to find much.	Nije očekivao da će naći mnogo.
We were too.	I mi smo bili.
Yeah, maybe that's just the thing.	Da, možda je to upravo stvar.
He's not here properly.	On nije ovdje kako treba.
I would like to.	Volio bih.
I could buy this.	Mogao bih ovo kupiti.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
Maybe that's what he thinks, and maybe it's true.	Možda je to ono što on misli, a možda je i istina.
Yes! 	Da!
even so.	čak i tako.
He never said.	Nikad nije rekao.
This should be done earlier.	Ovo bi trebalo uraditi ranije.
Time waits for no one.	Vrijeme ne čeka nikoga.
You know there is another problem.	Znate da postoji još jedan problem.
This is very difficult for me.	Ovo mi je jako teško.
Maybe it was that simple.	Možda je bilo tako jednostavno.
This was a happy day.	Ovo je bio sretan dan.
There seemed to be no time.	Činilo se kao da nema vremena.
Maybe things are fine now.	Možda su sada stvari u redu.
Now that you are here you must stay.	Sada kada ste ovdje morate ostati.
Not that you would know that.	Nije da biste to znali.
He promised to help.	Obećao je da će pomoći.
He expected that.	Očekivao je to.
He never even saw him.	Nikad ga nije ni video.
It was like he was mine.	Kao da je bio moj.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikome ništa nije rekao.
You are my father.	Ti si moj otac.
I don't really know why.	Ne znam zaista zašto.
No one was there.	Niko nije bio tu.
She knew what she was thinking.	Znala je šta misli.
You know nothing about why you are here.	Ne znate ništa o tome zašto ste ovde.
And so far no one can.	A do sada to niko ne može.
Few knew what he thought or who he was.	Malo ko je znao šta on misli ili ko je on.
There was little we could do now.	Sada smo malo toga mogli učiniti.
It's not enough.	Nije dovoljno.
As it should be.	Kao i trebalo bi.
If that's what you want.	Ako je to ono što želiš.
As far as I know, that never happened.	Koliko ja znam, to se nikada nije dogodilo.
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
I wonder how it was.	Pitam se kako je to bilo.
It all happens very quickly.	Sve se to dešava veoma brzo.
He could be here too.	Mogao bi biti i ovdje.
He wouldn't hear from me again.	Ne bi više čuo za mene.
And you have to do this for the first time.	I ovo morate uraditi prvi put.
You don't seem well.	Čini se da vam nije dobro.
She feels safe.	Osjeća se sigurno.
But probably few people know about it.	Ali vjerovatno malo ko zna za to.
It's good to be back.	Dobro je vratiti se.
He knew they knew something he didn't.	Znao je da oni znaju nešto što on nije znao.
I would love for a guy to do something like that for me.	Voleo bih da momak uradi tako nešto za mene.
Yes, he had.	Da, imao je.
He's just a happy guy.	On je samo sretan momak.
This is not a good thing.	Ovo nije dobra stvar.
We just did that.	Upravo smo to uradili.
I hope you get it.	Nadam se da ćeš dobiti.
Me too.	I ja sam.
It just happened.	Upravo se dogodilo.
He says he actually has but.	Kaže da u stvari ima ali.
Or for life, it seems.	Ili za život, čini se.
We didn't have a house.	Nismo imali kuće.
But even this is pretty obvious.	Ali i ovo je prilično očigledno.
It was just that much money.	Bilo je to samo toliko novca.
This video has just a little more.	Ovaj video ima samo malo više.
Really, really good thing.	Zaista, stvarno dobra stvar.
He can't say when.	Ne može reći kada.
I made it earlier today.	Napravio sam ga ranije danas.
You know a lot.	Znaš mnogo.
I have to go now.	Moram ići sada.
The thing is, it's not.	Stvar je u tome da nije.
That I love her.	Da je volim.
But it obviously happened.	Ali očigledno se dogodilo.
A true friend.	Pravi prijatelj.
That's how it happened.	Tako se to dogodilo.
That is hardly true.	Teško da je to tačno.
And don't be sorry.	I nemoj da ti bude žao.
Something was wrong.	Nešto nije bilo u redu.
Nothing we can do could be done without us.	Ništa što možemo da uradimo ne bi moglo da se uradi bez nas.
And he tried.	I pokušao je.
He wondered what he would do now.	Pitao se šta će sada.
We don't need more money.	Ne treba nam više novca.
It was so bad.	Bilo je tako loše.
I suppose.	Pretpostavljam.
There was too much for me to leave.	Bilo je previše toga da bih otišao.
That will help us.	To će nam pomoći.
I'm sure it's her.	Siguran sam da je to ona.
No, he doesn't know.	Ne, ne zna.
So far no one was.	Do sada niko nije.
She wants you.	Ona te želi.
It was a difficult time for him.	Bilo je to teško vrijeme za njega.
Nothing bad ever happened.	Nikada se ništa loše nije dogodilo.
All this takes time.	Za sve ovo treba vremena.
when.	kada.
I'm not done with it yet.	Nisam još završio s tim.
The reason is this.	Razlog je ovo.
I've heard both.	Čuo sam oboje.
That is exactly what happened here.	To je upravo ono što se ovdje dogodilo.
That can't be it.	To ne može biti to.
I can't say when.	Ne mogu reći kada.
Or they can be.	Ili mogu biti.
That says it all.	To o tome govori sve.
But that was not all.	Ali ni to nije bilo sve.
It's so real.	Tako je stvarno.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ne znam šta mi je.
That may be true, but it doesn't have to be.	To može biti istina, a ne mora.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
You just need a little.	Treba ti samo malo.
That was me three months ago.	To sam bio ja prije tri mjeseca.
Besides, this works.	Osim toga, ovo radi.
Maybe it was.	Možda je bilo tako.
I almost went back to school.	Skoro da sam se vratio u školu.
You can't see that.	Ne možete to vidjeti.
What you do and who you are.	Šta radite i ko ste.
I'll pay you back.	Ja ću ti vratiti.
I've never seen anything like it before.	Nikada ranije nisam video tako nešto.
We just have to.	Samo moramo.
And he needed me.	I trebao sam mu.
If you want.	Ako želiš.
I'm glad you did.	Drago mi je da jeste.
I needed.	Trebao sam.
I can't do anything.	Ne mogu ništa.
That was exactly what it was.	To je bilo upravo ono što je bilo.
He looks good.	On izgleda dobro.
He didn't expect that.	Nije to očekivao.
You don't have to.	Ne treba.
He didn't have to know, he told himself.	Nije morao da zna, rekao je sebi.
Was.	Bilo je.
But it happens.	Ali to se dešava.
You seem to be right.	Čini se da ste u pravu.
And that's not what it is.	A to nije ono što je.
That was as far as possible, he said.	To je bilo što dalje, rekao je.
But now they are gone.	Ali sada ih nema.
But there's nothing she can do about it.	Ali ona tu ništa ne može učiniti.
I don't think anyone can!.	Mislim da niko ne može!.
Except he had.	Osim što je imao.
Something is right.	Nešto je u pravu.
It's good, it's good that she's here.	Dobro je, dobro što je ona ovde.
That's his job.	To mu je posao.
There are many of them.	Mnogo ih je.
It's time for work.	Vrijeme je za posao.
I started well enough.	Počeo sam dovoljno dobro.
I'm just saying it is.	Samo kažem da jeste.
None of us would.	Niko od nas ne bi.
Does not work.	Ne radi.
She was alone.	Bila je sama.
I don't have much to say.	Nemam šta puno reći.
I'm doing well.	Dobro mi ide.
He was not a real father there.	Tamo nije bio pravi otac.
We will go.	Mi ćemo ići.
We do not know.	Ne znamo.
She wants nothing more from him.	Ona ne želi više ništa s njim.
There was a lot of that.	Bilo je dosta toga.
And there is much more.	A ima još mnogo toga.
Just do it.	Samo to uradi.
It should help a lot.	Trebalo bi puno pomoći.
Tell me your problem.	Reci mi svoj problem.
He knows he can never win.	Zna da nikada ne može pobijediti.
This was the right team.	Ovo je bio pravi tim.
There is nobody.	Nema nikoga.
If not already.	Ako već nije.
You just can’t see them.	Jednostavno ih ne možete vidjeti.
Tell me what you think.	Reci mi šta misliš.
The work is not so bad.	Posao nije tako loš.
My father gave it to me this morning.	Otac mi ga je dao jutros.
And he wanted to say so much.	I toliko je toga želio reći.
I need to have a car.	Treba da imam auto.
You do it well.	To radiš dobro.
It's enough.	Dosta mi je.
No, they are not.	Ne, nisu oni.
Can you believe it?	Možeš li vjerovati?
He told me.	Rekao mi.
It just seemed.	Samo se činilo.
Where have we been?	Gdje smo bili?
They told us we knew nothing.	Rekli su nam da ništa ne znamo.
We know what happened next.	Znamo šta se dalje dogodilo.
And there was something.	I bilo je nešto.
She said it took time.	Rekla je da je trebalo vremena.
Good question!	Dobro pitanje!
Someone needs to do it.	Neko to treba da uradi.
It's pretty simple.	To je prilično jednostavno.
It seems to be working now.	Čini se da sada radi.
I think he came here because of you.	Mislim da je došao ovde zbog tebe.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
So simple.	Tako jednostavno.
I don't know when.	Ne znam kada.
I think he's there.	Mislim da je tamo.
I quickly understood.	Brzo sam shvatio.
And it shows.	I to se vidi.
It can be.	To može biti.
Please, you have to trust me.	Molim te, moraš mi vjerovati.
Sure, he didn't have it.	Sigurno, nije ga imao.
I'm glad you're with us today.	Drago mi je da si danas sa nama.
And I know a lot about that.	I znam puno o tome.
We can do more tomorrow.	Možemo više sutra.
He's just trying to help.	On samo pokušava da pomogne.
I wasn't looking for a job.	Nisam tražio posao.
I told him many things that only he would know to be true.	Rekao sam mu mnogo toga za šta bi samo on znao da je istina.
I don't know what to do with him.	Ne znam šta da radim s njim.
There was little to say.	Bilo je malo toga za reći.
That's exactly what he did.	To je upravo ono što je on uradio.
He decided to work from home.	Odlučio je da radi kod kuće.
He lost his job, and he should have.	Izgubio je posao, a trebao je.
I don't know how many days it was.	Ne znam koliko je dana bilo.
I'm not sure it is.	Nisam siguran da jeste.
You haven't heard anything yet.	Još ništa nisi čuo.
Here we are.	Tu smo mi.
It was a very bad time for me.	Bilo je to jako loše vrijeme za mene.
I can't say that.	Ne mogu to reći.
She didn't want to talk about it.	Nije htela da priča o tome.
He said nothing.	Nije rekao ništa.
Just more.	Samo više.
I knew he would come.	Znao sam da će doći.
But it is much more than that.	Ali radi se i o mnogo više od toga.
I just thought.	Samo sam mislio.
We just couldn’t help it.	Jednostavno nismo mogli pomoći.
We know he loves his job.	Znamo da voli svoj posao.
But enough of me.	Ali dosta od mene.
I can't find him.	Ne mogu ga naći.
I never saw her.	Nikad je nisam vidio.
We were a team.	Bili smo tim.
You can't see them.	Ne možete ih vidjeti.
I said he was gone.	Rekao sam da ga više nema.
She doesn't speak.	Ona ne govori.
Nothing seemed to happen.	Činilo se da se ništa nije dogodilo.
You can't stay here.	Ne možeš ostati ovdje.
Now this is small.	Sada je ovo malo.
I was there for him.	Bio sam tu zbog njega.
And true, more than not.	I istina, više nego ne.
All right, she told herself.	U redu, rekla je sebi.
I heard all that.	Čuo sam sve to.
People who are like you.	Ljudi koji su kao ti.
You just never saw me.	Samo me nikad nisi vidio.
I saw him at a party.	Video sam ga na zabavi.
That's what you said.	Tako si rekao.
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
Anyone is fine with me.	Bilo ko je u redu sa mnom.
They were on us.	Bili su na nama.
That should be correct.	To bi trebalo biti tačno.
Yes, it's okay, you don't have to go.	Da, u redu je, ne morate ići.
It's so good.	Tako je dobro.
He had nothing to do with it.	Nije imao ništa s tim.
But for now, what you are doing is very good.	Ali za sada, ovo što radite je jako dobro.
Yes, right there.	Da, upravo tamo.
None of that.	Ništa od toga.
You can know without knowing.	Možete znati a da ne znate.
I asked.	Pitao sam.
That's too much for anyone.	To je previše za bilo koga.
And it looks good.	I izgleda dobro.
They are as sure as we know.	Oni su sigurni koliko znamo.
Which he usually is.	Što on obično i jeste.
There will be a lot of people there.	Tamo će biti puno ljudi.
But we know they are not.	Ali znamo da nisu.
Now that would never happen.	Sada se to nikada ne bi dogodilo.
It's pretty much what he did.	Prilično je to što je uradio.
And maybe it was.	A možda je to i bilo.
She means well and just wants to help.	Ona misli dobro i samo želi pomoći.
That's what he would say.	Tako bi on to rekao.
None of us would.	Niko od nas ne bi.
Don't do this again.	Ne radi ovo ponovo.
It used to be a problem.	Nekada je to bio problem.
It's nothing.	Nije ništa.
In fact, it didn’t take as long as you think.	Zapravo, nije trebalo toliko koliko mislite.
It's just this.	To je jednostavno ovo.
Not knowing what it is that you know.	Da ne znaš šta je to što znaš.
The only way.	Jedini način.
Is that.	Je li to.
We certainly aren't.	Mi sigurno nismo.
She didn't know what to tell him.	Nije znala šta da mu kaže.
You were wrong at the time.	Nisi bio u pravu u to vrijeme.
Maybe there was something in it.	Možda je bilo nešto u tome.
But I can't.	Ali ne mogu.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Nije mogao više.
Very often he wanted to be.	Vrlo često je to htio biti.
She is the reason we can do it.	Ona je razlog zašto to možemo.
It was really hard.	Bilo je zaista teško.
I was very.	Bio sam veoma.
He should be home by now.	Do sada bi trebao biti kod kuće.
She didn't tell me anything about it.	Nije mi rekla ništa o tome.
I want you.	Želim te.
I really didn't.	Zaista nisam.
I did more than that.	Uradio sam više od toga.
I love school.	Volim školu.
It was someone.	Bio je to neko.
So far so good.	Do sada je sve dobro.
I'm not there yet.	Nisam još tamo.
Maybe he already has it.	Možda ga već ima.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
I'm going.	idem.
That's why we're here tonight.	Zbog toga smo večeras ovdje.
He would get there.	On bi stigao tamo.
He must have known that.	Mora da je to znao.
It will come to me.	Doći će do mene.
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
He would never love you.	Nikad te ne bi voleo.
More than he wants.	Više nego što želi.
I’m not sure that’s going to happen.	Nisam siguran da će se to dogoditi.
Everyone had it.	Svi su ga imali.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
I'm not sure what you mean.	Nisam siguran na šta misliš.
That was your job.	To je bio tvoj posao.
He doesn't do anything.	On ništa ne radi.
It seemed that one must always know more.	Činilo se da se uvijek mora znati više.
And so I did.	I tako sam i uradio.
That it is so.	Da je tako.
He's your friend.	On je tvoj prijatelj.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
But he didn't know everything.	Ali nije znao sve.
I think everyone should win.	Mislim da bi svi trebali pobijediti.
I will never do anything.	Nikada ništa neću uraditi.
Never say that.	Nikad to ne reci.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
We would never know this.	Ovo nikada ne bismo znali.
New.	Novi.
It looks almost completely good.	Izgleda skoro potpuno dobro.
There must have been a problem.	Sigurno je bilo problema.
You're doing the right thing.	Radiš pravu stvar.
We are in it together.	Zajedno smo u tome.
Only this week !.	Samo ove sedmice!.
But it was that simple.	Ali bilo je tako jednostavno.
I don't want to know.	Ne želim da znam.
I told him thirty.	Rekao sam mu trideset.
That's what I did.	Tako sam i uradio.
But there are problems here.	Ali ovdje ima problema.
That no one would ever love me.	Da me niko nikad ne bi voleo.
I really needed that.	To mi je stvarno trebalo.
So far, so good.	Za sada sve radi dobro.
I'm still not sure how.	Još uvijek nisam siguran kako.
That might be enough.	To bi moglo biti dovoljno.
It shouldn't take much.	Ne bi trebalo puno.
Maybe that was okay.	Možda je to bilo u redu.
He probably wanted something better for you than he wanted.	Verovatno je želeo nešto bolje za vas nego što je želeo.
He's pretty good.	On je prilično dobar.
You are not a good person.	Ti nisi dobra osoba.
Not that it should have been, but it was.	Nije da je trebalo, ali jeste.
I tried everything myself.	Pokušao sam sve sam.
Now is the time to ask a few.	Sada je vrijeme da pitam nekoliko.
What he knew was that it was real.	Ono što je znao je da je to stvarno.
That's not why you're here.	Nisi zbog toga ovde.
That's what it's for.	Za to je to.
And so we are a new man.	I tako smo novi čovjek.
he said.	on je rekao.
No, it's not my life without power.	Ne, to nije moj život bez moći.
He's fine too.	Dobro je i on.
I'm sorry.	Žao mi je.
It was very difficult to leave.	Bilo je veoma teško otići.
But it was actually pretty good.	Ali zapravo je bilo prilično dobro.
I told you earlier.	Rekao sam ti ranije.
He's better now.	Odmah mu je bolje.
Obviously she has it.	Očigledno je da ona to ima.
I guess that might be okay too.	Pretpostavljam da bi i to moglo biti u redu.
I said for sure, when.	Rekao sam sigurno, kada.
He left and never came back.	Otišao je i više se nije vratio.
I love these things.	Volim ove stvari.
But your father didn't.	Ali tvoj otac nije.
There is still much to do.	Ima još mnogo toga da se uradi.
What can be said to that.	Šta se može reći na to.
He would never do such a thing.	On nikada ne bi uradio tako nešto.
Nobody liked her.	Niko je nije voleo.
That it wasn't as bad as it really was.	Da nije bilo tako loše kao što je zaista bilo.
We can still meet.	Još se možemo naći.
I just couldn't.	Jednostavno nisam mogao.
She has to.	Ona mora.
Usually not, but your father did.	Obično nisu, ali tvoj otac jeste.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nisam uradio ništa loše.
He always says that.	On to uvek kaže.
I lost my job.	Izgubio sam posao.
Please, you have to trust me now.	Molim te, moraš mi sada vjerovati.
You said it couldn't happen.	Rekli ste da se to ne može dogoditi.
That in itself would be difficult.	To bi samo po sebi bilo teško.
A lot can happen during that time.	Mnogo toga se može dogoditi za to vrijeme.
Good for you.	Dobro za tebe.
But she never told him anything.	Ali ona mu nikad ništa nije rekla.
He's better right away.	Odmah mu je bolje.
Yes, that's right.	Da, tako.
I am true without someone to hear it.	Ja sam istina bez nekoga ko bi je čuo.
I can't seem to do that anymore.	Čini se da to više ne mogu.
Besides, this was my friend.	Osim toga, ovo je bio moj prijatelj.
He just went to do it.	Samo je otišao da to uradi.
Or see.	Ili vidi.
There are a lot of things to see.	Ima puno stvari za vidjeti.
You didn't see him.	Nisi ga vidio.
I was here.	Bio sam ovde.
This is not so.	Ovo nije baš tako.
Maybe there is something we can do.	Možda postoji nešto što možemo učiniti.
Houses are not money.	Kuće nisu novac.
It's hard to know what to believe.	Teško je znati u šta vjerovati.
And just in time.	I baš na vrijeme.
Which would be better.	Što bi bilo bolje.
And there's too much money.	I ima previše novca.
Yes, that's good.	Da, to je dobro.
And so he said.	I tako je rekao.
So they are no more.	Tako da više nisu.
And a good thing.	I dobra stvar.
I couldn't tell who it was.	Nisam mogao reći ko je to bio.
It was simple this.	Bilo je jednostavno ovo.
Really easy to give.	Zaista lako dati.
I have a car.	Imam auto.
But it usually isn't.	Ali obično nije.
It never will be.	Nikada neće biti.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
We couldn't go back.	Nismo se mogli vratiti.
I guess you shouldn't be here.	Pretpostavljam da ne bi trebao biti ovdje.
It was a matter of time.	Bilo je pitanje vremena.
I know how it is.	Znam kako je.
Not even for a day.	Čak ni za jedan dan.
I'm still afraid of it.	I dalje se toga bojim.
I never came back.	Nikad se nisam vratio.
You must be better.	Mora da si bolji.
Too many things.	Previše stvari.
She wanted to live her life.	Htela je da živi svoj život.
But we don't really need to be told.	Ali nam zapravo ne treba reći.
I don't have to love you.	Ne moram da te volim.
There was no one to see.	Nije bilo nikoga da se vidi.
And he does it better.	I on to radi bolje.
If they are still here, drive again.	Ako su još uvijek ovdje, vozi ponovo.
I had no money.	Nisam imao novca.
Maybe they'll come here themselves.	Možda će i sami doći ovdje.
Why not do it.	Zašto to ne bi uradio.
I don't think we ever will.	Mislim da nikada nećemo.
It certainly works here.	Ovdje sigurno radi.
This one isn't.	Ovaj nije.
I've seen that before.	To sam već vidio.
There should be no problem.	Ne bi trebalo biti problema.
This was one.	Ovo je bio jedan.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
That's exactly what we have.	Upravo to imamo.
Like, you always were.	Kao, uvek si bio.
You can go.	Možeš ići.
I really can.	Zaista mogu.
But we know why.	Ali znamo zašto.
We need to work harder.	Moramo više raditi.
That's not bad.	To nije loše.
He knew why he was doing it.	Znao je zašto to radi.
But you really should see it for yourself.	Ali zaista biste to trebali sami vidjeti.
I thought he could play.	Mislio sam da može da igra.
I see what can't be there.	Vidim šta tu ne može biti.
You know.	Vi znate.
I heard about you.	Čuo sam za tebe.
But it is not easy enough to bring it back.	Ali nije dovoljno jednostavno ga vratiti.
Not as far as we know.	Ne koliko znamo.
He probably has no idea who you are.	Verovatno nema pojma ko si ti.
He did well.	Dobro je uradio.
The weather is good.	Vrijeme je dobro.
I know he can't.	Znam da ne može.
I mean really everything.	Mislim stvarno sve.
You want.	Ti želiš.
I'm just surprised.	Samo sam iznenađen.
Maybe you're already working on it.	Možda već radite na tome.
It's not that I don't want to, I want to.	Nije da ne želim, želim.
But he wasn't there.	Ali nije ga bilo.
I have to move on.	Moram da idem dalje.
That was many years ago.	To je bilo prije mnogo godina.
I wish I knew.	Voleo bih da znam.
I came too.	I ja sam došao.
And it's pretty simple.	I to je prilično jednostavno.
Maybe it's true.	Možda je istina.
It's very easy.	Vrlo je lako.
Everyone knows about you.	Svi znaju za tebe.
It's just you.	Samo ti jesi.
You told me very little.	Rekao si mi vrlo malo.
But not that way.	Ali ne na taj način.
You don't know everything.	Ne znaš sve.
We just did it to do it.	Samo smo to uradili da to uradimo.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
I won't be back.	Neću se vratiti.
But it is what it is.	Ali to je ono što jeste.
I'm glad you came.	Drago mi je što si došao.
I knew exactly what he meant.	Tačno sam znao šta je mislio.
This is not going to work.	Ovo neće ići.
We are still working.	I dalje radimo.
You can help me if you want.	Možete mi pomoći, ako želite.
There were so many of them.	Bilo ih je toliko.
It was not up to us.	To nije bilo na nama.
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
I've seen this before.	Vidio sam ovo ranije.
Was that anything.	Da li je to bilo šta.
Tell us what you think.	Reci nam šta misliš.
It won't work.	Neće raditi.
All you had to do was say it.	Sve što si trebao učiniti je to reći.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Nisam siguran u čemu je problem.
We just did that.	Upravo smo to uradili.
But it is more than that.	Ali to je više od toga.
I still have them as before.	I dalje ih imam kao i prije.
I was glad.	Bilo mi je drago.
So here too.	Tako i ovdje.
So on and so forth.	Tako dalje i tako dalje.
I didn't know why it was happening.	Nisam znao zašto se to dešava.
I was happy with him.	Bio sam sretan s njim.
It's so strong.	To je tako jako.
We are here for you.	Tu smo za vas.
We really can't.	Zaista ne možemo.
Not to say anything.	Da ne kažem ništa.
That's for sure.	To je sigurno.
That just wouldn’t happen.	To se jednostavno ne bi dogodilo.
I started, and now she's gone.	Počeo sam, a sada je više nema.
She probably was.	Verovatno je bila.
He doesn't know what to say.	Ne zna šta da kaže.
Yes, little.	Da malo.
He wouldn't have any of that.	Ne bi imao ništa od toga.
She said yes.	Rekla je da.
And what is this? 	A šta je ovo?
he asked.	pitao.
Just to make sure it's safe.	Samo da budem siguran da je sigurno.
I said that earlier.	Rekao sam to ranije.
There should be more of them.	Trebalo bi da ih je više.
I don't even know how.	Ne znam ni kako.
That's my father.	To je moj otac.
It works for a long time.	Radi dugo.
I say as if it were.	Kažem kao da jeste.
I know he knows about us.	Znam da zna za nas.
You don't have to do this, she said.	Ne morate ovo da radite, rekla je.
I see it now.	Vidim to sada.
It really works.	Zaista radi.
More than bad.	Više nego loše.
Neither is he.	Nije ni on.
I don't want to go home.	Ne želim ići kući.
It's too much.	Previše je.
To this day we still do.	Do danas to radimo.
Do you know.	Znaš li.
I didn't expect it from him.	Nisam očekivao od njega.
Maybe there's something to it.	Možda ima nešto u tome.
You never know.	Nikad se ne zna.
Nobody knew where he lived.	Niko nije znao gdje živi.
But they will be fine.	Ali oni će biti dobro.
You did the right thing.	Uradio si pravu stvar.
I tried to do too much.	Pokušao sam da uradim previše.
Story coming soon.	Priča uskoro.
Will this allow.	Hoće li ovo dozvoliti.
If he left now, she would be alone.	Da je sada otišao, bila bi sama.
It certainly wasn't easy.	Sigurno nije bilo lako.
Just soon, please.	Samo uskoro, molim.
He said it was a really good idea.	Rekao je da je to zaista dobra ideja.
I came home alone.	Sam sam se vratio kući.
But he looked good too.	Ali i on je dobro izgledao.
I didn't need a radio.	Nije mi trebao radio.
He wants me to tell him.	Želi da mu kažem.
And we are too.	I mi smo previše.
Maybe I wasted too much time.	Možda sam izgubio previše vremena.
I'll leave.	Ja ću otići.
He made them all.	On ih je sve napravio.
And we're still here.	I još smo tu.
It's better to be safe.	Bolje je biti siguran.
It goes like this.	To ide tako.
It's not hard to see.	Nije ga teško vidjeti.
I didn't mean anything.	Nisam ništa mislio.
Maybe that's the reason.	Možda je to razlog.
The code is this.	Kod je ovo.
I worked here, you know.	Radio sam ovde, znaš.
We could get more like them.	Mogli bismo dobiti još kao oni.
He had nothing more to say.	Nije imao šta više da kaže.
I know everything you have to say.	Znam sve što imaš da kažeš.
She doesn't have much money.	Ona nema mnogo novca.
he asked.	pitao.
Obviously something is wrong.	Očigledno nešto nije u redu.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
That's it for us.	To je to za nas.
We are a good team.	Mi smo dobar tim.
He said yes, but no.	Rekao je da, ali ne.
He should have done it himself.	Trebao je to sam uraditi.
And she's always on me.	I ona je uvek na mene.
Or trying to be.	Ili pokušava da bude.
So it was tonight.	Tako je bilo i večeras.
But it didn't.	Ali nije.
He should have helped.	Trebao je pomoći.
He wouldn't need it anymore.	Ne bi mu više trebao.
That's right! 	Tačno!
He had never seen her before and he had never seen her again.	Nikada je ranije nije video i nikada je više nije video.
He didn't know.	Nije znao.
Someone knew about the money.	Neko je znao za novac.
He wasn't sure that would be good.	Nije bio siguran da bi to bilo dobro.
Which obviously doesn't exist.	Što očigledno ne postoji.
But there is nothing.	Ali nema ništa.
The truth is that no one knows.	Istina je da niko ne zna.
It was more in that.	U više je bio taj.
He actually looks pretty good.	On zapravo izgleda prilično dobro.
You are a good friend.	Ti si dobar prijatelj.
But never for sure.	Ali nikad sigurno.
He knows you're here.	On zna da si ovde.
They were the first to do this.	Oni su ovo prvi uradili.
But they wouldn't do that either.	Ali ni oni to ne bi uradili.
Nothing about that.	Ništa o tome.
He seems to need it.	Izgleda da mu treba.
I mean not at all.	Mislim ne uopšte.
Maybe I was good.	Možda sam bio dobar.
Now everything is working properly.	Sada sve radi kako treba.
And that's okay.	I to je u redu.
Not so much and not so fast.	Ne toliko i ne tako brzo.
Why did they do that?	Zašto su to uradili?
In years, probably.	Za godine, vjerovatno.
It's easy to do things.	Lako je raditi stvari.
It was there for three years.	Tamo je bilo tri godine.
There are so many problems.	Ima toliko problema.
But good.	Ali, dobro.
It was necessary.	Trebalo je.
I don’t think he wants to be, but he is.	Mislim da ne želi biti, ali jeste.
I haven't seen him in a long time.	Nisam ga dugo video.
We have to do something right.	Mora da radimo nešto kako treba.
You are not mine.	Ti nisi moj.
That never happens to me anymore.	To mi se više nikad ne dešava.
Right now.	Upravo sada.
There is so much to talk about.	Ima toliko toga da se priča.
They are not everything.	Oni nisu sve.
No one will know it exists.	Niko neće znati da postoji.
Yes as you said.	Da kao što si rekao.
She didn't want to say that.	Nije htela to da kaže.
Or a lot.	Ili puno.
But with that, mine, mine.	Ali s tim, moj, moj.
For no one.	Ni za koga.
You never know with me.	Sa mnom nikad ne znaš.
It was supposed to look like that, but it didn't.	Trebalo je da izgleda tako, ali nije.
We can't see.	Ne možemo vidjeti.
Still and still.	I dalje i dalje.
This was hard to say.	Ovo je bilo teško reći.
So neither would we.	Tako da ne bismo ni mi.
That's all they were.	To je sve što su oni bili.
He couldn't see.	Nije mogao da vidi.
I can do that, you know.	Ja to mogu, znaš.
He was very surprised.	Bio je veoma iznenađen.
He said so.	On je tako rekao.
Must be.	Mora biti.
It seemed that maybe not.	Činilo se da možda nije.
He speaks very fast.	Govori veoma brzo.
Being here with you is not a good idea.	Biti ovdje s tobom nije dobra ideja.
It could have been me so easily.	Tako sam lako mogao biti ja.
He didn't say anything either.	Ni on nije ništa rekao.
It's really been three years.	Prošle su zaista tri godine.
She can't live like us.	Ona ne može da živi kao mi.
About both of us, actually.	O nama oboje, zapravo.
He's not exactly into that.	On nije baš u tome.
I'm not yours.	Ja nisam tvoj.
It couldn't be good.	Nije moglo biti dobro.
Nobody has to go.	Niko ne mora da ide.
I don't think it will.	Mislim da neće.
he asked.	pitao.
He seemed lost.	Činilo se da se izgubio.
You better say yes.	Bolje reci da.
No one is new to anyone.	Niko nije novi bilo ko.
He didn't say that.	On to nije rekao.
This should tell us something.	Ovo bi nam trebalo nešto reći.
I do not know what to say.	Ne znam šta da kažem.
And my father was one.	I moj otac je bio jedan.
Good.	Dobar.
Something bad.	Nešto loše.
I'll give him that much.	Toliko ću mu dati.
No one knows the reason.	Niko ne zna razlog.
He can't believe it.	Ne može vjerovati.
I work often.	Često radim.
That shouldn't happen.	To se ne bi trebalo dogoditi.
Except for a few.	Osim nekoliko.
And he needed a man for this job.	A za ovaj posao mu je trebao čovjek.
I think it can be both.	Mislim da može biti oboje.
Everyone had problems.	Svi su imali problema.
Not good enough.	Nije dovoljno dobar.
That was a problem before this happened.	To je bio problem prije nego što se ovo dogodilo.
I’ve seen it and it still looks good to me.	Vidio sam to i još uvijek mi izgleda dobro.
He is much better.	On je mnogo bolji.
But he didn't love me.	Ali on me nije volio.
He does not speak or do anything.	Ne govori i ne čini ništa.
She is right that she wants to see him again.	U pravu je što želi da ga ponovo vidi.
John loved his new job.	John je volio svoj novi posao.
There is nothing he will not do.	Ne postoji ništa što neće učiniti.
I never knew you could do this.	Nikad nisam znao da možeš ovo da uradiš.
Only she likes to have a lot of money.	Samo ona voli da ima mnogo novca.
I know what you mean.	Znam na šta si mislio.
Maybe it's not just the money.	Možda nije samo novac.
He could tell he wanted to say more.	Mogao je reći da želi reći više.
I don’t mean it in a bad way.	Ne mislim to na loš način.
Quick.	Brzo.
I'll just say this.	Reći ću samo ovo.
We need some time here.	Treba nam malo vremena ovdje.
Not a bad job.	Nije loš posao.
We are very sorry.	Veoma nam je žao.
You promised me.	Obećao si mi.
We can't do that yet.	To još ne možemo.
It just has to be.	To jednostavno mora biti.
I always seem to do that.	Čini mi se da to uvijek radim.
I knew that from him.	Znao sam to od njega.
Everyone could see it.	Svi su to mogli vidjeti.
He was here last year.	Bio je ovdje prošle godine.
Just tell me which one you want.	Samo mi reci koju želiš.
Let me see that.	Da vidim to.
He's good.	Dobar je.
Nobody talks about it anymore.	Niko više o tome ne priča.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
Nothing and no one.	Ništa i niko.
You have to do it.	Moraš to učiniti.
I don't know if any of us are ready for that.	Ne znam da li je neko od nas spreman za to.
He said nothing about it.	On nije ništa rekao o tome.
Apparently he had already done that.	Očigledno je to već radio.
I understood what she was telling me even before she said that.	Shvatio sam šta mi govori i prije nego što je to rekla.
That's not good now.	To sada ne čini dobro.
She was there.	Tu je bila.
This is true here as well.	Ovo je tačno i ovde.
Maybe we never will.	Možda nikada nećemo.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
They will find you.	Naći će te.
I knew he was thinking of me.	Znala sam da misli na mene.
Yes, that is what exists today.	Da, to je ono što danas postoji.
And you will be there.	I ti ćeš biti tamo.
That is hard.	To je teško.
He is so happy.	On je tako sretan.
No, we can't help you.	Ne, ne možemo vam pomoći.
There were too many doors.	Bilo je previše vrata.
Is something going on?	Da li se nešto dešava?
I have a problem.	Imam problem.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
He knew all this before.	Sve je to znao i ranije.
Someone has it.	Neko ga ima.
There is no money there.	Nema novca tamo.
I do not want.	Ne želim.
But don't tell the reason.	Ali ne govori razlog.
And why would !.	A zašto bi!.
There is nothing you can do.	Ne možete ništa učiniti.
If anyone can tell me how this can be done.	Ako neko može da mi kaže kako se to može uraditi.
I think he says so.	Mislim da kaže kako jeste.
It can't work.	To ne može raditi.
To this day, she has said nothing about it.	Do danas nije ništa rekla o tome.
Something like that didn't happen.	Tako nešto se nije dogodilo.
I was thinking of doing it tonight.	Mislio sam to uraditi večeras.
I really don't know what's happening to me.	Zaista ne znam šta mi se dešava.
I didn't start working with you for the money.	Nisam počeo da radim sa tobom zbog novca.
We didn't know.	Nismo znali.
Nothing ever was.	Ništa nikad nije bilo.
But it really is.	Ali zaista jeste.
Maybe that will never happen.	Možda se to nikada neće dogoditi.
That was not right for me.	Za mene to nije bilo u redu.
It's not a question of money.	Nije pitanje novca.
They can beat this team.	Oni mogu pobijediti ovaj tim.
He was there.	Bio je tamo.
someone asked.	pitao je neko.
I am moving on.	Idem dalje.
I was thinking about you this morning.	Mislio sam na tebe jutros.
But nothing wrong.	Ali ništa loše.
But it is, isn't it? '	Ali, jeste, zar ne?'.
You got me for sure.	Dobio si me sigurno.
Yes, that was true, so true.	Da, to je bilo tačno, tako tačno.
So for me it doesn’t exist.	Tako da za mene ne postoji.
You said, you sure would.	Rekao si, sigurno bi.
That's what it is.	To je što je.
Very happy with me.	Veoma sretan sa mnom.
I'm a guy.	Ja sam momak.
I'm really sorry.	Stvarno mi je žao.
He wasn't sure what he was ready for.	Nije bio siguran na šta je spreman.
They did it, together.	Oni su to uradili, zajedno.
I didn't tell you.	Nisam vam rekao.
But this one is.	Ali ovaj jeste.
The question is what.	Pitanje je šta.
No, it was all there.	Ne, sve je bilo tamo.
I mean, would you?	Mislim, da li bi?
I know you can do what you can.	Znam da radiš šta možeš.
He doesn't have much money.	On nema mnogo novca.
He can't come back, he knows so much.	Ne može se vratiti, toliko zna.
Not now, maybe not anymore.	Ne sada, možda ne više.
This man has no money.	Ovaj čovjek nema novca.
I hope you feel better.	Nadam se da ti je bolje.
Thirty years ago, maybe.	Prije trideset godina, možda.
I still can't believe it.	Još uvijek ne mogu vjerovati.
Not much.	Nije mnogo.
I didn't see it.	Nisam to vidio.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
If I can't, I can't.	Ako ne mogu, ne mogu.
He had no money.	Nije imao novca.
It's so good to see you again.	Tako je dobro vidjeti te ponovo.
And she was with him.	I ona je bila s njim.
Everything is going strong.	Sve ide jako.
How many times do you want.	Koliko puta želiš.
I have one too.	I ja imam jedan.
Enough.	Dosta '.
He is nothing.	On je ništa.
But only one.	Ali samo jedan.
I wish it could be me.	Voleo bih da to mogu biti ja.
And my friend was right.	I moj prijatelj je bio u pravu.
You have to give everything.	Morate dati sve.
You wouldn't do that, would you?	Ne biste to uradili, zar ne?
Not so often.	Ne tako često.
It really does.	Zaista to radi.
I hope that's okay.	Nadam se da je to u redu.
Please don't!	Molim te nemoj!
No, that's true.	Ne, to je istina.
Just as it is.	Baš kao što jeste.
Do it again.	Uradi to ponovo.
What he knows, he knows.	Ono što zna, zna.
And he himself.	I on sam.
But she herself knew nothing about it.	Ali ona sama nije znala ništa o tome.
Or what he should have done for you.	Ili šta je trebalo da uradi za tebe.
But he couldn't.	Ali nije mogao.
I am moving on.	Idem dalje.
We won't be able to do that here.	Nećemo to moći ovdje.
He could be right.	Mogao bi biti u pravu.
It is simple yes or no.	Jednostavno je da ili ne.
No, it can't be.	Ne, ne može biti.
We didn't seem to have a clue he was there.	Činilo se da nismo ni imali pojma da je tamo.
And he was.	I bio je.
Your life is yours.	Tvoj život je tvoj.
It is.	To je.
Everything was fine until last week.	Sve je bilo dobro do prošle sedmice.
He was right.	Bio je u pravu.
A lot has happened.	Mnogo toga se dogodilo.
I have nothing.	Nemam ništa.
And that's not good.	A to nije dobro.
Nothing but money.	Ništa osim novca.
I wish he could just come.	Voleo bih da može samo doći.
He will come to you.	On će doći do tebe.
It's too simple a question.	To je previše jednostavno pitanje.
How many years have you worked here?	Koliko godina radite ovdje?
She will say yes.	Ona će reći da.
That's the only way.	To je jedini način.
He could have done this.	Mogao je ovo da uradi.
I'm glad I did.	Drago mi je što sam to uradio.
But he is none of that.	Ali on nije ništa od toga.
Not much happened.	Nije se mnogo toga dogodilo.
How many people live their lives.	Koliko ljudi živi svoj život.
I did.	Ja sam uradio.
She has it there.	Ona ga ima tamo.
One.	Jedan.
I guess you will.	Pretpostavljam da ćeš uraditi.
They did that and more.	Uradili su to i još mnogo toga.
I don't want to be again.	Ne želim ponovo biti.
It must.	Mora.
I love seeing her.	Volim da je vidim.
If You Can.	Ako možeš.
I say what.	Kažem šta.
He was good enough to say that.	Bio je dovoljno dobar da to kaže.
It was very difficult for me.	Bilo mi je jako teško.
That is not really true.	To zapravo nije istina.
They had it, for sure. 	Imali su to, sigurno. 
We're pretty sure.	Prilično smo sigurni.
And you're in it.	I ti si u tome.
But she doesn't see.	Ali ona ne vidi.
Things will get better next week.	Stvari će biti bolje sljedeće sedmice.
No people.	Nema ljudi.
And maybe we can.	I možda možemo.
That's for sure.	To sigurno.
But apparently there was someone in the house.	Ali očigledno je bilo nekoga u kući.
I can only ask.	Mogu samo da pitam.
I'm not like those people.	Ja nisam kao ti ljudi.
I was only there for three days.	Bio sam tamo samo tri dana.
But he couldn't.	Ali nije mogao.
They could see me.	Mogli su me vidjeti.
I have no doubt that this is so.	Ne sumnjam da je to tako.
So we were completely alone.	Tako da smo bili potpuno sami.
I'm not sure.	Nisam baš siguran.
She knew well enough what she was talking about.	Znala je dovoljno dobro o čemu govori.
She knew exactly what she wanted.	Tačno je znala šta želi.
I could easily be too.	Lako bih mogao biti i ja.
Or you.	Ili ti.
And so it will be.	I tako će to biti.
No one can know.	Niko ne može znati.
We may not do this.	Ovo možda nećemo učiniti.
We said yes.	Rekli smo da.
You all know who you are.	Svi znate ko ste.
Nothing.	Ništa.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
He wouldn't say that.	On to ne bi rekao.
He speaks better.	On bolje govori.
I went to see him last night.	Otišao sam da ga vidim sinoć.
It's not just here.	Nije samo ovde.
This has never happened before.	To se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
He left.	On je otišao.
We can't be sure.	Ne možemo biti sigurni.
And he should be here.	I on bi trebao biti ovdje.
It's not the only way.	Nije jedini način.
That's not what you wanted at all.	To uopšte nije ono što si želeo.
Maybe you shouldn't.	Možda i ne bi trebalo.
Or maybe earlier.	Ili možda ranije.
That is what we have now.	To je ono što sada imamo.
He said he would come, but he didn't.	Rekao je da će doći, ali nije.
What are they in order?	Šta su oni po redu?
So it should go.	Tako da treba da ide.
It was okay.	Bilo je u redu.
I have no problem with him.	Nemam problema sa njim.
I should have known better.	Trebao sam znati bolje.
I was just there.	Jednostavno sam bio tamo.
It was the only time.	Bio je to jedini put.
That was last month.	To je bilo prošlog mjeseca.
But it doesn't just happen that way.	Ali to se ne dešava samo tako.
She said it was something she had to do.	Rekla je da je to nešto što mora da uradi.
She said she never did.	Rekla je da nikada nije.
He loved it.	Voleo je to.
This is about us too.	Ovo je i o nama.
He didn't have something like that.	Nije imao tako nešto.
And she was still there.	I još je bila tamo.
And he almost got it.	I skoro ga je dobio.
It really was.	Zaista je bilo.
Very good thing.	Vrlo dobra stvar.
I want to know what they are.	Želim da znam šta su oni.
You need to see someone else.	Morate vidjeti još nekoga.
I couldn't do that.	Nisam mogao to da uradim.
Now everyone knows.	Sada svi znaju.
It's just a matter of time.	To je samo pitanje vremena.
See if this works for you.	Vidi da li ovo radi za tebe.
It was yesterday, actually.	Bilo je to juče, zapravo.
It's true.	To je istina.
I just wanted to see what would happen.	Samo sam htio vidjeti šta će se dogoditi.
If there is something you.	Ako postoji nešto ti.
That was the reason, but not the only one.	Bio je to razlog, ali ne i jedini.
He did it himself.	On je to sam napravio.
That was not the way.	To nije bio put.
He just needs to play.	Samo treba da igra.
No one could do that anymore.	Niko to više nije mogao.
We have to go.	Moramo ići.
What could be better!?.	Šta može biti bolje!?.
I'm just a guy who knows what.	Ja sam samo momak koji zna šta.
You know what you did.	Znaš šta si uradio.
If it was, it wouldn't be.	Da jeste, ne bi bilo.
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
This man just did something to him.	Ovaj čovjek mu je upravo nešto uradio.
I don't know when he'll be back.	Ne znam kada će se vratiti.
I wish you well.	Želim ti dobro.
He won't tell us anything.	Neće nam ništa reći.
I really like that.	To mi se stvarno sviđa.
We don't know about tomorrow.	Ne znamo za sutra.
But it's like.	Ali to je kao.
Or maybe both.	Ili možda oboje.
Now more, even than that.	Sada više, čak i od toga.
Maybe that's all.	Možda je to sve.
We will always be there for you.	Uvijek ćemo biti tu za vas.
It wasn't that bad.	To nije bilo tako loše.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
He can do anything.	On može sve.
Do this well.	Radi ovo dobro.
And maybe he could.	A možda bi i mogao.
I just didn't hear them.	Samo ih nisam čuo.
They would never do anything.	Nikada ništa ne bi uradili.
In fact, she knew nothing.	U stvari, nije znala ništa.
In just three days.	Za samo tri dana.
What he didn't know was why.	Ono što nije znao je zašto.
Time is short.	Vremena je malo.
I loved them both.	Voleo sam ih oboje.
They can't help you.	Oni ti ne mogu pomoći.
I have someone right now.	Imam nekoga odmah.
I thought that was it.	Mislio sam da je to to.
I didn't want to tell anyone.	Nisam htela nikome da kažem.
I like it, a lot.	Sviđa mi se, mnogo.
No, he didn't tell anyone.	Ne, nikome nije rekao.
But you have to come.	Ali moraš doći.
Everyone knew that.	Svi su to znali.
All right.	U redu.
He's here for me.	On je tu za mene.
You knew better.	Znao si bolje.
Nothing really happened.	Ništa se zaista nije dogodilo.
I'm not done.	Nisam završio.
Surely you know about it.	Sigurno znate za to.
Life.	Život.
I just didn't know how and why.	Samo nisam znao kako i zašto.
But nothing could be done about it.	Ali ništa se nije moglo učiniti za to.
And he won't do anything.	I neće učiniti ništa.
She is not the only one.	Ona nije jedina.
That's your money.	To je tvoj novac.
There is another one of us.	Postoji još jedan od nas.
He will go with you if you want.	On će ići s tobom ako želiš.
We both knew that.	Oboje smo to znali.
He never asked.	Nikada nije pitao.
This is something no one likes to do.	Ovo je nešto što niko ne voli da radi.
I know it is.	Znam da jeste.
I didn't expect us to.	Nisam očekivao da ćemo.
But it is still difficult.	Ali, i dalje je teško.
It's right there.	To je upravo tamo.
Maybe she was right.	Možda je bila u pravu.
Like, really.	Kao, stvarno.
And now they knew they wouldn't.	A sada su znali da neće.
In fact, it is very, very difficult.	U stvari, to je veoma, veoma teško.
He knew what he had to do.	Znao je šta mora da uradi.
I thought you just arrived.	Mislio sam da si upravo stigao.
I was fine.	Bio sam dobro.
I've heard a lot.	Čuo sam dosta toga.
He's doing pretty well right now.	Trenutno mu ide prilično dobro.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
We have to do bad things.	Moramo da radimo loše stvari.
You never know what you'll get!	Nikad ne znaš šta ćeš dobiti!
He was not happy to see me.	Nije mu bilo drago što me vidi.
You think he's a good guy.	Misliš da je on dobar momak.
It was supposed to be easy.	Trebalo je biti lako.
That was completely true.	To je bilo potpuno tačno.
You can't help yourself.	Ne možeš si pomoći.
Please for something.	Molim te za nešto.
He got it.	Dobio ga je.
And much more.	I još mnogo toga.
As long as you tell him.	Sve dok mu ti kažeš.
That's all I can see.	Toliko mogu da vidim.
You still don't know what it's about.	Još ne znaš o čemu se radi.
But it wasn't supposed to be him.	Ali to nije trebao biti on.
And he does.	I on to radi.
He just wouldn't do it.	On to jednostavno ne bi uradio.
He did not return to work.	Nije se vratio na posao.
I loved her.	Voleo sam je.
He looked really good.	Zaista je izgledao dobro.
I didn't know what the point was.	Nisam znao u čemu je stvar.
It was never easy to leave.	Nikada nije bilo lako otići.
It's right here.	Ima ga upravo ovdje.
He knows everything.	On zna sve.
Just saying no was not enough.	Samo reći ne nije bilo dovoljno.
They are not what she is.	Oni nisu ono što je ona.
And he is.	I on je.
Who are they?	Ko su oni?
It may not be likely, but it happens.	Možda nije vjerovatno, ali se dešava.
I hope it helps.	Nadam se da je od pomoći.
But this is my problem.	Ali ovo je moj problem.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
Which was good for me.	Što je bilo dobro za mene.
Money couldn't.	Novac ne bi mogao.
And that is it.	I to je to.
It probably was.	Vjerovatno je bilo.
I bought a few things.	Kupio sam nekoliko stvari.
He was not there.	Nije ga bilo.
What really happened.	Šta se zaista dogodilo.
Very difficult.	Veoma teško.
We were here.	Bili smo ovdje.
You just have to believe.	Samo treba vjerovati.
I can't tell you anything.	Ne mogu ti ništa reći.
That is not happening.	To se ne dešava.
I mean completely.	Mislim potpuno.
Last night, three times.	Sinoć, tri puta.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
But he wanted it.	Ali on je to želeo.
But not this way.	Ali ne na ovaj način.
But he was there.	Ali on je bio tamo.
But the time will come.	Ali doći će vrijeme.
I think you are too.	Mislim da si i ti.
That's what he said.	To je on rekao.
She doesn't want him to leave now.	Ona ne želi da on sada ode.
So we don't work.	Tako da ne radimo.
He didn't have much time.	Nije imao mnogo vremena.
It doesn't work anymore.	Više ne radi.
I can go any way.	Mogu ići na bilo koji način.
When he wasn't there he worked.	Kad nije bio tamo je radio.
And it's not.	A to nije.
I think he's doing a very good job.	Mislim da radi veoma dobar posao.
We should do that.	Trebalo bi to da uradimo.
And they did.	I to su uradili.
Like you.	Kao ti.
He decided not to say anything.	Odlučio je da ne kaže ništa.
It was too much for him.	Bilo je to previše za njega.
They know where they have been.	Znaju gdje su bili.
You should have stayed with me.	Trebao si ostati sa mnom.
If you have to.	Ako moraš.
That's okay with me.	To je u redu sa mnom.
It is nothing more than that.	Nije ništa više od toga.
Even a good friend.	Čak i dobar prijatelj.
Today we know much more.	Danas znamo mnogo više.
And she knew who they were.	I znala je ko su oni.
I wasn't that.	Nisam to bio.
It's too much tonight.	Večeras je previše.
That is not good for anyone or any of us.	To nije dobro ni za koga, ni za koga od nas.
Why not.	Zašto ne bi.
I hope you like it !!!!.	Nadam se da vam se sviđa!!!!.
I did it myself.	I sam sam to uradio.
None of us can say anything to any of us.	Niko nikome od nas ništa ne može reći.
Yes, it's that simple.	Da, tako je jednostavno.
I've never seen her before.	Nikad je ranije nisam video.
I still won't believe this.	Još uvijek neću vjerovati u ovo.
But now they are gone.	Ali sada ih nema.
I wouldn’t ask for help or stuff.	Ne bih tražio pomoć ili stvari.
He has you in him today.	Danas te ima u sebi.
You know, it's pretty simple.	Znate, prilično je jednostavno.
Never say never.	Nikad ne reci nikad.
We have to do something right.	Mora da radimo nešto kako treba.
And see them.	I vidi ih.
You know why.	Znaš zašto.
Without it, nothing much would have happened.	Bez toga se ništa mnogo ne bi dogodilo.
I can not.	Ne mogu.
Hope is something.	Nada je nešto.
I do it.	Ja to radim.
I've never been there.	Nikad nisam bio tamo.
She said nothing.	Ona ništa nije rekla.
If you only knew, you wouldn't say so.	Da samo znaš, ne bi tako rekao.
I was good.	Bio sam dobar.
I don't have too many friends.	Nemam previše prijatelja.
And she was right.	I bila je u pravu.
She was fine.	Bila je dobro.
That is hard.	To je teško.
Maybe more time.	Možda više vremena.
I don't like her very much.	Ne volim je mnogo.
Not a problem at all.	Uopšte nije problem.
Now, question three.	Sada, pitanje tri.
It's not there.	To nije tamo.
I didn't even know how old he was.	Nisam ni znao koliko ima godina.
I asked her.	pitao sam je.
I can't see them.	Ne mogu ih vidjeti.
No problem.	Nije problem.
There will probably be several.	Verovatno će ih biti nekoliko.
They can do it themselves.	Oni to mogu sami.
Me and him.	Ja i on.
I still want one.	Još uvijek želim jedan.
I'm fine.	Dobro sam.
This is actually true.	Ovo je zapravo istina.
We have time.	Imamo vremena.
He didn't even see me there.	Nije me čak ni vidio tamo.
It may not be easy, but it can be done.	Možda neće biti lako, ali se može.
I mean, in fact, it might be better for me.	Mislim, u stvari, možda bi bilo i bolje za mene.
Like now.	Kao sada.
He can't be bought.	On se ne može kupiti.
I decided not to.	Odlučio sam da neću.
Getting more was a problem.	Dobiti više je bio problem.
He is a friend.	On je prijatelj.
I know what it's like.	Znam kako je to.
I am one.	Ja sam jedan.
This does nothing.	Ovo ne čini ništa.
And it's still there.	I još je tu.
It will surely be soon.	Sigurno će biti uskoro.
And so it will be tomorrow.	I tako će biti i sutra.
Please, just don't.	Molim te, samo ne.
We are nobody anymore.	Mi više nismo niko.
It's true.	To je istina.
So good.	Tako dobro.
It was time to leave.	Bilo je vrijeme da ode.
He would always love me very much.	Uvek bi me jako voleo.
I saw some of that.	Video sam nešto od toga.
This year more than ever.	Ove godine više nego ikada.
We are a team.	Mi smo tim.
All of them.	Svi oni.
He had never known before.	Nikada prije nije znao.
How many people live here?	Koliko ljudi živi ovdje?
But there is no one.	Ali nema nikoga.
I didn't want to stay in the house.	Nisam želio ostati u kući.
Do everything right.	Uradite sve kako treba.
Yes, she was.	Da, bila je.
He didn't have it in him.	Nije to imao u sebi.
He was just doing his job.	On je samo radio svoj posao.
She must know everything.	Ona mora sve da zna.
I've done so much.	Toliko sam toga uradio.
I saw that he began to believe me.	Vidio sam da mi je počeo vjerovati.
But it was.	Ali to je bilo.
He left.	Otišao je.
I'm glad you're back.	Drago mi je da si se vratio.
And we should leave immediately.	I trebali bismo odmah otići.
I go to work.	Idem na posao.
It's just who you are.	To je samo ko si.
It must.	Mora.
Want to buy here?	Želite li kupiti ovdje?
You need to buy it right here, right now.	Morate ga kupiti upravo ovdje, odmah.
Nobody wants to.	Niko ne želi.
But even that was fine.	Ali čak i to je bilo u redu.
And something is better than nothing.	I bolje je nešto nego ništa.
Not me, no.	Ne ja, ne.
It will never be again.	Nikada više neće biti.
I really don't know.	Ja stvarno ne znam.
This really happened.	Ovo se zaista dogodilo.
But he did not do such a thing.	Ali on nije uradio tako nešto.
And she eats.	I jede ona.
I'm sure of that.	Siguran sam u to.
In fact, you're fine.	U stvari, ti si dobro.
It was here, in the house.	Bilo je to ovdje, u kući.
Do your job.	Uradi svoj posao.
You can't do your job.	Ne možeš da radiš svoj posao.
It couldn't be.	Nije moglo biti.
He was so good.	Bio je tako dobar.
That's all.	To su svi.
I actually like to think not.	Ja zapravo volim da mislim da ne.
He seemed to know exactly what to do.	Činilo se da tačno zna šta da radi.
We know each other.	Znamo se.
He's not a bad guy.	On nije loš momak.
But it was bad of me.	Ali bilo je to loše od mene.
I never had the money.	Nikad nisam imao novac.
Enough for life.	Dovoljno za život.
In fact, that's what happened.	U stvari, tako se i dogodilo.
And he probably will.	I vjerovatno hoće.
I don't think so.	Mislim da nikada nije.
This is my code for now.	Ovo je moj kod za sada.
It is not hard.	Nije teško.
I need to know.	Moram da znam.
This is not a problem here.	Ovo nije problem ovdje.
He knew it was.	Znao je da jeste.
That's a lot!	To je mnogo!
I had to go to work tomorrow.	Morao sam sutra na posao.
Why would he.	Zašto bi on .
And bad for everyone.	I loše za sve.
It's very easy.	Vrlo je lako.
But it’s not what you think it is.	Ali nije ono što mislite da jeste.
And he did.	I to je uradio.
You didn't want her to be alone.	Nisi želeo da bude sama.
It just so happened.	Jednostavno se tako dogodilo.
They are fine.	Oni su dobro.
Who did that? 	Ko je to napravio?
it was a question now.	bilo je sada pitanje.
I don't know exactly how it happens or why it happens.	Ne znam tačno kako se to dešava ili zašto se dešava.
I think he can.	Mislim da može.
Yes you are.	Da, jesi.
But fine with me.	Ali dobro sa mnom.
He didn't know what to think about it.	Nije znao šta da misli o tome.
I've never had a problem before.	Nikad prije nisam imao problema.
You have to tell me what's wrong.	Moraš mi reći šta nije u redu.
And a lot of people will come.	I mnogo ljudi će doći.
Whatever you want.	Kako hoćeš.
This radio is my hope.	Ovaj radio je moja nada.
It's a new day.	Novi je dan.
Tom was looking for a new job.	Tom je tražio novi posao.
We are here.	Ovde smo.
I'm not good.	Nisam dobro.
He can't tell anyone how he feels.	Ne može nikome reći kako se osjeća.
I don't even want to do that.	Ne želim to ni da uradim.
I know myself.	Znam i sama.
I already have enough money.	Već imam dovoljno novca.
I hope you can help.	Nadam se da možete pomoći.
Everyone knew everything.	Svi su sve znali.
Even so.	Čak i tako.
I don't know what's going on here anymore, she said.	Ne znam više šta se ovde dešava, rekla je.
He knew it was much more than that.	Znao je da je mnogo više od toga.
That's enough.	Dosta je dosta.
There are more of us.	Ima nas više.
This was fine with me.	Ovo mi je bilo u redu.
Indeed, we were.	Zaista, bili smo.
And to see how everything goes, just like that.	I da vidim kako sve ide, samo tako.
Do you know who this man is?	Znate li ko je ovaj čovjek?
Like them.	Kao i oni.
Actually a lot.	Zapravo mnogo.
I should tell you something.	Trebao bih ti nešto reći.
That is not what we have today.	To nije ono što danas imamo.
It doesn't look right.	Ne izgleda u redu.
He just didn't want to do it anymore.	Jednostavno nije želio to više da radi.
I knew it was.	Znao sam da jeste.
Why would you do such a thing.	Zašto bi uradio tako nešto.
They are just themselves.	Oni su samo oni sami.
Do as you wish.	Radite kako želite.
For him, it was just a game.	Za njega je to bila samo igra.
You need to know this.	Treba da znaš ovo.
I don't mean anything.	Ne mislim ništa.
But it obviously doesn't work.	Ali očigledno ne radi.
I know you're busy.	Znam da si zauzet.
He couldn't see it now.	Sada to nije mogao vidjeti.
But it was.	Ali bilo je.
A lot, but not really.	Mnogo, ali ne baš.
It's not there.	Tamo nije.
I just didn't want to.	Jednostavno nisam htela.
That's us.	To smo mi.
The question was how.	Pitanje je bilo kako.
What have we done?	Šta smo uradili.
Something was wrong.	Nešto nije bilo.
And we're fine.	I dobro smo.
No one has ever given me as much as you.	Niko mi nikada nije dao toliko kao ti.
I really dont know.	Ne znam stvarno.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
I've never been well.	Nikad mi nije bilo dobro.
I had no idea if it was good or not.	Nisam imao pojma da li je to dobro ili ne.
We feel better when we are together.	Bolje nam je kad smo zajedno.
Check this out.	Vidi ovo.
It was hard enough for me because of that.	Bilo mi je dovoljno teško zbog toga.
I know where he might be.	Znam gdje bi mogao biti.
But not as a job.	Ali ne kao posao.
I do not want.	Ne želim.
She does it from time to time.	Ona to radi s vremena na vrijeme.
Doing it fast was.	Raditi to brzo je bilo.
It was never okay.	Nikad nije bilo u redu.
That he tried again.	Da je pokušao ponovo.
I was happy to see that.	Bio sam sretan što sam to vidio.
I'm usually there at three in the afternoon.	Obično sam tamo u tri popodne.
We work well together.	Dobro radimo zajedno.
And we're sorry.	I žao nam je.
I would never do something like that.	Nikad ne bih uradio tako nešto.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
Your life needs you.	Tvoj život te treba.
Not much.	Puno ne.
We are not.	Nismo.
These are the people you want.	To su ljudi koje želite.
But someone had to do it.	Ali neko je to morao da uradi.
I shouldn't have.	Nisam trebao.
I'm not sure how to do that.	Nisam siguran kako to da uradim.
Few will know.	Malo ko će znati.
You look much better.	Izgledaš mnogo bolje.
No problem.	Nije problem.
Nobody says anything for a while.	Niko ništa ne govori neko vrijeme.
Here the work is busy.	Ovdje je posao zauzet.
I couldn't go there yet.	Nisam još mogao tamo.
He saw nothing wrong.	Nije vidio ništa loše.
I can work all together for good.	Mogu raditi sve zajedno za dobro.
Which will be the case here as well.	Što će tako biti i ovdje.
It could easily be mine.	Lako bi mogao biti moj.
I don't want to see that.	Ne želim to vidjeti.
I mean really good.	Mislim stvarno dobro.
And that is my hope.	I to je moja nada.
But a lot for now.	Ali dosta toga za sada.
I got a new one this year.	Dobio sam novi ove godine.
I saw what he could have done last night.	Video sam šta je mogao da uradi sinoć.
And you can't do anything.	I ne možeš ništa.
We need to know.	Moramo znati.
And he wanted me.	I želio je mene.
I'm not allowed.	Nije mi dozvoljeno.
That's right.	Tako je.
No, it's not raining.	Ne, nije kiša.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
It's just happening.	To se samo dešava.
Maybe three times.	Možda tri puta.
Maybe he didn't have to do anything.	Možda nije morao ništa da uradi.
But he didn't want that.	Ali on to nije htio.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
Where were they?	Gdje su bili?
I'm not doing anything.	Ne radim ništa.
And probably even more.	I vjerovatno čak i više.
I've never seen this car before.	Nikada prije nisam vidio ovaj auto.
Whether you are long.	Bilo da ste dugo.
Obviously not anymore.	Očigledno je da više neće.
I have to too.	I ja moram.
I have no idea what to say.	Nemam pojma šta da kažem.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
And as she says.	I kako ona kaže.
So we can be better.	Tako da možemo biti bolji.
And there is still plenty of time for more.	I još ima dosta vremena za više.
What do you have to say to that?	Šta imaš da kažeš na to?
She just wants to play with me.	Ona samo želi da se igra sa mnom.
And it was good and there were a lot of stories.	I bilo je dobro i bilo je puno priča.
So much so that you can't.	Toliko da ne možeš.
No one is eating.	Niko ne jede.
That is exactly what happened.	Upravo to se dogodilo.
If he could.	Kad bi mogao.
The team had to work fast.	Tim je morao brzo da radi.
Except he isn’t and can’t now.	Osim što nije i ne može sada.
Even so, nothing is instantaneous.	Čak i tako, ništa nije trenutno.
I can.	Mogu'.
I did this.	Uradio sam ovo.
And you don't.	A ti ne.
They will never find him again.	Nikad ga više neće naći.
But not just any story.	Ali ne bilo koja priča.
It could still be.	I dalje bi moglo biti.
But no one was to know that.	Ali to niko nije trebao znati.
I'm not sure that's true.	Nisam siguran da je to istina.
You have to do this.	Moraš ovo da uradiš.
It seems so.	Izgleda tako.
And she.	I ona.
But he doesn't say anything.	Ali ne govori ništa.
This is a lot.	Ovo je mnogo.
There was very little time.	Bilo je vrlo malo vremena.
We're not sure here either.	Ni mi ovdje nismo sigurni.
Just yes.	Samo da.
That's a lot.	To je puno.
And I usually have that problem.	I ja obično imam taj problem.
Which we did.	Što smo i uradili.
This is a good thing.	Ovo je dobra stvar.
Just tell me what you want.	Samo mi reci šta želiš.
And it will happen pretty quickly.	I to će se dogoditi prilično brzo.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
And he does.	I on to radi.
But it is something to be lived for.	Ali to je nešto za šta se živi.
And there is nothing.	I ništa nema.
I'll say it.	Ja ću to reći.
You know nothing about it.	Ne znaš ništa o tome.
I saw what he did for you.	Video sam šta radi za tebe.
I like it here.	Sviđa mi se ovdje.
I was so happy.	Bio sam tako sretan.
He's so good, people.	On je tako dobar, ljudi.
But other than that, everything was fine.	Ali osim toga, sve je bilo u redu.
Good way.	Dobar način.
I'll find a new job.	Naći ću novi posao.
More on that soon.	Više o tome uskoro.
And we would have no idea where we were.	I ne bismo imali pojma gdje smo.
Everything is happening now.	Sve se dešava sada.
I told him exactly what happened.	Rekao sam mu šta se tačno dogodilo.
Usually not.	Obično nisu.
Nobody saw or heard anything.	Niko ništa nije ni video ni čuo.
I had to see him.	Morao sam da ga vidim.
That was for sure.	To je bilo sigurno.
But he asked me.	Ali on me je pitao.
She certainly didn't say.	Sigurno nije rekla.
That someone was right.	Taj neko je bio u pravu.
He lives it.	On to živi.
You can tell me the truth.	Možeš mi reći istinu.
I can't say if that's true.	Ne mogu reći da li je to istina.
I'll be on it.	Ja ću biti na tome.
And when.	I kada.
She loves me.	Ona me voli.
I was so surprised.	Bio sam tako iznenađen.
Life happens pretty fast.	Život se dešava prilično brzo.
But you can see.	Ali možete vidjeti.
But they were there.	Ali tamo su bili.
And neither will you.	A nećeš ni ti.
They can help you.	Oni vam mogu pomoći.
I was good at it.	Bio sam dobar u tome.
Maybe she still was.	Možda je još uvijek bila.
How exactly does she do it?	Kako ona to tačno radi?
It would have been much better if we had had more years together.	Bilo bi mnogo bolje da smo imali više godina zajedno.
He likes to be there.	On voli biti tamo.
It certainly won't be long.	Sigurno neće biti dugo.
That can't be done.	To se ne može uraditi.
But the problem is you don't do it.	Ali problem je što ti to ne radiš.
He says very little about it.	Vrlo malo govori o tome.
And for him, what he had was everything.	A za njega je ono što je imao bilo sve.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
Everything, he knew, was true.	Sve je, znao je, bilo tačno.
It was never supposed to be good.	Nikad nije trebalo da bude dobro.
I hope he says no.	Nadam se da će reći ne.
Or where we do it.	Ili gdje to radimo.
But something is wrong.	Ali nešto nije u redu.
There are a lot of them.	Ima ih dosta.
It won't be safe here.	Ovdje neće biti sigurno.
They are my life.	Oni su moj život.
This and nothing more.	Ovo i ništa više.
But today is not a good day.	Ali danas nije dobar dan.
I was tired too.	I ja sam bio umoran.
Maybe more than ever.	Možda više nego ikada.
I thought he could play.	Mislio sam da može da igra.
Or don't.	Ili nemoj.
No, no, really.	Ne, ne, zaista.
He would leave.	On bi otišao.
I'm not sure why.	Nisam siguran zašto.
Nobody loves him.	Niko ga ne voli.
But not you.	Ali ne ti.
But no, it wasn't supposed to be.	Ali ne, to nije trebalo biti.
But not much, not the way you think.	Ali ne mnogo, ne na način na koji mislite.
Life has moved on.	Život je otišao dalje.
Someone can say something.	Neko može nešto reći.
None of us can.	Niko od nas ne može.
Obviously that was the problem.	Očigledno je to bio problem.
Not that way.	Ne na taj način.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
And there's nothing wrong with that.	I u tome nema ništa loše.
Ready to go?	Spreman da idem?
This and next week.	Ove i sljedeće sedmice.
But me.	Ali ja.
I'm not sure what to do.	Nisam siguran šta da radim.
I never said no.	Nikad nisam rekao ne.
As we well know.	Kao što dobro znamo.
We can only be here.	Možemo samo biti ovdje.
You think you'd like that.	Misliš da bi ti to bilo drago.
She knew immediately what it was about.	Odmah je znala o čemu se radi.
He couldn't believe he would do it, but.	Nije mogao vjerovati da će to učiniti, ali.
I quickly saw that it was my father.	Brzo sam vidio da je to moj otac.
I'll be there this afternoon.	Doći ću popodne.
For being here.	Za to što si ovde.
This is not good.	Ovo nije dobro.
It's just a matter of time.	Samo je pitanje vremena.
The truth is that it can happen anywhere.	Istina je da se to može dogoditi bilo gdje.
I just can't.	Jednostavno ne mogu.
Maybe because of that.	Možda zbog toga.
They just know they know.	Oni jednostavno znaju da znaju.
And she's right.	I ona je u pravu.
I'm glad I'm helpful.	Drago mi je da sam od pomoći.
They already know that.	Oni to već znaju.
He does a good job.	On radi dobar posao.
Do what you can.	Uradi šta možeš.
But he had no idea how much time he had.	Ali nije imao pojma koliko vremena ima.
Maybe that's not the case with us anymore.	Možda ni to više nije kod nas.
He may not even exist.	On možda i ne postoji.
And I really meant it.	I ja sam to stvarno mislio.
I like to like it.	Volim da mi se sviđa.
I'm my own, just so you know.	Ja sam svoj, samo da znaš.
A long time ago.	Prije mnogo vremena .
Maybe a little too much.	Možda malo previše.
He had several.	Imao je nekoliko.
If it looks fast enough, it’s fast enough.	Ako izgleda dovoljno brzo, dovoljno je brzo.
And so it is.	I tako ima.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
It could be that.	Moglo bi biti to.
But that didn't happen here.	Ali to se ovdje nije dogodilo.
It was obvious that this was my life.	Bilo je očigledno da je ovo moj život.
I don't like it there.	Ne sviđa mi se tamo.
You know when.	Znaš kada.
That's what she said he said.	To je ona rekla da je on rekao.
So I can believe it.	Tako da mogu vjerovati.
I better believe it, it wasn't easy.	Bolje mi je vjerovati, nije bilo lako.
Or it was.	Ili je bilo.
I guess something happened.	Pretpostavljam da se nešto dogodilo.
I can't or won't.	Ne mogu ili neće.
Who is he.	Ko je on.
No need to say anything.	Ne treba ništa reći.
Again and again and again.	Ponovo i ponovo i ponovo.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
He eats with it.	On jede s njim.
I don't think I did that thing.	Ne čini mi se da sam ja radio tu stvar.
I'm not done.	Nisam završio.
I couldn't even believe it.	Nisam mogao ni vjerovati.
There must be more.	Mora ih biti više.
That usually doesn't work.	To obično ne ide.
I don't want to be here.	Ne želim biti ovdje.
I would do that.	Ja bih to uradio.
No one will be well until tomorrow.	Do sutra nikome neće biti dobro.
We would find you.	Naći bismo te.
I will definitely do that.	Sigurno ću to učiniti.
You can never be sure with him.	Sa njim se nikada ne može biti siguran.
It's really pretty simple.	Zaista je prilično jednostavno.
And what she just said was true.	A ono što je upravo rekla bilo je istina.
He lost his job.	Izgubio je posao.
It never was and never will be.	Nikada nije bilo i nikada neće.
We have it pretty well.	Imamo ga prilično dobro.
I was looking for him.	Tražio sam ga.
Or, very often, both.	Ili, vrlo često, oboje.
What is the right way to do this.	Koji je pravi način da se ovo uradi.
Your life itself.	Sam tvoj život.
She was, for me.	Bila je, za mene.
But you can't go back.	Ali ne možete se vratiti.
I know how it is.	Znam kako je.
You probably don't know.	Vjerovatno ne znaš.
I didn't think anything about it.	Nisam mislio ništa o tome.
He can never come back.	Nikad se ne može vratiti.
More.	Više.
Not too bad.	Nije baš loše.
Even more.	Čak i više.
I'm sure yes	Siguran sam da
We work a lot there.	Tamo radimo puno.
But we have to go beyond that.	Ali moramo ići dalje od toga.
We have to do that job.	Moramo da uradimo taj posao.
A little more needs to be said.	Malo više treba da se kaže.
He had problems before.	Imao je problema i ranije.
He had a problem last year, he said.	Imao je problem prošle godine, rekao je.
I wasn't sure what it was.	Nisam bio siguran koji je to bio.
But there was more.	Ali bilo je još toga.
He never wanted to be.	Nikad nije želeo da bude.
I can be the story you want.	Mogu biti priča koju želite.
He is nothing to me anymore.	On mi više nije ništa.
Things will never go your way.	Stvari nikada neće ići kako ti treba.
Or is it.	Ili je to.
Probably long before now.	Vjerovatno mnogo prije sada.
I couldn't find anything better.	Nisam mogao naći ništa bolje.
We cannot and do not have to do this.	Ne možemo i ne moramo ovo da radimo.
You should too.	Trebao bi i ti.
I could never tell.	Nikad nisam mogao reći.
When we did that.	Kada smo to uradili.
I didn't want to.	Nisam htela.
I need to see you.	Moram da te vidim.
I never left.	Nikada nisam otišao.
Better that way.	Bolje tako.
Maybe even before.	Možda čak i prije.
I can't go to him.	Ne mogu kod njega.
And this was exactly it.	A ovo je bilo upravo to.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
He never returned home.	Nikad se nije vratio kući.
Everything is not right.	Sve nije u redu.
We'll leave early.	Otići ćemo ranije.
You can't do that.	Ne možeš to da uradiš.
I'm not sure about everything.	Nisam siguran u sve.
We do it a lot.	Radimo to puno.
He doesn't want to come.	On ne želi doći.
For what, he did not know.	Za šta, nije znao.
Can we meet you? 	Možemo li se naći kod vas?
he said.	on je rekao.
Have fun.	zabavi se.
He can eat.	Može da jede.
That is certainly true.	To je sigurno istina.
That is true today more than ever.	To je istina danas više nego ikada.
It could have, but it didn't.	Moglo je, ali nije.
I saw something else.	Video sam još nešto.
It was always there.	Uvijek je bilo tu.
It was a code.	Bio je to kod.
But there are none.	Ali nema ih.
There are many of them.	Ima ih mnogo.
I didn't think he would tell me.	Nisam mislio da će mi reći.
But we can't know exactly who they are.	Ali, ne možemo tačno znati ko su oni.
I actually know that.	Ja to zapravo znam.
Still waiting.	Još se čeka.
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
It couldn’t have been a better day for that.	Nije mogao biti bolji dan za to.
You don't have to do this.	Ne morate ovo da radite.
Actually more than a few.	Zapravo više od nekoliko.
I think that would be a problem.	Mislim da bi to bio problem.
He was surprised.	Bio je iznenađen.
No one will believe you.	Niko ti neće vjerovati.
No money, she said.	Nema novca, rekla je.
Or a car.	Ili auto.
Or not really.	Ili ne baš.
This is real.	Ovo je stvarno.
Do you have more money?	Imaš li još novca?
You just can't do anything about it.	Jednostavno ne možeš ništa s tim.
I really can't trust myself to say more.	Zaista ne mogu vjerovati sebi da ću reći više.
She's doing something she wants.	Ona radi nešto što želi.
He'll probably be back for more.	Vjerovatno će se vratiti po još.
But it has to be done !.	Ali to se mora uraditi!.
I wanted that with him.	Htela sam to sa njim.
We need to know what happened.	Moramo znati šta se dogodilo.
It was good to know.	Bilo je dobro znati.
So much could have happened in that time.	Toliko se toga moglo dogoditi u to vrijeme.
I was glad for that.	Bilo mi je drago zbog toga.
I'll go now.	Idem odmah.
It's a good idea if it works.	Dobra je ideja ako radi.
This so soon.	Ovo tako brzo.
I have a lot more to say.	Imam još mnogo toga da kažem.
I wasn't ready for this.	Nisam bio spreman za ovo.
You didn't come.	Nisi došao.
It's really simple.	Stvarno je jednostavno.
Tell him how it goes.	Reci mu kako ide.
It was a difficult time.	Bilo je to teško vrijeme.
I didn't do much.	Nisam baš mnogo uradio.
There must be something.	Mora da postoji nešto.
This is a job.	Ovo je posao.
It's yours if you want it.	Tvoj je ako ga želiš.
But you can see too much.	Ali možete vidjeti previše.
It wasn't as hard as he thought it would be.	Nije bilo tako teško kao što je mislio da će biti.
He will say, your father.	Reći će, tvoj otac.
It's so hard for me.	To mi je tako teško.
And maybe more.	A možda još.
I'm not very good.	Nisam baš dobar.
But only for now.	Ali samo za sada.
I don't think we're there yet.	Mislim da još nismo tamo.
This happened last week.	Ovo se dogodilo prošle sedmice.
And we did.	I to smo uradili.
I'll be fine now.	Sada ću biti dobro.
I heard her too.	I ja sam je čuo.
Which it wouldn't.	Što ne bi.
I don't know what else can happen to me.	Ne znam šta mi se još može dogoditi.
I'm afraid that's a problem.	Bojim se da je to problem.
To be with him.	Da budem sa njim.
He really made it look so easy.	Zaista je učinio da to izgleda tako lako.
I have nothing to do.	Nemam šta da radim.
It was more like she said it.	Više je bilo kako je to rekla.
I was pretty good at it.	Bio sam prilično dobar u tome.
I'm afraid not.	Bojim se da nije.
Do your job.	Radi svoj posao.
What he says cannot be true.	Ono što on govori ne može biti istina.
I wonder if it will be me soon.	Pitam se da li ću to uskoro biti ja.
You don't want that, obviously.	Vi to ne želite, očigledno.
He's here right now.	Ovdje je upravo sada.
It may still not be enough.	I dalje možda neće biti dovoljno.
There is no right way.	Ne postoji pravi način.
He says he would like to see them if he could.	Kaže da bi želio da ih vidi kad bi mogao.
But I do not know.	Ali ne znam.
We won't talk about that now.	Nećemo sada o tome.
He arrived a little early.	Stigao je malo ranije.
I told him all that.	Sve sam mu to rekao.
I don't want that again either.	Ni ja to ne želim ponovo.
Arrived on time.	Stigao na vrijeme.
I don't know how to do that.	Ne znam kako to da uradim.
This is good enough for me.	Ovo je dovoljno dobro za mene.
We did not have.	Nismo imali.
He was, he was.	Bio je, jeste.
That's exactly what he said.	Upravo je to rekao.
So far so good.	Za sada je bila dobro.
You said that earlier.	Rekao si to ranije.
And she knows you can do it.	I ona zna da ti to možeš.
This could be done quickly.	Ovo bi se moglo uraditi brzo.
She knew nothing about what had happened to him.	Nije znala ništa o tome šta mu se dogodilo.
Someone needs to know something.	Neko mora nešto znati.
Something that is not like them.	Nešto što nije kao oni.
And he didn't do it.	A on to nije uradio.
Think what you want.	Misli šta hoćeš.
And he does.	I on to radi.
I never told you.	Nikad ti nisam rekao.
It's here.	Ovde je.
But she didn't really tell him no.	Ali nije mu baš rekla ne.
Like, this is going to happen.	Kao da, ovo će se dogoditi.
This man wants something.	Ovaj čovjek želi nešto.
He heard.	Čuo je.
I think they know that.	Mislim da oni to znaju.
I'm glad to be back.	Drago mi je što sam se vratio.
Don't say that.	Ne govori tako.
It shouldn't have been like that.	Nije tako trebalo da bude.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nisam uradio ništa loše.
Besides, there’s not much to say about it.	Osim toga, o tome nema puno toga za reći.
No one seems to ever do that.	Čini se da to nikada niko ne radi.
We work for you.	Mi radimo za vas.
Yes, you are one.	Da, ti si jedan.
We have to get to that.	Moramo doći do toga.
If only something.	Ako samo nešto.
She told me so.	Ona mi je tako rekla.
As much as it was before.	Koliko je to bilo prije.
Sam must have told him.	Mora da mu je Sam rekao.
It never was.	Nikada nije bilo.
There was nothing more to do.	Nije bilo šta više da se uradi.
I'm the one who should leave.	Ja sam taj koji bi trebao otići.
I never heard from you again.	Nikad se više nisam čuo.
I had one.	Imao sam jedan.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
She would tell him.	Rekla bi mu.
And we had it all, you know.	I imali smo sve, znaš.
We wouldn't do that.	Ne bismo to uradili.
He will know.	On će znati.
He could not.	Nije mogao.
I shouldn't have said that.	Nisam trebao to da kažem.
The truth is yes.	Istina je da.
But there was no time.	Ali nije bilo vremena.
But he wanted to know.	Ali želio je znati.
But neither is he.	Ali ni on to nije.
I heard him.	Čuo sam ga.
People would be there.	Ljudi bi bili tamo.
Obviously not.	Očigledno nije.
About a lot of things.	O puno stvari.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
I saw the things you did.	Video sam stvari koje si uradio.
I saw what was happening.	Video sam šta se dešava.
So .	Tako .
Now the car is working well.	Sada auto radi dobro.
Either this or nothing.	Ili je ovo ili ništa.
I think we have a problem here.	Mislim da ovde imamo problem.
You can see these here and here.	Ove možete vidjeti ovdje i ovdje.
But little is known.	Ali malo se toga zna.
And we are human.	I mi smo ljudi.
If only it works.	Ako samo radi.
We weren't there.	Nismo bili tamo.
And we really don't know much about it yet.	I zaista još ne znamo mnogo o tome.
He will return.	On će se vratiti.
He says he doesn't want her to feel that way.	Kaže da ne želi da se ona tako osjeća.
We have a lot of money.	Imamo dosta novca.
I couldn't do it without you.	Ne bih to mogao bez tebe.
I am very happy.	Ja sam vrlo sretan.
I'm not you.	Ja nisam ti.
This is not a new problem.	Ovo nije novi problem.
Very good for you.	Vrlo dobro za tebe.
Like me, today.	Kao ja, danas.
There were people.	Bilo je ljudi.
I had to know more.	Morao sam znati više.
I couldn't see them.	Nisam ih mogao vidjeti.
But they could be better.	Ali mogli bi biti bolji.
Must be.	Mora biti.
Hard in that as usual.	Teško u tome kao i obično.
For the money.	Za novac.
There is little he cannot do.	Malo je toga što ne može.
I don't want to see what's in there.	Ne želim da vidim šta je tamo.
I work for you.	Ja radim za tebe.
You have to trust me.	Moraš mi vjerovati.
I could see that while he was working.	To sam mogao vidjeti dok je radio.
It's not like that there.	Tamo nije tako.
We are so good together.	Tako nam je dobro zajedno.
He does not wish us well.	On nam ne želi dobro.
We know.	Mi znamo.
He will never do anything to you again.	Nikad ti više ništa neće učiniti.
But he couldn't.	Ali nije mogao.
Everyone.	Svi.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
Please? 	Molim te?
Much better than he thought.	Mnogo bolje nego što je mislio.
I don't know when that is.	Ne znam kada je to.
What is it?	Šta je to?
I'd like to know what you think.	Voleo bih da znam šta mislite.
We said say it again.	Rekli smo reci ponovo.
They shouldn't know.	Ne bi trebalo da znaju.
I did not understand.	Nisam shvatio.
He doesn't want to talk.	On ne želi da priča.
You know nothing.	Ti ne znaš ništa.
I have to have a life.	Moram da imam život.
He says something, she says something.	On nešto kaže, ona nešto kaže.
We can do it ourselves.	Možemo to sami.
What you have to believe.	U šta morate vjerovati.
Look, she said.	Vidi, rekla je.
You did your best.	Dao si sve od sebe.
There is nothing we cannot do together.	Ne postoji ništa što ne možemo zajedno da uradimo.
She said that.	Ona je to rekla.
But he likes to talk a lot.	Ali, voli puno da priča.
I never expected it to be so hard today.	Nikad nisam očekivao da će danas biti tako teško.
I've never seen him.	Nikad ga nisam vidio.
I just wasn't my own.	Jednostavno nisam bio svoj.
He must be thinking.	Sigurno se misli.
I had no idea how he knew that.	Nisam imao pojma kako je to znao.
Yes, there are several.	Da, ima ih nekoliko.
No, you don't have to work.	Ne, ne moraš da radiš.
And that's what it's all about.	I to je ono o čemu se radi.
He doesn't do anything.	On ništa ne radi.
It can be difficult.	Može biti teško.
And before.	I prije.
We just did that.	Upravo smo to uradili.
But it's not that simple.	Ali to nije tako jednostavno.
I saw this.	Video sam ovo.
I can't even see what it is.	Ne mogu ni da vidim šta je to.
I really love you very much.	Ja te zapravo jako volim.
That was the only time.	To je bio jedini put.
So little time for that.	Tako malo vremena za to.
He had more.	Imao je i više.
I need to know.	Moram da znam.
Maybe not for you but for me.	Možda ne za tebe nego za mene.
You said it yourself.	Sam si to rekao.
He will never do that again.	On to više nikada neće uraditi.
That would be better.	To bi bilo bolje.
But I'm not sure what.	Ali nisam siguran šta.
Something is happening.	Nešto se dešava.
I know all this.	Znam sve ovo.
But that was not enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno.
The truth is he loves it.	Istina je da on to voli.
It was yes or no.	Bilo je da ili ne.
And so it should.	I tako bi trebao.
But now he was safe.	Ali sada je bio siguran.
I was surprised to see her.	Bio sam iznenađen kad sam je vidio.
Not only that.	Ne samo to.
I didn't get it.	Nisam to shvatio.
I have nothing.	Nemam ništa.
Tell me why you're here.	Reci mi zašto si ovde.
They don't even know you're here.	Oni čak i ne znaju da si ovde.
He knew something was wrong, but he didn't know what it was.	Znao je da nešto nije u redu, ali nije znao šta je to.
This will not work.	Ovo neće moći.
I didn't want to bring them back today.	Danas ih nisam htio vratiti.
It took him a long time.	Trebalo mu je mnogo vremena.
And it happens.	I to se dešava.
Nobody did.	Niko nije.
It's not that he didn't work as hard as she did.	Nije da on nije radio koliko ona.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo u redu.
This is difficult.	Ovo je teško.
Maybe it happened here.	Možda se to ovde dogodilo.
It's not over yet.	Još nije završio.
You don't need it now.	Ne treba sada.
You can't say anything.	Ne možeš ništa reći.
But no one says anything.	Ali niko ništa ne govori.
Why not, it's hard to say.	Zašto nije, teško je reći.
I have a lot of things for you today.	Imam puno stvari za tebe danas.
She has.	Ona ima.
Or, no, that's not right.	Ili, ne, to nije u redu.
We've been here before.	Bili smo ovdje prije.
No next week.	Nema sljedeće sedmice.
Earlier this year.	Ranije ove godine.
I never had a problem with it.	Nikada nisam imao problema sa njim.
She knows all about it.	Ona zna sve o tome.
Why would I.	Zašto bi.
I don't want to see anything.	Ne želim ništa da vidim.
Oh my.	O moj.
I'll tell you that.	Reći ću ti to.
But there is a problem.	Ali postoji problem.
How do you do that?	Kako to radiš?
It happens, you know.	Dešava se, znaš.
I think we need to do this together.	Mislim da ovo moramo uraditi zajedno.
No one knows but me.	Niko ne zna osim mene.
This is hard for so many people.	Ovo je teško za toliko ljudi.
I just don't know.	Samo ne znam.
She wanted to know how you were.	Htela je da zna kako si.
That's so bad.	To je tako loše.
You do not want me.	Ne želiš me.
It seems so little to say it so simply.	Čini se tako malo reći to tako jednostavno.
Do not tell me.	Nemoj mi reći.
Nothing really happened.	Ništa se zaista nije dogodilo.
Not a good thing.	Nije dobra stvar.
I thought of that.	Mislio sam na to.
And that's good.	I to je dobro.
Not much, maybe.	Ne mnogo, možda.
Nothing is happening.	Ništa se ne dešava.
We won't do any of that.	Ništa od toga nećemo učiniti.
As they were.	Kao što su i bili.
I have my job.	Imam svoj posao.
He is a good friend.	On je dobar prijatelj.
I never heard from him.	Nikad se nisam čuo s njim.
And he did.	I on je to uradio.
This is all.	To je sve.
For me, it really is.	Za mene je, zaista, tako.
This is usually true, but not always.	Ovo je obično tačno, ali ne uvek.
That's exactly what I realized.	Upravo sam to shvatio.
Tell him what you told me!	Reci mu šta si mi rekao!
That's not me.	To nisam ja.
This actually happens often.	Ovo se zapravo često dešava.
I said for sure.	Rekao sam sigurno.
I will find a job tomorrow, he said.	Sutra ću naći posao, rekao je.
The next year there were none.	Sljedeće godine ih nije bilo.
They can simply stay.	Oni mogu jednostavno ostati.
Still nothing.	I dalje ništa.
Many, many things.	Mnogo, mnogo stvari.
Those who are here are here.	Oni koji su ovdje su ovdje.
We don't need it anymore.	Ne treba nam više.
Maybe that's good.	Možda je to dobro.
We need say no more than that.	Ne moramo reći ništa više od toga.
Wear it if you have it.	Nosi ga ako ga imaš.
And it works.	I radi.
It could be that way.	Moglo bi i tako.
I don't know why this is happening.	Ne znam zašto se to dešava.
How did he do that?	Kako je to uradio?
You should be happy.	Trebao bi biti sretan.
You can't buy this life.	Ne možeš kupiti ovaj život.
I probably never will.	Vjerovatno nikad neću.
We did it ourselves.	Uradili smo to sami sebi.
I want to be like her.	Želim da budem kao ona.
You can't come.	Ne možete doći.
He had a problem.	Imao je problem.
Let me just say this.	Samo da kažem ovo.
I am much better now.	Sada sam mnogo bolje.
And probably not.	I vjerovatno nije.
I don't want to be me.	Ne želim da to budem ja.
Neither do they.	Ni oni.
It's not.	Nije.
I wish you wouldn't.	Voleo bih da ne bi.
You are my problem.	Ti si moj problem.
What can you see there? 	Šta možete vidjeti tamo?
I want to like this.	Želim ovo da mi se sviđa.
I tell him that.	Ja mu to kažem.
We did this.	Ovo smo uradili.
Like it's real.	Kao da je stvarno.
There is more to it than that.	Ima i više od toga.
I was surprised to see you here.	Bio sam iznenađen što sam te vidio ovdje.
He said he didn't know why he did it.	Rekao je da ne zna zašto je to uradio.
You're good for me, you know.	Ti si dobar za mene, znaš.
He always likes to play.	Uvek voli da igra.
Everyone knew what to do.	Svi su znali šta treba uraditi.
But he can't.	Ali ne može.
He says he'll probably never see me again.	Kaže da me vjerovatno više nikada neće vidjeti.
No one ever told me.	Niko mi nikada nije rekao.
Yes! 	Da!
you are absolutely right.	potpuno si u pravu.
I have no friends.	Nemam prijatelja.
He's just a guy.	On je samo momak.
That's what he does.	To je ono što on radi.
I had no idea what had happened.	Nisam imao pojma šta se dogodilo.
I wouldn't tell anyone.	Ne bih nikome rekao ništa.
She didn't know what to say.	Nije znala šta da kaže.
We know that for sure.	Znamo to sigurno.
You're not like me.	Ti nisi kao ja.
Lots of money.	Puno novca.
That was it.	To je bilo.
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
He seemed to have it all.	Činilo se da ima sve.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I have nothing more to say.	Nemam više za reći.
So that was all.	Tako da je bilo sve.
I am a person who loves.	Ja sam osoba koja voli.
No, it really is.	Ne, stvarno je.
It's pretty easy.	Prilično je lako.
Someone wants you to look bad.	Neko želi da izgledaš loše.
There are not many of them.	Nema ih mnogo.
Why not?	Zašto ne?
He was thirty years old.	Imao je trideset godina.
She told us.	Rekla nam je.
They should know what's going on.	Oni bi trebali znati šta se dešava.
We knew it wasn't going to be easy.	Znali smo da neće biti lako.
Bad and good.	Loše i dobro.
And now it was here.	A sada je bilo ovdje.
Much more could have been done.	Moglo se učiniti mnogo više.
And not just one, many.	I ne samo jedan, mnogo.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
Besides, this has been a difficult time.	Osim toga, ovo je bilo teško vrijeme.
I should have told him no.	Trebao sam mu reći 'ne'.
Maybe we could help.	Možda bi mogli pomoći.
He was there last night.	Bio je tamo sinoć.
He's just trying to be helpful.	On samo pokušava da bude od pomoći.
He doesn't have much money.	On nema mnogo novca.
I say yes to everything.	Kažem da na sve.
Now she knew how much she loved him.	Sada je znala koliko ga voli.
I had to work.	Morao sam da radim.
This will be a problem.	Ovo će biti problem.
I was already fine.	Već sam bio dobro.
And he knew it was true.	I znao je da je to istina.
To say what he has to say.	Da kaže šta ima da kaže.
Something was still wrong.	Nešto i dalje nije bilo u redu.
I'm ready, he said.	Spreman sam, rekao je.
Why is this happening.	Zašto se to dešava.
He's just trying to do the right thing.	On samo pokušava da uradi pravu stvar.
Not even that.	Ne ni to.
And she with me.	I ona sa mnom.
Not bad, really.	Nije loše, zaista.
You should do something.	Trebao bi nešto učiniti.
Good day.	Dobar dan.
He couldn't believe what he was saying, he said.	Nije mogao vjerovati šta govori, rekao je.
How is it not.	Kako nije.
If not, say so.	Ako ne, reci.
There won't be enough of them soon.	Uskoro ih neće biti dovoljno.
And a few were more than they were.	I nekoliko je bilo više nego što su bili.
To be with him.	Da budem sa njim.
You should know better than that.	Trebalo bi da znaš bolje od toga.
Not this one !.	Ne ovaj!.
I think that could be a problem.	Mislim da bi to mogao biti problem.
He's done it before.	Radio je to i prije.
I said that.	Rekao sam to.
How about that?	Šta kažeš na to?
That would be true.	To bi bilo tačno.
I just got home.	Upravo sam se vratio kući.
He didn't expect that.	Nije to očekivao.
But you do it.	Ali ti to uradi.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Nisam siguran kako da to uradim.
It is very likely meant by that.	Vrlo vjerovatno se misli na to.
Now he wouldn't hear me work anymore.	Sada više ne bi čuo da radim.
I don't think so.	Mislim ne.
It's small.	Malo je.
It's like they're not there.	Kao da ih nema.
I'll say it again.	Reći ću ponovo.
I'm really sorry.	Veoma mi je žao.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
If only it existed.	Samo da postoji.
Let's do it now.	Uradimo to odmah.
You just have to know how to tell him what to do.	Samo moraš znati kako mu reći šta da radi.
I'm not sure how you do it.	Nisam baš siguran kako to radiš.
I'm not sure about you.	Nisam siguran za tebe.
He did what he did.	Uradio je ono što je uradio.
And he didn't know.	I nije znao.
You have yourself.	Imaš sebe.
But we will never see it.	Ali to nikada nećemo ni vidjeti.
He is not well today.	Danas mu nije dobro.
Is it bad.	Je li loše.
Here and there I am in it.	Tu i tamo sam u tome.
That was not the question.	To nije bilo pitanje.
I know this is true.	Znam da je ovo istina.
He had enough.	Imao je dosta.
But more can be done.	Ali više se može učiniti.
We have a problem here.	Ovdje imamo problem.
They are not really themselves.	Oni zapravo nisu oni sami.
He thought maybe it was the way she said it.	Mislio je da je možda tako kako je rekla.
I've been here before.	Bio sam ovdje prije.
It's you and you know it.	To si ti i ti to znaš.
They are not for me.	Nisu za mene.
And my father saw them.	I moj otac ih je vidio.
I do not have to.	Ne moram.
That's your friend.	To je tvoj prijatelj.
Can anyone help me?	Može li mi neko pomoći?
But it was actually more than that.	Ali to je zapravo bilo više od toga.
He knows how to drive.	On zna da vozi.
It's so fast and accurate.	Tako je brzo i tačno.
He could have done this.	Mogao je ovo da uradi.
I'm your father.	Ja sam tvoj otac.
The story is here.	Priča je ovdje.
Not as a thing for itself.	Ne kao stvar za sebe.
What is it.	O čemu se radi.
And he wanted to do it right.	I želio je to da uradi kako treba.
It will be soon.	Uskoro će.
How little they knew.	Kako su malo znali.
I am happy to have arrived earlier.	Sretan sam što sam stigao ranije.
I ask about him.	Pitam za njega.
He just bought a new car.	Upravo je kupio novi auto.
I love them all!.	Volim ih sve!.
And really happy.	I zaista sretan.
It's not just that.	Nije samo to.
I can't say we'll never do that.	Ne mogu reći da to nikada nećemo učiniti.
He worked on it yesterday.	Jučer je radio na tome.
This is certainly true.	Ovo je sigurno tačno.
She knew she was wrong.	Znala je da nije u pravu.
What is.	Šta je.
My father has been there many times.	Otac je bio tamo dosta puta.
I'm sorry, he said.	Žao mi je, rekao je.
And it's not easy.	I nije lako.
We didn't really know about that.	Za to zapravo nismo znali.
It was time.	Vrijeme je bilo.
If it's there.	Ako je tamo.
Until it was.	Dok nije bilo.
I'll come.	Doći ću.
They are nothing.	Oni nisu ništa.
I will tell you.	Reći ću ti.
Obviously it doesn't exist.	Očigledno ne postoji.
He wanted to say more.	Htio je reći više.
He had never seen her so badly.	Nikada je nije vidio tako loše.
I've had enough.	Bilo mi je dosta.
But now there is a problem.	Ali sada postoji problem.
Because of him.	Zbog njega.
Maybe even more.	Možda čak i više.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Nije bilo ništa loše u tome.
It was really good.	Bilo je stvarno dobro.
But we were.	Ali bili smo.
This has never happened before.	To se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
Maybe the only good one.	Možda jedini dobar.
I can't talk about it tonight.	Ne mogu o tome večeras.
I see it there.	Vidim to tamo.
Time does that.	Vrijeme to čini.
Nothing is wrong, nothing is as it seems.	Ništa nije u redu, ništa nije kako izgleda.
But he's not entirely sure either.	Ali nije ni potpuno siguran.
For the things you want.	Za stvari koje želite.
We would have a lot.	Imali bismo puno toga.
But this time he will have to.	Ali ovaj put će morati.
Follow me.	Reci za mnom.
They will do anything.	Oni će po bilo čemu.
I know what you're thinking.	Znam šta misliš.
We shouldn't have told him.	Nismo mu trebali reći.
If this.	Ako ovo.
That's what everyone had.	To su svi imali.
Even that wasn't easy.	Čak ni to nije bilo lako.
I just can't take it anymore.	Jednostavno ne mogu više.
I have never heard from him again to this day.	Nikad se više nisam čuo s njim do danas.
He should be what he really is.	On bi trebao biti ono što je stvarno.
There wasn't much to say.	Nije bilo puno toga za reći.
More like three.	Više kao tri.
She said no, she can't do that.	Rekla je ne, ne može to učiniti.
But it shouldn't be.	Ali ne bi trebalo biti.
It often does.	Često to čini.
I think money is the way to go.	Mislim da je za novac pravi put.
And I'm really sorry about you.	I zaista mi te je žao.
Yes, that's better.	Da, to je bolje.
He'll find something to do.	Naći će nešto da radi.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo dobro.
There were people who really knew what was going on.	Bilo je ljudi koji su zaista znali šta se dešava.
I want you to know.	Želim da znaš.
All right, just a little longer.	U redu, samo još malo.
In fact, he didn't say much.	U stvari, nije rekao mnogo.
I want it so badly.	Želim to tako jako.
Maybe she just told him.	Možda da mu je samo rekla.
If we are here, we are here.	Ako smo tu, tu smo.
But it wasn't right.	Ali nije bilo u redu.
Even we won't know what happened to you.	Čak ni mi nećemo znati šta ti se dogodilo.
And now we both have a lot more.	A sada oboje imamo mnogo više.
But he doesn't want to tell me anything more.	Ali ne želi mi ništa više reći.
But no one knows.	Ali niko ne zna.
We don't know how.	Ne znamo kako.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nisam uradio ništa loše.
I would love that.	Voleo bi to.
He was thinking of me.	Mislio je na mene.
You know you want to.	Znaš da želiš.
There is not enough time.	Nema dovoljno vremena.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
It wasn't us.	To nismo bili mi.
Just do your job.	Radite samo svoj posao.
I will never be ready.	Nikada neću biti spreman.
I'm not sure what's wrong.	Nisam siguran šta nije u redu.
.	.
I won't be long.	Neću dugo otići.
I will not do that.	Neću to učiniti.
He has it for that.	Ima to za to.
But what if it was me.	Ali šta ako sam to bio ja.
They, me, were alone.	Oni, ja, bili smo sami.
Like never before.	Kao nikad.
He was too alone.	Bio je previše sam.
I don't need your money.	Ne treba mi tvoj novac.
You were really good.	Bio si stvarno dobar.
Everything was so real.	Sve je bilo tako stvarno.
You did so much for me.	Toliko si uradio za mene.
I won't be here.	Neću biti ovdje.
I do not have it.	Nemam ga.
I did not know what to say.	Nisam znao šta da kažem.
I'm not sure what's up.	Nisam siguran šta ima.
Time is short, but it is possible.	Vremena je malo, ali se može.
He could, but he didn't.	Mogao je, ali nije.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo u redu.
I have to work fast.	Moram brzo da radim.
What does she have to think?	Šta ona mora da misli?
Maybe he was a.	Možda je bio a.
Now we know about it, but.	Sada znamo za to, ali.
It's too easy to be good.	Previše je lako biti dobar.
I don't want you to think of me.	Ne želim da misliš na mene.
I know him better than anyone.	Znam ga bolje od bilo koga.
He's not for you.	On nije za tebe.
I'm just there like.	Ja sam samo tamo kao .
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
This was enough for tonight.	Ovo je bilo dovoljno za večeras.
Until last week.	Do prošle sedmice.
This man is.	Ovaj čovjek je.
I've had enough.	Bilo mi je dosta toga.
Maybe she was right.	Možda je bila u pravu.
I didn't do anything.	Ja nisam ništa uradio.
And she him.	A ona njega.
And he works there.	I on tamo radi.
They had it.	Imali su to.
Do it well.	Uradi to dobro.
I've never been there.	Nikad nisam bio tamo.
It won't be fast.	Neće biti brzo.
He wasn't sure why he had come.	Nije bio siguran zašto je došao.
I had no idea.	Nisam imao ideja.
I didn't think it was.	Nisam mislio da jeste.
Not anymore.	Ne više.
All together.	Svi zajedno.
You know what you got there.	Znaš šta imaš tamo.
It hasn't been here before.	Prije nije bilo ovdje.
It would be good tonight.	Večeras bi bilo dobro.
It shouldn't be like that.	Ne bi trebalo da bude tako.
He was very happy to be home.	Bio je veoma sretan što se vratio kući.
Probably has.	Verovatno ima.
But not like you.	Ali ne kao ti.
Can I see first?	Mogu li prvi vidjeti?
You can do it.	To ti možeš.
Nobody wanted these things.	Niko nije želeo ove stvari.
I have to go now.	Moram da idem sada.
I better have something '.	Bolje da imam nešto'.
Without it, you just can’t.	Bez toga, jednostavno ne možete.
Only the first.	Samo prvi.
He better be ready.	Bolje da bude spreman.
They were there.	Bili su tamo.
And they are not the only ones.	I nisu jedini.
I don't know why really.	Ne znam zašto zaista.
And it is, indeed.	I jeste, zaista.
I totally bought them.	Potpuno sam ih kupio.
But it wasn't right.	Ali nije bilo u redu.
Obviously he will.	Očigledno hoće.
Maybe that's our only hope.	Možda nam je to jedina nada.
He's here tonight.	On je ovde večeras.
Do something.	Radi nešto.
What's happening? 	Šta se dešava?
he thought.	mislio je.
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to istina.
Probably just me.	Vjerovatno samo ja.
I've done it so many times.	Uradio sam to toliko puta.
No one will know.	Niko neće znati.
It's time to do it.	Vrijeme je da to uradimo.
I knew better now.	Sada sam znao bolje.
I have plenty of time.	Imam dosta vremena.
She doesn't talk either.	Ni ona ne priča.
He was ready for this.	Bio je spreman za ovo.
But that was not enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno.
It happens, quite often.	To se dešava, prilično često.
I know he can.	Znam da može.
That was it, really.	To je bilo to, zaista.
I see a problem.	Vidim problem.
I was sure of it.	Bio sam siguran u to.
He speaks into it.	On govori u to.
Really very good.	Zaista veoma dobro.
It wasn't her.	To nije bila ona.
But not like what you think.	Ali ne kao ono što mislite.
Really, really good.	Zaista, stvarno dobro.
Before that.	Prije toga.
Why her? 	Zašto ona?
He was fine and really alone.	Bio je dobro i zaista sam.
I always think so and you will too.	Ja to uvek mislim a i ti ćeš.
You look good.	Izgledaš dobro.
No, it was better.	Ne, bilo je bolje.
I didn't know what happened.	Nisam znao šta se dogodilo.
I do that often.	Često to radim.
Work fast now.	Radite brzo sada.
I never had to.	Nikad nisam morao.
This was my life.	Ovo je bio moj život.
Say what you need to say.	Reci šta treba da kažeš.
No, that's not right.	Ne, to nije u redu.
I asked several people.	Pitao sam nekoliko ljudi.
Really?	Stvarno?
I didn't see it.	Nisam video.
And that was really hard for me.	I to mi je bilo zaista teško.
I know myself.	Znam sebe.
Actually this is not so obvious either.	Zapravo ni ovo nije tako očigledno.
He wouldn't say why.	Nije htio reći zašto.
No, you shouldn't.	Ne, ne bi trebao.
Everything would be fine.	Sve bi bilo u redu.
Okay, he said again.	Dobro, rekao je ponovo.
He should be home by now.	Do sada bi trebao biti kod kuće.
She has no friends here.	Ona ovde nema prijatelja.
He will do it himself.	On će to učiniti sam.
I was very tired.	Bio sam veoma umoran.
It won't be easy.	Neće biti lako.
I hope you stay safe too.	Nadam se da ćeš i ti ostati siguran.
It was all supposed to be.	Sve je to trebalo da bude.
Nobody wanted her.	Niko je nije želeo.
Now it has happened.	Sada se to dogodilo.
Yes, she would.	Da, ona bi.
If it works, it works.	Ako radi, radi.
I wasn't sure if it would.	Nisam bio siguran da li će.
Maybe for you, maybe him.	Možda za tebe, možda on.
It’s actually pretty hard.	To je zapravo prilično teško.
Just not today.	Samo ne danas.
I can't tell you how it happened.	Ne mogu vam reći kako se to dogodilo.
You had to know.	Morao si znati.
That way it will be better.	Tako će biti bolje.
But he didn't say that.	Ali on to nije rekao.
You can say that.	To možete reći.
Not that he could do much.	Nije da je mogao mnogo da uradi.
I can not.	Ne mogu.
Just like that.	Samo tako i.
I wouldn’t expect much trouble here.	Ne bih očekivao mnogo problema ovdje.
It was good to be there.	Bilo je dobro biti tamo.
We don't need this.	Ne treba nam ovo.
I think that's a very good thing.	Mislim da je to jako dobra stvar.
I have what we need.	Imam ono što nam treba.
They just don't know.	Oni jednostavno ne znaju.
I know, neither do I.	Znam, ni ja.
We are a team.	Mi smo tim.
I saw him for the first time.	Vidio sam ga prvi put.
And he sees it now.	I on to sada vidi.
She loves him very much.	Ona ga jako voli.
No one seems to.	Čini se da niko.
And he didn't know if he did the right thing.	I nije znao da li je uradio pravu stvar.
I thought maybe.	Mislio sam možda.
There are many things we do not know.	Ima mnogo stvari koje ne znamo.
There are many ideas.	Postoji mnogo ideja.
I don't doubt you.	Ne sumnjam u tebe.
It is never enough.	Nikada nije dovoljno.
You for that.	Ti za to.
I have no idea why.	Nemam pojma zašto.
You have to trust me and stay here.	Moraš mi vjerovati i ostati ovdje.
But only for a few days.	Ali samo na nekoliko dana.
That is no longer a problem.	To više nije problem.
You are you.	Ti si ti.
Just like you have to.	Baš kao što moraš.
I had to know for sure.	Morao sam da znam sigurno.
He came to me.	Došao je do mene.
They were not in it.	Oni nisu bili u tome.
I wonder how old he really is.	Pitam se koliko ima godina, zaista.
We just know if it works or not.	Samo znamo da li radi ili ne.
But this is not enough.	Ali ovo nije dovoljno.
I hope this is better.	Nadam se da je ovo bolje.
This was a lot.	Ovo je bilo puno.
He lost it.	Izgubio ga je.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
This has never happened before.	Ovo se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
In fact, a lot of it.	U stvari, dosta toga.
He says he knows.	Kaže da zna.
We knew this day would come.	Znali smo da će doći ovaj dan.
This is happening.	Ovo se dešava.
I am completely.	Potpuno sam.
I hope you can help.	Nadam se da možete pomoći.
That seems to be true.	Čini se da je to tačno.
Do what you want.	Radi šta želiš.
Really, really is.	Zaista, zaista jeste.
That doesn't happen often.	To se ne dešava često.
We work hard enough.	Radimo dovoljno.
He really wanted that.	To je jako želio.
But you know what they did.	Ali znate šta su uradili.
That's how it is now.	Tako je to sada.
We are not doing that at the moment.	Mi to trenutno ne radimo.
It's still going.	I dalje ide.
And that was supposed to be it.	I to je trebalo biti to.
It was him now.	To je sada bio on.
And he left.	I on je otišao.
I don’t want to see him do it.	Ne želim da ga vidim kako to radi.
I had no idea what to do.	Nisam imao pojma šta da radim.
That's pretty much it.	Prilično mu je to.
All good.	Sve dobro.
No you are not.	Ne ti nisi.
It's not what you think.	Nije ono što mislite.
It may or may not work.	Može raditi, a možda i neće.
You are there.	Ti si tamo.
They will find you.	Naći će te.
Not very good, but really very bad.	Nije baš dobro, ali zaista jako loše.
He's really bad.	On je stvarno loš.
I can't even find it in the house.	Ne mogu ga naći ni u kući.
I am your very good friend.	Ja sam tvoj veoma dobar prijatelj.
You never work.	Nikad ne radiš.
I want to see him.	Želim da ga vidim.
Like mine.	Kao i moj.
You can't do anything.	Ne možeš ništa.
But it's just us.	Ali to smo samo mi.
I do it myself from time to time.	I sama to s vremena na vrijeme radim.
I can say that.	To mogu reći.
He loves it.	On to voli.
They should be here.	Trebali bi biti ovdje.
You are not allowed to do that.	To vam nije dozvoljeno.
It could happen here.	Moglo bi se dogoditi ovdje.
He is a very good person.	On je veoma dobra osoba.
Or maybe it was this one.	Ili je to možda bio ovaj.
Just tell me.	Samo mi reci.
I never saw him.	Nikad ga nisam video.
A lot of that.	Mnogo toga.
Tell us this and you can go home.	Reci nam ovo i možeš ići kući.
Not that he didn't try.	Nije da nije pokušao.
Probably something very small.	Verovatno je nešto veoma malo.
He was ready, and he could.	Bio je spreman, i mogao je.
There could be another.	Mogao bi biti još jedan.
For something so simple.	Za nešto tako jednostavno.
This should be obvious.	Ovo bi trebalo biti očigledno.
There are many of us.	Ima nas mnogo.
He didn't do it anymore.	Nije to više radio.
I want to go there, she said.	Želim da idem tamo, rekla je.
I couldn’t believe it, but she was right.	Nisam mogao vjerovati, ali bila je u pravu.
I'm done.	Završio sam.
I mean, when he was there.	Mislim, kad je bio tamo.
It couldn't be.	To nije moglo biti.
They did something better.	Uradili su nešto bolje.
What he meant was obvious.	Ono što je mislio bilo je očigledno.
Now we do everything together.	Sada sve radimo zajedno.
Not that you should have.	Nije da ste trebali.
I don’t know how that could have happened.	Ne znam kako se to moglo dogoditi.
And work is work.	A posao je posao.
I'm almost the only one who does.	Ja sam skoro jedini koji to radi.
He saw it here.	Video je ovdje.
Even if they don't know it.	Čak i ako to ne znaju.
I want to know for sure.	Želim da znam sigurno.
Not that he expected it.	Nije da je očekivao.
Neither did he, obviously.	Ni on, očigledno.
They never did.	Nikada nisu.
Everyone knows who you are.	Svi znaju ko ste.
Maybe more than that.	Možda i više od toga.
And that's what it's all about.	I o tome se radi.
Okay, you said.	Dobro, rekao si.
To be sure.	Da bi bili sigurni.
Okay, maybe not, but if it could, it would be.	Dobro, možda i nije, ali da je moglo, bilo bi.
I'm still in it.	Još uvijek sam u tome.
I couldn't do without it.	Ne bih mogao bez toga.
Probably not.	Verovatno nisu.
I want to see him, now.	Želim da ga vidim, odmah.
But more was needed.	Ali trebalo je još toga.
I thought he needed help.	Mislio sam da mu treba pomoć.
There was so much to do.	Bilo je toliko toga da se uradi.
And we're about to do it right.	I uskoro ćemo to učiniti kako treba.
I do.	Ja to radim.
He knows that.	On to zna.
They were all there.	Svi su bili tamo.
And that's okay.	I to je u redu.
No one would tell me why.	Niko mi ne bi rekao zašto.
I really didn't.	Zaista nisam.
But he did none of that.	Ali on nije uradio ništa od toga.
You can't get a job again.	Ne možeš ponovo dobiti posao.
I can't trust him.	Ne mogu mu vjerovati.
It's just not that simple.	Samo to nije tako jednostavno.
He wondered where he was tonight.	Pitao se gdje je večeras.
Until last month.	Do prošlog mjeseca.
Maybe they were there.	Možda su bili tamo.
It didn't happen.	Nije se dogodilo.
They did just that.	Oni su upravo to uradili.
You are here now.	Sada si ovdje.
I really wasn't sure.	Zaista nisam bio siguran.
I don't have a car.	Nemam auto.
I never really had time.	Nikad stvarno nisam imao vremena.
No one was here.	Niko nije bio ovdje.
That's bad enough.	To je dovoljno loše.
Anything that could ever be.	Sve što bi ikada moglo biti.
So it seems to work for me.	Tako da izgleda da mi radi.
I can tell you well.	Mogu ti dobro reći.
He did it well.	On je to dobro uradio.
But no one saw him.	Ali niko ga nije video.
Do you want to come?	Želiš li doći?
In fact, not everything.	U stvari, sve samo ne.
Why, we can do anything.	Zašto, možemo sve.
And they know about me.	I znaju za mene.
I was surprised.	Bio sam iznenađen.
I only heard what you heard.	Čuo sam samo ono što si ti čuo.
Which, it's hard to say.	Koje, teško je reći.
And how she wants to live there.	I kako ona želi da živi tamo.
Exactly how it happened.	Tačno kako se dogodilo.
This works well.	Ovo dobro radi.
But it wasn't just him.	Ali nije to bio samo on.
I was never happy.	Nikad nisam bio sretan.
They were like him.	Bili su kao on.
That will help you.	To će ti pomoći.
Or they were.	Ili su bili.
I love you	volim te
I do not know who it is.	Ne znam koje.
I didn't mean it that way.	Nisam tako mislio.
You know how it was.	Znaš kako je to bilo.
I wasn't happy about that.	Nisam bio sretan zbog toga.
But there are so many of them.	Ali tako ih je mnogo.
We have to leave soon.	Moramo uskoro otići.
That is what life is.	To je ono što je život.
I have more and more money and power.	Imam sve više novca i moći.
All the better for us.	Tim bolje za nas.
It's really not that hard.	Zaista nije tako teško.
I asked her what she was going to do.	Pitao sam je šta će da uradi.
I'm not asking.	Ne pitam.
What must be done.	Šta je ono što se mora uraditi.
But it's better.	Ali bolje je.
Maybe there is still a way.	Možda još postoji način.
Just what he needed.	Baš ono što mu je trebalo.
It's not hard for me.	Nije mi teško.
You don't know what he can do to you.	Ne znaš šta ti može učiniti.
I mean, you know.	Mislim, znaš.
I love it so much.	Toliko volim.
Someone better do something soon.	Bolje da neko uradi nešto uskoro.
I guess you know what the reason is.	Pretpostavljam da znate koji je to razlog.
This is obviously not true.	Ovo očigledno nije tačno.
I'll pay you back.	Ja ću ti vratiti.
Tell him what to do.	Reci mu šta treba da uradi.
To be sure.	Da budem siguran.
But probably no one will.	Ali vjerovatno niko neće.
She was always there for us.	Uvek je bila tu za nas.
Nobody asked for it.	Niko to nije tražio.
He will give you everything he has.	On će ti dati sve što ima.
It's a new way.	To je novi način.
No, it's just .	Ne, to je samo .
I know it wasn't easy.	Znam da to nije bilo lako.
The team worked well.	Tim je dobro radio.
There is nothing further than that.	Ne postoji ništa dalje od toga.
I go to work.	Idem na posao.
Not that we have much.	Nije da imamo mnogo.
He said he did.	Rekao je da jeste.
We'll know soon enough.	Uskoro ćemo znati.
We know what happened, we know who did it.	Znamo šta se dogodilo, znamo ko je to napravio.
I think he is too.	Mislim da je i on.
He will too.	I on će tako.
Was that you?	Jesi li to bio ti?
We can talk about it.	Možemo razgovarati o tome.
I am one of you.	Ja sam jedan od vas.
Very very good.	Jako jako dobar.
Now you know the reason.	Sada znate razlog.
That was not true.	To nije bilo istina.
Don't talk often.	Ne govori često.
It was just a job for him.	To je za njega bio samo posao.
It's about fun.	Radi se o zabavi.
But maybe we won't.	Ali možda nećemo.
And he admitted it.	I on je to priznao.
When you want it.	Kad to želiš.
Maybe it is.	Možda je to.
Please tell me this is not it.	Molim te reci mi da nije ovo.
Not just my job.	Ne samo moj posao.
I didn't know anything.	Nisam znao ništa.
It seemed like a lot at the time.	Činilo se kao dosta u to vrijeme.
It's very simple.	Vrlo je jednostavno.
This is fast.	Ovo je brzo.
They have said that many times.	To su rekli mnogo puta.
He simply exists.	On jednostavno postoji.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
He would.	On bi.
But he couldn't, not yet.	Ali nije mogao, ne još.
That's my job.	To je moj posao.
I want her here.	Želim je ovdje.
I'm glad for him.	Drago mi je zbog njega.
He doesn't need it.	Ne treba mu.
He wants it badly.	On to želi loše.
I have to go.	Moram ići.
I don't want him to come.	Ne želim da dođe.
I don't know how long.	Ne znam koliko dugo.
I went and told him.	Otišao sam i rekao mu.
He was fine.	Bilo mu je dobro.
Nobody like him.	Niko kao on.
Obviously there was something to see.	Očigledno je bilo šta da vidim.
Everything he does works well.	Sve što radi, radi dobro.
But that's not it.	Ali to nije to.
I have it.	Imam je.
I still could.	I dalje bih mogao.
And so, but hard to get.	I tako, ali teško dobiti.
But that was last year.	Ali to je bilo prošle godine.
I can find them.	Mogu ih naći.
We've never had this before.	Ovo nikada ranije nismo imali.
We could have been anywhere.	Mogli smo biti bilo gdje.
And do it again.	I uradi to ponovo.
He knows when he is.	On zna kada je.
It cannot be done by one man alone.	To ne može učiniti samo jedan čovjek.
Such a happy day.	Tako sretan dan.
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
I had another reason why I came.	Imao sam još jedan razlog zašto sam došao.
And a lot if we can get it.	I puno toga ako ga možemo dobiti.
If it did, it would probably happen this afternoon or tonight.	Da jeste, vjerovatno bi se to dogodilo popodne ili večeras.
But that's not really the point.	Ali to nije baš stvar.
But they are there.	Ali oni su tu.
What can be	Šta može biti
I can't be sure.	Ne mogu biti siguran.
There is really nothing to do.	Zaista nema šta da se uradi.
Today, there is a lot of money.	Danas, ima dosta novca.
I'll go, if you want me to go.	Otići ću, ako želiš da idem.
But not me.	Ali ne ja.
I want to be here.	Želim biti ovdje.
That's a pretty good thing.	To je prilično dobra stvar.
I'm still there.	I dalje sam tamo.
It's not.	Nije.
She's wrong.	Ona nije u pravu.
That didn't need to be done either.	Ni to nije trebalo uraditi.
I have to go to work.	Moram na posao.
I think he probably will.	Mislim da vjerovatno hoće.
And you didn't know.	A ti nisi znao.
A few people were in line.	Nekoliko ljudi je bilo u redu.
It was difficult for everyone.	Svima je bilo teško.
There is enough for everyone.	Ima dovoljno za sve.
Without it, I would be nothing.	Bez toga ne bih bio ništa.
You said yourself she was the problem.	Sam si rekao da je ona problem.
You're home.	Kući ste.
I never heard that.	Nikad to nisam čuo.
And you will be better.	I ti ćeš biti bolji.
It took a long time to play like before.	Trebalo je dosta vremena da se igra kao prije.
I doubt it's the only one.	Sumnjam da je to jedini.
This is true enough.	Ovo je dovoljno tačno.
I really think my friend was right.	Zaista mislim da je moj prijatelj bio u pravu.
But it doesn't work anymore.	Ali to više ne radi.
Is there anyone else about it?	Ima li još neko nešto o tome?
He must love her.	Mora da je voli.
It just doesn’t work.	To jednostavno ne radi.
You can't see him.	Ne možete ga vidjeti.
But what do we know.	Ali šta znamo.
Much more will be seen tomorrow.	Sutra će se još mnogo toga vidjeti.
If he did, he might never leave.	Da jeste, možda nikada ne bi otišao.
We are very.	Veoma smo.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
He no longer knew what it was.	Više nije znao šta je.
It will happen, it will happen for sure.	To će se dogoditi, to će se sigurno dogoditi.
He won't give it to us.	Neće nam ga dati.
But now.	Nego sada.
Only it never really happened.	Samo što se to nikada nije dogodilo stvarno.
Easy.	Lako.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
You say that, it must be so.	Ti to kažeš, mora da je tako.
You should do it.	Trebao bi to uraditi.
And so we did.	I tako smo i uradili.
But it looks good.	Ali izgleda dobro.
I just asked her something.	Upravo sam je nešto pitao.
I think that's a problem with us.	Mislim da je to problem kod nas.
I wonder where he lives.	Pitam se gdje živi.
You have to help us.	Morate nam pomoći.
So there is a lot to do.	Tako da ima mnogo toga da se uradi.
But do it right.	Ali uradi to kako treba.
We can be better than that.	Možemo biti bolji od toga.
Not much, maybe.	Ne mnogo, možda.
He was supposed to come tomorrow.	Trebao je doći sutra.
I know you're there.	Znam da si tamo.
I should have come back alone.	Trebao sam se sam vratiti.
He was also my father.	I on je bio i moj otac.
What he said.	Šta je rekao.
I lost too.	I ja sam izgubio.
This doesn't work.	Ovo ne radi.
Like yours, here.	Kao tvoj, ovde.
I never said that.	Nikad to nisam rekao.
But not us.	Ali ne mi.
Something she said was very difficult.	Nešto što je rekla bilo je veoma teško.
That's a lot.	To je mnogo.
I told him.	Rekao sam mu.
He eats almost everything.	Jede skoro sve.
He will see you for himself.	On će te sam vidjeti.
It's probably there too.	Verovatno je i tamo.
Tomorrow will be bad weather.	Sutra će biti loše vrijeme.
He never wanted that.	On to nikada nije želio.
I hope that's okay.	Nadam se da je to u redu.
My friend is here.	Moj prijatelj je ovdje.
And there is time.	A tu je i vrijeme.
I'm going to see him.	Idem kod njega.
But that was not all.	Ali to nije bilo sve.
I'll tell him you're not here.	Reći ću mu da nisi ovdje.
He expected to be here for a while.	Očekivao je da će biti ovdje neko vrijeme.
He just isn't there.	Jednostavno ga nema.
But we don't have to.	Ali ne moramo.
I thought you could tell me not to go.	Mislio sam da bi mi mogao reći da ne idem.
That's for a good day.	To je za dobar dan.
I know.	Znam.
Nothing more than that, for now.	Ništa više od toga, za sada.
Everything is going so fast.	Sve ide tako brzo.
That's what he would do.	To bi on uradio.
This often happens.	To se često dešava.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
You can easily see this for yourself.	To možete lako vidjeti i sami.
I wondered.	Pitao sam se.
But it has to be done !.	Ali to se mora uraditi!.
It was really bad.	Bilo je stvarno loše.
Nobody did.	Niko nije.
And it was because of me.	I to je bilo zbog mene.
That is not a problem at the moment.	To trenutno nije problem.
This is your problem.	Ovo je tvoj problem.
I just don't know what to say.	Jednostavno ne znam šta da kažem.
This was not the way.	Ovo nije bio put.
That was the only thing he wouldn't do.	To je bila jedina stvar koju on ne bi uradio.
But it actually can.	Ali zapravo može.
I'll tell you when.	Reći ću ti kada.
The first way.	Prvi način.
I would buy here again.	Kupio bih ponovo ovdje.
I hope that is enough.	Nadam se da je to dovoljno.
As someone said, it's not.	Kao što je neko rekao, nije.
But she won't say anything to help me.	Ali ona neće reći ništa da mi pomogne.
He still has it.	I dalje ga ima.
It looks really good.	Izgleda jako dobro.
We don't have to do that here.	Ne moramo to da radimo ovde.
Even.	Čak.
Maybe a little.	Možda, malo.
Or he shouldn't have.	Ili nije trebao.
I don't ask much.	Ne pitam puno.
Why not?' 	Zašto ne?'
I didn't tell him much.	Nisam mu mnogo rekao.
We just have to be on it.	Samo moramo biti na tome.
I gave it my all.	Dao sam sve.
We should too.	I mi bi trebali.
We don't know how it happened.	Ne znamo kako se to dogodilo.
I did my job and he did his.	Ja sam radio svoj posao, a on svoj.
But when a man can, he will.	Ali kad čovjek može, hoće.
He couldn't help it.	Nije mogao pomoći.
More and more.	Sve više i više.
Tell me what's going on.	Reci mi šta se dešava.
It works for me.	Radi za mene.
She doesn't seem to know anything.	Ona, izgleda, ne zna ništa.
They were not like me.	Nisu bili kao ja.
It happened here.	To se dogodilo ovdje.
I've seen it here before, I just don't know where.	Već sam to vidio ovdje, samo ne znam gdje.
That obviously won't happen.	To se očigledno neće dogoditi.
I didn't want to see anyone.	Nisam htela nikoga da vidim.
But he couldn't help it.	Ali nije mogao pomoći.
None of us expected this.	Niko od nas nije očekivao ovo.
Maybe they knew that.	Možda su to i znali.
I would like to know what is happening.	Voleo bih da znam šta se dešava.
They are business.	Oni su posao.
He will be home soon.	Uskoro će se vratiti kući.
I wish I knew why.	Voleo bih da znam zašto.
I didn't hear what he said.	Nisam čuo šta je rekao.
I was tired of it.	Bio sam umoran od toga.
And good for me.	I dobro za mene.
Nobody can find us here.	Ovde nas niko ne može naći.
Maybe he should.	Možda je trebao.
This last week.	Ovo prošle sedmice.
Even bad weather is good.	Čak je i loše vrijeme dobro.
That way no one would see you.	Tako te niko ne bi video.
I didn't have that.	Nisam to imao.
It used to be that simple.	To je nekada bilo tako jednostavno.
Can anyone do that.	Može li neko to učiniti.
That, even more.	To, čak i više.
We have time.	Imamo vremena.
That was so obvious.	To je bilo tako očigledno.
I'm not very good at it.	Nisam baš dobar u tome.
He said .	On je rekao .
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
How happy a man he is.	Kako je on sretan čovjek.
Which they usually were all.	Što su obično bili svi.
I lost some, but not too much.	Izgubio sam nešto, ali ne previše.
I don't have to do this.	Ne moram ovo da radim.
People know who you are.	Ljudi znaju ko ste.
It is, indeed.	Jeste, zaista.
He didn't hear her.	Nije je čuo.
If not, fine.	Ako ne, u redu.
You will leave.	Otići ćeš.
That was three days ago.	To je bilo prije tri dana.
You were very good!	Bio si veoma dobar!
But it's not.	Ali nije.
We know more now than before.	Sada znamo više nego ranije.
That's them.	To su oni.
Just don't do it.	Samo nemoj to raditi.
That's what you told us.	To ste nam rekli.
That's all we can do.	To je sve što možemo.
But nothing more than that.	Ali ništa više od toga.
The man said nothing.	Čovjek ništa nije rekao.
Not in a good or bad way.	Ne na dobar ili loš način.
Not as good as you think.	Nije tako dobro kao što mislite.
And nothing will.	I ništa neće.
Who lost everything.	Ko je sve izgubio.
Not you.	Ne i ti.
We had no money.	Nismo imali novca.
You will have to do this yourself.	Ovo ćete morati sami da uradite.
There is nothing to say that it could not.	Nema šta da se kaže da nije moglo.
I hope this happens soon.	Nadam se da će se to dogoditi uskoro.
Not fast enough.	Ne dovoljno brzo.
That is easy.	To je lako.
You can't, it doesn't exist.	Ne možete, ne postoji.
You can do this very easily.	To možete učiniti vrlo jednostavno.
I do not like.	ne volim.
He does his job and does it well.	On radi svoj posao i dobro ga radi.
And so it was.	I tako je bilo.
That just wasn’t enough.	To jednostavno nije bilo dovoljno.
This really can't happen.	Ovo se zaista ne može dogoditi.
But he knew it was.	Ali on je znao da jeste.
You must be tired.	Mora da si umoran.
But it's like, no.	Ali to je kao, ne.
Very much.	Veoma.
It's simple in itself.	To je jednostavno samo po sebi.
I don't know why, it just is.	Ne znam zašto, jednostavno jeste.
That was my first job.	To je bio moj prvi posao.
I didn't know there was such a thing.	Nisam znao da postoji tako nešto.
But it can be real.	Ali to može biti stvarno.
She is waiting.	Ona čeka.
Okay, it looks pretty good.	U redu, izgleda prilično dobro.
I had it.	Imao sam ga.
Maybe he's right.	Možda je u pravu.
Never never never.	Nikad nikad nikad.
That just wouldn’t happen.	To se jednostavno ne bi dogodilo.
I would do a lot of things today.	Danas bi radio mnogo stvari.
You should come.	Trebao bi doći.
He must have known that was not true.	Sigurno je znao da to nije istina.
Something people did.	Nešto što su ljudi uradili.
They both knew how much he had done.	Oboje su znali koliko je uradio.
You could have done more.	Mogao si uraditi više.
I'm afraid that's it.	Bojim se da je to to.
He was not surprised.	Nije bio iznenađen.
I'm sure you'll know what to do.	Siguran sam da ćete znati šta da radite.
They are just a thing.	Oni su samo stvar.
Who is someone when no one loves.	Koji je neko koga niko ne voli.
It wouldn't take long.	Ne bi trebalo dugo.
That was me.	To sam bio ja.
It is often done.	Često se radi.
That's what you need.	To je ono što ti treba.
I want to know what happened there.	Želim da znam šta se tamo dogodilo.
She knew how to do it.	Znala je kako to da uradi.
He thinks.	On misli.
You can do this.	Ovo možete učiniti.
And that's a good thing.	I to je dobra stvar.
He looked better tonight.	Večeras je izgledao bolje.
You don’t have to do everything yourself.	Ne morate sve sami.
I have no idea what's going on.	Nemam pojma šta se dešava.
I know it's not me.	Znam da nisam ja.
I'm sure he'll be here very soon.	Siguran sam da će doći vrlo brzo.
He did what he did.	Uradio je ono što je uradio.
One is obviously a very bad job.	Jedan je očigledno jako loš posao.
I'm sorry I can't help anymore.	Žao mi je što više ne mogu pomoći.
So it goes on.	Tako da ide dalje.
It wasn't allowed.	Nije bilo dozvoljeno.
I was there many years ago.	Bio sam tamo prije mnogo godina.
It is never easy.	Nikad nije lako.
I want you .	Želim te .
But he had many friends.	Ali imao je mnogo prijatelja.
It's not that simple.	Nije tako jednostavno.
But that was not very likely.	Ali to nije bilo baš vjerovatno.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
He doesn't want to talk.	On ne želi da govori.
I think we were a better team.	Mislim da smo bili bolji tim.
He got lost.	Izgubio se.
Arrived there, but not there yet.	Stigao tamo, ali još ne tamo.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I was really into it for a while.	Neko vrijeme sam stvarno bio u tome.
I wondered who he was.	Pitao sam se ko je on.
He only has me.	On ima samo mene.
A little more.	Malo više.
Nobody says anything.	Niko ništa ne govori.
That's my problem.	To je moj problem.
No, this was more.	Ne, ovo je bilo više.
There were too many of them.	Bilo ih je previše.
That was thirty years ago.	To je bilo prije trideset godina.
I just didn’t know what to do about it.	Jednostavno nisam znao šta da radim o tome.
So much more.	Toliko više.
And she knew it.	I ona je to znala.
It was really, really hard.	Bilo je stvarno, jako teško.
You know, don't say yes or no.	Znaš, nemoj reći da ili ne.
So it is today.	Tako je danas.
Now he realized he didn't know what to do with it.	Sada je shvatio da ne zna šta bi s tim.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
Just not in the way he thought.	Samo ne na način na koji je mislio.
You can't talk to him.	Ne možeš razgovarati s njim.
But he hasn't arrived yet.	Ali još nije stigao.
That's what we need.	To je ono što nam treba.
Now he understood that.	Sada je to shvatio.
But we really never know how much time we have.	Ali zaista nikad ne znamo koliko vremena imamo.
That happened.	To se dogodilo.
I was right.	Bio sam u pravu.
And it works very well.	I radi veoma dobro.
Like, that's right.	Kao, to je tako.
There are a lot of things here.	Ovdje ima puno stvari.
This is much better.	Ovo je mnogo bolje.
I didn't want to ask.	Nisam htela da pitam.
Father asked you.	Otac te je pitao.
what are you going to do	šta ćeš da radiš?
He started to say something.	Počeo je nešto da govori.
This is not going to be hard for me.	Ovo mi neće biti teško.
There was one there, yes.	Bio je jedan tamo, da.
But really, there is nothing wrong with that.	Ali zaista, u tome nema ništa loše.
Who they are.	Ko su.
Doing something is something.	Raditi nešto je nešto.
He had been in the house before.	Bio je u kući od ranije.
And she says.	I ona kaže.
We can't leave.	Ne možemo otići.
I had no idea how to do it today.	Nisam imao pojma kako da to uradim danas.
He was much more than that now.	Sada je bio mnogo više od toga.
I know them well.	Znam ih dobro.
We had no idea what he did.	Nismo imali pojma šta je uradio.
He started driving.	Počeo je da vozi.
It's just a matter of time.	To je samo pitanje vremena.
Can we do this?	Možemo li ovo?
He must have her.	Mora da je ima.
He's gone now.	Sada je otišao.
There was too much money.	Bilo je previše novca.
You know why that was.	Znate zašto je to bilo.
Maybe you don't know he's there.	Možda i ne znaš da je tamo.
It was hard for that.	Bilo je teško za tim.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
We would never do that now.	Nikada to sada ne bismo uradili.
It seemed to be.	Činilo se da jeste.
And everything works.	I sve radi.
I'd say it's bad.	Rekao bih da je loše.
How do we really know what is true?	Kako zaista znamo šta je istina?
This is not true.	To nije istina.
Actually a few.	Zapravo nekoliko.
I was happy.	Bio sam sretan.
No, that's not a problem.	Ne, to nije problem.
I asked him if he had ever seen it.	Pitao sam ga da li je to ikada vidio.
Just tell me what to do.	Samo mi govori šta da radim.
That was what he expected.	To je bilo ono što je očekivao.
Are you sure that was enough?	Jeste li sigurni da je to bilo dovoljno?
I'm sorry you can't see that.	Žao mi je što to ne možete vidjeti.
That's okay with us.	To je u redu sa nama.
He won't even know he's there.	Neće ni znati da je tamo.
You know what to do.	Znaš šta da radiš.
He was a real friend of mine.	Bio mi je pravi prijatelj.
Maybe she was.	Možda je i bila.
I'm glad you're better.	Drago mi je da si bolje.
So it was very difficult.	Tako da je bilo jako teško.
This should be a good day.	Ovo bi trebao biti dobar dan.
He saw nothing.	Nije video ništa.
She said as if she did.	Rekla je kao da jeste.
Even if you may be good, you may be bad.	Čak i ako si možda dobar, možda loš.
I was nothing and I had nothing.	Bio sam ništa i nisam imao ništa.
It's all true.	Sve je to istina.
I could do it.	Ja sam to mogao.
I had to see you.	Morao sam da te vidim.
I will not do that.	Neću to učiniti.
We know he's a good guy.	Znamo da je dobar momak.
Or it certainly seemed to be.	Ili se sigurno činilo da jeste.
That's how my business started.	Tako je počeo moj posao.
Things you can't bring back.	Stvari koje ne možete vratiti.
And she loves him.	I ona ga voli.
I am going home.	Idem kući.
But nothing works.	Ali ništa ne radi.
Mine doesn't work.	Moj to ne radi.
But that was not enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno.
Nice to know.	Drago mi je da znam.
It could have been better.	Moglo je biti bolje.
We have to move on.	Moramo dalje.
Yes, nothing seems to have happened.	Da, izgleda da se ništa nije dogodilo.
I don't know what happened to you.	Ne znam šta ti se dogodilo.
I would be the first to do that.	Ja bih bio prvi koji bi to uradio.
Not like here.	Ne kao ovdje.
You still do it.	I dalje to radiš.
Nothing so simple.	Ništa tako jednostavno.
Now he wondered why he thought he could.	Sada se pitao zašto je mislio da može.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
We always do that.	Mi to uvek radimo.
You know, that's nothing.	Znaš, što nije ništa.
Where he will probably stay.	Gdje će vjerovatno ostati.
Any of you.	Bilo ko od vas.
I've done it so far.	Ja sam to radio do sada.
I want to be me.	Želim da budem ja.
It was hard for me.	Za mene je bilo teško.
This is not the time.	Trenutno nije vrijeme.
Not a bit.	Nije ni malo.
That is what we need to know.	To je ono što treba da znamo.
I can't go beyond that.	Ne mogu dalje od toga.
It should be pretty easy to get to.	Trebalo bi biti prilično lako doći.
That just can’t happen.	To se jednostavno ne može dogoditi.
I'm going there.	Idem tamo.
I don't want to do that here.	Ne želim to raditi ovdje.
She has her job.	Ona ima svoj posao.
My father was there too.	I moj otac je bio tamo.
That never happened.	To se nikada nije dogodilo.
How you do it.	Kako to radite.
He thinks so.	On to misli.
Not a single time.	Ni jedan jedini put.
And your father doesn't know you're here, not yet.	A tvoj otac ne zna da si ovdje, ne još.
Which he did.	Što je i uradio.
Why not now ?.	Zašto ne sada?.
Much better than before.	Mnogo bolje nego ranije.
This is very good.	Ovo je vrlo dobro.
He'll be home the next day for sure.	Sigurno će biti kući sljedećeg dana.
This simply cannot be true.	Ovo jednostavno ne može biti istina.
I thought you knew that too.	Mislio sam da i ti to znaš.
He had to know what was going on.	Morao je znati šta se dešava.
This has never happened before.	To se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
I realized who she was.	Shvatio sam ko je ona.
he said.	on je rekao.
Just never again.	Samo nikad više.
Yes, it really would.	Da, zaista bi.
I don't know where he is.	Ne znam gdje je.
New life, maybe.	Novi život, možda.
None of us knows what you are anymore.	Niko od nas više ne zna šta si ti.
He went with it.	Otišao je s tim.
This cannot be found now.	Ovo se sada ne može naći.
I'm not good.	Nisam dobro.
In addition, there is a problem.	Osim toga, postoji i problem.
You are the problem here.	Vi ste problem ovde.
She loves to play.	Ona voli da igra.
No problem here.	Tu nema problema.
Speak, she said.	Govori, rekla je.
I'm doing very well there.	Mnogo mi dobro ide tamo.
That was his only hope.	To mu je bila jedina nada.
That was probably good, but it wasn't good.	To je vjerovatno bilo dobro, ali nije bilo dobro.
Be there, do it.	Bio tamo, uradio to.
I thought it might be so.	Mislio sam da bi moglo biti tako.
Usually it can't.	Obično ne može.
He says even she is.	Kaže da čak i ona jeste.
It's true.	To je istina.
It won't work.	Neće raditi.
I have to do this.	Moram ovo da uradim.
But this time.	Ali ovaj put.
It's just for me.	To je samo za mene.
So he was ready.	Tako da je on bio spreman.
Maybe he's right.	Možda je u pravu.
And so it is.	I tako je.
But there really is no way to say it.	Ali zaista ne postoji način da to kažem.
Let someone come and help.	Da neko dođe i pomogne.
We like it here.	Sviđa nam se ovdje.
Tell me why you want to.	Reci mi zašto želiš.
And he was the only one who knew.	I on je jedini znao.
To know you're here.	Da znam da si ovde.
I’m pretty sure it’s the only one that exists.	Prilično sam siguran da je jedini koji postoji.
Not very good.	Nije baš dobro.
He was right.	Bio je u pravu.
She was very good that way.	Bila je jako dobra na taj način.
I have to do something.	Moram nešto da uradim.
He knows it's more than that.	Zna da je više od toga.
That seems obvious to me.	To mi izgleda očigledno.
We couldn't see anything.	Nismo mogli ništa vidjeti.
Your father will do what he wants.	Tvoj otac će raditi šta hoće.
We knew that at the time.	Znali smo to u to vrijeme.
It shouldn't have been.	Nije trebalo biti.
I'm not sure about that.	Nisam baš siguran u to.
I thought maybe you could do something with it.	Mislio sam da bi možda mogao nešto učiniti s tim.
There was nothing to do.	Nije bilo šta da se radi.
It was time.	Bilo je vrijeme.
We have a pretty good deal going for us.	Imamo prilično dobar posao za nas.
For you.	Za tebe.
How much.	Koliko.
He wanted to know the time.	Želio je znati vrijeme.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu ide.
I just need someone for me.	Samo mi treba neko za mene.
I want to know.	Želim znati.
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno ste u pravu.
That's what it looks like.	Tako izgleda.
I still see it often.	I dalje to često vidim.
I must have been tired before.	Sigurno sam ranije bio umoran.
And it really works.	I zaista radi.
But not really.	Ali ne baš.
If you are sure.	Ako ste sigurni.
There are a lot of them.	Ima ih dosta.
But not really.	Ali ne baš.
But he knew he wouldn't.	Ali znao je da neće.
He can't be trusted!	Ne može mu se vjerovati!
And it often is.	I često je tako.
There is a good life there.	Dobar je život tamo.
It doesn't look like that.	Ne izgleda tako.
They are wrong.	Oni nisu u pravu.
But he didn't feel better without it.	Ali bez toga mu nije bilo bolje.
He was out of ideas.	Bio je bez ideja.
She hadn't told him yet.	Još mu nije rekla.
I can never come home to you again.	Ne mogu ti više nikada doći kući.
That won’t happen tomorrow, but it will come.	To se neće dogoditi sutra, ali će doći.
But it happened.	Ali to se dogodilo.
And this usually works well enough.	I ovo obično radi dovoljno dobro.
He told us all about it.	Rekao nam je sve o tome.
It won't be me.	Neću biti ja.
That would be to do the right thing.	Bilo bi to da uradiš pravu stvar.
Do you really need it? 	Da li ti zaista treba?
he asked.	pitao.
I said no.	Rekao sam ne.
He's not on it.	On nije na tome.
He can do whatever he wants.	Može da radi šta hoće.
She says she knows.	Ona kaže da zna.
You and your code.	Ti i tvoj kod.
Love, love, love.	Voli, voli, voli.
He should have known better.	Trebao je znati bolje.
Yes, maybe that was it.	Da, možda je to bilo to.
There are many more than us.	Postoji mnogo više od nas.
It never was.	To nikad nije bilo.
He asked for a meeting.	Tražio je sastanak.
I don't see why not.	Ne vidim zašto ne.
Maybe they are like me.	Možda su kao ja.
Time.	Vrijeme.
Maybe I won't.	Možda neću.
It took a long, long time.	Trebalo je dugo, dugo.
But you could help me if you could tell me more.	Ali mogli biste mi pomoći ako biste mi mogli reći više.
He didn't mean it.	Nije mislio.
That was never an issue.	To nikada nije bilo pitanje.
I'm sorry it took me so long.	Žao mi je što mi je trebalo toliko vremena.
Like a door.	Kao vrata.
He was exactly what he wanted to be.	Bio je upravo ono što je želio biti.
I've seen it work.	Video sam da radi.
She was at home.	Bila je kod kuće.
So far, so ordinary.	Do sada, tako obično.
As it was, that didn't happen.	Kako je bilo, to se nije dogodilo.
This did not happen.	Ovo se nije dogodilo.
All right.	U redu.
I can't get it.	Ne mogu ga dobiti.
He told me to go home.	Rekao mi je da ide kući.
She can always do them with us.	Ona ih uvijek može raditi kod nas.
Not so much more.	Ne toliko više.
We had it.	Imali smo to.
He doesn't know what he wants to do.	On ne zna šta želi da radi.
Not much further.	Ne mnogo dalje.
She knows why she's there.	Ona zna zašto je tamo.
He did a lot of things to me.	Uradio mi je mnogo stvari.
It was now.	Bilo je sada.
It's just not going to happen.	To se jednostavno neće dogoditi.
That was this week.	To je bilo ove sedmice.
Still too much.	Još uvijek previše.
Or one video.	Ili jedan video.
That will help us.	To će nam pomoći.
I couldn't do without it.	Ne bih mogao bez toga.
He went even further.	Otišao je još dalje.
I want that.	Želim to.
It's easy to tell him.	Lako mu je reći.
I loved her.	Voleo sam je.
Now was not the time.	Sada nije bilo vrijeme.
And you are not.	A ti nisi.
It could, a little.	Moglo bi, malo.
You are not one of us.	Ti nisi jedan od nas.
I should have done more.	Trebao sam učiniti više.
I knew immediately what had happened.	Odmah sam znao šta se dogodilo.
He decided not to do that.	Odlučio je da to ne uradi.
He said no.	Rekao je ne.
That's with a lot of things.	To je sa mnogo stvari.
We are not doing that at the moment.	Trenutno to ne radimo.
That was just a few years ago.	To je bilo prije samo nekoliko godina.
I'm so sorry to do this, but.	Tako mi je žao, da uradim ovo, ali.
But it is, and it works very well.	Ali jeste, i radi veoma dobro.
But you have to help me.	Ali moraš mi pomoći.
Now we know.	Sada znamo.
But it was hard to say.	Ali bilo je teško reći.
Now he can do whatever he wants.	Sada može da radi šta hoće.
We are right.	U pravu smo.
He knew what was coming.	Znao je šta će doći.
He never wondered what it was.	Nikad se nije pitao šta je to.
It's going fast.	Ide brzo.
Just this.	Samo ovo.
He could have been there.	Mogao je biti tamo.
I say yes.	Kažem da jeste.
And I have it now.	I ja ga sada imam.
She told me about you.	Rekla mi je za tebe.
There's always more.	Uvijek ima više.
And it won't be easy.	I neće biti lako.
Everything seems fine to me.	Sve mi se čini u redu.
That's a little.	To je malo.
Everything looks fine.	Sve izgleda u redu.
There are so many of you.	Toliko vas je.
Really, really good.	Zaista, stvarno dobro.
But we need to move on.	Ali treba ići dalje.
He told me not to do anything.	Rekao mi je da ne radim ništa.
I hope it will.	Nadam se da hoće.
There were so few of us.	Bilo nas je tako malo.
I guess you would.	Pretpostavljam da bi.
It could not be done, so simply.	To se nije moglo uraditi, tako jednostavno.
I work here.	Ja radim ovde.
Besides, it should be fine.	Osim toga, trebalo bi da bude u redu.
He wants something that only you can give him.	On želi nešto što mu samo ti možeš dati.
What? 	Šta?
He didn't get a new job.	Nije dobio novi posao.
I hope you will too.	Nadam se da ćeš i ti.
I doubt he would.	Sumnjam da bi.
She didn't know how long.	Nije znala koliko dugo.
We know that.	Znamo to.
Besides, he's not here right now.	Osim toga, on trenutno nije ovdje.
I was there today, everything looks good.	Bio sam tamo danas, sve izgleda dobro.
I don't want to do these things.	Ne želim da radim ove stvari.
He must have heard something.	Mora da je nešto čuo.
I still had time, but probably not much.	Još sam imao vremena, ali vjerovatno ne baš puno.
I don't see it.	Ja to ne vidim.
It still exists.	Još uvijek postoji.
He lost his job.	Izgubio je posao.
I really don't think so.	Zaista mislim da neće.
I didn't see him.	Nisam ga vidio.
I'd like that better.	Voleo bih to bolje.
That should be it.	To bi trebalo biti to.
He won't get any of it.	Neće dobiti ništa od toga.
The truth is the truth.	Istina je istina.
He was here a lot.	Bio je ovde mnogo.
It's a simple question.	To je jednostavno pitanje.
I hope this gets to you in the right way.	Nadam se da će ovo doći do tebe na pravi način.
Life is a job.	Život je posao.
He loves us so much.	On nas toliko voli.
We had a life.	Imali smo život.
She wanted me to tell you.	Htela je da ti kažem.
Maybe he expected too much from himself.	Možda je previše očekivao od sebe.
Except it's real.	Osim što je stvarno.
Who is.	Ko je.
It's out of your way.	Dalje ti je s puta.
We'll talk.	Mi ćemo razgovarati.
You know, when she.	Znaš, kad ona.
I told him to come tomorrow.	Rekao sam mu da dođe sutra.
As we knew he would.	Kao što smo znali da hoće.
People can't help themselves.	Ljudi si ne mogu pomoći.
Nothing here either.	Ni tu ništa.
I am working tomorrow.	Radim sutra.
Why is it.	Zašto je.
Everyone said it was.	Svi su rekli da jeste.
Why don't you do it now.	Zašto to ne uradiš sada.
I just wish there were more of them.	Samo bih volio da ih je više.
Not all of us.	Ne svi mi.
Maybe you're right.	Možda si u pravu.
She wants to know how.	Ona želi znati kako.
And she didn't want to be.	A nije htela da bude.
We can’t give you everything you want.	Ne možemo vam dati sve što želite.
All those people in the house.	Svi ti ljudi u kući.
It's not over yet.	Još nije završio.
Which could be good.	Što bi moglo biti dobro.
No one knows what you want except you.	Niko ne zna šta želiš osim tebe.
What did you do?	Šta si radio?
I knew it was going to be bad.	Znao sam da će biti loše.
We could find a way.	Mogli smo naći način.
That's what he realized.	To je ono što je on shvatio.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
I think he was fine.	Mislim da je bio dobro.
I never came home.	Nikada nisam došao kući.
I didn't tell you before.	Nisam ti rekao ranije.
Only they couldn't see her that way.	Samo što je nisu mogli vidjeti na taj način.
Obviously, it has to be.	Očigledno, mora biti.
That was for you.	To je bilo za tebe.
I have it.	Imam je.
This is often the case.	Često je tako.
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
I probably would.	Verovatno bih.
Let me tell you something.	Da ti kažem nešto.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
And now is the time.	I sada je vrijeme.
But it wasn't him.	Ali to nije bio on.
You wanted nothing to do with him.	Nisi htela da imaš ništa sa njim.
What to do.	Šta da radim.
I almost lost my job.	Skoro sam izgubio posao.
she said.	ona je rekla.
I don't have one.	Ja nemam.
No, no problem.	Ne, nema problema.
Three and a half.	Tri i po.
I know you can do it.	Znam da ti to možeš.
He tried to say something from time to time.	S vremena na vrijeme pokušao je nešto reći.
He says he needs it for work.	Kaže da mu treba za posao.
I wasn't sure what was going to happen.	Nisam bio siguran šta će se dogoditi.
And they were.	I bili su.
It does not exist.	Ne postoji.
It should work now.	Sada bi trebalo da radi.
The question of being today.	Pitanje biti danas.
He didn't see this.	Nije vidio ovo.
Do any of you know.	Da li neko od vas zna.
I need help.	Treba mi pomoć.
It's easy to buy.	Lako ga je kupiti.
I'm doing something wrong.	Uradim nešto loše.
And not a little.	I to ne malo.
All of you.	Svi vi.
I had to know, to see.	Morao sam da znam, da vidim.
You didn't do anything wrong.	Niste uradili ništa loše.
I'm not even that.	Nisam čak ni to.
We can know many things.	Možemo znati mnogo stvari.
In a little while.	Za malo.
It just looks so bad, right now.	Samo izgleda tako loše, trenutno.
I wish I knew why.	Voleo bih da znam zašto.
I won't tell anyone.	Neću nikome reći.
What about you?	Šta je sa tobom?
It doesn't have to be that way.	Ne mora to tako.
They told him this.	Oni su mu ovo rekli.
He looked really bad.	Izgledao je jako loše.
This is new.	Ovo je novi.
He did a good job.	Radio je dobar posao.
I hope he doesn't leave.	Nadam se da neće otići.
She is.	Ona je.
I think it's more.	Mislim da je više.
Don't see it.	Ne vidi to.
You have to come.	Moraš doći.
I made it myself.	Sam sam ga napravio.
You know, like a date.	Znaš, kao sastanak.
He didn't expect that.	Nije to očekivao.
She was.	Bila je.
It wasn't necessary.	Nije trebalo.
Everyone knows that much.	Toliko svi znaju.
And she wanted it.	I htela je to.
They can help.	Oni mogu pomoći.
He will find her.	Naći će je.
I want everything done the right way.	Želim da se sve uradi na pravi način.
It has to be good enough.	Mora biti dovoljno dobro.
This can go either way.	Ovo može ići na bilo koji način.
I didn't see anyone.	Nisam nikoga video.
There is no one way to get there.	Ne postoji jedan put do tamo.
They are not human.	Oni nisu ljudi.
Not very good.	Nije baš dobar.
So we're pretty sure.	Tako da smo prilično sigurni.
I don't know if there is or not.	Ne znam da li ima ili ne.
That doesn't tell us.	To nam ne govori.
This is very, but it is.	Ovo je veoma, ali jeste.
Nobody knows why.	Niko ne zna zašto.
He never loved me.	Nikada me nije volio.
This is really hard for me.	Ovo mi je zaista teško.
He could do something like that.	Moglo bi uraditi tako nešto.
But how? 	Ali kako?
he wondered.	pitao se on.
He was here, she knew now.	On je bio ovdje, sada je znala.
He doesn’t have enough time to do the things he wants.	Nema dovoljno vremena da radi stvari koje želi.
We have to see.	Moramo vidjeti.
And I told him that.	I to sam mu rekao.
They all were.	Svi su bili.
That's what it was supposed to be.	To je ono što je trebalo biti.
And they know for themselves.	I znaju za sebe.
But there is.	Ali ima.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
He really didn't know.	On zaista nije znao.
And that is what it is about.	I to je ono o čemu se radi.
I just got one.	Upravo sam dobio jedan.
Together they could do all of that.	Zajedno bi mogli učiniti sve od toga.
Not much, really.	Ne puno, zaista.
It was almost one in the afternoon.	Bilo je skoro jedan popodne.
I'm afraid that's all we have.	Bojim se da je to sve što imamo.
He goes to the door.	Ide do vrata.
But it won't.	Ali neće.
But even that was not enough.	Ali ni to nije bilo dovoljno.
I won't get it.	Neću ga dobiti.
But he must be alone.	Ali mora da je sam.
She said.	Ona je rekla.
Yes, there are.	Da, ima ih.
I'm as happy as I often am.	Sretan sam koliko i često.
I don't know how bad.	Ne znam koliko loše.
He said he just wanted to talk.	Rekao je da samo želi razgovarati.
But for myself.	Ali za sebe.
It can't be.	Ne može biti.
He came right away.	Odmah je došao.
But I'm not sure.	Ali nisam siguran.
I know how this is.	Znam kako je ovo.
Actually, it's not.	Zapravo, nije.
But not much.	Ali ne mnogo.
He is currently there.	On je trenutno tamo.
He hasn't done anything yet.	Još nije uradio ništa.
I saw that one.	Video sam taj.
Maybe it still works.	Možda i dalje radi.
Isn't that really something.	Nije li to stvarno nešto.
What he did.	Šta je radio.
You're going home soon.	Uskoro ćeš ići kući.
Or probably he couldn't.	Ili vjerovatno nije mogao.
I came back to tell you that.	Vratio sam se da ti to kažem.
I'm sorry, but it can't be helped.	Žao mi je, ali ne može se pomoći.
You could have told him yesterday or this morning.	Mogao si mu reći juče ili jutros.
I like the idea !.	Sviđa mi se ideja!.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
I want them to know that.	Želim da to znaju.
What is ever seen is never seen.	Ono što se ikada vidi nikad se ne vidi.
It's hard for everyone to be everything.	Teško je svima biti sve.
You do what you can.	Radiš šta možeš.
It was my turn.	Bio sam na redu.
Now none of that will happen.	Sada se ništa od toga neće dogoditi.
He saw it too.	I on je to video.
We had so little time together.	Imali smo tako malo vremena zajedno.
Really good.	Stvarno dobro.
It's worn, but not bad.	Nosi se, ali nije loše.
It was even better.	Bilo je čak i bolje.
I want to help, he said.	Želim pomoći, rekao je.
I don't know who they were.	Ne znam ko su oni bili.
And now, he loves it.	I sada, on to voli.
This is better.	Ovo je bolje.
There is only one.	Postoji samo jedan.
Nobody knows what will happen to him.	Niko ne zna šta će biti s njim.
Work better.	Radite bolje.
People will move on.	Ljudi će ići dalje.
Maybe there's something there.	Možda ima nešto tamo.
It must be you.	Mora da si ti.
And nothing more.	I ništa više.
He was sure that no one thought so.	Bio je siguran da niko tako ne misli.
She is not at home.	Ona nije kod kuće.
It looks and feels so good.	Izgleda i izgleda tako dobro.
He did it.	Uradio to.
He expected her to be at the party.	Očekivao je da će ona biti na zabavi.
But let me tell you something.	Ali da ti kažem nešto.
It might even help.	Možda čak i pomogne.
He was the only one.	On je bio jedini.
I don't know how it happened.	Ne znam kako se to dogodilo.
So we don't do that.	Tako da mi to ne radimo.
It would be at that time.	U to vrijeme bi bilo.
I didn't lose on that.	Nisam izgubio na tome.
Apparently something bad happened.	Očigledno se nešto loše dogodilo.
I have to be there.	Moram biti tamo.
But how to do it?	Ali kako to učiniti?
I'll come back tomorrow.	Doći ću sutra.
There is one.	Postoji jedan.
He never was.	Nikad nije bio.
I just left home.	Upravo sam otišao od kuće.
And that's good, actually.	I to je dobro, zapravo.
Just like you could.	Baš kao što biste i sami mogli.
Maybe I could help.	Možda bih mogao pomoći.
You can trust him.	Možeš mu vjerovati.
I can't find my way.	Ne mogu naći svoj put.
Just for now.	Samo za sada.
He can't go on.	Ne može dalje.
I came to the party.	Došao sam na zabavu.
Or even dinner.	Ili čak i večeru.
I can tell you what to do with it.	Mogu ti reći šta da radiš s tim.
It wouldn't be right.	Ne bi bilo u redu.
I need more.	Treba mi više.
That will not happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
I wasn't even human anymore.	Nisam više čak ni bio čovjek.
And it wasn't the only time that happened.	I to nije bio jedini put da se to dogodilo.
I can't love anymore.	Ne mogu više da volim.
They can do it.	Oni to mogu.
This has.	Ovo ima .
I would love to stay here again.	Volio bih ostati ovdje ponovo.
Until that happened.	Sve dok se to nije dogodilo.
Time was, and time was not.	Vrijeme je bilo, a vrijeme nije.
I don't know anything about that.	Ne znam ništa o tome.
He was a really good man.	On je zaista bio dobar čovjek.
I'm absolutely sure of that.	Potpuno sam siguran u to.
And they didn’t have much.	I nisu imali puno toga.
If you've been here, you know.	Ako ste bili ovde, znate.
I haven't heard of you yet.	Još uvek nisam čuo za tebe.
Now this is a problem.	Sada je ovo problem.
I'm not ready for this.	Nisam spreman za ovo.
Tell yourself that now.	Reci to sebi sada.
Do the job.	Uradite posao.
Okay, that's it.	U redu, to je to.
Or maybe because of that.	Ili možda zbog toga.
Still pretty easy.	Još uvijek prilično lako.
That's right.	Tačno.
Maybe he'll come.	Možda će doći.
I don't think this is true.	Mislim da ovo nije istina.
Fast and much.	Brzo i mnogo.
He had few friends.	Imao je malo prijatelja.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
We have to go to work tomorrow.	Moramo sutra na posao.
We should all be better.	Svi bismo trebali bolje.
Why is it so hard.	Zašto je to tako teško.
No, not there.	Ne, ne tamo.
I did not know what to say.	Nisam znao šta da kažem.
I'm sorry I had to ask.	Žao mi je što sam morao da pitam.
I think it's him.	Mislim da je to on.
That would be too much.	To bi bilo previše.
A lot of things happened today.	Mnogo stvari se danas dogodilo.
They were a team.	Bili su tim.
He knew it was going to happen.	Znao je da će se to dogoditi.
But they did nothing.	Ali oni ništa nisu uradili.
I see a problem.	Vidim problem.
He just wouldn't.	On jednostavno ne bi.
Not good, maybe.	Nije dobro, možda.
I know you're probably right.	Znam da si vjerovatno u pravu.
But they are not for me.	Ali nisu za mene.
There is still time to do something.	Još ima vremena da se nešto uradi.
I haven't seen anything like that in many, many years.	Tako nešto nisam vidio mnogo, mnogo godina.
Let me ask now.	Da pitam sada.
But he was so tired.	Ali bio je tako umoran.
I really need to see.	Zaista moram da vidim.
I'm not sure what can be done.	Nisam siguran šta se može učiniti.
I mean, maybe he will.	Mislim, možda hoće.
Nothing will happen to me.	Ništa mi se neće dogoditi.
That probably always happens.	To se vjerovatno uvijek dešava.
That would not happen today.	To se danas ne bi dogodilo.
But we can say more.	Ali možemo reći više.
You won't believe this.	Nećeš vjerovati u ovo.
And he could.	I mogao je.
He won't talk to me anymore.	Neće više razgovarati sa mnom.
That's why he's here.	Za to je tu.
Except he was still here.	Osim što je još uvijek bio ovdje.
It was so obvious.	Bilo je tako očigledno.
This is too much for me.	Ovo je previše za mene.
You know what little you can see.	Znaš ono malo što možeš vidjeti.
I'm happy now.	Sada sam sretan.
For myself, for my team.	Za sebe, za svoj tim.
I’ve never seen anything do what it does.	Nikada nisam vidio da nešto radi ono što radi.
There was something there.	Nešto je bilo tamo.
He knew what he wanted.	Znao je šta želi.
That could be true.	To bi moglo biti tačno.
It is very difficult.	Veoma je teško.
But they know it.	Ali oni to znaju.
There are a lot of people there.	Ima puno ljudi tamo.
They can't see it.	Oni to ne mogu vidjeti.
It can be so hard.	Može biti tako teško.
It was difficult at the time.	Bilo je teško u to vrijeme.
So it can be done.	Tako da se to može uraditi.
He couldn't know.	Nije mogao znati.
I certainly have them.	Ja ih sigurno imam.
This is easy.	Ovo je lako.
I couldn't do it alone.	Ne bih mogao sam.
I'm sure you'll find it at home.	Siguran sam da ćeš ga naći kod kuće.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Rekao je da ne zna ništa o tome.
Can anyone tell me how to do it.	Može li mi neko reći kako da to uradim.
It works well.	Radi dobro.
Few years ago.	Prije nekoliko godina.
Love, love, love her.	Voli, voli, voli je.
I like the way it looks.	Sviđa mi se kako izgleda.
Does anyone know for sure.	Da li neko zna sigurno.
They’re not just there for looks.	Oni nisu tu samo zbog izgleda.
The more you can do, the better.	Što više možete učiniti, to bolje.
I don't mean me.	Ne mislim na mene.
I could talk to anyone.	Mogao bih razgovarati sa bilo kim.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
I can't bring them back.	Ne mogu ih vratiti.
Maybe there is nothing more than that.	Možda nema ništa više od toga.
But it's not a job.	Ali to nije posao.
I'm glad about that too.	Drago mi je i zbog toga.
Do this, don't do that.	Uradi ovo, nemoj ono.
He should be home.	Trebao bi biti kod kuće.
That's really not much.	To zaista nije mnogo.
That's enough for me.	To mi je dovoljno.
It was bad for the team and bad for me.	Bilo je loše za tim i loše za mene.
And it's simple.	I to je jednostavno.
Something was wrong here.	Nešto ovdje nije bilo u redu.
I think we have a problem.	Čini mi se da imamo problem.
Not just you and me.	Ne samo ti i ja.
It was my turn.	Bio sam na redu.
She will get to it.	Ona će doći do toga.
You know better than that.	Ti znaš bolje od toga.
I had money.	Imao sam novac.
It was not a question, so to speak.	To nije bilo pitanje, da tako kažem.
I didn't ask him why.	Nisam ga pitao zašto.
Don't say that.	Ne govori to.
I don't have to go any further.	Ne moram dalje.
Are you with us?	Jesi li sa nama?
We like it here, and it shows.	Sviđa nam se ovdje, i to se vidi.
I often do that.	Ja to često radim.
It would, for sure.	Bi, sigurno.
The first was just something to do.	Prvi je bio samo nešto za raditi.
But it was difficult.	Ali bilo je teško.
He shouldn't see us here.	Ne bi trebalo da vidi da smo ovde.
That's all, and that's all.	Sve je to, i to je sve.
This would never happen.	Ovo se nikada ne bi dogodilo.
And so he had.	I tako je i imao.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda i nije.
You did it.	To si uradio.
He told you that and that’s what he does.	On vam je to rekao i to je ono što radi.
I think you are too.	Mislim da si i ti.
I was glad to have him.	Bilo mi je drago što ga imam.
He knows there aren't that many.	Zna da ih nema toliko.
He, the team.	On, tim.
She just knows.	Ona jednostavno zna.
Lot more.	Puno više.
I am that.	Ja sam to.
I knew he meant it.	Znao sam da je to mislio.
You don't have to tell me.	Ne moraš mi reći.
That's very good for me.	To je jako dobro za mene.
He couldn't see them.	Nije ih mogao vidjeti.
He couldn't see.	Nije mogao da vidi.
I love you so much.	Volim te puno.
Or he will return.	Ili će se vratiti.
None of that exists.	Ništa od toga ne postoji.
I didn't say anything to anyone.	Nikome nisam ništa rekao.
I like.	sviđa mi se.
He knew now.	Sada je znao.
Nothing but friends.	Ništa osim prijatelja.
That was a long time ago.	To je bilo prije dosta vremena.
Now he got even more.	Sada je dobio još više.
As he had done several times before.	Kao što je to učinio nekoliko puta ranije.
Alone.	Sama.
Besides, he couldn't find much to say about himself.	Osim toga, nije mogao naći mnogo toga da kaže za sebe.
She said she wanted to see him again and again and again.	Rekla je da želi da ga vidi ponovo i ponovo i ponovo.
she will say.	ona će reći.
There is nothing we can do.	Ne možemo ništa da uradimo.
You never knew.	Nikad nisi znao.
Someone you can talk to very easily.	Neko s kim možete vrlo lako razgovarati.
I know it’s not going to happen now, but the thoughts are there.	Znam da se to sada neće dogoditi, ali misli su tu.
You can't be here without it.	Ne možete biti ovdje bez toga.
No one saw her.	Niko je nije video.
Never again.	Nikad više.
We could have done much better.	Mogli smo mnogo bolje.
I see it today.	Vidim to danas.
He could talk to anyone.	Mogao je razgovarati sa bilo kim.
Not because of me.	Ne zbog mene.
I can talk to him well now.	Sada mogu dobro razgovarati s njim.
He was the one who left.	On je bio taj koji je otišao.
Unless someone told him.	Osim ako mu neko nije rekao.
He's doing it now.	On to sada radi.
What is me.	Šta je ja.
I was fine with that.	Bio sam u redu sa tim.
It was fine.	Bilo je u redu.
This time there are more of them.	Ovaj put ih je više.
The more of us, the better.	Više nas, to bolje.
I just told myself that.	Samo sam to sebi rekao.
He was alone, they said.	Bio je sam, rekli su.
I have done that.	Uradio sam to.
That was all it took.	To je bilo sve što je trebalo.
I'm fine and I've been for a long time.	Ja sam u redu i već dugo sam.
They would be fine on their own.	Sami bi bili u redu.
Something like a game.	Nešto kao igra.
I don't know why it isn't, but it's not.	Ne znam zašto nije, ali nije.
Or that it doesn't exist.	Ili da ne postoji.
That's probably fine for now.	To je vjerovatno u redu za sada.
It doesn't work that way.	Ne ide to tako.
I didn't tell anyone.	Nisam nikome rekao.
I was the first here!	Ja sam prvi bio ovdje!
I didn't do anything!	Nisam ništa uradio!
She didn't want to see it.	Nije htela da to vidi.
He could have been there for a while.	Mogao je biti tamo neko vrijeme.
It was just.	Bila samo.
Something they would never do.	Nešto što nikada ne bi uradili.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ali ništa nije mogao.
we can't go.	ne možemo ići.
I know how it is.	Znam kako je.
Yes, even mine.	Da, čak i moj.
You should.	Trebalo bi ti.
More on that here.	Više o tome ovdje.
What works for you, works for you.	Ono što radi za vas, radi za vas.
No problem.	Nije problem.
But that hasn't happened yet.	Ali, to se još nije dogodilo.
It seems very unlikely that will happen now.	Čini se da će se to sada dogoditi vrlo malo.
There was so much to see!	Bilo je toliko toga za vidjeti!
I do not want.	Ne želim.
But really, it's hardly a job.	Ali zaista, teško da je to posao.
That's him.	To je on.
My father couldn't believe it.	Moj otac nije mogao vjerovati.
It seemed so.	Činilo se kao da je tako.
I thought he was back.	Mislio sam da se vratio.
He says he's happy.	Kaže da je sretan.
He couldn't even talk.	Nije mogao ni da priča.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
He didn't say much.	Nije puno rekao.
I thought it was.	Mislio sam da jeste.
I need help.	Treba mi pomoć.
Never heard of it, never seen it.	Nikad čuo za to, nikad ga vidio.
But they told us enough.	Ali rekli su nam dovoljno.
Or even if he had it.	Ili čak i da ga je imao.
He certainly goes for all or nothing.	On sigurno ide na sve ili ništa.
No one can tell me what's wrong with me.	Niko mi ne može reći šta nije u redu sa mnom.
That's not it.	To nije to.
We don't know for sure.	Ne znamo sigurno.
He has many friends.	Ima mnogo prijatelja.
He has no friends for me.	Za mene nema prijatelja.
Not a little if.	Nije malo ako.
I thought it was pretty good.	Mislio sam da je prilično dobro.
She never told me who.	Nikad mi nije rekla ko.
And we don't know what to do with it.	I ne znamo šta da radimo s tim.
This video has it all.	Ovaj video ima sve.
But she didn't want to.	Ali nije htela.
He had to see the truth.	Morao je da vidi istinu.
A little bit tired.	Malo umoran.
This is not just an idea, this is real.	Ovo nije samo ideja, ovo je stvarno.
That's what she said.	To je ona rekla.
And he knew he would.	I znao je da hoće.
He's doing so well.	Tako mu dobro ide.
But that's my truth, right.	Ali to je moja istina, tačno.
I've never been, not really.	Nikad nisam bio, ne baš.
I guess that's a good thing.	Pretpostavljam da je to dobra stvar.
I doubt it.	Sumnjam u to.
I probably still do.	Vjerovatno i dalje radim.
It took a long time.	Dugo je trebalo.
And that's not bad.	I to nije loše.
He's a really good man.	On je stvarno dobar čovjek.
But it will happen.	Ali to će se dogoditi.
And it's good.	I dobro je.
She doesn't love me anymore.	Ona me više ne voli.
Maybe that will be enough.	Možda će to biti dovoljno.
I didn't mean to do that.	Nisam mislio to da uradim.
He didn't want to see anyone.	Nije želio nikoga vidjeti.
She is the only one who is not.	Ona je jedina koja nije.
It should have been a little.	Trebalo je biti malo.
They are not.	Oni nisu.
I'm the new guy.	Ja sam novi momak.
And he is him.	I on je on.
That's how the story goes.	Tako priča ide.
He would never return.	Nikad se ne bi vratio.
I did what he said.	Uradio sam šta je rekao.
It doesn't have to be.	Ne mora ih biti.
I'd like to know what it is.	Voleo bih da znam šta je to.
And he is here with us.	I on je ovdje sa nama.
It seemed to work well.	Činilo se da dobro radi.
But it's not likely.	Ali nije vjerovatno.
It's just something that happened.	To je samo nešto što se dogodilo.
I won't even talk to you tomorrow.	Neću ni razgovarati s tobom sutra.
On this way.	Na ovaj način.
It usually happens when we don't know about it.	Obično se to dešava kada ne znamo za to.
I've never been there before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio tamo.
But we have to.	Ali moramo.
We are not what we used to be.	Mi nismo ono što smo bili.
That's not real life.	To nije pravi život.
So you really didn't know where you were going to be safe.	Tako da zaista nisi znao gdje ćeš biti siguran.
Not now, never, she said.	Ne sada, nikad, rekla je.
He promised he would.	Obećao je da hoće.
That can't happen.	To se ne može dogoditi.
But it never is.	Ali nikad nije.
In fact, it can be quite easy.	U stvari, to može biti prilično lako.
I love us together.	Volim nas zajedno.
Everyone.	Svi.
He can't do anything wrong.	Ne može ništa loše da uradi.
I thought quickly.	brzo sam mislio.
Now with that.	Sada s tim.
And he will leave.	I on će otići.
But if it is.	Ali ako jeste.
He'll be back soon.	Uskoro će se vratiti.
He asked me.	Pitao me je.
I think of you too.	I ja mislim na tebe.
For what, he wasn't sure.	Za šta, nije bio siguran.
Or they should.	Ili bi trebali.
But she would.	Ali bi ona.
Here I guess it would.	Ovdje pretpostavljam da bi.
It works much, much better.	To radi mnogo, mnogo bolje.
You just don't know.	Ti jednostavno ne znaš.
I'm not afraid of him.	Ne bojim ga se.
That's how he got the money.	Tako je dobio novac.
I'm really good.	Zaista sam dobro.
Even if my father had his own way, he still wouldn't.	I da je moj otac imao svoj način, i dalje ne bi.
He doesn't like it.	On ne voli.
It still looks good.	I dalje izgleda dobro.
He has to stay.	Mora ostati.
You told me.	Rekao si mi.
I don't know what can happen.	Ne znam šta se može dogoditi.
If you think .	Ako mislite .
This was a job.	Ovo je bio posao.
More than likely, it wouldn’t.	Više nego vjerovatno, ne bi.
I have so much.	Imam toliko toga.
But now was not the time.	Ali sada nije bilo vrijeme.
I have no idea what's wrong with that.	Nemam pojma šta nije u redu s tim.
That's for sure.	To je sigurno.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
He can't do it fast enough.	Ne može to učiniti dovoljno brzo.
They may know even more than we do.	Oni možda znaju čak i više od nas.
They will find you.	Naći će te.
What it is and what it does.	Šta je i šta radi.
One of us will.	Jedan od nas hoće.
Or I can.	Ili mogu.
She knows what happened to me.	Ona zna šta mi se dogodilo.
That is still pending.	Na to se još čeka.
He would understand this.	On bi ovo shvatio.
He is happy to have something to do.	Sretan je što ima nešto da radi.
Maybe it was.	Možda je i bilo.
Or her?	Ili ona?
That's right.	Tako je.
You said you didn't want that for yourself.	Rekli ste da to ne želite za sebe.
Works.	Radi.
We can help !.	Možemo pomoći!.
You never know who will do what.	Nikad se ne zna ko će šta uraditi.
You can't do both.	Ne možete oboje.
But she knows who did it.	Ali ona zna ko je to uradio.
They are not there.	Oni nisu tamo.
Nobody does that.	Niko to ne radi.
But it wouldn't.	Ali ne bi.
It was there.	Tamo je bilo.
I'm not sure why that is.	Nisam siguran zašto je to tako.
But we can't either.	Ali ne možemo i.
Maybe just a few.	Možda samo nekoliko.
That's really not a problem.	To zaista nije problem.
But that's bad.	Ali, to je loše.
But we know each other.	Ali znamo se.
It just was.	Jednostavno je bilo.
But he wouldn't tell anyone.	Ali on to nikome ne bi rekao.
You don't even know who.	Čak ni za ti znaš koga.
Live for today.	Živi za danas.
I'm pretty good.	Ja sam prilično dobro.
I thought it was.	Mislio sam da jeste.
Who knows.	Ko zna.
He wants to move on.	On želi da ide dalje.
But they were there.	Ali oni su bili tamo.
I had to move on.	Morao sam da idem dalje.
Like we weren't even there.	Kao da nismo ni bili tamo.
Everyone knows this will never happen.	Svi znaju da se to nikada neće dogoditi.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
That's much better.	To je mnogo bolje.
Even for work.	Čak i za posao.
The car leaves.	Ode auto.
And this is not a good thing.	A ovo nije dobra stvar.
It was simple.	Jednostavno je bilo.
I don't even want to.	Čak ni ne želim.
Not really.	U stvari ne.
I won't believe it.	Neću vjerovati.
It's neither good nor bad.	Nije ni dobro ni loše.
I know it's for me.	Znam da je za mene.
That cannot be said here.	To se ovdje ne može reći.
he will say.	reći će on.
It will certainly be so.	Sigurno će biti tako.
Say what you need.	Reci šta treba.
I understood why.	Shvatio sam zašto.
Except me.	Osim mene.
You still say no.	Još uvijek kažeš ne.
I'm fine.	Imam dobro.
Nobody works.	Niko ne radi.
It wasn't hard to do.	To nije bilo teško uraditi.
That is what is being done.	To je ono što se radi.
Not that he was looking for him.	Nije da ga je tražio.
They were almost there.	Skoro su bili tamo.
And one last year.	I jedan prošle godine.
Apparently you had no idea what he was doing there.	Očigledno niste imali pojma šta on tamo radi.
I've seen so much.	Toliko sam toga vidio.
He didn't mean it.	Nije mislio na to.
Not from anyone.	Ne od bilo koga.
I no longer know if that is true or not.	Više ne znam da li je to istina ili ne.
I'm very good at it.	Vrlo sam dobar u tome.
Together we will go on and on.	Zajedno ćemo ići dalje i dalje.
It should be here.	Trebalo bi biti ovdje.
We just don't work.	Mi jednostavno ne radimo.
I saw us.	Video sam nas.
He didn't know what to do to help.	Nije znao šta da učini da pomogne.
But better not.	Ali bolje da nije.
We won't talk about it.	Nećemo o tome.
I know those things.	Znam te stvari.
I love how hard it is.	Volim koliko je teško.
But she was just a job.	Ali ona je bila samo posao.
But they weren't there.	Ali oni nisu bili tamo.
Maybe we should.	Možda bi trebali.
Or he just finished.	Ili je upravo završio.
He just knew he didn't want to be alone.	Znao je samo da ne želi da bude sam.
She didn't know what she was doing.	Nije znala šta radi.
I thought we could do both.	Mislio sam da možemo oboje.
He said he would come to help me.	Rekao je da će doći da mi pomogne.
You don't want the truth.	Ne želite istinu.
I wondered if you knew the way.	Pitao sam se da li znaš način.
So it was with me.	Tako je bilo i sa mnom.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
He doesn't see it.	On to ne vidi.
I should be the one.	Ja bih trebao biti taj.
It was very difficult.	Bilo je veoma teško.
I should do that too.	I ja bih to trebao uraditi.
I just didn't.	Jednostavno nisam.
It's about what we do here.	Radi se o tome šta radimo ovdje.
Something more here.	Nešto više ovdje.
They certainly can.	Oni sigurno mogu.
But he didn't do it.	Ali on to nije uradio.
Maybe he can.	Možda može.
Not much, it seemed.	Ne mnogo, činilo se.
I don't mean well.	Ne mislim dobro.
It probably wasn't here.	Nije vjerovatno bilo ovdje.
We like it here.	Sviđa nam se ovdje.
They are right.	Oni su u pravu.
Not now.	Sada nije.
Little by little.	Malo pomalo.
This is not so.	Ovo nije tako.
You don't need it.	Ne treba ti.
He'll be right back.	Odmah će se vratiti.
And no money.	I bez novca.
It still is.	I dalje je.
I knew exactly what was going to happen.	Tačno sam znao šta će se dogoditi.
If she was right, he couldn't stay here.	Ako je bila u pravu, on ne bi mogao ostati ovdje.
I think he's here.	Mislim da je ovde.
This was it.	Ovo je bilo.
It was on time.	Bilo je na vrijeme.
Everyone should know that by now.	Svi bi to do sada trebali znati.
I thought.	Mislio sam.
I was more than a little surprised.	Bio sam više nego malo iznenađen.
If everything was fine.	Ako je sve bilo u redu.
I had a meeting.	Imao sam sastanak.
He said he had a good reason for it.	Rekao je da ima dobar razlog za to.
She didn't know which one and she didn't know why.	Nije znala koji i nije znala zašto.
He did it himself.	Uradio je to sam.
Do you think you will come again next year?	Mislite li da ćete doći ponovo sljedeće godine?
I expected that.	Očekivao sam to.
I want it for myself.	Želim to za sebe.
He should know better.	Trebalo bi da zna bolje.
I never knew who it was.	Nikad nisam znao ko je to.
Maybe I know something that might help you.	Možda znam nešto što bi ti moglo pomoći.
He was pretty good at it.	Bio je prilično dobar u tome.
This is bad.	Ovo je loše.
This is very easy to do.	Ovo je vrlo lako uraditi.
Maybe I was there with him.	Možda sam bio tamo s njim.
Nobody knows how to do it.	Niko ne zna kako to da uradi.
They know what we're up to.	Oni znaju na čemu smo.
No, it's not a problem.	Ne, nije problem.
I have a new job.	Imam novi posao.
We couldn't do that.	Mi to nismo mogli.
Good and good.	Dobro i dobro.
It was actually pretty simple.	Zapravo je bilo prilično jednostavno.
I never thought you could do it.	Nikad nisam mislio da ti to možeš.
You need to know this.	Morate znati ovo.
Life for life.	Život za život.
I really want to talk to you.	Zaista želim razgovarati s tobom.
What he looks like.	Kako on izgleda.
He could work with that.	Mogao je raditi s tim.
I don't want you here.	Ne želim te ovdje.
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
Good, he said.	Dobro, rekao je.
It was just him.	Bio je samo on.
You can never tell what will happen.	Nikad ne možeš reći šta će se dogoditi.
But it was.	Ali bilo je.
We don't know that.	Mi to ne znamo.
I always am.	Ja sam uvek.
But no one really knows.	Ali niko zaista ne zna.
I'm there now.	Sada sam tamo.
But three times.	Ali tri puta.
It's really bad now.	Sada je stvarno loše.
And you left.	I otišao si.
That will tell you.	To će ti reći.
I can't find him either.	Ni ja ga ne mogu naći.
And that is life.	A to je i život.
And he knows everything.	I on zna sve.
But that was all.	Ali to je bilo samo to.
I was looking for you.	Tražio sam te.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
You could have given him time.	Mogao si mu dati vremena.
And he returned quickly.	I brzo se vratio.
I knew it was only a matter of time.	Znao sam da je samo pitanje vremena.
He did not return.	Nije se vratio.
He'll be right there.	Doći će odmah.
Is it true or not.	Je li istina ili nije.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žao.
That day may come.	Taj dan može doći.
I need to know.	Moram da znam.
It's not for us.	Nije za nas.
He didn't think it would be a problem.	Nije mislio da će to biti problem.
He didn't know if he could trust me.	Nije znao može li mi vjerovati.
Just like you think it is.	Baš kao što mislite da jeste.
No one was ever sure.	Niko nikada nije bio siguran.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
It doesn't have to be hard.	Ne mora biti teško.
He'll know soon enough.	Uskoro će znati.
I'm working with you.	Radim sa tobom.
Do we ever do that.	Da li to ikada uradimo.
And there were a lot of people there.	I tamo je bilo dosta ljudi.
Or maybe with.	Ili možda sa.
You have it in you.	Imaš to u sebi.
She doesn't think so.	Ona ne misli tako.
You think if anyone knows, it must be him.	Misliš da ako neko zna, to mora da je on.
I think that's it.	Mislim da je to to.
Where is that? 	Gdje je to?
You are not right.	Nisi u pravu.
Looks like it is.	Izgleda da jeste.
It could have been anyone.	Mogao je biti bilo ko.
It's been a long time.	To je dugo vremena.
They couldn't stay here long.	Nisu mogli dugo ostati ovdje.
That would be better.	To bi bilo bolje.
Together we can do it!.	Zajedno možemo to!.
I'm ready to go now.	Spreman sam da idem sada.
Never, never, never.	Nikad, nikad, nikad.
I hope you stay there.	Nadam se da ćeš ostati tu.
I hope that's true.	Nadam se da je to istina.
But apparently he was.	Ali očigledno je bio.
She doesn't know who she is.	Ona ne zna ko je ona.
It's not life either.	Nije ni život.
And not just her.	I ne samo ona.
I won't stay long.	Neću dugo ostati.
She knew it and she knew he knew it.	Ona je to znala i znala je da je on to znao.
I'll stay here.	Ja ću ostati ovdje.
Like us.	Kao i mi.
I love you so much.	Volim te puno.
In fact, they are not.	U stvari, nisu.
I'm just happy to be here.	Samo sam sretan što sam ovdje.
that was the question.	to je bilo pitanje.
This measures quite accurately.	Ovo se prilično tačno meri.
I was with him.	Bio sam s njim.
I was so busy.	Bio sam tako zauzet.
And if something can happen, that's fine.	I ako se nešto može dogoditi, to je u redu.
That's a problem, but a good one.	To je problem, ali dobar.
In fact, she was.	U stvari, bila je.
He came yesterday	Došao je juče
Now more and more.	Sada sve više i više.
As if it's not that hard.	Kao da nije tako teško.
Obviously there is a lot to do here.	Očigledno je da ovdje ima puno toga za raditi.
That's just the truth.	To je samo istina.
Maybe I'll do some of that.	Možda ću uraditi nešto od toga.
I don't know how to do it, can you help.	Ne znam kako da to uradim, možeš li pomoći.
If you said yes, it wouldn't be right.	Da ste rekli da, ne bi bilo u redu.
And that was good.	I to je bilo dobro.
Or tried to be.	Ili pokušao biti.
That's right now.	Tako je sada.
We could talk about it.	Mogli bismo razgovarati o tome.
You're doing pretty well.	Prilično ti dobro ide.
He hadn't even seen him before.	Nije ga ni vidio ranije.
She really didn't want to go there.	Ona zaista nije htela da ide tamo.
He got lost in it.	Izgubio se u tome.
I didn't know what to tell him.	Nisam znala šta da mu kažem.
I love being here.	Volim biti ovdje.
But you don’t have to be.	Ali ne morate biti.
I told him to come.	Rekao sam mu da dođe.
And she knew it.	I ona je to znala.
That will never happen.	To se nikada neće dogoditi.
It was that day.	Bio je taj dan.
I would say this.	Ja bih ovo rekao.
Even we don't know for sure.	Čak ni mi ne znamo sigurno.
Don't tell anyone.	Nemoj nikome reći.
Can you come now?	Možeš li doći odmah?
No, really.	Nisam, zaista.
He left.	On je otišao.
We know that too.	To znamo i mi.
It would be helpful.	Bilo bi od pomoći.
He was safe now.	Sada je bio siguran.
What is it?	Šta je to?
yes.	da.
She can't come back now.	Ona se sada ne može vratiti.
It would be good.	Bilo bi dobro.
You know, just the way you like it.	Znaš, baš kako ti se sviđa.
Nothing really.	Ništa u stvari.
But today we will do just that.	Ali danas ćemo učiniti upravo to.
Everyone knows him.	Svi ga znaju.
I don't need this.	Ne treba mi ovo.
Actually a few times.	Zapravo nekoliko puta.
I can tell you so much now.	Toliko vam sada mogu reći.
He's there.	On je tamo.
Or it should.	Ili bi tako trebalo.
which.	koji.
So much.	Toliko toga.
We know so much for sure.	Toliko znamo sigurno.
But not anymore.	Ali više nije.
But that is true.	Ali to je tačno.
I’m good at so few things, and bad at so many.	Dobar sam u tako malo stvari, a loš u toliko.
I hope you know that.	Nadam se da to znaš.
She never will.	Ona nikad neće.
If so, that's a good idea.	Ako jeste, to je dobra ideja.
I don't know why, but it is.	Ne znam zašto, ali jeste.
That he is not there.	Da ga nema.
I asked many, many times.	Pitao sam mnogo, mnogo puta.
I don't see anything wrong.	Ne vidim ništa loše.
If only we could get them.	Kad bismo ih mogli dobiti.
There are three of them.	Ima ih tri.
He should have worked harder.	Trebao je više raditi.
It is never easy.	Nikada nije lako.
The problem is you don't know.	Problem je u tome što ne znaš.
I can't even be a friend.	Ne mogu ni biti prijatelj.
That wasn't good enough.	To nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
So, yeah, that was fine.	Tako da, da, to je bilo u redu.
That's not much.	To nije mnogo.
It's just good.	Samo je dobro.
This is not a good job.	Ovo nije dobar posao.
Except for myself.	Osim sebe.
You want something from me.	Želiš nešto od mene.
But she didn't want to go.	Ali ona nije htela da ide.
I had to find a new job.	Morao sam naći novi posao.
We were not the only ones.	Nismo bili jedini.
I really know.	Zaista znam.
I couldn't see.	Nisam mogao vidjeti.
And he was more than right.	I bio je više nego u pravu.
I'm so happy.	Tako sam sretan.
He said he would see what he could find.	Rekao je da će vidjeti šta može naći.
But it is difficult, very difficult.	Ali teško je, veoma teško.
I'm not sure if it works.	Nisam siguran da li radi.
That was correct.	To je bilo tačno.
He knew where this man lived.	Znao je gdje ovaj čovjek živi.
He would do anything.	On bi sve uradio.
What took you so long?	Šta ti je toliko dugo trebalo?
It's really something.	To je stvarno nešto.
It's true.	To je tačno.
Maybe he'll tell you.	Možda ti kaže.
Who's new.	Ko je novi.
We can't stay here.	Ne možemo ostati ovdje.
Or there could be none.	Ili ih nije moglo biti.
He had to be.	Morao je biti.
I worked fast.	Radio sam brzo.
The more you work, the more money.	Što više radite, više novca.
You have to go.	Moraš otići.
I didn't see you there.	Nisam te vidio tamo.
And a friend to everyone.	I prijatelj svima.
No, it can't be.	Ne, ne može biti.
I could have found it many years ago.	Mogao sam ga naći prije mnogo godina.
You can help too.	I ti možeš pomoći.
We are still here.	I dalje smo tu.
I think that's enough.	Mislim da je to dovoljno.
I don't see that happening yet.	Ne vidim da se to još dogodilo.
It will happen quickly.	To će se dogoditi brzo.
We have so much time.	Imamo toliko vremena.
They didn't know until today.	Ni do danas nisu znali.
I thought you could be better than that.	Mislio sam da znaš biti bolji od toga.
That could happen, he realized.	To bi se moglo dogoditi, shvatio je.
I am going home.	Idem kući.
This is your job.	Ovo je tvoj posao.
We can do this together.	Možemo ovo zajedno.
This, not so much.	Ovo, ne toliko.
Yes, it doesn't happen.	Da, ne dešava se.
Or he had something.	Ili je nešto imao.
Let me see you.	Da te vidim.
she said.	ona je rekla.
And now, gone.	A sada, otišao.
I would too.	I ja bih bio.
No, that's something.	Ne, to je nešto.
It's nothing.	Nije ništa.
You didn't do anything.	Nisi ništa uradio.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
But you can't.	Ali ne možeš.
I couldn't help myself.	Nisam si mogao pomoći.
I knew it would be okay.	Znao sam da će biti u redu.
He knows it, they know it.	On to zna, oni to znaju.
He saw what it was.	Video je šta je to.
This is your problem.	Ovo je tvoj problem.
There must be them.	Mora da ih ima.
Good good good.	Dobro dobro dobro.
We didn't do our job.	Nismo uradili svoj posao.
You have to stay here with us.	Moraš ostati ovdje sa nama.
Or it should be.	Ili bi trebalo da bude.
And that is often true.	I to je često istina.
You know this is true.	Znaš da je ovo istina.
It works pretty well.	Radi prilično dobro.
It is sufficient.	To je dovoljno.
He didn't even have money.	Nije imao ni novca.
Just the thing.	Samo stvar.
He just thought it was.	Samo je mislio da jeste.
She will be able to help.	Ona će moći pomoći.
This is my job.	Ovo je moj posao.
Much of what she said was true.	Mnogo toga što je rekla bilo je istina.
Maybe it's that simple.	Možda je tako jednostavno.
We don't know who they are.	Ne znamo ko su oni.
He didn't see the things he wanted to see.	Nije vidio stvari koje je želio vidjeti.
I never think of him.	Nikad ne mislim na njega.
He knew it was wrong, but he couldn't help himself.	Znao je da to nije u redu, ali nije si mogao pomoći.
But it really happened.	Ali to se zaista dogodilo.
But we.	Ali mi .
And so on.	I tako dalje.
It was for me.	Za mene je bilo.
And this year they did it.	I ove godine su to uradili.
But that wasn't good either.	Ali ni to nije bilo dobro.
Nothing could be done without him.	Ništa se nije moglo bez njega.
I want to be something.	Želim da budem nešto.
Now nothing was right.	Sada ništa nije bilo kako treba.
We can't know what's going to happen.	Ne možemo znati šta će se dogoditi.
It was just.	Bilo je samo.
But it's nothing.	Ali nije ništa.
This was too much.	Ovo je bilo previše.
It was hard for me with that.	Bilo mi je teško s tim.
It was very bad.	Bilo je jako loše.
He needed a life.	Trebao mu je život.
Maybe not so bad.	Možda i nije tako loš.
You won't be sorry.	Neće vam biti žao.
There is nothing to do.	Nema šta da se uradi.
He saw it too.	I on je to video.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
We should know what to do.	Trebalo bi da znamo šta da radimo.
But she works for me.	Ali ona radi za mene.
That in itself is difficult.	To je samo po sebi teško.
He wanted to be well.	Želio je da bude dobro.
I can see him.	Mogu ga vidjeti.
It's here now.	Sada je tu.
That was my idea.	To je bila moja ideja.
He doesn't want to talk.	Ne želi da priča.
Can anyone help ???.	Može li neko da pomogne???.
But it seemed to be true.	Ali činilo se da je to istina.
So far, he is doing very well.	Za sada mu ide jako dobro.
I want you to know you're not alone.	Želim da znaš da nisi sam.
She didn't know if it was still true or not.	Nije znala je li to još uvijek istina ili ne.
Me or them.	Ja ili oni.
But that's not good.	Ali to nije dobro.
And, if you need a good reason, this is it.	I, ako vam treba dobar razlog, to je to.
Just not now.	Samo ne sada.
You were.	Bio si.
Not just who does what, but when and how often.	Ne samo ko šta radi već kada i koliko često.
I'm going to see her.	Idem da je vidim.
But for now it is what it is.	Ali za sada je to što jeste.
I do not want anything.	Ne želim ništa.
I don't do anything, and neither do you.	Ja ne radim ništa, a ne radiš ni ti.
You need this.	Treba ti ovo.
I'm never alone.	Nikad nisam sama.
But not any job.	Ali ne bilo koji posao.
A lot of it is good.	Mnogo toga je dobro.
No, that's not it.	Ne, to nije to.
Right at .	Upravo kod .
What are you doing?	Šta radiš?
And that was it.	I to je bilo to.
I don't love him anymore.	Ne volim ga više.
But that cannot be true.	Ali to ne može biti tačno.
She loves him.	Ona ga voli.
I knew immediately.	Odmah sam znao.
I still work a little to this day.	Još uvijek radim malo do danas.
I just have to be better.	Samo moram biti bolji.
I wasn't there.	Nisam bio tamo.
I want you to do it.	Želim da to uradiš.
Good times for sure !.	Dobra vremena sigurno!.
But it's still there.	Ali još uvijek je tu.
It was good, for sure.	Bilo je dobro, sigurno.
Do you know where this was?	Znate li gdje je ovo bilo?
I know he was.	Znam da je bio.
They said yes.	Oni su rekli da.
But only if you want to.	Ali samo ako to želite.
No one tried.	Niko nije pokušao.
That's just bad.	To je jednostavno loše.
I'm not like you.	Ja nisam kao ti.
It is.	Da, jeste.
I'll give you one.	Ja ću ti dati jedan.
It just seemed enough to just be there.	Činilo se da je dovoljno samo biti tamo.
But.	Ali.
Business is going well.	Posao ide dobro.
For now, everything works.	Za sada sve radi.
So far it has been easy.	Do sada je bilo lako.
He couldn't help but see them.	Nije mogao da ih ne vidi.
Not even to myself.	Čak ni sebi.
He eats well, but speaks little.	Dobro jede, ali malo govori.
I thought there was something wrong with me.	Mislio sam da sa mnom nešto nije u redu.
And it usually is.	I obično je tako.
I love you very much.	Volim vas mnogo.
He can't see me.	Ne može me vidjeti.
Few have seen it.	Malo ko je to vidio.
I would not.	Ne bih.
I have to go, you said.	Moram da idem, rekao si.
Just like you.	Baš kao i ti.
This time it is better to do it properly.	Ovaj put je bolje da to uradi kako treba.
That's exactly what he said.	Upravo je to rekao.
No one here would do that.	Niko ovde to ne bi uradio.
It's so easy now.	Sada je tako lako.
I never would.	Nikad ne bih.
Or it can be.	Ili može biti.
But they are not just people.	Ali oni nisu samo ljudi.
I had to talk to you.	Morao sam razgovarati s tobom.
We don't know why she's going.	Ne znamo zašto ona ide.
And I didn't tell him that.	A da mu to nisam rekao.
But really, it can be anything.	Ali zaista, to može biti bilo šta.
And how he knew that.	I kako je to znao.
What happened to you was real.	Ono što ti se dogodilo bilo je stvarno.
He never does that.	On to nikad ne čini.
He wanted to live as a person.	Želeo je da živi kao osoba.
I really hope you're right.	Zaista se nadam da si u pravu.
Nobody knows why and how.	Niko ne zna zašto i kako.
From home.	Od kuće.
He had no money with him.	Nije imao novca kod sebe.
But we like it that way.	Ali nama se tako sviđa.
He shouldn't need that here.	Ovdje mu to ne bi trebalo.
I wondered what was going on.	Pitao sam se šta se dešava.
You, you're not and it's just not right.	Ti, nisi i jednostavno nije u redu.
I saw that he liked it.	Video sam da mu se sviđa.
But there was no time.	Ali nije bilo vremena.
Not yet, not really.	Ne još, ne baš.
It goes on.	Ide dalje.
It was time to have fun.	Bilo je vrijeme da se zabavi.
Maybe it didn't happen that way.	Možda se to nije dogodilo baš tako.
And you can see that.	I to možete vidjeti.
Tell me what you did today.	Reci mi šta si radio danas.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
It wasn't easy for me.	Nije mi to bilo lako.
Like we don't know what year this is.	Kao da ne znamo koja je ovo godina.
I didn't want to see.	Nisam htela da vidim.
I don't know which one.	Ne znam koji.
No one has ever seen a car here.	Ovde niko nikada nije video auto.
I can't believe you're going to do something like that.	Ne mogu ti vjerovati da ćeš tako nešto učiniti.
Besides, nothing was like last year.	Osim toga, ništa nije bilo kao prošle godine.
He would never do that.	On to nikada ne bi uradio.
This is going to be so hard.	Ovo će biti tako teško.
That's not good enough.	To nije dovoljno dobro.
Bad weather or something.	Loše vrijeme ili tako nešto.
He has few friends.	Ima malo prijatelja.
Not so today.	Danas nije tako.
It's up to us.	Na nama je.
They know what they are up to.	Oni znaju na čemu su.
I saw them.	Video sam ih.
That will definitely help.	To će sigurno pomoći.
Not much, really.	Ne mnogo, zaista.
But he'll be here soon.	Ali uskoro će biti ovdje.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Nije htio razgovarati sa mnom.
But there it is.	Ali tu je.
This is a good thing.	Ovo je dobra stvar.
I repeatedly asked her to give me a job.	Više puta sam je tražio da mi da posao.
And there is a problem.	I postoji problem.
I wish he was here today.	Volio bi da je danas ovdje.
It was pretty simple.	Bilo je prilično jednostavno.
Even this doesn't look bad.	Čak ni ovo ne izgleda loše.
I knew it would never be enough.	Znao sam da to nikada neće biti dovoljno.
I knew what was going to happen.	Znao sam šta će biti.
They are in it.	Oni su u tome.
And another.	I još jedan.
I didn't even tell anyone.	Nisam ni nikome rekao.
This is not exactly true.	Ovo baš i nije tačno.
He wouldn't be there.	On ne bi bio tamo.
It's a good day for that.	Dobar je dan za to.
This should be done here as well.	Ovo bi trebalo uraditi i ovdje.
I think he's right.	Mislim da je u pravu.
To this day they are not.	Do danas nisu.
I'm not okay with that.	Nisam u redu sa tim.
But this actually looks good.	Ali ovo zapravo izgleda dobro.
He won't say more.	Neće više da kaže.
I just can't.	Jednostavno ne mogu.
They were here.	Bili su ovdje.
Why, he didn't know.	Zašto, nije znao.
What! 	Šta!
I didn't ask him.	Nisam ga pitao.
I didn't know that myself.	Ni sam to nisam znao.
Have fun.	Zabavi se.
It seemed like a good job.	Činilo mu se kao dobar posao.
This one could.	Ovaj bi mogao.
She was a really good thing for me.	Ona je zaista bila dobra stvar za mene.
That never happens.	To se nikada ne dešava.
But it couldn't be easy.	Ali nije moglo biti lako.
I like it that way.	Sviđa mi se tako.
He was right the first time.	Bio je u pravu prvi put.
I love it!.	Volim to!.
We never did.	Nikad nismo.
Just like he had.	Baš kao što je i imao.
It wasn't right.	Nije bilo u redu.
Enough for now.	Za sada dosta.
It's been around for a while.	Postoji već neko vrijeme.
That's what my friend liked to say.	To je moj prijatelj voleo da kaže.
If this, do that.	Ako ovo, uradi ono.
But it's not that simple.	Ali to nije tako jednostavno.
She is fine now.	Ona je sada dobro.
he asked.	pitao.
what should you do	šta treba da uradite?
I've never heard of it.	Nikad nisam čuo za to.
It's for work.	Je za posao.
Or maybe that's not it.	Ili možda to nije to.
They didn't seem to have been there before.	Činilo se da tamo ranije nisu bili.
Is that it.	Je li to ono.
That has already happened.	To se već dogodilo.
Good thing he didn't.	Dobro je što nije.
It just seemed right.	Činilo se baš kako treba.
Or I would like to do.	Ili bih želio učiniti.
I saw her.	Video sam je.
Yes, something happened.	Da, nešto se dogodilo.
He asked me a few things.	Pitao me je o nekoliko stvari.
Or you could do it.	Ili biste mogli to da uradite.
I gave him the money.	Dao sam mu novac.
He lost.	Izgubio je.
I'm happy.	Ja sam sretan.
I think you are.	Mislim da jesi.
I've never seen you.	Nikad te nisam video.
It's happening, it is.	Dešava se, jeste.
Lots and lots of thoughts.	Puno i puno misli.
As if he didn't know exactly what he had done.	Kao da nije znao šta je tačno uradio.
The day started very	Dan je počeo veoma
But now he is gone.	Ali sada ga nema.
He will bring it back.	On će ga vratiti.
He couldn't even talk.	Nije mogao ni da priča.
I won't talk to you about it.	Neću razgovarati s tobom o tome.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
It won't be long.	Neće još dugo.
You really know.	Stvarno znaš.
It never happened.	Nikad se nije dogodilo.
They never did anything.	Nikada ništa nisu uradili.
Are you ready ?.	Da li si spreman?.
Good thing here.	Dobra stvar ovdje.
Or anyone.	Ili bilo koga.
Why is it a good question.	Zašto je dobro pitanje.
All this, this time.	Sve ovo, ovaj put.
Which has never happened before.	Što se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
In fact, nothing happened.	U stvari, ništa se nije dogodilo.
It's hard to say now.	Teško je sada reći.
But it wasn't one.	Ali to nije bio jedan.
I know you know.	Znam da znaš.
I'm still thinking about you.	I dalje mislim na tebe.
I have no idea how.	Nemam pojma kako.
It's not all that bad.	Nije sve tako loše.
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije.
I think they are a good thing.	Mislim da su dobra stvar.
He must be tired!	Mora da je umoran!
Must be.	Mora biti.
I've seen you many times.	Vidio sam te mnogo puta.
For me, it really works.	Za mene to zaista radi.
He will return.	On će se vratiti.
What he said is simply not true.	Ono što je rekao jednostavno nije istina.
I'm here, he said.	Stigao sam, rekao je.
Nothing is wrong.	Ništa nije u redu.
I tried to do things.	Pokušao sam da radim stvari.
Everything is as it should be.	Sve je kako treba.
We can find him.	Možemo ga naći.
I'm not saying it's bad.	Ne kažem da je to loše.
It's like mine.	Kao da je moj.
He thought of all the things he needed to say.	Mislio je na sve stvari koje je trebao reći.
But there are still a few people.	Ali još uvijek ima nekoliko ljudi.
And not just an idea.	I ne samo ideja.
Not that we knew that at the time.	Nije da smo to znali u to vrijeme.
he asked.	pitao.
I wonder what will happen now.	Pitam se šta će se sada dogoditi.
I'm telling you this.	Kažem ti ovo.
And maybe that was good too.	A možda je i to bilo dobro.
I'm not entirely sure.	Nisam potpuno siguran.
It is something that can or cannot be done.	To je nešto što se može ili ne može učiniti.
I don't think we can do anything more than that.	Mislim da ne možemo ništa više od toga.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ne zna se da li je to tačno.
Time, it just seems, is never enough.	Vremena, samo izgleda da nikad nije dovoljno.
But it's like doing anything.	Ali to je kao da radiš bilo šta.
I see no reason why you shouldn't do something that way.	Ne vidim razlog zašto nešto ne uradite na taj način.
You can't do that now.	Ne možeš to sada.
It could be said that no one wanted to be there.	Moglo bi se reći da niko nije želio biti tamo.
Until it is.	Sve dok nije.
We were almost there.	Bili smo skoro .
The man was working.	Čovjek je radio.
I'm just not there yet.	Samo još nisam tamo.
Everything he said is true.	Sve što je rekao je istina.
I have to go.	Moram ići.
And it seems not.	I izgleda da nije.
They can't do that, can they?	Oni to ne mogu, zar ne?
He never even asked for it.	Nikada to nije ni tražio.
She is always there for me.	Ona je uvek tu za mene.
This would be a good game.	Ovo bi bila dobra igra.
A lot more.	Mnogo više.
It just won't happen.	Samo se to neće dogoditi.
And maybe it's for you.	A možda je za tebe.
Looks easy enough.	Izgleda dovoljno lako.
It seems to me that you are wrong.	Čini mi se da niste u pravu.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
They should have.	Trebali su.
I'm really sorry.	Veoma mi je žao.
And what they are on now.	I na čemu su sada.
These are things we know we know.	To su stvari koje znamo da znamo.
You have everything.	Imaš sve.
The truth is that there is no one way.	Istina je da ne postoji jedan put.
If not, don't.	Ako ne, nemoj.
Or we should leave.	Ili bismo trebali otići.
Or not, until last night.	Ili nije, do sinoć.
You have to tell me what to do.	Moraš mi reći šta da radim.
Now we know we can.	Sada znamo da možemo.
By itself, that wasn’t the real problem.	Samo po sebi, to nije bio pravi problem.
That time was not like today.	To vrijeme nije bilo kao danas.
And he did that for a while.	I to je neko vrijeme radio.
He would need more money.	Trebalo bi mu više novca.
He won't come.	Neće doći.
For anything really.	Za bilo šta zaista.
You did the right thing.	Uradili ste pravu stvar.
Think of tomorrow.	Misli na sutra.
I didn't say anything.	Nisam ništa rekao.
No one was there.	Niko nije bio tamo.
Just your money, and that's it.	Samo tvoj novac, i to je to.
I could never do that now.	Nikad to sada ne bih mogao.
It was just something that happened.	Bilo je to samo nešto što se dogodilo.
I couldn't do that.	Nisam mogao to da uradim.
You can't see that.	Ne možete to vidjeti.
Too much as one on one.	Previše kao jedan na jedan.
He seems very sure.	Izgleda veoma siguran.
It's a good game.	To je dobra igra.
Just like her.	Baš kao i ona.
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
I can really talk to you.	Zaista mogu razgovarati s tobom.
You can get it.	Možete ga dobiti.
I still had a lot of money at the time.	U to vrijeme sam još uvijek imao dosta novca.
She said that would be fine.	Rekla je da bi to bilo u redu.
And he did a lot.	I uradio mnogo.
I think you did a good job.	Mislim da si uradio dobar posao.
So we can get back to that.	Tako da se možemo vratiti na to.
All of us.	Svi mi.
She and he together.	Ona i on zajedno.
It just doesn’t work.	To jednostavno ne radi.
He wouldn't know where she was.	Ne bi znao gdje je ona.
Years of time.	Godine vremena.
This is not easy for me.	Ovo mi nije lako.
He had no idea who it was.	Nije imao pojma ko je to.
There are few of them.	Malo ih je.
But not all.	Ali ne sve.
She actually said that.	Ona je to zapravo rekla.
Nice to see you again.	Drago mi je da te ponovo vidim.
I don't know what they did to him.	Ne znam šta su mu uradili.
You have to see it for yourself.	Morate to sami vidjeti.
As if he never wanted anything.	Kao da nikad ništa nije želeo.
It's good to be busy here.	Dobro je biti zauzet ovdje.
I wish I knew that.	Voleo bih to da znam.
But there were many things.	Ali bilo je mnogo stvari.
I haven't seen this before.	Nisam ovo ranije video.
He was ready for anything.	Bio je spreman na sve.
I would be glad.	Bilo bi mi drago.
He was alone there.	Tamo je bio sam.
I just want to say.	Samo želim da kažem.
For more money.	Za više novca.
This is happening, for now.	Ovo se dešava, za sada.
Or so it seems.	Ili, tako izgleda.
Will you come with me?	Hoćeš li sa mnom?
A lot is wrong.	Mnogo toga nije u redu.
He did this.	Ovo je uradio.
Tomorrow is my day.	Sutra je moj dan.
I loved it.	Voleo sam to.
He was not his own.	On nije bio svoj.
I was sure something was wrong.	Bio sam siguran da nešto nije u redu.
Lots of money.	Puno novca.
I can’t believe it works so fast.	Ne mogu vjerovati da tako brzo radi.
Yes, that's right.	Da, upravo to.
And work a little more.	I radi još malo.
But maybe that's good too.	Ali možda je i to dobro.
I'm not sure yet.	Nisam još siguran.
I just don't know when that day will be.	Samo ne znam kada će biti taj dan.
And you won't know.	I nećeš znati.
I'm going to do it again.	Idem ponovo na to.
Sure you can.	Sigurno možete.
Everything is exactly as it was.	Sve je tačno kako je bilo.
You know better than that.	Ti znaš bolje od toga.
But it wasn't her.	Ali to nije bila ona.
She said she thought she could.	Rekla je da misli da može.
I don't want to be alone.	Ne želim da budem sama.
Okay, but long, so we can get to that.	Dobro, ali dugo, tako da bismo mogli doći do toga.
It didn't take long.	Nije trebalo dugo.
But not much.	Ali ne mnogo.
This is true.	Ovo je tačno.
And they could be better.	I mogli bi biti bolji.
We needed him.	Trebao nam je.
I'm not surprised.	Nisam iznenađen.
But in fact he was.	Ali u stvari je bio.
Lots of stuff here.	Puno stvari ovde.
And neither can you.	A ne može ni bilo ko od vas.
They did it well.	Oni su to dobro uradili.
But it could be anything.	Ali moglo bi biti sve.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
And not just work.	I ne samo posao.
Even the weather was bad.	Čak je i vrijeme bilo loše.
Now he knew.	Sada je znao.
Everything was good, everything was good.	Sve je bilo dobro, sve je bilo dobro.
But neither is life.	Ali nije ni život.
Or, the car could be the problem.	Ili, auto može biti problem.
She knew what she meant.	Znala je na šta misli.
That's for sure.	To je sigurno.
I knew it couldn't be easy.	Znao sam da nije moglo biti lako.
We have to be told.	Mora nam se reći.
Not so much in a bad way.	Ne toliko na loš način.
Maybe he'll go for it.	Možda će ići na to.
You could trust him.	Mogao si mu vjerovati.
I needed a car.	Trebao sam auto.
It was hard to tell who heard what.	Bilo je teško reći ko je šta čuo.
You should know this.	Trebao bi ovo znati.
I can work on it.	Mogu raditi na tome.
The right way.	Pravi put.
We know what you did.	Znamo šta ste uradili.
But that doesn't have to be the case.	Ali to ne mora biti tako.
Being human is okay.	Biti čovjek je u redu.
But maybe it would.	Ali možda bi.
It's hard for me.	Teško mi je.
I was the problem.	Ja sam bio problem.
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
You are doing well.	Dobro ti ide.
It seems to have happened many years ago.	Čini se da se to dogodilo prije mnogo godina.
First time here.	Prvi put ovdje.
He couldn't help who he was.	Nije mogao pomoći ko je bio.
Be here now.	Biti ovdje sada.
I don't see why.	Ne vidim zašto bi.
So he did what they said.	Tako da je uradio ono što su rekli.
Whether it is a.	Bilo da je a.
There was never a problem.	Nikada nije bilo problema.
I'll go with you if you want.	Ići ću s tobom ako želiš.
I've always done that.	Uvek sam to radio.
Maybe he seems to be right.	Možda je, izgleda, u pravu.
I have to say there are many and more things.	Moram reći da ima mnogo i više stvari.
Tell me the truth.	Reci mi istinu.
I still don't know.	I dalje ne znam.
And she was absolutely right.	I bila je potpuno u pravu.
That's real life.	To je pravi život.
I'm very tired.	Veoma sam umoran.
He is never afraid.	On se nikad ne boji.
Do it fast.	Uradi to brzo.
I was bad too.	I ja sam bio loš.
No more time.	Nema više vremena.
He knew the weather was not good.	Znao je da vrijeme nije dobro.
Yes, he is very, very good.	Da, on je veoma, veoma dobar.
That's how it should be.	Tako treba da bude.
Not like this morning.	Ne kao jutros.
Tomorrow wouldn't be so bad.	Sutra ne bi bilo tako loše.
Lots to like.	Mnogo toga da vam se sviđa.
That happened.	To se dogodilo.
Either you do it or you don't.	Ili to uradiš ili ne.
I'm back, ready.	Vratio sam se, spreman.
I didn’t have time to wonder why.	Nisam imao vremena da se pitam zašto.
It would be.	Bilo bi.
I know my job.	Znam svoj posao.
I think this is a good thing.	Mislim da je ovo dobra stvar.
I can get a job if I have to.	Mogu dobiti posao, ako treba.
He won't stay.	Neće ostati.
But it will do more.	Ali to će učiniti više.
It's not just a question of money.	Nije samo pitanje novca.
To be with me.	Da bude sa mnom.
And maybe it was true.	A možda je i bila istina.
No, not really, but that's right.	Ne, ne baš, ali tako je.
I don't love you, not really.	Ne volim te, ne baš.
Tell him everything's going well here.	Reci mu da sve ide dobro ovde.
He does not live.	On ne živi.
Now they had.	Sada su imali.
I think it is now.	Mislim da je sada.
There is enough.	Ima dovoljno.
Nobody asked why.	Niko nije pitao zašto.
It was pretty easy.	Bilo je prilično lako.
It's there.	To je tamo.
But that seems to be exactly what happened.	Ali izgleda da se upravo to dogodilo.
Besides, it's pretty good.	Osim toga, prilično je dobro.
She said she felt much better.	Rekla je da se osjeća mnogo bolje.
It will not be easy.	To neće biti lako.
True, we have.	Istina, imamo.
But he's not even sure about that.	Ali on nije ni siguran u to.
Which is the reason for that.	Što je razlog tome.
She can say it could be better.	Ona može reći da može biti bolje.
You have to do something yourself.	Morate sami nešto da uradite.
That's all he's been doing so far.	To je sve što radi do sada.
Simply bad.	Jednostavno loše.
But this does not seem to be the right way to do this.	Ali čini se da ovo nije pravi način da se ovo uradi.
Until then.	Do toga.
He says he knows.	Kaže da zna.
I don't do that.	Ja to ne radim.
They are a team.	Oni su tim.
And the truth was that it might never be.	A istina je bila da možda nikada neće biti.
It's raining.	Kiša je .
Really.	Zaista.
This could do it.	Ovo bi to moglo učiniti.
I'm just saying.	Samo kažem.
But not like this one.	Ali ne kao ovaj.
He wasn't like him either.	Ni to nije bio kao on.
It should be something you know and something you have.	To bi trebalo da bude nešto što znaš i nešto što imaš.
Easy like that.	Lako tako.
Let me tell you, you know.	Da ti kažem, znaš.
The problem is money.	Problem je novac.
That's more than that.	To je više od toga.
I'm telling you how it is here.	Ja ti kažem kako je ovde.
You may or may not get it.	Možda ćete ga dobiti, a možda i ne.
It was either us or them.	Bili smo ili mi ili oni.
I wouldn't have heard of this.	Ne bi čuo za ovo.
Not much is said.	Ne govori se puno.
I love everything, I love.	Volim sve, volim.
I was just working.	Samo sam radio.
The problem is that.	Problem je u tome.
I'll tell you as a friend.	Reći ću ti kao prijatelj.
He's doing well.	On ide dobro.
I don't know what's next.	Ne znam šta dalje.
That was my life.	To je bio moj život.
But I see what you mean.	Ali vidim na šta misliš.
I don't know why, but it's true.	Ne znam zašto, ali je istina.
I know who he is.	Znam ko je on.
I heard the job is good.	Čuo sam da je posao dobar.
No one should find him here.	Niko ga ne bi trebao naći ovdje.
I didn't do anything.	Nisam ništa uradio.
That's just what's happening.	To je samo ono što se dešava.
It is not true that we needed this man.	Nije tačno da nam je trebao ovaj čovjek.
How does it look like.	Kako izgleda.
Maybe you didn't know that.	Možda to niste znali.
I wondered what he had.	Pitao sam se šta ima.
They said we could get them tomorrow.	Rekli su da ih možemo dobiti sutra.
This is.	Ovo je.
You have your money.	Imaš svoj novac.
He can give it to you right away.	Može vam odmah dati.
Only three of them.	Samo tri od toga.
They are people too.	I oni su ljudi.
I haven't decided yet.	Nisam se još odlučio.
I'd like to think that it didn't actually happen.	Voleo bih da mislim da se to zapravo nije dogodilo.
He was surprised.	Bio je iznenađen.
That is simply not true.	To jednostavno nije istina.
It seemed to be.	Činilo se da je.
He was much better now, but he had never seen this one come.	Sada je bio mnogo bolji, ali nikada nije vidio da će ovaj doći.
Did you.	Da li si.
But mine too.	Ali i moja.
And it's not just her.	I nije samo ona.
But please don't do that.	Ali molim te nemoj to raditi.
She knows he needs to be told everything.	Ona zna da mu treba sve reći.
Too many problems.	Previše problema.
I don't think this is right.	Mislim da ovo nije u redu.
She wants me to be happy.	Ona želi da budem sretan.
That was not yes.	To nije bilo da.
He was supposed to be mine.	On je trebao biti moj.
he says.	kaže on.
She was here now.	Sada je bila ovdje.
I'm fine myself.	I sama sam dobro.
He did it.	On je to uradio.
A friend told me everything would be fine.	Prijatelj mi je rekao da će sve biti u redu.
He probably worked.	Verovatno je radio.
What is it? 	Šta je to?
I can't just go.	Ne mogu samo ići.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
I like what he does.	Sviđa mi se to što radi.
Maybe not.	Možda i ne bi.
Nobody knows how much.	Niko ne zna koliko.
That would never happen today.	To se danas nikada ne bi dogodilo.
It was so hard.	Bilo je tako teško.
He was never our friend.	On nam nikada nije bio prijatelj.
We don't need help.	Ne treba nam pomoć.
But it didn't.	Ali nije.
And that's very good.	I to je jako dobro.
It's just my idea.	To je samo moja ideja.
I was so sure of it.	Bio sam tako siguran u to.
I just wanted a little.	Samo sam htela malo.
It was a person.	Bila je to osoba.
I want both.	Želim oboje.
Someone I could talk to.	Neko s kim bi mogao razgovarati.
I'm surprised how well it goes.	Iznenađen sam kako dobro ide.
I should be.	Trebalo bi da budem.
Who 'we' were.	Ko smo 'mi' bili.
Where we are.	Gdje smo.
They never did.	Nikada nisu.
This is the first.	Ovaj je prvi.
Like now.	Kao i sada.
This was good.	Ovo je bilo dobro.
This makes it unlikely.	Zbog toga je malo vjerovatno.
But he got very well.	Ali mnogo je dobro dobio.
It doesn't work that way here.	Ne radi tako ovdje.
I really like going.	Zaista volim da idem.
It's not.	Nije.
Like, good man.	Kao, čovjek dobar.
But they are not here.	Ali oni nisu ovdje.
No, maybe about that.	Ne, možda o tome.
That happened.	To se dogodilo.
But not much.	Ali ne mnogo toga.
He didn't have to.	Nije morao.
It will come as one.	Doći će kao jedan.
It's not right.	Nije u redu.
I really had no idea about it.	Zaista nisam imao pojma o tome.
But he can say a few things about it.	Ali on može reći nekoliko stvari o tome.
It looks like.	Izgleda kao.
This is what you will be, what will happen to you.	Ovo ćeš biti, šta će ti se dogoditi.
It seemed to be.	Činilo se da jeste.
Not something like that.	Ne nešto tako.
I love that thing.	Volim tu stvar.
I would say no.	Rekao bih ne.
And that could help.	I to bi moglo pomoći.
And that just won't work.	A to jednostavno neće ići.
Maybe we won't.	Možda nećemo.
He knows he could do it.	On zna da bi to mogao.
I'm here.	Tu sam ja.
Nothing.	Ni u čemu.
You look like her.	Izgledaš kao ona.
I don't see how bad that can be for you.	Ne vidim kako to može biti loše za tebe.
He'll never have to come back.	Nikada se neće morati vratiti.
Something works for me.	Nešto mi radi.
And it should.	I trebalo bi.
He really did everything he could.	Zaista je učinio sve što je mogao.
You will find me.	Naći ćeš me.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda neće.
Do it fast.	Uradi to brzo.
Not much, he realized quickly.	Ne baš mnogo, brzo je shvatio.
I can't do it now.	Ne mogu to sada da uradim.
There is probably a reason for that.	Vjerovatno postoji razlog za to.
It's there waiting for him.	Tamo ga čeka.
What else do I need to do here.	Šta još treba da radim ovde.
They did it together.	Zajedno su to uradili.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
I have done that.	Uradio sam to.
That's the only real problem here.	To je jedini pravi problem ovdje.
No one should know.	Niko ne bi trebao znati.
And that's us.	A to smo mi.
It seems to be working well.	Čini se da radi dobro.
We might know.	Mogli bismo znati.
That is a difficult question.	To je teško pitanje.
Nobody ever said anything.	Niko nikad ništa nije rekao.
He really couldn't do that.	On to zaista nije mogao.
I did it.	Ja sam to radio.
I could see why.	Mogao sam da vidim zašto.
And so it is today.	I tako je i danas.
Everything seemed easy.	Činilo se da je sve lako.
That's something, he thinks.	To je nešto, misli on.
We were for those things.	Bili smo za te stvari.
He thought so too.	I on je tako mislio.
But you never came.	Ali ti nikad nisi došao.
She knew exactly what to say.	Tačno je znala šta da kaže.
He's gone now.	Sada je otišao.
Maybe it's all of that.	Možda je sve to.
Obviously, someone did.	Očigledno, neko jeste.
Exactly where I can go.	Tačno gdje mogu ići.
I'm still not sure what to do with it.	Još uvijek nisam siguran šta da radim s tim.
They are real people.	Oni su pravi ljudi.
It really was.	Zaista je bilo.
There must be something wrong.	Mora da nešto nije u redu.
She said again.	Ponovo je rekla.
You just know what to do.	Samo znaš šta da radiš.
Or so fast that it could be instantaneous.	Ili tako brzo da bi moglo biti i trenutno.
He can't get anything that way.	Na taj način ne može ništa dobiti.
Nobody heard him.	Niko ga nije čuo.
There are a lot of people.	Ima puno ljudi.
It was both.	Bilo je oboje.
What seems to be the problem? 	Šta se čini da je problem?
I haven't seen him in a long time.	Nisam ga dugo vidio.
There are still too many of them.	Još uvijek ih ima previše.
I thought you were right.	Mislio sam da si u pravu.
That really isn’t true.	To zaista nije istina.
They were nothing to me.	Za mene nisu bili ništa.
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
Now it seemed that he would have to do just that.	Sada se činilo da će morati da uradi upravo to.
There was never enough money.	Nikada nije bilo dovoljno novca.
That certainly wasn't for me.	To sigurno nije bilo za mene.
He worked the way he wanted.	Radio je kako je htio.
I can tell what she thinks.	Mogu reći šta ona misli.
We can buy.	Možemo kupiti.
I could.	Mogao sam.
He would know that.	On bi to znao.
I saw the road.	Video sam put.
He saw what he should not have seen.	Video je ono što nije trebalo da vidi.
In fact, he didn't even know why he was there.	Zapravo, nije ni znao zašto je tamo.
That was my job.	To je bio moj posao.
oh no! 	o ne!
He knew.	Znao je.
I could never do that.	Nikad to nisam mogao.
But not there.	Ali ne tamo.
It would be the first time if it had.	Bilo bi to prvi put da jeste.
But there is still time.	Ali još ima vremena.
There was a lot to see.	Bilo je mnogo toga da se vidi.
I can't say exactly everything he does.	Ne mogu tačno reći sve što radi.
You needed me.	Trebao si me.
We only had one car.	Imali smo samo jedan auto.
It's not enough.	Nije dovoljno.
And she will be here.	I ona će biti ovdje.
She was never mine.	Nikada nije bila moja.
Only he wasn't there now.	Samo što ga sada nije bilo.
It is true that none of us know yet.	Istina je da niko od nas još ne zna.
I was fine.	Bilo mi je dobro.
He had to plan.	Morao je da planira.
It was a good job.	Bio je to dobar posao.
Everything works well.	Sve radi dobro.
He should haven't.	Morao bi da nije.
The day he got home.	Dan kada je stigao kući.
It's a job.	To je posao.
That path no longer exists.	Taj put više ne postoji.
He had done it before.	Radio je to ranije.
I will say the same for him.	Toliko ću reći i za njega.
You like it.	Sviđa ti se.
You should be too.	I ti bi trebao biti.
for sure	sigurno,
I think he is.	Mislim da je on.
We shouldn't talk for a while.	Ne bismo trebali razgovarati neko vrijeme.
I do not know what is happening.	Ne znam šta se dešava.
It doesn't take long.	Ne treba dugo.
In fact, much more.	Zapravo mnogo više.
There is a reason why we are still here.	Postoji razlog zašto smo još uvijek ovdje.
But maybe it's not that simple.	Ali možda to i nije tako jednostavno.
You should have seen them.	Trebao si ih vidjeti.
I want it to work well.	Želim da dobro radi.
There were, but not many.	Bilo ih je, ali ne mnogo.
I'm not sure why that is, but it simply is.	Nisam siguran zašto je to tako, ali jednostavno jeste.
If you are in.	Ako ste u.
I didn't.	Nisam.
Don't say anything.	Ne govori ništa.
It doesn't have to be.	Ne mora da bude.
Do you want to come with us?	Želiš li s nama?
Not too many people know.	Ne zna previše ljudi.
Nobody loves him.	Niko ga ne voli.
One times one.	Jedan puta jedan.
I just said that.	Upravo sam to rekao.
There are none.	Nema ih.
That will not happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
They didn't have.	Nisu imali.
I don't want him to leave yet.	Ne želim da još ode.
He doesn't like it.	On to ne voli.
It wasn't right away.	Nije bilo odmah.
Or as good as.	Ili tako dobar kao.
He was so tired.	Bio je tako umoran.
No it's not.	Ne nije.
It's so good.	Tako je dobro.
Want to see how it's done?	Želite li vidjeti kako se to radi?
I'm glad you're here.	Drago mi je da si tu.
That's what they said.	Tako su rekli.
You're not now.	Sada nisi.
It just wasn't right.	Jednostavno nije bilo u redu.
He doesn't like help.	Ne voli pomoć.
Not very good.	Nije baš dobro.
Someone who was good.	Neko ko je bio dobar.
No you're not.	Ne, nisi.
Now I know what he thinks.	Sada znam šta on misli.
He's like us.	On je kao mi.
He didn't ask.	Nije pitao.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
How you all were.	Kako ste svi bili.
It's just that it wasn't easy anymore.	Samo što on to više nije bio jednostavno.
This is for me.	Ovo je za mene.
Can you help?	Možete li pomoći?
I thought it was you.	Mislio sam da si to ti.
That was good to see.	To je bilo dobro vidjeti.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
It was a really good job.	Bio je to zaista dobar posao.
Make everything look so simple.	Učiniti da sve izgleda tako jednostavno.
We can't go on like this.	Ne možemo tako dalje.
People know that.	Ljudi to znaju.
There are so many of them.	Toliko ga je.
But he knew.	Ali on je znao.
We just won't.	Jednostavno nećemo.
And you have to be.	I moraš biti.
I just want to be alone.	Jednostavno želim da budem sam.
I came back for help.	Vratio sam se po pomoć.
They know what they know.	Oni znaju šta znaju.
I think you will too.	Mislim da ćeš i ti.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
This code works.	Ovaj kod radi.
He was not good.	Nije bio dobar.
Yes, you need a new one.	Da, treba ti novi.
I'm very sorry	jako mi je žao
You never came back.	Nikad se nisi vratio.
Not enough money.	Nema dovoljno novca.
That's not my problem.	To nije moj problem.
This is not difficult.	Ovo nije teško.
It's not there, but it's there.	Nije tamo, ali je tu.
No one could believe it.	Niko nije mogao vjerovati.
You know you want to.	Znaš da želiš.
A lot a lot a lot.	Puno puno puno.
If you do.	Ako ti uradiš.
Don't do that.	Nemoj to raditi.
We can go home.	Možemo kući.
I hope so.	Nadam se da je to tako.
I'm not so sure.	Nisam tako siguran.
I knew this could happen.	Znao sam da bi se ovo moglo dogoditi.
We are someone.	Mi smo neko.
But that's me.	Ali to sam ja.
We never had.	Nikada nismo imali.
We've been together for three years.	Zajedno smo tri godine.
And it won't be.	I neće biti.
Or really, a question.	Ili zaista, pitanje.
He arrived home.	Stigao je kući.
And this is true.	I ovo je istina.
I hope you're okay with that.	Nadam se da si u redu sa tim.
One, not many.	Jedan, ne mnogo.
I doubt it will be easy.	Sumnjam da će to biti lako.
He told me to say it.	Rekao mi je da to kažem.
No, it looks like it is, but it isn't.	Ne, izgleda da jeste, ali nije.
We can't stay.	Ne možemo ostati.
He had this.	Imao je ovo.
He always says what he thinks.	On uvek govori šta misli.
How are you.	Kako ti.
And it's still not enough.	I još uvijek nije dovoljno.
I can't trust anyone.	Ne mogu nikome vjerovati.
That's not it.	To nije ono.
That says something.	To nešto govori.
It usually is.	Obično jeste.
Someone should say.	Neko bi trebao reći.
I like it very, very much.	Sviđa mi se jako, jako.
I had to be ready.	Morao sam biti spreman.
You do everything you have to do.	Radiš sve što treba da uradiš.
I just know we'll be together.	Samo znam da ćemo biti zajedno.
You never did that.	Nikad to nisi uradio.
And he wasn't alone.	I nije bio sam.
He knew we were there.	Znao je da smo tamo.
I could use one.	Dobro bi mi došao jedan.
This is really simple.	Ovo je zaista jednostavno.
You should come back.	Trebao bi se vratiti.
He didn't even think it was about power.	Nije čak ni mislio da se radi o moći.
Now he could get everything.	Sada je mogao dobiti sve.
It's not safe here anymore.	Ovdje više nije sigurno.
Quick.	Brzo.
It’s a job and it’s my life.	To je posao i to je moj život.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
I don't know about me either.	Ne znam ni za mene.
I bought a car.	Kupio sam auto.
Without it, he would have nothing.	Bez toga ne bi imao ništa.
He really did it.	Zaista je to uradio.
I didn’t expect that to happen.	Nisam očekivao da će se to dogoditi.
I shouldn't do this.	Ne bih trebao ovo da radim.
I know you will.	Znam da hoćeš.
He never got them.	Nikada ih nije dobio.
A lot of that.	Mnogo toga.
I know what she looks like.	Znam kako ona izgleda.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
And maybe he was right.	I možda je bio u pravu.
But that never happened.	Ali, to se nikada nije dogodilo.
I just felt sorry for him.	Samo mi ga je bilo žao.
I really wanted to.	Zaista sam htela.
You know what's in there.	Znaš šta je tamo.
Just like yesterday.	Baš kao juče.
Don't say anything more.	Ne reci ništa više.
I know you now.	Znam te sada.
I'd say you don't need it.	Rekao bih da ti ne treba.
It is difficult to know exactly where that is.	Teško je znati gdje je to tačno.
And, he's probably right.	I, vjerovatno je u pravu.
I think we've had enough.	Mislim da nam je bilo dosta.
We can get a job.	Možemo dobiti posao.
I don't think anyone can.	Mislim da niko ne može.
That's why we're really here.	Zbog toga smo zaista ovdje.
And even if there is, see it my way.	A čak i ako postoji, vidi to na moj način.
But nothing happened.	Ali ništa se nije dogodilo.
It's from before.	To je od ranije.
No, that's not true.	Ne, to nije istina.
Any of us was.	Bilo ko od nas je bio.
This is my code.	Ovo je moj kod.
And if you don’t know, you can’t believe it.	A ako ne znate, ne možete vjerovati.
Me too.	I ja sam.
I'm happy here.	Ja sam sretan ovdje.
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to istina.
He doesn't know why.	On ne zna zašto.
I have no idea how you do it.	Nemam pojma kako to radiš.
It's that simple.	Tako je jednostavno.
Really bad stuff.	Zaista loše stvari.
He saw it right away.	Odmah je to video.
He had time.	Imao je vremena.
You are not allowed to do this.	Ovo vam nije dozvoljeno.
I think everyone knows that.	Mislim da to svi znaju.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žao.
We know that now.	Znamo to sada.
But please don't tell anyone.	Ali, molim te, nemoj nikome reći.
He seemed to know what to do.	Činilo se da zna šta da radi.
I hope you are well for now.	Nadam se da ste za sada dobro.
This doesn't work anymore.	Ovo više ne radi.
I hope you stay here.	Nadam se da ćeš ostati ovdje.
I asked for everything.	Sve sam tražio.
I think you'll be fine.	Mislim da ćeš biti dobro.
But we can't.	Ali ne možemo.
He can't stay here.	Ne može ostati ovdje.
In fact, he never does.	U stvari, on to nikada ne radi.
Nobody does it better.	Niko to ne radi bolje.
But this is not so bad.	Ali, ovo nije tako loše.
This is my life now.	Ovo je sada moj život.
In fact, too much.	U stvari, previše.
They will talk about it.	Oni će razgovarati o tome.
I just have no idea.	Jednostavno nemam pojma.
That, even more.	To, čak i više.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
There is no one like him.	Ne postoji niko kao on.
I hope you all like it.	Nadam se da vam se svima sviđa.
You said that.	Rekao si to.
This was not true.	Ovo nije bila istina.
They are not there.	Oni nisu tamo.
She has to say it now, she said.	Ona to sada mora reći, rekla je.
You could have done anything.	Mogao si sve.
He didn't think it was too much.	Nije mislio da je to previše.
I really like it.	Jako mi se sviđa.
Like last night.	Kao sinoć.
He didn't want her.	Nije je želio.
I'm not even sure it works.	Nisam ni siguran da radi.
But he didn't want that.	Ali on to nije želio.
We don't need it.	Ne treba nam.
It's that simple !.	To je tako jednostavno!.
I can do well.	Ja mogu dobro.
True, it is not.	Istina, nije.
Have you been.	Jeste li bili.
We did everything right.	Uradili smo sve kako treba.
I'll stay here.	Ja ću ostati ovdje.
I don't think that's what he was looking for.	Mislim da to nije ono što je tražio.
I love work.	Volim posao.
You were a real friend.	Bio si pravi prijatelj.
What did you say.	Šta si rekao.
I didn't do it well.	Nisam to dobro uradio.
I hope there is a better way to do this.	Nadam se da postoji bolji način da se ovo uradi.
It should be there.	Trebalo bi biti tamo.
Either way it can work.	Bilo koji način može raditi.
But maybe you are too.	Ali možda i vi jeste.
A way to see who can play.	Način da se vidi ko može da igra.
And that was enough.	I to je bilo dovoljno.
It is not known if this happens in humans.	Ne zna se da li se to dešava kod ljudi.
They don't know what will happen.	Ne znaju šta će se dogoditi.
I did it to work here.	Uradio sam to da bih radio ovde.
You know what they can do and what they have done.	Znate šta oni mogu i šta su uradili.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Tačno je znao šta radi.
If he wants to see me, he knows the way.	Ako želi da me vidi, zna put.
You need more than ever.	Treba ti više od bilo koga.
I gave you back.	Vratio sam ti.
What did he do?	Šta je uradio.
I doubt he's right.	Sumnjam da je u pravu.
But this must be done.	Ali ovo se mora uraditi.
I'm doing it again.	Radim to ponovo.
Something would happen.	Nešto bi se dogodilo.
That's what he's saying there.	To je ono što on tamo govori.
If something is wrong, can you tell me?	Ako nešto nije u redu, možete li mi reći?
Or for money.	Ili za novac.
Nobody wants the truth.	Niko ne želi istinu.
I should be able to do this.	Trebalo bi da mogu ovo da uradim.
They could be helpful.	Oni bi mogli biti od pomoći.
But it could be.	Ali moglo bi biti.
He should have seen.	Trebao je da vidi.
No, I wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
I wish I knew.	Voleo bih da znam.
He lives and loves.	Živi i voli.
Don't do this again.	Ne radi ovo ponovo.
I never will.	Nikad neću.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
You need to know how to do it.	Morate znati kako to učiniti.
We are here to work on ourselves.	Tu smo da radimo na sebi.
We do it.	Mi to radimo.
That's my job while he's here.	To je moj posao dok je on ovdje.
She doesn't know how to drive.	Ona ne zna da vozi.
He would be my first.	On bi mi bio prvi.
I'll be here.	Ja ću biti ovdje.
He saw what was there.	Video je šta je tamo.
But that doesn't seem to be happening here.	Ali izgleda da se to ovde ne dešava.
But you know how it goes.	Ali znaš kako to ide.
So good.	Tako dobro.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
In a few years.	Za nekoliko godina.
So much more.	Tako više.
I never knew him to be so happy.	Nikada ga nisam znala da je tako sretan.
Or maybe he won't say anything.	Ili možda neće ništa reći.
He loves you.	On te voli.
I've had enough.	Bilo mi je dosta.
I didn't hear him.	Nisam ga čuo.
Don't say that.	Ne govori to.
Yes! 	Da!
That was a little difficult.	To je bilo malo teško.
You are a true friend.	Ti si pravi prijatelj.
I do not know what it is.	Ne znam šta je to.
None of you have anyone.	Niko od vas nema nikoga.
I didn't want much.	Nisam htela mnogo.
I don't even want to do that.	Ne želim to ni da uradim.
None of that.	Ništa od toga.
No one knows when he will return.	Niko ne zna kada će se vratiti.
You're welcome in the house.	Nema na čemu u kući.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
But we need to know.	Ali moramo znati.
I can't talk to him.	Ne mogu razgovarati s njim.
I was pretty happy.	Bio sam prilično sretan.
I've never done that.	Nikada to sam uradio.
And she was there.	I ona je bila tamo.
That's a lot of money.	To je dosta novca.
It was very difficult for him.	Bilo mu je jako teško.
It was all because of you.	Sve je bilo zbog tebe.
But now you know.	Ali sada znaš.
I didn't lose her.	Nisam je izgubio.
Why are you.	Zašto si.
He couldn't see anything.	Nije mogao ništa da vidi.
I didn't do it.	Nisam to radio.
And if it wasn't.	A da nije.
Some time.	Neko vrijeme.
I think he might need some help.	Mislim da mu možda treba pomoć.
Just what's going on.	Samo šta se dešava.
Or maybe they are so new.	Ili su možda tako novi.
We know where you are.	Znamo gdje si.
I thought.	Mislio sam.
No.	Nema.
Besides, you don't need it.	Osim toga, ne treba ti.
Do what works.	Radite ono što radi.
Except as.	Osim kao.
But this is from me.	Ali ovo je od mene.
This will not work.	Ovo neće raditi.
He could hardly.	Teško da nije mogao.
In fact, it is.	U stvari, jeste.
This must be it for now.	Ovo za sada mora biti to.
Does anyone want to tell me what's going on?	Hoće li neko da mi kaže šta se dešava?
This can be good or bad.	Ovo može biti dobro ili loše.
I know you well.	Znam te dobro.
You went to your place.	Otišao si kod sebe.
I love them.	Ja ih volim.
I wouldn't.	Ne bi.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
But good.	Ali dobro.
Everything and everyone will return.	Sve i svi će se vratiti.
I don't see them now.	Ne vidim ih sada.
Things you should know, and now you know so well.	Stvari koje biste trebali znati, a sada znate tako dobro.
I think it's soon.	Mislim da je uskoro.
How is it made?	Kako se pravi?
That's as good as it can get.	To je dobro koliko može.
And now he has it.	I sada ga ima.
First time.	Prvi put.
That's what he would expect.	To bi on očekivao.
Almost everything works for me.	Skoro sve mi radi.
There are many of them.	Ima ih mnogo.
It was only a matter of time now.	Sada je bilo samo pitanje vremena.
He is much more.	On je mnogo više.
Or something more.	Ili nešto više.
We could just leave tomorrow.	Mogli bismo jednostavno otići sutra.
Okay for now.	U redu za sada.
And it seems likely that it will.	I čini se vjerovatno da hoće.
I didn't.	Nisam.
But he went further.	Ali otišao je dalje.
He did his job.	Radio je svoj posao.
I never would.	Nikada ne bi.
And he had.	I imao je.
Things are fine right now.	Stvari su trenutno u redu.
He wanted to know what she thought.	Želeo je da zna šta ona misli.
It was actually pretty good.	Zapravo je bilo prilično dobro.
I mean, it is.	Mislim, jeste.
It's too good to be.	Previše je dobro da bi bilo.
I wish there was more.	Voleo bih da toga ima više.
Not a little.	Ne malo.
He didn't do that.	To nije uradio.
Not sure.	Niste sigurni.
They were right.	Bili su u pravu.
I just can't.	Jednostavno ne mogu.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
If it will help us, it can help us.	Ako će nam pomoći, mogu nam pomoći.
That's okay with me.	To je u redu sa mnom.
My father bought it.	Moj otac ga je kupio.
I just tried it.	Upravo sam sada pokušao.
Do you think it is difficult to buy?	Mislite li da ga je teško kupiti?
You really don't have to do it yourself.	Zaista ne morate to sami da radite.
We don't need help.	Ne treba nam pomoć.
I made it last night.	Napravio sam sinoć.
They said that could not happen.	Rekli su da se to ne može dogoditi.
I have no idea how it works.	Nemam pojma kako to radi.
I wonder if that's true.	Pitam se da li je to istina.
Get to work now.	Odmah na posao.
I can see everything.	Mogu vidjeti sve.
There was no one to talk to.	Nije bilo s kim razgovarati.
They are there for you.	Oni su tu za vas.
I need more money.	Treba mi još novca.
I can tell what he thinks.	Mogu reći šta misli.
She said nothing.	Nije rekla ništa.
But this is not the right way to go.	Ali ovo nije pravi način zbog.
He can leave.	On može otići.
He could do anything.	Mogao je sve.
It was as usual.	Bilo je kao i obično.
Nobody said much.	Niko nije rekao mnogo.
I don't want anything.	Neće mi ništa.
Nothing, she said quickly.	Ništa, rekla je brzo.
I saw that there was.	Video sam da ima.
He said more than he wanted.	Rekao je više nego što je želio.
I'm not sure exactly.	Nisam siguran tačno.
I didn't have that much time.	Nisam imao toliko vremena.
This should not be allowed.	Ovo ne bi trebalo dozvoliti.
Your father wanted you to have this.	Tvoj otac je želio da imaš ovo.
He'll probably get a job.	Verovatno će dobiti posao.
He didn't expect that.	Nije to očekivao.
I still couldn't see her.	I dalje je nisam mogao vidjeti.
She wants to tell the truth.	Ona želi da kaže istinu.
Just tell me what you think.	Samo mi reci šta misliš.
I'm just happy to be here.	Ja sam samo sretan što sam ovdje.
I'm glad you're here with me!	Drago mi je da si ovdje sa mnom!
That was never an issue.	To nikada nije bilo pitanje.
This was a meeting.	Ovo je bio sastanak.
I want to be sure.	Želim da budem siguran.
And a little for yourself.	I malo za sebe.
But not in a good way.	Ali ne na dobar način.
But only one.	Ali samo jedan.
That could be a problem.	To bi mogao biti problem.
And yours .	I tvoj .
I've never seen this.	Nikad ovo nisam video.
Quick and easy !.	Brzo i lako!.
But we will find her.	Ali naći ćemo je.
We did that.	To smo uradili.
He had no idea.	Nije imao pojma.
But now he is gone.	Ali sada ga nema.
I have to bring her back.	Moram je vratiti.
I know why.	Znam zašto.
To know that they are not alone.	Da znaju da nisu sami.
I still can't believe it.	Još uvijek ne mogu vjerovati.
We are here.	Tu smo.
He has to do it or do nothing.	Mora to učiniti ili ne radi ništa.
A few years ago.	Još prije nekoliko godina.
He wants me.	On mene želi.
I think that can help us.	Mislim da nam to može pomoći.
Just a friend.	Samo prijatelj.
I wonder why you didn't.	Pitam se zašto nisi.
I think.	Ja mislim.
There is a lot of time !.	Ima dosta vremena!.
Obviously it is.	Očigledno jeste.
It's pretty easy to see why.	Prilično je lako vidjeti zašto.
But that is no more.	Ali toga više nema.
He knew he hadn't figured something out.	Znao je da nešto nije shvatio.
Nothing was as it was.	Ništa nije bilo kao što je bilo.
He wanted to do his job.	Želio je da radi svoj posao.
But that doesn't have to be the case.	Ali to ne mora biti tako.
It was just a question.	To je bilo samo pitanje.
And maybe no one ever told him.	A možda mu niko nikada nije rekao.
No, really, it can't be.	Ne, stvarno, ne može biti.
We can't do that here.	Ne možemo to učiniti ovdje.
I know you're a good person.	Znam da si dobra osoba.
I'm not sure.	Nisam baš siguran.
It was better, much better.	Bilo je bolje, mnogo bolje.
I'm tired of it.	Umoran sam od toga.
We'll just have to work harder.	Samo ćemo morati više da radimo.
He would come.	On bi došao.
He will go with you.	On će ići s tobom.
It's that simple.	Tako je jednostavno.
This must be found.	Ovo se mora naći.
But only for a while.	Ali samo na neko vrijeme.
He couldn't leave.	Nije mogao otići.
This one would be good.	Ovaj bi bio dobar.
When it's true.	Kada je istina.
But we could.	Ali mogli bismo.
That wasn't so bad.	To nije bilo tako loše.
I never want to go back to that life.	Nikad se ne želim vratiti u taj život.
He didn't look well.	Nije izgledao dobro.
We have a meeting next week.	Imamo sastanak sljedeće sedmice.
I didn't get it.	Nisam to shvatio.
I know it exists.	Znam da postoji.
You told us what to do.	Rekao si nam šta da radimo.
This is actually pretty easy.	Ovo je zapravo prilično lako.
You know where he is.	Znaš gdje je.
They did it.	Oni su to uradili.
Now I can.	Sada mogu.
All right with me.	U redu sa mnom.
We will never be.	Nikada nećemo biti.
This is something we really need to work on.	Ovo je nešto na čemu zaista treba da radimo.
I told you that afternoon.	Rekao sam ti to popodne.
She didn't know what they were.	Nije znala šta su.
Maybe this will help.	Možda će ovo pomoći.
He needs it badly this afternoon.	Treba mu jako danas popodne.
That happened.	To se dogodilo.
And he will.	I hoće.
We have help.	Imamo pomoć.
He knew what he would find.	Znao je šta će naći.
They can say yes or no.	Oni mogu reći da ili ne.
That's a lot of things.	To je puno stvari.
It was hard.	Bilo je, teško.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I was happy to do it.	Bio sam sretan što sam to uradio.
I thought you knew.	Mislio sam da znaš.
It wasn't much.	Nije bilo puno.
No.	Ne.
It doesn't work anymore either.	Ni to više ne radi.
I knew that.	Znao sam to.
I have no idea why he left.	Nemam pojma zašto je otišao.
I think he needs to do a little bit of that.	Mislim da to treba malo da uradi.
But there is another reason why we have to go there.	Ali postoji još jedan razlog zašto moramo ići tamo.
It's okay, you don't need it.	U redu je, ne treba ti.
Everything is going badly.	Sve ide loše.
That needs to be discussed.	O tome se mora razgovarati.
Just what it took.	Baš ono što je trebalo.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ne znam šta je bilo s njim.
It has to be talked about.	Mora se razgovarati.
He won't buy it.	On to neće kupiti.
I have something to tell you.	Imam nešto da ti kažem.
She knew the truth, but said nothing.	Znala je istinu, ali ništa nije rekla.
There is, but it is not.	Postoji, ali nije.
There was no problem.	Nije bilo problema.
None of that is.	Ništa od toga nije.
But it does the job.	Ali radi posao.
We will do that.	To ćemo uraditi.
This time will soon come.	Ovo vrijeme će uskoro doći.
I'm done with that.	Završio sam s tim.
This is something you should never do.	Ovo je nešto što nikada ne biste trebali raditi.
They could have gone home earlier.	Mogli su ranije otići kući.
That was life.	To je bio život.
This happens a lot.	Ovo se često dešava.
But from now on more than that.	Ali od sada više od toga.
Who is there? 	Ko je tamo?
But he wanted to talk about it.	Ali želio je razgovarati o tome.
Time moves on.	Vrijeme ide dalje.
Tim knew he would be back.	Tim je znao da će se vratiti.
I want to be here and now.	Želim biti ovdje i sada.
No one can be better than you.	Niko ne može biti bolji od tebe.
You know that as well as we do.	Vi to znate dobro kao i mi.
Are you sure about this?	Jeste li sigurni u ovo?
I can't stay.	Ne mogu ostati.
But there is no one there.	Ali tamo nema nikoga.
I still can.	I dalje mogu.
So it's safe.	Tako da je sigurno.
It was good for me.	Bilo je dobro za mene.
This is really, really obvious!	Ovo je zaista, zaista očigledno!
I knew exactly what to do.	Tačno sam znao šta da radim.
You can't do that.	Ne možeš to da radiš.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
I say why not.	Ja kažem zašto ne.
I have a life.	Ja imam život.
You could do anything, there.	Mogao si sve, tamo.
This can't happen.	Ovo se ne može dogoditi.
He lives here.	Ovdje živi.
That's what he wants us to do.	To je ono što on želi da uradimo.
Or he could do something.	Ili bi mogao nešto da uradi.
We will be able to see that.	Moći ćemo to vidjeti.
He didn't expect it to be that easy.	Nije očekivao da će biti tako lako.
The weather here is not bad.	Vrijeme ovdje nije loše.
I know they are there.	Znam da su tamo.
We have a problem.	Imamo problem.
He had to work for it.	Morao je da radi za to.
But maybe next time it won't be.	Ali možda sljedećeg puta neće biti.
You're not.	Nisi.
If you like it, live.	Ako ti se sviđa, živi.
Not if we can help.	Ne ako mi možemo pomoći.
There's just nothing we can do about it here.	Jednostavno ne možemo ništa uraditi s njim ovdje.
Maybe not so bad.	Možda i nije tako loše.
You will be safe here.	Ovdje ćeš biti siguran.
I didn’t know when and how it was going to happen.	Nisam znao kada i kako će se to dogoditi.
I know what's wrong with you.	Znam šta nije u redu s tobom.
I came.	Došao sam.
And a lot of that.	I mnogo toga.
I do not have it.	Nemam ga.
But we are not those people.	Ali mi nismo ti ljudi.
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
This was bad.	Ovo je bilo loše.
And never, but.	I nikad nije, ali.
Life goes on.	Život ide dalje.
And he didn't know what to do.	I nije znao šta da radi.
No one was to be seen.	Niko nije trebalo da se vidi.
We did that to ourselves many years ago.	To smo sebi uradili prije mnogo godina.
She told me everything.	Rekla mi je sve.
I won't tell anyone.	Neću nikome reći.
Yes, he was good at it.	Da, bio je dobar u tome.
And, in fact, he had a good reason.	I, u stvari, imao je dobar razlog.
But it never is.	Ali nikada nije.
He didn't expect that.	Nije to očekivao.
I loved that stuff.	Voleo sam te stvari.
And it really works.	I zaista radi.
It could be anyone.	Mogao bi biti bilo ko.
There was no way he could do that.	Ni na koji način to nije mogao učiniti.
Not much, maybe, but something.	Ne mnogo, možda, ali nešto.
It could be anything.	Može biti bilo šta.
You are not my father.	Ti nisi moj otac.
I had them.	Imao sam ih.
That was a few days ago.	To je bilo prije nekoliko dana.
Is that really what you wanted to say?	Je li to stvarno ono što si htio reći?
I would go and come back again.	Otišao bih i vratio se ponovo.
But to work.	Ali na posao.
Not us, not them.	Ne mi, ne oni.
Not so the first time.	Nije tako prvi put.
They will say no.	Oni će reći ne.
I thought people would see it.	Mislio sam da će ljudi to vidjeti.
He will have to do that.	To će morati da uradi.
It will be easy to find.	Lako će se naći.
You know you can.	Znaš da možeš.
I want to do it for myself.	Želim to učiniti za sebe.
He can do anything.	On može sve.
They both knew it.	Oboje su to znali.
Nobody does that.	Niko to ne radi.
He doesn't have himself here right now.	Ovdje trenutno nema sebe.
Maybe he gave a little more time.	Možda je dao malo više vremena.
It was bad enough that I saw it.	Bilo je dovoljno loše da sam video.
I can't tell you when.	Ne mogu ti reći kada.
That is obvious now.	To je sada očigledno.
We can help !.	Možemo pomoći!.
And the problem is that.	A problem je u tome.
He won't be back for a few days.	Neće se vratiti nekoliko dana.
Maybe you are.	Možda jesi.
She's been here before and that's all she does.	Bila je ovdje prije i samo to radi.
Nobody really works.	Niko zaista ne radi.
I'm not sure how to do that.	Nisam siguran kako to da uradim.
You told me that.	Rekao si mi to.
I'm telling you it's true.	Kažem vam da je to istina.
You never were.	Nikada nisi bio.
I had to talk.	Morao sam razgovarati.
They were probably right.	Vjerovatno su bili u pravu.
He was not and never will be.	Nije bio i nikada neće biti.
Like everyone.	Kao i svi.
But he is happy.	Ali on je sretan.
I used to do it.	Ja sam to radio.
I knew it was going to happen.	Znao sam da će se to dogoditi.
In fact, there are many.	U stvari, ima ih mnogo.
Isn't she doing well?	Zar ona ne radi dobro?
But it's true.	Ali to je istina.
This is a good thing, he told himself.	Ovo je dobra stvar, rekao je sebi.
We could talk.	Mogli smo razgovarati.
I just want you.	Ja samo tebe želim.
That's your problem, not mine.	To je tvoj problem, ne moj.
I hope he can come home soon.	Nadam se da će uskoro moći doći kući.
She says she says it's not him, but.	Kaže da ona kaže da nije on, ali.
I was sick.	Bilo mi je loše.
That would be bad for both of us.	To bi bilo loše za nas oboje.
I told him not to talk.	Rekao sam mu da ne govori.
She will never come back.	Ona se nikad neće vratiti.
Don't do that.	Ne radite to.
There is nothing to do.	Nema šta da se uradi.
You know what you need.	Znate za šta vam treba.
That's better.	Tako je bolje.
But it's really not that hard.	Ali to zaista nije tako teško.
There are few of them.	Malo ih ima.
I worked there.	Radio sam tamo.
I love you so much.	Volim te tako.
I do not want.	Ne želim.
What’s bad is that it’s hard to get.	Ono što je loše je to što ga je teško dobiti.
We don't know how bad it will be.	Ne znamo koliko će biti loše.
He doesn't know it's us.	On ne zna da smo to mi.
And that's something.	I to je nešto.
This may or may not happen.	To se može dogoditi ili ne mora.
He didn't know.	Nije znao.
So far I have had no problems.	Do sada nisam imao problema.
Which would be bad.	Što bi bilo loše.
I just had to be here.	Samo sam morao biti ovdje.
Not anymore.	Nisam više.
I was expecting this.	Očekivao sam ovo.
And nothing happened.	I ništa se nije dogodilo.
No one knows what will happen tomorrow, ever.	Niko ne zna šta će se dogoditi sutra, nikada.
That was not true.	To nije bila istina.
I want to know what's going on here.	Želim da znam šta se ovde dešava.
But she didn't say that.	Ali ona to nije rekla.
I heard it was good.	Čuo sam da je dobro.
I knew that was the reason.	Znao sam da je to razlog.
We have to be better.	Moramo biti bolji.
But there was still money there.	Ali tamo je još bilo novca.
And I really meant it.	I ja sam to stvarno mislio.
But not often.	Ali ne često.
I'm still there.	I dalje sam tamo.
Maybe he did it this year.	Možda je to uradio ove godine.
It should work.	Trebalo bi da radi.
I want to know why.	Želim da znam zašto.
I will say more.	Reći ću više.
I have to say.	Moram reći.
Apparently, they didn't have time.	Očigledno, nisu imali vremena.
There is no such thing.	Ne postoji tako nešto.
He didn't want to tell me anything.	Nije mi htio ništa reći.
As you probably do.	Kao što verovatno radite.
He was absolutely right.	Bio je potpuno u pravu.
Maybe she was right.	Možda je bila u pravu.
You want someone you like.	Želiš nekoga ko ti se sviđa.
Someone has to.	Neko mora.
Will you buy it?	Hoćeš li to kupiti?
It still is, in fact.	I dalje jeste, u stvari.
Still no one.	I dalje niko.
That's almost everyone.	To je skoro svima.
But he knew it was.	Ali znao je da jeste.
I saw him.	Vidio sam ga.
I have nothing bad to say about it.	Nemam ništa loše da kažem o tome.
It couldn't be.	Nije moglo biti.
And he seems to be right.	I izgleda da je u pravu.
You have it.	Imaš je.
I didn't even know how he felt.	Nisam ni znao kako se osjeća.
Obviously it should be.	Očigledno bi trebalo biti.
You know, just do it.	Znaš, samo uradi to.
She said okay.	Rekla je u redu.
Nobody knew anything.	Niko ništa nije znao.
I didn't want to do this.	Nisam htela ovo da uradim.
I was actually thinking about you today.	Danas sam zapravo mislio na tebe.
I was not happy.	Nije mi bilo drago.
I love having you here.	Volim da si ovde.
There is nothing more.	Ne postoji ništa više.
And it certainly is.	I sigurno jeste.
Will it rain?	Hoće li doći kiša?
But it's not.	Ali nije.
But maybe that's a good thing.	Ali možda je to dobra stvar.
It took three days.	Trebalo je tri dana.
I want what you really are.	Želim ono što zapravo jeste.
The only problem is that this is not true.	Jedini problem je što to nije istina.
And it would.	I to bi.
You can see here, here and here.	Možete vidjeti ovdje, ovdje i ovdje.
That's right, everything.	Tako je, na sve.
Like my father before me.	Kao moj otac prije mene.
There's one for you too.	Ima jedan i za tebe.
You are the first.	Prvi si.
He's been here before.	Bio je ovdje prije.
I like this a lot.	Ovo mi se mnogo sviđa.
I couldn't see who it was, but someone was there.	Nisam mogao da vidim ko je, ali neko je bio tamo.
That was it, no more.	To je bilo to, ne više.
You are, and he is not, yet.	Vi jeste, a on nije, još uvek.
And that's the problem.	I to je problem.
I would really love that.	Ja bih to zaista volio.
Probably not.	Verovatno nisi.
I didn't think it would be.	Nisam mislio da bude.
But people here don't know any better.	Ali ljudi ovdje ne znaju ništa bolje.
That happened.	To se dogodilo.
Not so this time.	Ovaj put nije tako.
And it still works.	I još uvijek radi.
They couldn't know.	Nisu mogli znati.
A lot of things.	Puno stvari.
But that's just not true.	Ali to jednostavno nije istina.
He is what he is.	On je ono što jeste.
This is certainly true.	Ovo je sigurno istina.
But no, it was real.	Ali ne, bilo je stvarno.
It's not.	Nije.
We like it.	Sviđa nam se.
Which is bad.	Što je loše.
Both good and bad of me.	I dobro i loše od mene.
It's like them.	To je kao oni.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
It won't be long.	Neće dugo.
Everything you said is true.	Sve što si rekao je istina.
And no one would buy it.	I niko to ne bi kupio.
It was really good.	Zaista je bilo dobro.
She's not good.	Ona nije dobra.
For me, but you know, not really.	Za mene, ali znaš, ne baš.
You should have seen that.	Trebalo je to vidjeti.
They were never human.	Nikada nisu bili ljudi.
I do not know who it is.	Ne znam ko je.
This is not just an idea, this is real.	Ovo nije samo ideja, ovo je stvarno.
That's a bit too much.	To je malo previše.
I can't say what.	Ne mogu reći šta.
I wish it would work for me.	Voleo bih da radi za mene.
That's my business.	To je moja stvar.
I need more money.	Treba mi još novca.
He did it.	On je to uradio.
He did it as if it was nothing to him.	Uradio je to kao da mu to nije ništa.
I can't tell anyone.	Ne mogu nikome reći.
But it's yours.	Ali tvoj je.
Is there time?	Ima li vremena?
Which probably exists.	Što vjerovatno postoji.
I know what the problem is.	Znam u čemu je problem.
I can never really find him.	Nikad ga zaista ne mogu naći.
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
I saw her, really.	Vidio sam je, zaista.
I came before you.	Došao sam prije tebe.
He's not here today.	Danas nije ovdje.
And we didn't do anything.	I nismo ništa uradili.
Or even more.	Ili čak i više.
He's fine.	On je dobro.
But he could handle it.	Ali mogao je da se nosi sa tim.
None of that was good.	Ništa od toga nije bilo dobro.
And what else.	I šta još.
And no one looked too good.	I niko nije izgledao previše dobro.
She knows everything.	Ona zna sve.
Your path is not mine.	Tvoj put nije moj.
My friend loved it.	Moj prijatelj to volio.
They are always there for me.	Uvek su tu za mene.
Maybe there is another reason.	Možda postoji još jedan razlog.
But I can tell you this.	Ali mogu ti ovo reći.
The question is why he was here.	Pitanje je zašto je bio ovdje.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
It was so real.	Bilo je tako stvarno.
He knew when he was well.	Znao je kad mu je dobro.
I'd like to see what else you have there.	Voleo bih da vidim šta još imaš tamo.
Right here at home.	Baš ovdje kod kuće.
It never was.	Nikada nije bilo.
The next day.	Sljedećeg dana.
I certainly didn't.	Ja sigurno nisam.
It was hard to leave.	Bilo je teško otići.
It must be mine.	Mora biti moj.
I think this time is good.	Mislim da je ovo vrijeme dobro.
We just don't know when he was there.	Samo ne znamo kada je bio tamo.
Will you	Hoćeš li
They wouldn't either.	Ni oni ne bi.
He got three years for it.	Dobio je tri godine za to.
I never had that.	Nikad to nisam imao.
This time they really did it to themselves.	Ovaj put su to zaista uradili sami sebi.
In fact, he was pretty right.	U stvari, bio je prilično u pravu.
Maybe to everyone who was with him.	Možda svima koji su bili sa njim.
But that is no longer the case.	Ali to više nije tako.
More than enough.	Više nego dovoljno.
That's the only reason to do it.	To je jedini razlog da to uradite.
That's the only way I can do it.	To je jedini način na koji to mogu.
It is so.	To je tako.
No one seemed safe.	Činilo se da niko nije siguran.
And maybe he lost.	I možda je izgubio.
I did not know that.	Nisam to znao.
But that is what is happening.	Ali to je ono što se dešava.
I want her here now.	Želim je ovdje odmah.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
He is my life.	On je moj život.
Really something.	Zaista nešto.
It is better to come to the meeting earlier.	Bolje je doći ranije na sastanak.
Or maybe this one.	Ili možda ovaj.
It won't be easy.	Neće biti lako.
I said again.	Ponovo sam rekao.
Neither good nor bad.	Ni dobro ni loše.
But he didn't think he would.	Ali nije mislio da hoće.
Yes, he could live here.	Da, mogao bi da živi ovde.
But you don't.	Ali ti ne.
I can help you.	Mogu ti pomoći.
We did it.	Uradili smo to.
Now do it.	Sada uradi to.
Nobody really knows.	Niko zaista ne zna.
I'll be on time, he promised.	Doći ću na vrijeme, obećao je.
I wasn't there for that.	Nisam bio tu zbog toga.
This is obviously difficult.	Ovo je očigledno teško.
He will help me.	On će mi pomoći.
So that shouldn't be a problem.	Tako da to ne bi trebao biti problem.
Who are these people?	Ko su ti ljudi?
I have to know.	Moram znati.
He couldn't say anything.	Nije mogao ništa reći.
It's okay, the man said.	U redu je, rekao je čovjek.
Where have you been?	Gdje si bio?
What he says is so true.	To što on kaže je tako istina.
And we did it.	I mi smo to uradili.
They didn't have a radio.	Nisu imali radio.
But you never know.	Ali nikad se ne zna.
This is not one.	Ovo nije jedan.
It's not as easy as it looks.	Nije tako lako kao što izgleda.
I really didn't have to.	Zaista nisam morao.
But there is a problem with that.	Ali postoji problem s tim.
It's there.	Tamo je.
It looks like rain.	Izgleda kao kiša.
Nothing will happen to you, but you have to tell me.	Ništa ti se neće dogoditi, ali moraš mi reći.
We don't even need a reason.	Ne treba nam ni razlog.
It's not what it looks like.	Nije kako izgleda.
I think he can do whatever he wants.	Mislim da može da radi šta hoće.
You just have to tell me something about yourself.	Samo mi moraš reći nešto o sebi.
Just like rain.	Baš kao kiša.
I thought you should know.	Mislio sam da bi trebao znati.
It took him longer.	Trebalo mu je više vremena.
Maybe you should go with him?	Možda bi trebao ići s njim?
But there were no people.	Ali nije bilo ljudi.
In fact, you have to work for nothing.	Zapravo, morate raditi za ništa.
I've never seen him before.	Nikad ga ranije nisam video.
More than today for some time.	Više nego danas već neko vrijeme.
And that is exactly what happened.	I upravo to se dogodilo.
But no.	Ali ne.
It's just a.	To je samo a.
There would never be time.	Nikad ne bi bilo vremena.
How are you.	Kako si.
I don't have these.	Ja nemam ove.
Good to know.	Dobro je znati.
No one should have been surprised.	Niko nije trebao biti iznenađen.
Maybe you even feel sorry for me.	Možda ti je čak i žao mene.
This was another bad deal.	Ovo je bio još jedan loš posao.
Tom was looking for a new job.	Tom je tražio novi posao.
Just for you.	Samo za tebe.
I really love him a lot.	Zaista ga mnogo volim.
Now he lives alone.	Sada živi sam.
He really couldn't.	Zaista nije mogao.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
I have to work on it.	Moram da radim na tome.
Should I.	Da li bi trebalo.
She didn't know what she was thinking.	Nije znala šta misli.
I'll tell you right away.	Reći ću ti odmah.
Please more, more.	Molim vas više, više.
I would do that too.	I ja bih to uradio.
He had to be.	Morao je biti.
That's us.	To smo mi.
What was beyond that, they had no idea.	Šta je bilo dalje od toga, nisu imali pojma.
He wasn't sure.	Nije bio siguran.
It was not certain who did it.	Nije bilo sigurno ko je to uradio.
She said yes, you can't do it alone.	Rekla je da, ne možeš sam.
I've never been so good.	Nikad mi nije tako dobro.
Someone either heard it, or they didn't.	Neko je to ili čuo, ili nije.
The problem still exists.	Problem i dalje postoji.
I know that.	Znam to.
He immediately understood this.	Odmah je shvatio ovo.
Let's do it.	Uradimo to.
That's life.	To je život.
And how much.	I koliko.
No more of you and me, from 15.09.	Nema više tebe i mene, od 15.09.
You should know something.	Trebao bi nešto znati.
You can do it from home.	Možete to učiniti od kuće.
You and she are not the first.	Ti i ona niste prvi.
But it doesn't have to be that way.	Ali ne mora biti tako.
He expected this.	Očekivao je ovo.
There are problems there.	Tu ima problema.
I was alone.	Bio sam sam.
They won't have to.	Neće morati.
I just said it first.	Samo sam prvi rekao.
I was very happy at home.	Bio sam veoma sretan kod kuće.
Yes, you can stay at home!	Da, možete ostati kod kuće!
A lot of things.	Puno stvari.
I have no idea what you would do with it at all.	Nemam pojma šta bi ti uopšte uradio sa tim.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
It wouldn't be that hard.	Ne bi bilo tako teško.
I want it.	Ja ga želim.
And you should know.	I trebao bi znati.
All the time,' he said.	Sve vrijeme', rekao je.
That's very bad.	To je jako loše.
This is for sure.	Ovo je sigurno.
She will know what we need.	Ona će znati šta nam treba.
I've never done that before.	Nikad to ranije nisam radio.
And the sooner you do it, the better.	I što prije to uradi, to bolje.
It was already time to do something.	Već je bilo vrijeme da se nešto uradi.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Ovo nije prvi put da se ovo dogodilo.
He told me he didn't know.	Rekao mi je da ne zna.
I am now going.	Idem sada.
I should have seen it earlier.	Trebao sam to vidjeti ranije.
They know what it is.	Znaju šta je to.
I never told you that.	Nikad ti to nisam rekao.
He wondered why.	Pitao se zašto.
In fact, it may be more.	U stvari, može biti više.
I knew that would be what she said.	Znao sam da će to biti ono što ona kaže.
It was good to see her.	Bilo mi je dobro vidjeti je.
But he doesn't do that.	Ali on to ne radi.
You should have.	Trebao si.
I've never been there before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio tamo.
But you have to help us.	Ali morate nam pomoći.
It couldn't be easy.	Nije moglo biti lako.
I thought.	Mislio sam.
There was no problem.	Nije bilo problema.
To be better.	Da budem bolji.
I don't want to know anything.	Ne želim ništa da znam.
But there was no help for that.	Ali nije bilo pomoći za to.
He has me there.	On me ima tamo.
Besides, he was right.	Osim toga, bio je u pravu.
That's what you want.	To je ono što i ti želiš.
Just do it.	Samo ti uradi.
I told him I liked it.	Rekla sam mu da mi se sviđa.
You don't have to be here.	Ne morate biti ovdje.
That can't happen!	To se ne može dogoditi!
It's as bad as it can be.	Loše je koliko može biti.
What's he doing?	Šta radi.
I know this is true.	Znam da je ovo tačno.
Had at home.	Imao kod kuće.
I never had a problem.	Nikada nisam imao problem.
Do these things.	Raditi ove stvari.
It seems too easy.	Čini se previše lako.
And he wouldn't have it for long.	I ne bi ga dugo imao.
Probably say no.	Verovatno reci ne.
He just was.	On je jednostavno bio.
They were just real people.	Bili su samo pravi ljudi.
But I don't think so.	Ali mislim da neće.
They will do it if they can.	Oni će to uraditi ako mogu.
That didn't happen here.	To se ovdje nije dogodilo.
I don't have that much time.	Nemam toliko vremena.
I know there are a lot of them.	Znam da ih ima dosta.
No, it's not good.	Ne, nije dobro.
They must have had time.	Mora da su imali vremena.
The truth is .	Istina je .
Say that again, please.	Reci to ponovo, molim te.
That was it for me.	To je bilo to za mene.
He did it.	Uradio to.
This should not happen.	Ovo se ne bi trebalo dogoditi.
It took me longer than that.	Trebalo mi je više vremena od toga.
But you don't look well today.	Ali danas ne izgledaš dobro.
Maybe he never really was.	Možda ga zapravo nikada nije bilo.
You couldn't help it.	Nisi mogao pomoći.
I should say.	Trebao bih reći.
We can't know the reason.	Razlog ne možemo znati.
Maybe more than a few.	Možda više od nekoliko.
They won't say they know.	Neće reći da znaju.
Obviously not.	Očigledno nije.
But this will never happen.	Ali ovo se nikada neće dogoditi.
We can't do that.	Ne možemo to da uradimo.
It must be better.	Mora biti bolje.
He was one of us.	Bio je jedan od nas.
But this is not.	Ali ovo nije.
But he left.	Ali on je otišao.
I would hear that.	Čuo bih to.
I know that, but that was not the reason.	Znam to, ali to nije bio razlog.
So far they haven't.	Do sada nisu.
Maybe, never.	Možda, nikad.
I would do that.	Ja bih to uradio.
He's gone, you can't help him anymore.	Otišao je, ne možeš mu više pomoći.
Not little by little.	Ne malo po malo.
I was both.	Bio sam oboje.
We're fine now.	Sada smo u redu.
That must be difficult.	To mora biti teško.
I did a few things.	Uradio sam nekoliko stvari.
That is not a problem here.	To ovdje nije problem.
Maybe even now I do.	Možda čak i sada to radim.
This usually happens.	To se obično dešava.
But this is us.	Ali ovo smo mi.
That's really it.	To je zaista to.
That was not a good thing.	To nije bila dobra stvar.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
Like life, nothing is certain.	Kao i život, ništa nije sigurno.
Yes, they are.	Da, i oni su.
It could be a few days.	Moglo bi biti nekoliko dana.
I know it's something.	Znam da je to nešto.
So he got a new job.	Tako je dobio novi posao.
A friend of mine told me that a few years ago.	Moj prijatelj mi je to rekao prije nekoliko godina.
We just.	Mi samo.
But there was no time.	Ali nije bilo vremena.
It wasn't too much.	Nije bilo previše.
This is a difficult question.	Ovo je teško pitanje.
I think it was real.	Mislim da je bilo stvarno.
I just had a bad day.	Samo sam imao loš dan.
What do we have here?	Šta imamo ovde?
It's all in us.	Sve je u nama.
I said.	Rekao sam.
Not true.	Nije istina.
He wanted it.	On je to želio.
Nobody knows how much.	Niko ne zna koliko.
You have time.	Imaš vremena.
It's not hard either.	Ni to nije teško.
Now she didn't know what to think.	Sada nije znala šta da misli.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
Still not.	I dalje nema.
She lives alone.	Živi sama.
But that's all for today.	Ali to je sve za danas.
And he didn't have the stuff to do it.	I nije imao stvari da to uradi.
I'm not just from you.	Nisam samo od tebe.
I can't do that.	Ja to ne mogu.
But even that won't do any good.	Ali ni to neće učiniti ništa dobro.
You are never alone.	Nikad nisi sam.
Do not speak.	Ne govori.
They still are.	I dalje su.
Yes, he said.	Da, rekao je.
They won't do anything.	Neće ništa uraditi.
We are still working on it.	Još uvijek radimo na tome.
I can't see that.	Ne mogu to vidjeti.
I do not think.	Ne mislim.
I have everything here.	Imam sve ovde.
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
I have a lot to tell you.	Imam puno toga da ti kažem.
How could this have happened.	Kako se ovo moglo dogoditi.
You seem to be doing just that.	Čini se da upravo to radite.
Love, love, love it.	Voli, voli, voli to.
I don't like it a little.	Ne sviđa mi se malo.
He didn't do any of that.	Nije uradio ništa od toga.
That, in fact, is what happened.	To je, u stvari, ono što se dogodilo.
Works or doesn't work.	Radi ili ne radi.
As long as she.	Sve dok ona.
I like it there.	Sviđa mi se tamo.
That's very good for business.	To je jako dobro za posao.
None of this is true.	Ništa od toga nije istina.
Actually it’s not strong enough.	Zapravo to nije dovoljno jako.
That's what you want.	To je ono što želiš.
This is another problem we had.	Ovo je još jedan problem koji smo imali.
There is a way to work around it.	Postoji način da se radi na tome.
It’s something we do to this day.	To je nešto što radimo do danas.
I won't tell you anymore.	Neću ti više reći.
I say, no one is sure.	Kažem, niko nije siguran.
He went back to that.	Vratio se na to.
And we are not.	A mi nismo.
They are what they have always been.	To su ono što su uvijek bili.
But he did nothing.	Ali nije ništa uradio.
But that was never, ever true.	Ali to nikada, nikada nije bila istina.
We do things that only we can do.	Radimo stvari koje samo mi možemo.
It was real.	Bilo je stvarno.
This works well.	Ovo dobro radi.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
Will you help?	Hoćeš li pomoći?
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
No, they didn't.	Ne, nisu.
We still have a way.	Još uvijek imamo put.
But you don’t have to if you don’t want to.	Ali ne morate ako ne želite.
And it's probably not going well.	I vjerovatno ne ide dobro u tome.
But for now.	Ali za sada.
It will be soon.	Uskoro će biti.
You should go.	Trebao bi ići.
I know he has it.	Znam da ga ima.
I'm better now, I'm just tired.	Sada mi je bolje, samo sam umoran.
But it doesn't work.	Ali to ne radi.
I couldn't see the road.	Nisam mogao da vidim put.
He knew this day would come and now he is there.	Znao je da će ovaj dan doći i sada je tu.
You will stay here.	Ti ćeš ostati ovdje.
That was obvious.	To je bilo očigledno.
This will not be easy.	Ovo neće biti lako.
What did she want to do with it?	Šta je htela da uradi sa tim?
You can go further.	Možete ići dalje.
I know it's hard.	Znam da je teško.
He was.	On je bio.
Maybe it was both.	Možda je bilo oboje.
Nobody can do that.	Niko to ne može.
It’s easy to see why this happened.	Lako je vidjeti zašto se to dogodilo.
And that he hadn't seen her.	I da je nije vidio.
It was so simple.	Bilo je tako jednostavno.
But we can only do that if we know.	Ali to možemo učiniti samo ako znamo.
But something like that did not happen.	Ali tako nešto se nije dogodilo.
I've never seen him.	Nikad ga nisam video.
He wanted to do more.	Želeo je da radi više.
You told us.	Rekao si nam.
But it doesn't seem to work.	Ali izgleda da ne radi.
Yes, you should.	Da, trebao bi.
He goes on to say.	Dalje kaže.
We had.	Imali smo.
I hope you would too.	Nadam se da bi i ti.
Good thing here.	Dobra stvar ovde.
Everything can be true.	Sve može biti istina.
But that's it.	Ali to je to.
Just not us.	Samo ne mi.
Pretty long, it seems.	Prilično dugo, čini se.
Do you work? 	Radiš li?
.	.
This is completely true.	Ovo je potpuno tačno.
He didn't seem to feel anything.	Činilo se da ništa ne osjeća.
And she lives.	I ona živi.
But there is no one there.	Ali tamo nema nikoga.
As far as I know.	Koliko ja znam.
I'm the only one here.	Ja sam jedini ovdje.
You can come back.	Možeš se vratiti.
There were three.	Bila su tri.
I have no time.	Nemam vremena.
I'm sure they'll see him too.	Sigurno će ga i oni vidjeti.
I'm a little tired.	Malo sam umoran.
He was ready.	Bio je spreman.
That's my real problem.	To je moj pravi problem.
They must have been alone.	Sigurno su bili sami.
And I.	I ja.
They will return.	Oni će se vratiti.
She will see for herself what happened.	Sama će vidjeti šta je bilo.
I asked what it was.	Pitao sam šta je to.
But not enough.	Ali ne dovoljno.
I hope it works.	Nadam se da radi.
I thought we would.	Mislio sam da ćemo.
But it is much better.	Ali mnogo je bolje.
Little is known about it.	Malo se zna o tome.
Maybe he'll be right.	Možda će biti u pravu.
I wondered why he asked me.	Pitao sam se zašto me je pitao.
I can't say if that's the case.	Ne mogu reći da li je to tako.
I bought it.	Kupio sam ga.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to da uradim.
We did just that.	Uradili smo upravo to.
Or he should have known.	Ili je trebao znati.
It must be true.	Mora da je istina.
She didn't say anything for a long time.	Dugo nije ništa rekla.
But not the way you think.	Ali ne na način na koji mislite.
It started right away.	Odmah je počeo.
I want you too.	Želim te previše.
She always is.	Ona je uvek.
I could never find him again.	Nikada ga više nisam mogao naći.
Sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga.
She didn't know many things.	Nije znala mnogo stvari.
It seemed too much.	Činilo se previše.
This time he is tired.	Ovaj put je umoran.
Better not, better not.	Bolje ne, bolje ne.
You've done a lot.	Uradio si dosta.
It's just one of you.	Samo je jedan od vas.
Maybe, and maybe not.	Može, a možda i ne.
Yes, it really is.	Da, zaista jeste.
Tell me this is not true.	Reci mi da ovo nije istina.
We had them there yesterday.	Imali smo ih tamo juče.
This time she was not alone.	Ovaj put nije bila sama.
Not too much, but a little.	Ne previše, ali malo.
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
That's okay.	To je u redu.
But it wasn't like that, it wasn't like that.	Ali nije bilo tako, nije bilo tako.
I want him to see me.	Želim da me vidi.
Something is obviously wrong with him.	Nešto očigledno nije u redu s njim.
Is this the right path?	Da li je ovo pravi put?
It was now.	Bilo je sada.
This is not about that.	Ovde se ne radi o tome.
So much is happening.	Toliko toga se dešava.
It was so small.	Bilo je tako malo.
We will come for you.	Doći ćemo po vas.
He expected so much.	Toliko je očekivao.
What would that be.	Šta bi to.
All right with me.	U redu sa mnom.
I don't mean anything.	Ne mislim ništa.
Or like it.	Ili se sviđa.
You can't do this anymore.	Ne možete ovo više raditi.
He knows he would lose.	Zna da bi izgubio.
Even if it's me.	Čak i ako sam to ja.
You have this.	Imaš ovo.
I wasn't even sure what to say.	Nisam ni bio siguran šta da kažem.
You won't go and give me away.	Nećeš otići i dati me.
I know we didn't do it.	Znam da to nismo uradili.
I'm going alone.	Idem sam.
I don't think this is true.	Mislim da ovo nije tačno.
No one at home but me.	Nikoga kod kuće osim mene.
Everyone knows everything.	Svi znaju sve.
And so on.	I tako da.
Just a little longer.	Samo još malo.
It's not as hard as it looks.	Nije tako teško kao što izgleda.
He never left.	Nikad nije otišao.
That's your job.	To je tvoj posao.
In fact, it can't be.	U stvari, ne može biti.
Maybe you don't like it.	Možda ti se to ne sviđa.
I can't say enough.	Ne mogu dovoljno reći.
He actually said that.	On je to zapravo rekao.
She's fine.	Ona je dobro.
In fact, no, it still exists.	Zapravo, ne, još uvijek postoji.
There is no time for any of that, now.	Nema vremena ni za šta od toga, sada.
That just has to be true.	To samo mora biti istina.
We just know it.	Mi to jednostavno znamo.
Maybe you can help.	Možda možete pomoći.
You will never find him again.	Nikad ga više nećeš naći.
They knew it.	Oni su to znali.
You know it, they know it.	Vi to znate, oni to znaju.
It's neither here nor there.	To nije ni ovdje ni tamo.
That must have been difficult.	To mora da je bilo teško.
He just couldn't.	Jednostavno nije mogao.
He loves her.	On je voli.
You will find him.	Naći ćeš ga.
I'm glad to be with you.	Drago mi je što sam s tobom.
The money arrived quickly.	Novac je stigao brzo.
It's not hard either.	Nije ni teško.
I wish you .	Želim ti .
I wouldn't know.	Ne bih znao.
But we couldn't leave.	Ali nismo mogli otići.
I'm glad for you because of that.	Drago mi je zbog tebe zbog toga.
I know it looks like that, but it's not true.	Znam da tako izgleda, ali nije istina.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati.
Yes, it is bad what happened here.	Da, loše je to što se ovdje dogodilo.
I worked for both.	Radio sam za oboje.
And no one will have to tell me.	I niko neće morati da mi kaže.
My father is back.	Moj otac se vratio.
I did not understand.	Nisam shvatio.
It shouldn't be that long.	Ne bi trebalo biti tako dugo.
And they are right.	I u pravu su.
Nobody knew about you.	Niko nije znao za tebe.
Not exactly that stuff.	Ne baš te stvari.
But she can't be right.	Ali ona ne može biti u pravu.
I didn't want to be that.	Nisam želeo da to budem.
I have nothing to do.	Nemam šta da radim.
But today is that day.	Ali danas je taj dan.
And he understood.	I on je shvatio.
It never was, it never will be.	Nikada nije bilo, nikada neće biti.
He is right.	On je u pravu.
Like you and me.	Kao ti i ja.
Not everyone.	Ne baš svima.
You don't have to say that.	Ne moraš to reći.
I don't know why that would be so.	Ne znam zašto bi to bilo tako.
He says he just can't.	Kaže da jednostavno ne može.
I have it all.	Imam sve to.
He is nothing anymore.	On više nije ništa.
We are here today.	Tu smo danas.
I still can't believe it.	Još uvijek ne mogu vjerovati.
And without that.	I bez toga.
I know that.	Znam to.
There aren't that many.	Toliko ih nema.
Went to dinner.	Otišao na večeru.
All good so far.	Sve dobro do sada.
He admitted that many things were true.	Priznao je da je mnogo toga istina.
What do you think about that?	Šta mislite o tome?
That's the problem.	To je problem.
He seemed to like it.	Činilo se da mu se to sviđa.
I have no idea why.	Nemam pojma zašto.
It was simple enough.	To je bilo dovoljno jednostavno.
I'll get to you.	Doći ću do tebe.
He was still a man.	On je još uvijek bio čovjek.
This was a problem.	Ovo je bio problem.
I'm still working on it.	Još uvijek radim na tome.
He was looking for anyone.	Tražio je bilo koga.
We can't stay.	Ne možemo ostati.
I don't want to see him again.	Ne želim ga više vidjeti.
I just work here.	Ja samo radim ovdje.
I feel sorry for you.	Žao mi je zbog tebe.
To go to work.	Da idem na posao.
I'm sure you know about that.	Siguran sam da znaš za to.
I didn't know you were here, in the house.	Nisam znao da si ovde, u kući.
It's in the house.	U kući je.
But tell me what you think!	Ali reci mi šta misliš!
He was supposed to be something.	On je trebao biti nešto.
Not just them.	Ne samo oni.
It's for him.	Za njega je.
Should we do it or not?	Da li da to uradimo ili ne.
It's just something.	To je samo nešto.
I thought you might want to know.	Mislio sam da bi želeo da znaš.
Now no one eats.	Sada niko ne jede.
I want to do something, to be someone.	Želim nešto da uradim, da budem neko.
I've seen them before.	Video sam ih ranije.
But not now.	Ali sada nije.
We didn't do anything wrong.	Nismo uradili ništa loše.
The car was still there.	Auto je još bio tamo.
There is usually not much.	Obično nema mnogo toga.
How about that.	Šta kažeš na to.
I am working on that.	Radim na tome.
Because of a lot of that.	Zbog mnogo toga.
But there is much more.	Ali tu je još mnogo toga.
You need better.	Moraš bolje.
Now she knew it wasn't going to happen.	Sada je znala da se to neće dogoditi.
Maybe it was.	Možda je bilo.
She told him.	Rekla mu je.
I wish you had come earlier.	Voleo bih da si došao ranije.
There is nothing for you here.	Ovde nema ništa za tebe.
Maybe a few here and there.	Možda nekoliko tu i tamo.
The problem is you.	Problem si ti.
I wasn't too happy.	Nisam bio previše sretan.
He knew what was happening and did nothing.	Znao je šta se dešava i ništa nije uradio.
I knew it existed.	Znao sam da postoji.
I knew he wouldn't come back.	Znao sam da se neće vratiti.
She says something.	Ona kaže nešto.
Nobody really knows.	Niko zaista ne zna.
Yes, it's not that good.	Da, nije tako dobro.
She has a job she loves.	Ona ima posao koji voli.
You can't go back.	Ne možete se više vratiti.
They won't know what you look like.	Neće znati kako izgledaš.
You're the one who did it.	Ti si taj koji si to uradio.
He had never seen him before.	Nikad ga prije nije vidio.
I'm not as afraid of you as I am of that.	Ne bojim te se toliko koliko toga.
He had no money with him.	Nije imao novca kod sebe.
I'm very glad to be here.	Veoma mi je drago što sam ovde.
He knew something.	Znao je nešto.
You're nothing without me.	Bez mene si ništa.
I know this is not going to happen.	Znam da se ovo neće dogoditi.
I can't be like them.	Ne mogu biti kao oni.
He did everything we needed to do.	Uradio je sve što smo mi trebali.
For now.	Za sada.
I can't tell anyone.	Ne mogu nikome reći.
You will be now.	Sada ćeš biti.
No, not for us.	Ne, ne za nas.
And that's enough.	I to je dovoljno.
Maybe something would happen.	Možda bi se nešto dogodilo.
What? 	Šta?
She knew what she was doing.	Znala je šta radi.
I can say that.	To mogu reći.
But it is.	Ali jeste.
What was needed.	Šta je trebalo.
He is gone today.	Danas ga nema.
She said it herself.	I sama je to rekla.
But no one knew what to do.	Ali niko nije znao šta da radi.
She has to go alone.	Mora da ide sama.
You told me that yourself.	Sam si mi to rekao.
This is a problem.	Ovo je problem.
Too many years.	Previše godina.
In fact, it often happens.	Zapravo, to se često dešava.
I would like more.	Voleo bih više.
But very good.	Ali vrlo dobro.
It's very easy to do.	To je vrlo lako uraditi.
The question is difficult.	Pitanje je teško.
He seemed to want to be me, but better.	Činilo se da želi biti ja, ali bolje.
It looks good to me.	Izgleda mi dobro.
This is all.	To je sve.
I didn't hear you.	Nisam te čuo.
I just wanted to know what was going on.	Samo sam htela da znam šta se dešava.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
Find what? 	Naći šta?
said my father.	rekao je moj otac.
Or not enough.	Ili nije dovoljno.
We must know who we really are.	Moramo znati ko smo zaista.
He didn't have to see them.	Nije morao da ih vidi.
The truth is.	Istina je.
If so, we don't have to do anything.	Ako jeste, ne moramo ništa da radimo.
Looks like you have a really good one.	Izgleda da imaš stvarno dobar.
There is something in that.	Ima nešto u tome.
You could go home.	Mogao bi ići kući.
Not until last night.	Ne do sinoć.
Are you okay?	Jesi li dobro?
We have to do it.	Moramo to da uradimo.
But no, it's not him.	Ali ne, nije on.
She is right.	Ona je u pravu.
It doesn't look real.	Ne izgleda stvarno.
Like him.	Kao i on.
For now, nothing works.	Za sada ništa ne radi.
It would be.	Bilo bi.
It took him a while.	Trebalo mu je malo vremena za sebe.
Maybe they were right.	Možda su bili u pravu.
I want to know how and why and when.	Želim da znam kako i zašto i kada.
And no, that's not a euphemism for something else.	I ne, to nije ni to.
I never would.	Nikada ne bi.
He worked a lot.	Radio je mnogo.
On this way,.	Na ovaj način,.
I'm wrong about myself.	Nisam u pravu u sebi.
He wants to see you.	On želi da te vidi.
There will come a time when you have to leave.	Doći će vrijeme kada morate otići.
This could have happened to me.	Ovo mi se moglo dogoditi.
He'll be back soon.	Uskoro će se vratiti.
Better and better.	Sve bolje i bolje.
More, more, he said.	Još, više, rekao je.
I would give my life for it.	Dao bih život za to.
Nobody knew anything, nobody saw her.	Niko ništa nije znao, niko je nije video.
Maybe so.	Možda je tako.
I love this team.	Volim ovaj tim.
I wanted money anyway.	Želeo sam novac na bilo koji način.
I really knew where they were.	Zaista sam znao gdje su.
Probably a few days.	Verovatno nekoliko dana.
Yes, it works.	Da, radi.
He knew his way.	Znao je svoj put.
It usually works.	Obično radi.
It's even better not to be.	Još bolje je ne biti.
There was plenty there.	Tamo je bilo dosta.
You can be something more.	Možeš biti nešto više.
I just couldn’t get it.	Jednostavno ga nisam mogao dobiti.
He did a lot of people.	Učinio je mnogo ljudi.
I want to be someone.	Želim da budem neko.
But not a question.	Ali ne pitanje.
Not many people are colored.	Nema mnogo ljudi u boji.
I think that says it.	Mislim da to govori.
Do it right this time.	Uradi to kako treba ovaj put.
Any day.	Bilo koji dan.
And to see them.	I da ih vidim.
But we have to.	Ali moramo.
And it works for me.	I radi za mene.
I knew the truth.	Znao sam istinu.
No one ever is.	Niko nikad nije.
Now they could certainly be right.	Sada bi sigurno mogli biti u pravu.
I hope he is right.	Nadam se da je u pravu.
We are here now.	Sada smo tu.
He's tired.	On je umoran.
I like to work around the house.	Volim raditi po kući.
You should do this now.	Ovo treba da uradite odmah.
If anything was obvious, it was.	Ako je bilo šta očigledno, to je bilo.
You don't have to do anything else.	Ne morate ništa dalje da radite.
Get away from me.	Dalje od mene.
Not just for me.	Ne samo za mene.
I'm not sure about the question.	Nisam siguran za pitanje.
There are too many people.	Previše je ljudi.
You must be tired.	Mora da si umoran.
I know he can.	Znam da može.
Yes, they certainly will.	Da, sigurno će to učiniti.
But you can have them.	Ali ti ih možeš.
I knew it would be so.	Znao sam da će biti tako.
I've never seen her before.	Nikad je ranije nisam video.
You're safe now.	Sada si siguran.
I'm sure he'll be fine.	Siguran sam da će biti dobro.
Not that he should have.	Nije da je trebao.
But no.	Ali ne .
It would be good to see you again.	Bilo bi dobro vidjeti te ponovo.
That she is good.	Da je dobra.
That's what we did.	Tako smo i uradili.
But it doesn't seem to work.	Ali izgleda da ne radi.
To do that.	Da se to uradi.
He didn't do any of that.	Nije uradio ništa od toga.
Who wouldn't?	Ko ne bi?
He said it wouldn't happen to me.	Rekao je da mi se to neće dogoditi.
You could just say you knew.	Mogao si samo reći da znaš.
I know it's not much.	Znam da nije puno.
It was very bad.	Bilo je jako loše.
I knew nothing better.	Nisam znao ništa bolje.
I have a good job.	Imam dobar posao.
And we need to know this.	I ovo moramo znati.
But it's not quite like that.	Ali nije baš tako.
That was not the reason.	To nije bio razlog.
We have to meet.	Moramo se naći.
She knew for the first time.	Znala je za prvi put.
She knew so much, and she told him so little.	Toliko je toga znala, a tako malo mu je rekla.
So it's hard to be sure of anything.	Tako da je teško biti siguran u bilo šta.
I really needed the money.	Jako mi je trebao novac.
He is what he says he is.	On je ono za koga kaže da jeste.
He was first last night.	Sinoć je bio prvi.
Why do you need to know?	Zašto moraš znati?
Not as bad as it could have been.	Nije tako loše koliko je moglo biti.
Live life.	Živi život.
But this doesn't work.	Ali ovo ne radi.
I think so.	Mislim.
But it goes beyond that.	Ali, to ide dalje od toga.
I was happy to do that.	Bio sam sretan što sam to uradio.
We can talk about anything.	Možemo razgovarati o bilo čemu.
It's happening, right now.	To se dešava, upravo sada.
No one can be sure.	Niko ne može biti siguran.
Tell him to go.	Reci mu da ode.
I didn't even have a friend.	Nisam ni imao prijatelja.
I needed someone to tell me it would be okay.	Trebao mi je neko da mi kaže da će biti u redu.
They know people will buy.	Oni znaju da će ljudi kupiti.
I want to know it will be fine.	Želim da znam da će biti dobro.
There was no time.	Nije bilo vremena.
And another, and another.	I još jedan, i još jedan.
But only a few days before him.	Ali samo nekoliko dana prije njega.
That way you will stay together.	Tako ćete ostati zajedno.
Now everything works.	Sada sve radi.
It's still going.	Još uvijek ide.
Now the question is whether they really will.	Sada je pitanje da li zaista hoće.
I do not know what it is.	Ne znam šta je to.
Three more years.	Još tri godine.
That's what you told us.	To ste nam rekli.
We don't do that.	Mi to ne radimo.
I have this.	Imam ovo.
Nothing was like before.	Ništa nije bilo kao prije.
You know very well why that is.	Znate dobro zašto je tako.
Not good.	Nije dobro.
He must be a very good friend of mine.	Mora da mi je veoma dobar prijatelj.
There was no one there.	Tamo nije bilo nikoga.
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
Yes, this is my lucky day.	Da, ovo je moj sretan dan.
Or still.	Ili još uvijek.
That's what it's about.	Radi se o tome.
I had a lot of problems with that.	Imao sam mnogo problema s tim.
We had a bit of a problem, but not really.	Imali smo malo problema, ali ne baš.
Besides, who knows?	Osim toga, ko zna?
Maybe you think it's me, and maybe you are.	Možda misliš da sam to pravi ja, a možda i jeste.
I didn't know anyone else did that.	Nisam znao da je neko to više uradio.
Not fast enough.	Nije dovoljno brzo.
The only question is how fast.	Pitanje je samo koliko brzo.
It's about what you do.	Radi se o tome šta radiš.
It's just me.	To sam samo ja.
I don't know if he's still here.	Ne znam da li je još tu.
I just want them home.	Samo ih želim kući.
But only soon.	Ali samo skoro.
Hard to know he has it.	Teško da biste znali da ga ima.
We do a lot of things together.	Radimo mnogo stvari zajedno.
I didn't say this.	Nisam ovo rekao.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
Probably not good.	Verovatno nije dobro.
When he arrived, he knew why.	Kad je stigao, znao je zašto.
You were tired.	Bio si umoran.
No, not much.	Ne, ne mnogo.
I saw it right away.	Video sam to odmah.
Not just for work, but for everyone.	Ne samo za posao, već za sve.
That's how it goes.	Tako to ide.
We had no idea what to do.	Nismo imali pojma šta da radimo.
I love what you can do.	Volim što možeš da radiš.
It was good to be tired.	Bilo je dobro biti umoran.
You work too hard.	Previše radiš.
He just didn't want to.	Jednostavno nije htio.
But there was nothing he could do.	Ali ništa nije mogao učiniti.
I came back right away.	Odmah sam se vratio.
They are there tonight.	Tamo su večeras.
Yes, that was it.	Da, to je bilo.
I'm not surprised.	Nisam iznenađen.
He will give everything he has.	On će dati sve što ima.
I told you the truth.	Rekao sam ti istinu.
And that would be three.	A to bi bila tri.
That you need this or that.	Da ti treba ovo ili ono.
As if we both knew we just had it.	Kao da smo oboje znali da ga upravo imamo.
It just takes a lot of time.	Samo treba puno vremena.
We are still working on it.	Još radimo na tome.
This doesn't look right.	Ovo ne izgleda u redu.
And they couldn't.	I nisu mogli.
It can still be done.	Još uvijek se može.
It will continue to be so.	Tako će i dalje biti.
I'm sure he would.	Siguran sam da bi.
Few of us are enough.	Malo nas je dovoljno.
That's what he thought.	Tako je mislio.
She knew she didn't want to.	Znala je da to ne želi.
If you did, you were fine.	Ako si to uradio, bio si u redu.
It will happen.	To će se dogoditi.
It just isn't.	Jednostavno nije.
It should be easy.	Trebalo bi biti lako.
What.	Šta.
As they say.	Kako se to kaže.
I think something is wrong.	Mislim da nešto nije u redu.
I was myself.	Bio sam svoj.
He knew everything and nothing.	Znao je sve i ništa.
I know it looks like a lot.	Znam da izgleda puno.
This is enough.	Ovo je dosta.
I began to doubt myself.	Počeo sam da sumnjam u sebe.
He was surprised.	Bio je iznenađen.
Surely you can do better than that.	Sigurno možeš i bolje od toga.
He didn't even do that.	Čak ni to nije uradio.
He knows his way around.	Zna svoj put.
And he lives by it.	I živi po tome.
This time it would happen.	Ovaj put bi se to dogodilo.
Always has been, always will be.	Uvijek je bilo, uvijek će biti.
It's both for me.	Za mene je oboje.
This time it's just me.	Ovaj put sam samo ja.
That's just not good enough.	To jednostavno nije dovoljno dobro.
We said that.	Rekli smo to.
I wish you had this.	Voleo bih da imaš ovo.
That should help him a little.	To bi mu trebalo malo pomoći.
Something is wrong here.	Nešto tu nije u redu.
Nobody asked me that.	To me niko nije pitao.
That was the only way.	To je bio jedini način.
He's probably right.	Verovatno je u pravu.
I want him to do it.	Želim da to uradi.
I know a lot of people.	Znam dosta ljudi.
He must have known that.	Mora da je to znao.
That's us.	To smo mi.
You brought me back to life.	Vratio si me u život.
So never.	Tako da nikad.
Not really, it's not.	Zapravo ne, nije.
This can be anything.	Ovo može biti bilo šta.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
I always do.	Ja uvijek .
I think it's him.	Mislim da je to on.
He is so.	On je tako.
I can do it, no problem.	Mogu ja to, nema problema.
He told me he loved me.	Rekao mi je da me voli.
Or maybe you don't know.	Ili možda ne znaš.
All he has to do is tell the truth.	Sve što treba da uradi je da kaže istinu.
Okay, he told no one.	Dobro, rekao je nikome.
He will come after me.	Doći će za mnom.
But now you know it's not that easy.	Ali sada znate da to nije tako lako.
You had to do what you did.	Morao si da uradiš ono što si uradio.
I didn't like to tell you.	Nisam volio da ti kažem.
But we have and we can.	Ali imamo i možemo.
It’s something we do.	To je nešto što radimo.
I love it!.	Volim to!.
He went to the door.	Otišao je do vrata.
Even he is.	Čak i on jeste.
I wasn’t sure whether to tell him that or not.	Nisam bio siguran da li da mu to kažem ili ne.
It was good enough.	Bilo je dovoljno dobro.
I can't say anything yet.	Ne mogu još ništa reći.
I know that very well.	Znam to vrlo dobro.
You know you shouldn't be here.	Znaš da ne bi trebao biti ovdje.
But it was just a game.	Ali to je bila samo igra.
There are still problems.	I dalje ima problema.
And so it can be.	I tako može biti.
But he heard me.	Ali on me je čuo.
I'm still working.	I dalje radim.
I never heard again.	Nisam više čuo.
But it doesn't look like that now.	Ali sada ne izgleda tako.
I just don't know about it.	Samo ne znam o tome.
You're the only one who couldn't.	Ti si jedini koji nije mogao.
This must be good.	Ovo mora da je dobro.
That is indeed so.	To je zaista tako.
The only way.	Jedini način.
He really didn't expect that.	On to zaista nije očekivao.
This is the only way.	Ovo je jedini put.
He works for me.	On radi za mene.
Only, he didn't have enough time.	Samo, nije imao dovoljno vremena.
I really wish there was a way to do this.	Zaista bih volio da postoji način da se ovo uradi.
You shouldn't have gone either.	Ni ti nisi trebao ići.
He lost that one.	Izgubio je taj.
And it's not.	I nije.
Do everything you can for him.	Uradite sve što možete za njega.
If so, you would know.	Da jeste, znali biste.
You can buy them.	Možete ih kupiti.
So three weeks have passed.	Tako su prošle tri sedmice.
I'm glad for that.	Drago mi je zbog toga.
She will go with us.	Ona će ići sa nama.
No, it won't.	Ne, neće.
I think it was just me.	Mislim da sam to bio samo ja.
I'm not sure who said that first.	Nisam siguran ko je to prvi rekao.
Maybe someone knows more.	Možda neko zna više.
I started to think she didn't want to.	Počeo sam da mislim da nije htela.
And that was three days ago.	A to je bilo prije tri dana.
He decided he had to leave.	Odlučio je da mora otići.
I've never seen it before.	Nikada ranije nisam video.
Maybe it was a lot or a little.	Možda je bilo mnogo ili malo.
Now he.	Sada on.
Something would happen instantly.	Nešto bi se trenutno dogodilo.
She said that.	Ona je to rekla.
He hopes to find a better job.	Nada se da će naći bolji posao.
You will find a way.	Naći ćeš put.
They were already there.	Oni su već bili tamo.
He's there.	On je tamo.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Ne želi da priča o tome.
Tell me what you can do.	Reci mi šta možeš da uradiš.
He will be here for a long time.	On će biti ovde još dugo.
It's happening.	To se dešava.
It’s something you want to work on.	To je nešto na čemu želite raditi.
He's tired and not very well.	Umoran je i nije baš dobro.
Neither do we.	Ni mi.
Not much.	Ne baš mnogo.
I still haven’t worked with him much.	Još uvijek nisam puno radio s njim.
But maybe you can help me.	Ali možda mi možeš pomoći.
Besides, she was fine.	Osim toga, bila je dobro.
Let's do it now.	Uradimo to sada.
And it happens.	I to se dešava.
I'm not sorry about that.	Nije mi žao zbog toga.
That was enough for now.	Za sada je to bilo dovoljno.
None of that.	Ništa od toga.
Like us.	Kao i mi.
I have to go home.	Moram da idem kući.
Like there's something wrong with me.	Kao da nešto nije u redu sa mnom.
For this day.	Za ovaj dan.
That's just not enough time.	To jednostavno nije dovoljno vremena.
I ask him if he can come.	Pitam ga da li može da dođe.
I don't know what to do now.	Ne znam šta da radim sada.
I had no idea what it was.	Nisam imao pojma šta je to.
Nobody asked.	Niko nije pitao.
He wished she wouldn't.	Želio je da ona to ne učini.
We knew better.	Znali smo bolje.
Everyone can see him here.	Ovdje ga svi mogu vidjeti.
You can be sure she will get the job.	Možete biti sigurni da će ona dobiti posao.
I had to do everything myself.	Sve sam morao sam.
He said nothing more and shouldn't have.	Ništa više nije rekao i nije trebao.
It's not right to do that.	Nije u redu to raditi.
I doubt this.	Sumnjam u ovo.
We did very well.	Uradili smo jako dobro.
And it works really well.	I radi jako dobro.
Let me tell him how he is at home.	Da mu kažem kako je kod kuće.
We don't know what it is.	Ne znamo šta je to.
But you did.	Ali jesi.
Have fun! 	Zabavi se!
We only have today.	Imamo samo danas.
But are they really.	Ali da li su zaista.
Which was bad.	Što je bilo loše.
That was never true.	To nikada nije bila istina.
I'm better.	Bolji ja.
It's been like that for a few days.	Tako je nekoliko dana.
They don't know how.	Ne znaju kako.
There was a lot to see.	Bilo je mnogo toga za vidjeti.
Yes, it's fine.	Da, u redu je.
Nothing more than that.	Ništa više od toga.
He told me he loved me and that he went to work.	Rekao mi je da me voli i da je otišao na posao.
He can't get a job.	Ne može dobiti posao.
A good thing is really good.	Dobra stvar je zaista dobra.
I know what she wants.	Znam šta ona želi.
I've been there many times.	Bio sam tamo mnogo puta.
I love them.	Volim ih.
You are what you are and that's it.	Ti si ono što jesi i to je to.
I do not know.	Ja ne znam.
This will always be you.	Ovo ćeš uvek biti ti.
And she loves him.	I voli ga.
I had to hurry.	Morao sam brzo.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ne znam šta je sa mnom.
Nothing more can be said.	Ništa se više ne može reći.
Not much time.	Nema puno vremena.
Quick about it, will you?	Brzo o tome, hoćeš li?
He said he didn't do it.	Rekao je da to nije uradio.
I'm glad he's not in it.	Drago mi je da nije u tome.
I think I Love You.	Mislim da te volim.
I think that's really it.	Mislim da je to zaista to.
I didn't see any of that.	Nisam vidio ništa od toga.
I love that one too.	I ja volim taj.
He was not there.	On nije bio tamo.
For one day.	Za jedan dan.
He came ready.	Došao je spreman.
He wanted to.	Želio je da hoće.
I wish they knew that.	Voleo bih da to znaju.
I didn’t expect that to happen.	Nisam očekivao da će se to dogoditi.
This was a good idea.	Ovo je bila dobra ideja.
Besides, he knew that couldn't be true.	Osim toga, znao je da to ne može biti istina.
It is something that will stay with us.	To je nešto što će ostati sa nama.
It's just us.	To smo samo mi.
He wouldn't come back.	Ne bi se vratio.
I loved that he was with us.	Voleo sam da je sa nama.
Too much, maybe.	Previše, možda.
We know that's not true.	Znamo da to nije istina.
He knew who was talking.	Znao je ko govori.
Which we do.	Što i radimo.
We could say.	Mogli bismo reći.
Not for the first time.	Ne prvi put.
, not me.	, ne ja.
That's enough to ask.	To je dovoljno da pitam.
To be clear, none of us really work.	Da se zna, niko od nas zaista ne radi.
Not a car.	Ne auto.
Everyone is fine.	Svi su u redu.
Not bad.	Nije loše.
They were really right.	Zaista su bili u pravu.
He's just better than me today.	Samo je bolji od mene danas.
He had a lot of friends.	Imao je puno prijatelja.
I just finished it myself.	Upravo sam ga sam završio.
With much more.	Sa mnogo više toga.
Just because of that.	Samo zbog toga.
You will be too.	I ti ćeš biti.
He won't be back.	Neće se vratiti.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
I hope you can help me.	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći.
But it happens.	Ali to se dešava.
I didn't have a team.	Nisam imao tim.
But it happened.	Ali to se dogodilo.
I was ready to do something.	Bio sam spreman da uradim nešto.
I said something.	Rekao sam nešto.
If you have something to say, tell me.	Ako imaš nešto da kažeš, reci mi.
Maybe, just maybe.	Možda, samo možda.
We didn't need that.	To nam nije trebalo.
Really, you shouldn't.	Zaista, ne bi trebao.
I love doing it.	Volim to raditi.
I am yours, you are mine.	Ja sam tvoj, ti si moj.
But he's not here right now, and you are.	Ali on trenutno nije ovdje, a ti jesi.
I didn't want that.	Nisam to htio.
And he still didn't want to come back.	I još se nije želio vratiti.
That is not enough.	To nije dovoljno.
I'm moving fast.	Brzo idem dalje.
No need to believe.	Ne treba vjerovati.
I'm never too tired.	Nikad nisam previše umoran.
I shouldn't have said that.	Nisam to trebao reći.
And now she knew what they were.	A sada je znala šta su.
This cannot be done.	Ovo se ne može uraditi.
I could never see that.	Nikad to nisam mogao vidjeti.
It's actually very simple.	To je zapravo vrlo jednostavno.
You're just working for me.	Samo radiš za mene.
Nothing was wrong.	Ništa nije bilo u redu.
That should be easy to do.	To bi trebalo biti lako uraditi.
No one could do that.	Niko to nije mogao.
It was simple, but good.	Bilo je jednostavno, ali dobro.
It's pretty simple.	Prilično je jednostavno.
Which is pretty simple.	Što je prilično jednostavno.
I love it love it.	Volim to volim.
I am glad if you can help me.	Drago mi je ako mi možete pomoći.
But it's still there.	Ali još uvek je tu.
That was not easy to say.	To nije bilo lako reći.
But they were there for more than that.	Ali oni su bili tu zbog više od toga.
She's wrong.	Ona nije u pravu.
This has never been a problem for us.	Ovo nam nikada nije bio problem.
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
I'm not good at being alone.	Nisam dobar u tome da budem sam.
Do.	Da li.
I had no idea how to say anything real.	Nisam imao pojma kako da kažem bilo šta stvarno.
I hope it will be of help to you !.	Nadam se da će vam biti od pomoći!.
It just happens.	To se jednostavno dešava.
I hope you get this soon.	Nadam se da ćete ovo uskoro dobiti.
Everything happens so fast here.	Ovde se sve dešava tako brzo.
But it's a really bad job.	Ali, to je zaista loš posao.
And they told us.	I rekli su nam.
A long time ago.	Prije mnogo vremena.
So go for it.	Tako da ide na to.
That's exactly what happened here.	Upravo to se dogodilo ovdje.
I hope your day is going well.	Nadam se da ti dan ide dobro.
This was not good.	Ovo nije bilo dobro.
I saw her do it.	Video sam je kako to radi.
He did it.	Uradio je to.
I won't be a problem.	Neću biti problema.
They were still there.	I dalje su bili tamo.
And they don't know who we are.	A oni ne znaju ko smo mi.
Which works well.	Što radi dobro.
I couldn't believe it when she told me.	Nisam mogao vjerovati kad mi je rekla.
I don't want him.	Ne želim ga.
I really understood.	Stvarno sam shvatio.
As if nothing had happened.	Kao da se ništa nije dogodilo.
And it often is.	I često je tako.
Not without telling him everything.	Ne bez da mu kažem sve.
But he had to.	Ali morao je.
I don't think that would happen today.	Mislim da se to danas ne bi dogodilo.
In three days.	Za tri dana.
I didn't get to go because of the weather.	Nisam stigao da idem zbog vremena.
But they are not the only ones.	Ali oni nisu jedini.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
She said so.	Ona je tako rekla.
Now, your father.	Sada, tvoj otac.
I saw her do it.	Video sam je kako to radi.
I think you're really ready.	Mislim da li si zaista spreman.
Or with me.	Ili sa mnom.
But he said none of that.	Ali on nije rekao ništa od toga.
It's really simple.	Stvarno je jednostavno.
It needs to work.	Treba raditi.
This is simply not true.	Ovo jednostavno nije tačno.
Nobody wants this.	Niko ne želi ovo.
We shouldn't have done that.	Nismo trebali to da uradimo.
I knew he would.	Znao sam da hoće.
They've been there before.	Bili su tamo ranije.
And that would be him.	I to bi on.
There was someone else in the house.	Bio je još neko u kući.
You can’t both be right.	Ne možete oboje biti u pravu.
I see a problem.	Vidim problem.
Nothing works here.	Ovdje ništa ne radi.
You never know.	Nikad se ne zna.
I have it here.	Imam ga ovde.
It only exists here.	Postoji samo ovdje.
She knew she couldn't.	Znala je da ne može.
I really tried.	Zaista sam pokušao.
He will never return.	Nikad se neće vratiti.
He wouldn't do something like that.	On ne bi uradio tako nešto.
She must have been.	Mora da je bila.
I saw them, but not today.	Video sam ih, ali ne danas.
He's just a.	On je samo a.
It's true.	To je istina.
I often heard him say that.	Često sam ga čuo kako to govori.
There were too many people.	Bilo je previše ljudi.
It's not about that.	Ne radi se o tome.
So far they have not done so.	Do sada to nisu uradili.
There may be another problem.	Možda postoji još jedan problem.
But very good.	Ali vrlo dobro.
He never got beyond that.	Nikada nije stigao dalje od toga.
We were fine.	Bili smo dobro.
That could never happen.	To se nikada ne bi moglo dogoditi.
You should be too.	I ti bi trebao biti.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
No one could tell.	Niko nije mogao reći.
He was busy.	Bio je zauzet.
And it's not good.	I nije dobro.
I had no idea how and when we would return.	Nisam imao pojma kako i kada ćemo se vratiti.
I have one now.	Sada imam jedan.
Could it have been them? 	Da li su to mogli biti oni?
he wondered.	pitao se on.
I know too many things.	Znam previše stvari.
Or a better life.	Ili bolji život.
And it wasn't because of me.	I to nije bilo zbog mene.
He is really happy there.	On je zaista sretan tamo.
He won't drive anything anymore.	Neće više ništa da vozi.
The man was surprised.	Čovjek je bio iznenađen.
I don't know when or how or why.	Ne znam ni kada ni kako ni zašto.
I can't give them away.	Ne mogu ih dati.
And we would, if it wasn't.	I mi bismo, da nije.
The job has to speak for itself.	Posao mora da govori sam za sebe.
And you weren't there this morning.	A jutros te još uvijek nije bilo.
And maybe it will be this year as well.	A možda će biti i ove godine.
And we're pretty sure he will.	I prilično smo sigurni da hoće.
He.	On.
Who doesn't love him.	Ko ga ne voli.
I'm so tired.	Tako sam umoran.
That's how it is.	Tako je to.
It's been a long time.	To je dugo vremena.
If not, that's the real problem.	Ako nije, to je pravi problem.
But that was just three days ago.	Ali to je bilo prije samo tri dana.
They know for themselves.	Oni znaju za sebe.
He wanted to do this alone.	Želio je ovo da uradi sam.
He realized what he had done.	Shvatio je šta je uradio.
I want that.	Ja to želim.
I never was and never will be.	Nikad nisam bio i nikada neću biti.
You were right.	Bio si u pravu.
I can do it myself.	Mogu i sam.
He knew how to do it well.	Znao je to dobro da uradi.
He can't do anything.	Ne može ništa da uradi.
I shouldn't do this.	Ne bih trebao ovo da radim.
I can't help you.	Ne mogu ti pomoći.
I'm really afraid not.	Zaista se bojim da ne.
We did it together.	Zajedno smo to uradili.
But it probably does.	Ali vjerovatno ima.
But I couldn't.	Ali nisam mogao.
I didn't get it.	Nisam to shvatio.
It didn’t just happen.	Nije se jednostavno dogodilo.
I'm doing something.	Radim nešto.
Or maybe it's just not for you.	Ili možda jednostavno nije za tebe.
She knew what she meant.	Znala je šta želi reći.
And who might not even believe me.	A ko mi možda neće ni vjerovati.
I know a lot of people want them back.	Znam da ih mnogo ljudi želi vratiti.
But that it is so simple.	Ali da je to tako jednostavno.
But this is not.	Ali ovo je ne.
It wasn't hard for him.	Nije mu bilo teško.
Okay, that's who.	Dobro, to je ko.
Does he even know about.	Da li on uopšte zna za.
And it won't be.	I neće biti.
It's very simple, really.	Vrlo je jednostavno, zaista.
But no one tried to do that.	Ali niko to nije pokušao da uradi.
It was nothing.	Nije bilo ni po čemu.
I work from home.	Radim kod kuće.
I wouldn't tell anyone why.	Ne bi nikome rekla zašto.
I think everyone should too!.	Mislim da bi i svi trebali!.
I just asked.	Samo sam pitao.
Say what you think.	Reci šta misliš.
It still works.	I dalje radi.
I see.	Vidim.
He said he needed a lot of time.	Rekao je da mu treba dosta vremena.
There was no need to say anything.	Nije trebalo ništa reći.
He drives.	On vozi.
That's exactly what he thought.	To je upravo ono što je on mislio.
It wasn't hard.	Nije bilo teško.
I never understood.	Nikad nisam shvatio.
He saw it working and wondered how.	Vidio je da radi i pitao se kako.
So far he wasn't very sure.	Do sada nije bio baš siguran.
I have my way.	Ja imam svoj način.
Like her.	Kao i ona.
I didn't start that way, you know.	Nisam tako počeo, znaš.
I like what he just wants to do.	Sviđa mi se što on samo želi da radi.
You think.	Ti misliš.
Maybe that will help.	Možda će to pomoći.
That may not be true.	To ne može biti tačno.
How much is this?	Koliko je ovo?
No, we didn't.	Ne, nismo.
Oh my.	O moj.
I know it can't be easy.	Znam da ne može biti lako.
That is so true.	To je tako istina.
You were a real friend.	Bio si pravi prijatelj.
I didn't even see him.	Nisam ga ni vidio.
I know enough.	Znam dovoljno.
Do everything right.	Uradite sve kako treba.
He didn't expect that.	Nije to očekivao.
This is me.	Ovo sam ja.
I hope it helps.	Nadam se da će pomoći.
Everything you need is there.	Sve što vam treba je tu.
How many are not.	Koliko ih nije.
I'm still scared.	I dalje se bojim.
The weather is always good.	Vrijeme je uvijek dobro.
I have my life and that is more than enough.	Imam svoj život i to je više nego dovoljno.
It was a very good day.	Bio je to jako dobar dan.
Very very.	Veoma veoma.
He'll tell you.	Reći će ti.
I'm my boyfriend now.	Sada sam svoj momak.
It's very simple.	Vrlo je jednostavno.
Tell yourself.	Reci sebi.
He just loved to play.	Jednostavno je volio da se igra.
He couldn't help it.	Nije mogao pomoći.
I was not happy.	Nisam bio sretan.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
Something you need to know.	Nešto što treba da znaš.
You can do it your way.	To možete učiniti na svoj način.
Really very busy.	Zaista veoma zauzet.
You were helpful.	Bio si od pomoći.
But it was also time for him to leave.	Ali bilo je i vrijeme da on ode.
You're so right.	Toliko si u pravu.
Everything seemed to be getting better.	Činilo se da je sve bolje.
This is not all.	Ovo nije sve.
It was a day for that.	Bio je to dan za to.
He had me.	Imao je mene.
Yes, this is fine with me.	Da, ovo je u redu sa mnom.
I tried several times.	Pokušao sam nekoliko puta.
And that's my problem.	I tu je moj problem.
But I won't.	Ali neću.
I'm not sure what's waiting.	Nisam baš siguran šta čeka.
Maybe even better.	Možda čak i bolje.
It's a really bad job.	To je stvarno loš posao.
He wasn't so sure of himself.	Nije bio tako siguran u sebe.
This is not going to happen.	Ovo se neće dogoditi.
It could have reached him.	Moglo je doći do njega.
Why don't you do it again?	Zašto to ne uradite ponovo?
But today it is not easy.	Ali danas to nije lako.
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
I've seen this a lot.	Vidio sam ovo mnogo.
And he was a good friend.	I bio je dobar prijatelj.
That would be bad.	To bi bilo loše.
Something not so good is happening to him.	Nešto ne baš dobro mu se dešava.
This is my father.	Ovo je moj otac.
But they know.	Ali oni znaju.
But he would have none of that.	Ali on ne bi imao ništa od toga.
He was just a problem.	On je samo bio problem.
Money speaks.	Novac govori.
I told you the truth.	Rekao sam ti istinu.
But not fast enough.	Ali ne dovoljno brzo.
They just didn’t have time for us.	Jednostavno nisu imali vremena za nas.
I'm thinking of you.	Mislim na vas.
Tell me this.	Reci mi ovo.
It could still happen.	I dalje bi se moglo dogoditi.
This or nothing.	Ovo ili ništa.
And even this was never certain.	A čak ni ovo nikada nije bilo sigurno.
And he tells it like it is.	I on to kaže kako jeste.
He should have just said that.	Trebao je to samo reći.
Both.	Oboje.
He's been here a long time.	Bio je ovdje dugo vremena.
I'm sure I'm a good friend.	Siguran sam da sam dobar prijatelj.
I went back to work.	Vratio sam se na posao.
Someone has to know.	Neko mora znati.
She is something more.	Ona je nešto više.
She is a good person.	Ona je dobra osoba.
Too much to do.	Previše toga za uraditi.
It carries us.	To nas nosi.
He's pretty good at it.	Prilično je dobar u tome.
It shouldn't be that hard.	Ne bi trebalo biti tako teško.
There was really nothing they could do for him.	Zaista nisu mogli ništa učiniti za njega.
Your life was so safe.	Tvoj život je bio tako siguran.
She wasn't alone, she said.	Nije bila sama, rekla je.
None of this is a problem.	Ništa od toga nije problem.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
That shouldn't be a problem.	To ne bi trebao biti problem.
He did such a good job.	Uradio je tako dobar posao.
It can't be anymore.	Ne može biti više.
Yes, there is a problem.	Da, tu je problem.
She will let you have enough of them.	Ona će ti dozvoliti da ih imaš dovoljno.
This time it wasn't bad.	Ovaj put nije bilo loše.
Does not work.	Ne radi.
No one could really help me with that.	Niko mi zaista nije mogao pomoći u tome.
I'm so sorry about that.	Jako mi je žao zbog toga.
I've done it before.	Radio sam to ranije.
None of that.	Ništa od toga.
No one came to see what was happening.	Niko nije došao da vidi šta se dešava.
It took me a long time.	Trebalo mi je dosta vremena.
It's better without it.	Bolje je bez toga.
She can help here.	Ona može pomoći ovdje.
We know each other well.	Znamo se dobro.
Maybe you are.	Možda jesi.
You probably don't know.	Verovatno ne znaš.
But you better do it fast.	Ali bolje da to uradite brzo.
Still and still.	I dalje i dalje.
The question is how to do it.	Pitanje je kako to učiniti.
I would do more.	Uradio bih više.
No, it wasn't good.	Ne, nije bilo dobro.
This is going to be hard, but there are some	Ovo će biti teško, ali ima ih
I just wasn’t ready.	Jednostavno nisam bio spreman.
And we need more of that.	I treba nam više toga.
No.	Neću.
But not everything is so simple.	Ali nije sve tako jednostavno.
You'll probably be fine.	Vjerovatno ćeš biti dobro.
He won't be in the house.	Neće biti u kući.
I'm going for it now.	Idem odmah na to.
I’ve seen this before, but that was many years ago.	Ovo sam već vidio, ali to je bilo prije mnogo godina.
That's not it either.	Ni to nije to.
I don't know what will happen.	Ne znam šta će se dogoditi.
I’m not saying any of that is wrong.	Ne kažem da ništa od toga nije u redu.
I was there, you know.	Bio sam tamo, znaš.
Nobody works.	Niko ne radi.
I didn't hear that.	Nisam to čuo.
I've been.	Bio sam.
We should work on that.	Trebali bismo raditi na tome.
He wasn't sure who she was.	Nije bio siguran koja je ona.
You have to be good at it.	Moraš biti dobar u tome.
We were not allowed to do this 90 years ago.	Prije 90 godina nam nije bilo dozvoljeno.
I never did.	Nikad nisam.
I mean, people aren't sure.	Mislim, ljudi nisu sigurni.
It hasn't been that long.	Nije je bilo toliko godina.
But it's not that.	Ali nije to.
But the truth is that everything is going badly.	Ali istina je da sve ide loše.
Really? 	Zaista?
This is what we know for sure.	To je ono što sigurno znamo.
I knew he was right.	Znao sam da je u pravu.
He couldn't leave.	Nije mogao otići.
I know people know.	Znam da ljudi znaju.
He knew immediately that he was at home.	Odmah je znao da je kod kuće.
But only to myself.	Ali samo sebi.
I tried, you know.	Pokušao sam, znaš.
That will be enough for now.	To će biti dovoljno za sada.
How could he know?	Kako je mogao znati?
No, no, they won't.	Ne, ne, neće.
Or maybe it's not for you.	Ili možda nije za tebe.
He didn't say that.	On to nije rekao.
This is already happening.	Ovo se već dešava.
None of us can.	Niko od nas ne može.
Except no one knew when it would be.	Osim što niko nije znao kada će to biti.
His life seemed to return.	Činilo se da mu se život vratio.
I don't want to do these things.	Ne želim da radim ove stvari.
It's a really good thing, really, really good.	To je stvarno dobra stvar, stvarno, stvarno dobra.
They are not and never will be.	Nisu i nikada neće biti.
See what's going on.	Vidi šta se dešava.
But just so you know, it won't be me.	Ali, samo da se zna, to neću biti ja.
Everyone was here.	Svi su bili ovde.
He could not give him what he asked for.	Nije mu mogao dati ono što je tražio.
You're welcome.	Nema na čemu.
All this takes time.	Za sve ovo treba vremena.
But there is a reason why they are no more.	Ali postoji razlog zašto ih više nema.
I still want it.	I dalje to želim.
There is a lot to know.	Ima dosta toga da se zna.
He did it.	On je to uradio.
I had them both.	Imao sam ih oboje.
This was real.	Ovo je bilo stvarno.
Any at all.	Uopšte bilo koji.
You think it's a game.	Misliš da je to igra.
I can't do this.	Ne mogu ovo da uradim.
But only if you want to.	Ali samo ako to želiš.
I didn't ask for this.	Nisam tražio ovo.
Yes, a few times.	Da, nekoliko puta.
There wasn't much.	Nije bilo puno toga.
He didn't seem to want to talk about it.	Činilo se da nije želio razgovarati o tome.
Everyone can see that.	To svi mogu vidjeti.
They knew something he didn't know, something about themselves.	Znali su nešto što on nije znao, nešto o sebi.
See what we can do.	Vidi šta možemo da uradimo.
That was not good.	To nije bilo dobro.
And he saw what he expected.	I video šta je očekivao.
I love that car.	Volim taj auto.
That's my job.	To je moj posao.
I want to say something.	Želim nešto reći.
Maybe, maybe we could.	Možda, možda bismo mogli.
This was true.	Ovo je bila istina.
I just needed you to know.	Samo sam trebao da znaš.
He doesn't have time either.	Ni on nema vremena.
I can't say.	Ne mogu reći.
I'm going to him.	idem kod njega.
He should never have won and he knows it.	Nikada nije trebao pobijediti i on to zna.
That's what she says.	To je ono što ona kaže.
You never came back to me.	Nikad mi se nisi vratio.
That will be enough.	To će biti dovoljno.
I didn't ask him about it.	Nisam ga pitao o tome.
You will never find him.	Nikad ga nećeš naći.
You need to know that for sure.	Morate to sigurno znati.
Probably bad.	Verovatno je loše.
Not now.	Sada nije.
He must know.	Mora da zna.
You don't have to work anymore.	Ne moraš više da radiš.
But not like before.	Ali ne kao prije.
We could all do that.	Svi bismo to mogli.
Yes, it's true.	Da, istina je.
I got it.	Ja sam shvatio.
You know there is a very good reason for this.	Znate da postoji veoma dobar razlog za ovo.
And you have to work.	I ti moraš da radiš.
I had to find him.	Morao sam ga naći.
That was easy to get.	To je bilo lako dobiti.
I don't want to do that.	Ne želim to da radim.
And you would be right, there weren't many of them.	I bili biste u pravu, nije ih bilo mnogo.
I'll go there tonight.	Otići ću tamo večeras.
I have no idea how it happened, but it did.	Nemam pojma kako se to dogodilo, ali jeste.
Maybe it would be okay.	Možda bi bilo u redu.
Maybe we could stay there.	Možda bismo mogli ostati tamo.
But he is right.	Ali on je u pravu.
.	.
Today it is.	Danas jeste.
Like my friend.	Kao moj prijatelj.
You've been here before, haven't you?	Bili ste ovdje prije, zar ne?
I wondered what the problem was.	Pitao sam se u čemu je problem.
There must be more to it.	Mora biti više toga.
All or nothing, he said.	Sve ili ništa, rekao je.
I had no idea what to think.	Nisam imao pojma šta da mislim.
He knows you're not what he wants.	On zna da nisi ono što želi.
Just what can happen.	Samo šta se može dogoditi.
And she tells it like it is.	I ona to kaže kako jeste.
It will happen.	To će se dogoditi.
There is so much to do.	Ima toliko toga da se uradi.
I know this works.	Znam da ovo radi.
But please just do this for me.	Ali molim te samo uradi ovo za mene.
He saw what happened.	Video je šta se dogodilo.
I'm sorry.	Žao mi je.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
That's really good to see.	To je zaista dobro vidjeti.
Maybe he loves you very much.	Možda te mnogo voli.
Besides, there was more to it than that.	Osim toga, bilo je više od toga.
Please tell me.	Molim te reci mi.
You could talk to him.	Mogao bi razgovarati s njim.
That would be difficult.	To bi bilo teško.
Neither do they.	Ni oni.
I must have done something right.	Mora da sam uradio nešto kako treba.
It's you.	To si ti.
They never told me.	Nikad mi nisu rekli.
But they are not for me.	Ali nisu za mene.
I want to go.	Želim ići.
But he didn't get it.	Ali on to nije dobio.
But this never happens.	Ali ovo se nikada ne dešava.
And you.	I ti si.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?	Jeste li sigurni da znate šta radite?
I couldn't reach him.	Nisam mogao doći do njega.
It's all over now.	Sada je sve.
And it never did.	I nikad nije.
But something seemed wrong with him.	Ali činilo se da nešto nije u redu s njim.
I have a lot of things.	Imam puno stvari.
They know all about it.	Oni znaju sve o tome.
I really like to go.	Mnogo volim da idem.
He was only thirty years old.	Imao je samo trideset godina.
We can't say we'll ever see it.	Ne možemo reći da ćemo to ikada vidjeti.
That cannot be true.	To ne može biti istina.
You can tell me anything.	Možeš mi reći bilo šta.
I didn't know if you were coming.	Nisam znao da li ćeš doći.
I do not want anything.	Ne želim ništa.
If I could bring that day back.	Kad bih mogao vratiti taj dan.
I can do this for you.	Mogu ovo da uradim za tebe.
I will not tell you.	Neću ti reći.
This time he did not return.	Ovaj put se nije vratio.
I know he's right.	Znam da je u pravu.
It's hard to do everything.	Teško je sve uraditi.
I mean, you even think what he thinks.	Mislim, ti čak misliš šta on misli.
I think it is.	Mislim da je.
There are actually few of them.	Malo ih je zapravo.
He asked where they were.	Pitao je gdje su.
It’s hard to tell if you’re not there.	Teško je reći ako niste tamo.
I don't have any of that.	Nemam ništa od toga.
I wasn't ready for this.	Nisam bio spreman za ovo.
I told him we needed more money.	Rekao sam mu da nam treba još novca.
He tried but didn't know how to help us.	Pokušao ali nije znao kako da nam pomogne.
They shouldn't be.	Ne bi trebali biti.
That's the reason.	To je razlog.
In fact, it is very simple.	Zapravo, vrlo je jednostavno.
It's not.	Nije.
It’s something we do.	To je nešto što radimo.
To be seen.	Da se vidi.
Yes you are.	Da si .
He doesn’t seem to feel the time going on.	Čini se da ne osjeća da vrijeme ide dalje.
But we can no longer be sure.	Ali više ne možemo biti sigurni.
We had everything we needed and more than that.	Imali smo sve što nam je trebalo i više od toga.
I want to say that time goes on.	Želim reći da vrijeme ide dalje.
He was now the man of the house.	On je sada bio čovjek u kući.
This is a game.	Ovo je igra.
He still could.	I dalje je mogao.
It is better to say that it never happened.	Bolje je reći da se to nikada nije dogodilo.
It hasn't been three years.	Nije je bilo tri godine.
He works for both of us.	On radi za nas oboje.
Maybe there is a way.	Možda postoji način.
Left in the afternoon.	Otišao popodne.
But maybe it is.	Ali možda i jeste.
We're fine now.	Sada smo u redu.
I asked for help.	Tražio sam pomoć.
I just wanted to be sure.	Samo sam htio biti siguran.
I really think this is the only way.	Zaista mislim da je ovo jedini način.
It's already happening.	To se već dešava.
And that seems to be it.	I čini se da je to to.
You said you were sure.	Rekao si da si siguran.
I know it's real.	Znam da je stvarno.
He says to do it, but not tomorrow.	Kaže da uradi to, ali ne sutra.
I don't know how it happened.	Ne znam kako se to dogodilo.
He has a lot of money	Ima puno novca
It doesn't get any better than that.	Ne može biti bolje od toga.
It's just not me.	Samo nisam ja.
We really need to talk.	Zaista moramo razgovarati.
Not bad either looks.	Nije loše ni izgleda.
And it's just you.	A ti si samo .
If you want fast, we will fast.	Ako želite brzo, mi ćemo brzo.
Something is obviously wrong.	Nešto očigledno nije u redu.
There must be something.	Sigurno nešto ima.
But you did.	Ali jesi.
But money was still a problem.	Ali novac je i dalje bio problem.
Maybe too much.	Možda previše.
I'm not sure what will happen.	Nisam siguran šta će biti.
I will tell you.	Reći ću ti.
How she knew she didn't know.	Kako je znala nije znala.
But he couldn't get it there either.	Ali ni tamo ga nije mogao dobiti.
He doesn't seem to know how to drive.	Izgleda da ne zna da vozi.
None of us can go home now.	Niko od nas sada ne može kući.
What did you say?	Šta si rekao?
I love wearing it.	Volim da ga imam na sebi.
I guess it's this one.	Pretpostavljam da je ovaj.
He never returned it.	Nikada ga nije vratio.
Please tell me now.	Molim te reci mi sada.
help! 	pomoć!
I have no idea what the problem is here.	Nemam pojma šta je ovde problem.
That's how he did it.	Tako je on to uradio.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
Or still on it.	Ili još uvijek na tome.
You were safe, very safe.	Bio si siguran, vrlo siguran.
He didn't know what.	Nije znao šta.
But there is only so much we can do.	Ali postoji samo toliko toga što možemo učiniti.
I still couldn’t believe it was happening.	Još uvijek nisam mogao vjerovati da se to dešava.
He doesn't seem to be afraid.	Čini se da se ne boji.
It's just me here.	Ovdje sam samo ja.
When did that happen?	Kada se to dogodilo?
She will be fine now.	Sada će biti dobro.
I was pretty sure everyone knew.	Bio sam prilično siguran da svi znaju.
More than surprised.	Više nego iznenađen.
It does not say that both must be true.	Ne kaže da oboje mora biti tačno.
But he wasn't so sure.	Ali nije bio tako siguran.
No one would ever give me a job again.	Niko mi više nikad ne bi dao posao.
I was fine.	Bilo mi je dobro.
He's not going to work.	Ne ide na posao.
Everything would be fine.	Sve bi bilo u redu.
Maybe I did better to think that about myself.	Možda sam bolje uradio da sam to mislio o sebi.
It was hard, but it could.	Bilo je teško, ali moglo je.
And it works.	I to radi.
And it's good for business.	A dobro je i za posao.
It does not exist.	Ne postoji.
It worked well for a while.	Dobro je radio neko vrijeme.
He knows something.	On zna nešto.
I'm not that good at it.	Nisam tako dobar u tome.
I work often.	Često radim.
Another is gone.	Još jedan je otišao.
He came for me.	Došao je po mene.
Tell me something else.	Reci mi još nešto.
I won't be there.	Neću biti tamo.
He can say what he wants.	Može da kaže šta hoće.
He's really bad.	On je stvarno loš.
That's what you tell yourself.	To je ono što kažeš sebi.
And maybe he will.	A možda i hoće.
If you don't want to do that.	Ako to ne želite da uradite.
Everyone is safe.	Svi su sigurni.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
No one ever asked for them.	Niko ih nikada nije tražio.
Those who know what's going on and can tell me.	Oni koji znaju šta se dešava i mogu mi reći.
I didn't know what to do.	Nisam znao šta da radim.
I will not say.	Neću reći.
But it is enough.	Ali dovoljno je.
We don't need more.	Ne treba nam više.
There is something you should know.	Ima nešto što bi trebalo da znaš.
I got lost here too.	I ja sam se izgubio ovde.
It's simple.	To je jednostavno.
I thought it was something like that.	Mislio sam da je tako nešto.
So it is here.	Tako je i ovdje.
It's not there.	Nije tamo.
Nobody really knows what to do.	Niko zaista ne zna šta da radi.
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
I would do that.	Ja bih to uradio.
None of that happened.	Ništa od toga se nije dogodilo.
He tells me everything.	On mi sve govori.
You were absolutely right to ask for those things.	Bio si potpuno u pravu što si tražio te stvari.
But not this.	Ali ne ovo.
So we can't say it's nothing.	Tako da ne možemo reći da nije ništa.
I guess you want something from me.	Pretpostavljam da nešto želiš od mene.
Which he was.	Koji je bio.
None of us did.	Niko od nas nije.
And you have to be.	I to moraš biti.
And so on.	I tako dalje.
I've seen him before.	Video sam ga ranije.
I haven't seen much.	Nisam mnogo vidio.
I knew something was wrong.	Znao sam da nešto nije u redu.
Any of us would.	Bilo ko od nas bi.
So we needed them all.	Tako da su nam svi trebali.
I like to be at home.	Volim biti kod kuće.
He was just wondering how she was doing.	Samo se pitao kako je.
Probably not that good.	Verovatno nije tako dobro.
Just be.	Jednostavno biti.
I'm not the only one who thinks so.	To ne mislim samo ja.
And that's exactly what they did.	I upravo su to uradili.
I don't know now.	Ne znam sada.
It's hard to know.	Teško je znati.
But you just don’t know until you know.	Ali ti jednostavno ne znaš, dok ne znaš.
I wasn't very happy.	Nisam bio baš sretan.
I saw her.	Video sam je.
That's right.	Tako je.
No, not you.	Ne, ne ti.
If not, who knows.	Ako ne, ko zna.
Indeed, it is.	Zaista, jeste.
But he didn't tell anyone why.	Ali nikome nije rekao zašto.
That's the way.	To je put.
It used to be that way.	Nekada nije bilo tako.
He was very busy.	Bio je veoma zauzet.
He did it for himself.	On je to napravio za sebe.
Who and more.	Ko i više.
But in one way it is.	Ali na jedan način jeste.
But we don't do that.	Ali mi to ne radimo.
But it's not.	Ali to nije.
There aren't too many of them.	Previše ih nema.
That's what his father tried to tell him.	To mu je otac pokušao reći.
You know, like mine.	Znaš, kao moj.
He says what he knows.	On govori šta zna.
The question is when.	Pitanje je kada.
I'll tell you what we're doing here.	Reći ću vam šta mi radimo ovde.
But they did nothing about it.	Ali nisu ništa uradili s tim.
And you probably wouldn't ask for it.	I vjerovatno ga ne bi tražio.
I know what you would do.	Znam šta bi uradio.
You have to stay.	Moraš ostati.
It's not enough.	Nije dovoljno.
We all need that.	To nam svima treba.
And that will be it.	I to će biti to.
Nothing was needed.	Ništa nije trebalo.
She didn't say much.	Nije rekla puno.
But we didn't.	Ali nismo.
For now, it is.	Za sada, to je.
I have nothing for you.	Nemam ništa za tebe.
It's been a long time.	To je dugo vremena.
In no way, not at any time.	Ni na koji način, ni u bilo koje vrijeme.
Neither is she, really.	Nije ni ona, zaista.
A little more.	Malo više.
He did it three times.	Uradio je to tri puta.
Who speaks?	Ko govori?
He seemed to be his friend.	Činilo se da mu je bio prijatelj.
That was not enough for me, ever.	To mi nije bilo dovoljno, nikad.
We just don’t work that way.	Mi jednostavno ne radimo na taj način.
He came back again.	Ponovo se vratio.
It's not that easy.	Nije tako lako.
It works now.	Sada radi.
But how? 	Ali kako?
Maybe he doesn't see anything.	Možda ne vidi ništa.
We did both.	Uradili smo oboje.
I knew that.	Znao sam to.
But that would not be so easy.	Ali to ne bi bilo tako lako.
Please don't him please don't him.	Molim te nemoj njega molim te nemoj njega.
Where have you been? 	Gdje si bio?
And when it works, it works.	I kada radi, radi.
I see this happening more and more.	Vidim da se to dešava sve više i više.
It didn't happen that way.	Nije se to tako dogodilo.
Enough to see.	Dovoljno da vidi.
I don’t know how that’s going to happen.	Ne znam kako će se to dogoditi.
I do not know.	Ne znam.
It has to be more than that.	Mora biti više od toga.
But even if it is true.	Ali čak i da je istina.
Now he doesn't want to play at all.	Sada uopšte ne želi da igra.
And it was small.	I bilo je malo.
He seemed to be right about that, too.	Činilo se da je i u tome bio u pravu.
If they ever were.	Ako su ikada bili.
I went back to school today.	Danas sam se vratio u školu.
The team can't.	Tim ne može.
But this is more than that.	Ali ovo je nešto više od toga.
And that could be true.	I to bi moglo biti tačno.
He did it several times.	Uradio to nekoliko puta.
They will always be there.	Oni će uvijek biti tu.
I really don’t think of it that way.	Zaista ne mislim o tome tako.
He got nothing.	Nije dobio ništa.
You did it.	Ti si to uradio.
You're too good a guy not to.	Previše si dobar momak da ne bi.
Maybe this will help.	Možda će ovo pomoći.
I knew you had to come back.	Znao sam da se moraš vratiti.
Do it better if you can.	Uradi to bolje ako možeš.
She's waiting.	Ona čeka.
I better not say anything.	Bolje da ne kažem ništa.
And just like that, he never came back.	I samo tako, nikad se nije vratio.
U.	U.
That's a very good idea.	To je jako dobra ideja.
He knew she didn't have to do that.	Znao je da ona to ne mora učiniti.
He did nothing.	Nije uradio ništa.
She thinks something is wrong.	Ona misli da nešto nije u redu.
It should be.	Trebao bi biti.
There was always something.	Nešto je uvek bilo.
He could do it.	On je to mogao.
More than we ever had.	Više nego što smo ikada imali.
I didn't get the job because of it.	Nisam dobio posao zbog toga.
That's what we know now, everyone.	To je ono što mi sada znamo, svi.
That's what it is.	To je što je.
He was surprised to see him.	Bio je iznenađen kad ga je vidio.
He must be right.	Mora da je u pravu.
I want everything.	Želim sve.
He is happy, even if he says no.	Sretan je, čak i ako kaže da nije.
He was fine the day before.	Bio je dobro dan ranije.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.	Ne zna se šta bi mu se moglo dogoditi.
But he didn't do it often.	Ali nije to radio često.
I see why he loves them.	Vidim zašto ih voli.
Yes, we need that.	Da, to nam treba.
I told him, but good.	Rekao sam mu, ali dobro.
We had a good day.	Imali smo dobar dan.
But that was not enough.	Ali toga je bilo malo.
They can do things.	Oni mogu raditi stvari.
None of us could live without you now.	Niko od nas sada ne bi mogao da živi bez tebe.
It still is.	Još uvek je.
Dan lives another day.	Dan živi još jedan dan.
I don't mean that.	Ne mislim to.
I want to know what's going on next.	Želim da znam šta se dalje dešava.
It was much more than that.	Bilo je mnogo više od toga.
That was really about it.	To je zaista bilo o tome.
It won't be.	Neće biti.
Where he went.	Gdje je otišao.
That's what you do.	To je ono što radite.
He didn't seem sure how to deal with it.	Činilo se da nije siguran kako da se nosi s tim.
I'll go alone.	Ići ću sam.
He was mine.	Bio je moj.
You don't have to do that.	Ne treba to raditi.
That's the reason, she's where she is today.	To je razlog, ona je tu gdje je danas.
That would be very bad.	To bi bilo jako loše.
And he saw it happening and did nothing.	I on je vidio da se to dešava i nije učinio ništa.
I just need to know what it is.	Samo moram znati šta je to.
Everyone is here!	Svi su ovdje!
Is anyone there?	Ima li nekoga tamo?
But not just for me.	Ali ne samo za mene.
He saw it right here.	Video je upravo ovdje.
He wondered about it.	Pitao se o tome.
We are still working.	I dalje radimo.
I mean, he's a friend too.	Mislim, on je i prijatelj.
But they shouldn't have been.	Ali nisu trebali biti.
He heard nothing.	Nije čuo ništa.
That is not enough.	To nije dovoljno.
He doesn't really do these things alone.	On zapravo ne radi ove stvari sam.
Not yet.	Ne još.
Or what you want.	Ili šta želite.
I really had no idea what that could be.	Zaista nisam imao pojma šta bi to moglo biti.
We will win easily.	Lako ćemo pobijediti.
But now he has done nothing to do it.	Ali sada nije učinio ništa da to učini.
He just told you.	Upravo ti je rekao.
One and only.	Jedan i jedini.
I want you now.	Želim te sada.
I wonder when he will return home.	Pitam se kada će se vratiti kući.
They didn't have time.	Nisu imali vremena.
I was sure of it.	Bio sam siguran u to.
I'm telling you, it was hard.	Kažem ti, bilo je teško.
And yes, it was.	I da, bilo je.
We could talk about anything together.	Mogli bismo zajedno razgovarati o bilo čemu.
There was no time.	Nije bilo vremena.
But that is not a problem now.	Ali to sada nije problem.
He wasn't sure what to do next.	Nije bio siguran kako dalje.
Time is money.	Vrijeme je novac.
I'm fine with that.	Dobro sam s tim.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I wasn't ready to go.	Nisam bio spreman da idem.
You tell us.	Ti nam reci.
Maybe that was it.	Možda je to bilo to.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
I know that's not good.	Znam da to nije dobro.
It will never be so bad.	Nikada neće biti tako loše.
She wouldn't say either.	Ni ona ne bi rekla.
Why are there so many.	Zašto ih ima toliko.
It can't be helped.	Ne može se pomoći.
Are you still.	Jesi li još uvijek.
Probably more than that.	Verovatno je i više od toga.
There was much more here.	Ovdje je bilo mnogo više.
It is not entirely true.	Potpuno nije istina.
She can't be.	Ona ne može biti.
In fact, it could be so bad.	Zapravo, moglo bi biti tako loše.
Maybe that's what it's about.	Možda se o tome radi.
Will you help with that?	Hoćeš li pomoći s tim?
I thought there must be something ‘wrong’ with me.	Mislio sam da mora da nešto 'nije u redu' sa mnom.
Just a few days ago.	Prije samo nekoliko dana.
This if very often a problem.	Ovo ako je vrlo često problem.
You should be too.	I ti bi trebao biti.
And this is not the way.	A ovo nije način.
It was never true.	Nikada nije bila istina.
Are you okay.	Da li si dobro.
Why do you think this happened?	Što mislite zašto se to dogodilo?
She's wrong.	Ona nije u pravu.
He seemed to be saying that.	Činilo se da to govori.
Certainly not.	Sigurno nije.
That won't happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
That's not my problem.	To nije moj problem.
We don't know how.	Ne znamo kako.
I have a question.	Imam pitanje.
They had a reason.	Imali su razlog.
I thought it could be yours.	Mislio sam da bi mogao biti tvoj.
You are a person.	Ti si osoba.
I like that about you.	Sviđa mi se to kod tebe.
I have to go to work.	Moram ići na posao.
She didn't say why.	Nije rekla zašto.
How long he would stay there, no one knew.	Koliko će dugo ostati tamo, niko nije znao.
I could never do that again.	Nikad to više ne bih mogao.
I say, this doesn't look good.	Kažem, ovo ne izgleda dobro.
If she wants it.	Ako ona to želi.
Really, really bad.	Zaista, jako loše.
Will you be here next week?	Hoćeš li biti ovdje sljedeće sedmice?
I knew it was a problem.	Znao sam da je problem.
He didn't have much to do.	Nije imao mnogo toga da uradi.
We would be further away from you.	Bili bismo dalje od tebe.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Tačno sam znao šta želi.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
She has nothing.	Ona nema ništa.
It was hard to know what it was about.	Bilo je teško znati o čemu se radi.
And it took us a long time to do this.	I nama je trebalo dosta vremena da radimo ovo.
But he went beyond that.	Ali on je otišao dalje od toga.
For me, it has it all.	Za mene to ima sve.
I almost didn't.	Skoro da nisam.
I'll help myself.	Pomoći ću sebi.
It's totally fine.	Potpuno je u redu.
That's what you told me.	To si mi rekao.
It couldn't have been better for him.	Nije moglo biti bolje za njega.
That's what he loved to do.	To je volio da radi.
I don't know which is which.	Ne znam koji je koji.
There are a lot of people.	Ima mnogo ljudi.
Yes they are.	Da oni su.
I wouldn't say how.	Ne bi rekao kako.
I don't do that.	Ja to ne radim.
He couldn't go on.	Nije mogao dalje.
He doesn't know what's going on.	On ne zna šta se dešava.
I'm fine.	Dobro sam.
I was there for that.	Bio sam tamo zbog toga.
We are such a good team.	Tako smo dobar tim.
There you can get what you want.	Tamo možete dobiti šta želite.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Možda je to dobra stvar.
But no one could do anything yet.	Ali niko još ništa nije mogao učiniti.
She was like.	Bila je kao.
But not so much.	Ali ne toliko.
I know, but the question is why.	Znam, ali pitanje je zašto.
Only you could do that for me.	Samo ti bi to mogao uraditi za mene.
But don't tell me that.	Ali nemoj mi to reći.
Not when he came back now.	Ne kada se sada vratio.
He didn't want her to know.	Nije želio da ona zna.
It shouldn't take much.	Ne bi trebalo mnogo.
They said it wasn't a problem.	Rekli su da nije problem.
It looks like rain.	Izgleda kao kiša.
I want to know.	Želim da znam.
I haven't seen it yet.	Nisam to još vidio.
I don't want to be there.	Ne želim biti tamo.
This can be so.	Ovo može biti tako.
And often so.	I često je tako.
I heard it was very good.	Čuo sam da je jako dobro.
Both.	Oboje.
I just wouldn't.	Jednostavno ne bi.
You're right.	Ti si u pravu.
But you know how it is.	Ali znaš kako je.
But he was not home for a long time.	Ali dugo nije bio kod kuće.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Nisam baš siguran kako to učiniti.
Even how they did it.	Čak i kako su to uradili.
It wasn't for me.	Nije bilo za mene.
Something he would never do.	Nešto što nikada ne bi uradio.
Do you need more?	Treba li ti još?
But there is more.	Ali, ima još toga.
I mean, good.	Mislim, dobar.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Ništa, ništa, ništa.
I think he likes the idea.	Mislim da mu se sviđa ideja.
Not bad so far.	Nije loše do sada.
And they didn't.	I nisu.
And there are a lot of things about it.	I ima puno stvari o tome.
He must have known.	Mora da je znao.
They didn't.	Nisu.
In fact, I’ve never seen him talk so much.	Zapravo, nikad ga nisam vidio da priča toliko.
I could come back maybe tonight.	Mogao bih se vratiti možda večeras.
And say so.	I reci tako.
You should now.	Trebalo bi sada.
It may be that there is a.	Može biti da postoji a.
But no, that wasn't right.	Ali ne, to nije bilo u redu.
We couldn't talk about it.	Nismo mogli o tome razgovarati.
But they couldn't help it.	Ali nisu mogli pomoći.
Do you know how many people live here?	Znate li koliko ljudi živi ovdje?
And this is fine.	I ovo je u redu.
I mean, it certainly is.	Mislim, sigurno jeste.
There's a lot to come.	Ima dosta toga da dođe.
You told me that earlier.	Rekao si mi to ranije.
Bad is good.	Loše je dobro.
None of that.	Ništa od toga.
Something bad happened.	Nešto loše se dogodilo.
I couldn't, not like him.	Nisam mogao, ne kao on.
They said they would be back tonight.	Rekli su da će se vratiti večeras.
What if.	Šta ako.
I mean this.	Mislim na ovo.
Not as it happens.	Ne kao što se dešava.
I wish he was still here.	Voleo bih da je još uvek ovde.
It took a long time.	Trebalo je dosta vremena.
It's hard to believe.	Teško je vjerovati.
He loved his money.	Voleo je svoj novac.
But she wouldn't.	Ali ona ne bi.
He is very busy and has no time for this.	Veoma je zauzet i nema vremena za ovo.
I'm telling you now.	Kažem ti sada.
Or maybe you just don't know what's next.	Ili možda jednostavno ne znate šta dalje.
But that's not right.	Ali to nije u redu.
I can see everything.	Mogu da vidim sve.
None of us knew what was going on.	Niko od nas nije znao šta se dešava.
I told you this afternoon.	Rekao sam ti danas popodne.
It's easy at home.	Kod kuće je to lako.
Please do it.	Molim te uradi to.
And yes, you can.	I da, možeš.
Or what he didn't do.	Ili šta nije uradio.
It will definitely happen.	Sigurno će se dogoditi.
How long have you been planning this?	Koliko dugo planira ovo?
He told me exactly how he was going to do it.	Tačno mi je rekao kako će to uraditi.
She was a person.	Ona je bila osoba.
We are not.	Nismo.
Which isn't bad, but it's not good either.	Što nije loše, ali nije ni dobro.
Really.	Zaista.
I'm really tired today.	Danas sam stvarno umoran.
But u !!!.	Ali u !!!.
It was good to know exactly who would come after me.	Bilo je dobro znati tačno ko će doći za mnom.
And you should see her here.	I trebao bi je vidjeti ovdje.
He could have.	Mogao je i da jeste.
Only money works.	Samo novac radi.
He couldn't believe he said that.	Nije mogao vjerovati da je to rekao.
I thought for sure.	Mislio sigurno.
This is so simple.	Ovo je tako jednostavno.
Or you could stay where you are.	Ili biste mogli ostati tamo gdje jeste.
That is completely true.	To je potpuno tačno.
I mean, you know.	Mislim, znaš.
It was hard for me.	Bilo mi je teško.
How he loved them.	Kako ih je volio.
She's been here before.	Bila je ovdje prije.
It's here.	To je ovdje.
Nobody knows.	Niko ne zna.
She has to be who she is now.	Ona mora biti ono što je sada.
We have to work now.	Moramo da radimo sada.
Maybe none of that happened.	Možda se ništa od toga nije dogodilo.
I don't want to go there.	Ne želim da idem tamo.
I think that is unlikely.	Mislim da je to malo vjerovatno.
It was fast and it should be fast.	Bilo je brzo i trebalo bi da bude brzo.
That's probably fast enough.	To je vjerovatno dovoljno brzo.
That's just the truth.	To je samo istina.
I hope yours has too !.	Nadam se da i tvoj ima!.
I really like it.	Stvarno mi se sviđa.
He would have her.	Imao bi je.
I have a problem.	Imam problema.
That is currently true.	To je trenutno tačno.
I don't want you.	Ne želim te.
But only for today.	Ali samo za danas.
That is exactly what happened.	Upravo to se dogodilo.
I hope it gets better.	Nadam se da će biti bolje.
You are one.	Ti si jedan.
Can you give me some money?	Možete li mi dati nešto novca?
You look much better.	Izgledaš mnogo bolje.
He wanted to know why.	Želio je znati zašto.
What's next?	Šta će biti sljedeće?
Never heard of him.	Nikad čuo za njega.
Almost no one knew about you.	Skoro niko nije znao za tebe.
I mean, you don't have to say anything.	Mislim, ne moraš ništa da kažeš.
Now everyone knows.	Sada svi znaju.
You must look like one now.	Sada sigurno izgledaš kao jedan.
But no one really wants that.	Ali to zapravo niko ne želi.
Or even better.	Ili još bolje.
If he wants to talk, he can be the first.	Ako želi da priča, može prvi.
It was a job.	To je bio posao.
I don't want you to do anything for me.	Ne želim da uradiš ništa za mene.
I heard them.	Čuo sam ih.
It's easy to do.	Lako je to uraditi.
And now there is.	A sada ima.
You can do it now.	Možete to učiniti sada.
The first day was good.	Prvi dan je bio dobar.
He's a bad man.	On je loš čovjek.
Which it certainly isn't.	Što sigurno nije.
I was good at it.	Bio sam dobar u tome.
If they had them.	Ako su ih imali.
Yes, that's right.	Da, tako je.
I know you want to say.	Znam da želiš da kažeš.
It's still you.	I dalje si ti.
I had this.	Imao sam ovo.
I've always loved her.	Uvek sam je voleo.
I've never done that.	Nikada to nisam radio.
He had done it before.	Radio je to i ranije.
It was even good.	Čak je bilo dobro.
It never works.	Nikada ne radi.
any of you	bilo ko od vas?
I thought we had.	Mislio sam da imamo.
You've been here a long time.	Dugo ste tu.
No, not really.	Ne, ne baš.
I shouldn't have gone to see him.	Nisam trebao ići da ga vidim.
Maybe they don't know.	Možda i ne znaju.
Maybe you too.	Možda i ti.
And maybe it exists.	A možda i postoji.
I'm sure it is.	Siguran sam da jeste.
You are the first in such a long, long time.	Ti si prvi u tako dugo, dugo vremena.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
We will never always be right.	Nikada nećemo uvek biti u pravu.
That was for me.	To je bilo za mene.
I just want to believe they know better.	Samo želim vjerovati da znaju bolje.
I didn't tell anyone.	Nisam nikome rekao.
Where do you want to go?	Gdje želiš ići?
I'm not sure that's true.	Nisam siguran da je to istina.
Usually not much.	Obično nije mnogo.
He did it.	On je to uradio.
I can't not.	Ne mogu ne.
You certainly don't know that.	Vi to sigurno ne znate.
And there is not only what to say, there is when to say it.	I ne postoji samo šta da se kaže, postoji i kada se to kaže.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
Why, she didn't know.	Zašto, nije znala.
I'm sure you can do it.	Siguran sam da ti to možeš.
She knew what was there.	Znala je šta je tamo.
But he couldn't.	Ali nije mogao.
I can't talk to him.	Ne mogu razgovarati s njim.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
But not just this.	Ali ne samo ovo.
No, it wasn't.	Ne, nije to bio.
I won't tell anyone who you are.	Neću nikome reći ko si.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
There is no time now.	Sada nema vremena.
What would you do?	Šta bi ti uradio.
That will happen to us.	To će nam se dogoditi.
It's like everything.	To je kao sve.
It was fine.	Bilo je u redu.
But that's not true, not anymore.	Ali to nije istina, ne više.
You never saw that.	To nikad nisi video.
This one works.	Ovaj radi.
It was more than that.	Bilo je više od toga.
If only he could see.	Kad bi samo mogao vidjeti.
It was a game.	To je bila igra.
We don't have to talk.	Ne moramo razgovarati.
That's more so.	To je više tako.
Probably is.	Verovatno jeste.
I had to.	Morao sam.
Not only that, but he's not sorry.	Ne samo to, nego mu nije žao.
Not really, she said.	Ne baš, rekla je.
He knew what he was doing.	Znao je šta radi.
You had .	Imali ste .
I had to be something more.	Morao sam biti nešto više.
But don't tell me.	Ali nemoj mi reći.
Someone is absolutely right.	Neko potpuno u pravu.
There were none.	Nije ih bilo.
So there's always that.	Tako da uvek postoji to.
But it wasn't this.	Ali to nije bilo ovo.
If someone asked for help, anywhere, they got it immediately.	Ako je neko tražio pomoć, bilo gdje, odmah je dobio.
But he never speaks.	Ali nikad ne govori.
I couldn't allow that.	Nisam to mogao dozvoliti.
We will too.	I mi ćemo.
She said no.	Rekla je da nije.
There's a lot going on here.	Ovdje se dešava mnogo stvari.
Nobody said anything good.	Niko nije rekao ništa dobro.
Yes, we know about that.	Da, znamo za to.
No need to know.	Ne treba znati.
You should.	Morao bi.
But even that will not be enough.	Ali ni to neće biti dovoljno.
It just doesn't seem right to me.	Jednostavno mi se ne čini u redu.
You can do it again.	Možeš to ponovo.
This is just one.	Ovo je samo jedan.
He shouldn't have been here.	Nije trebao biti ovdje.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
He was supposed to do it.	On je to trebao da uradi.
I thought maybe he knew something.	Mislio sam da možda nešto zna.
I do not need.	Ne treba mi.
It's hard to say.	Teško se može reći.
That was not a problem.	To nije bio problem.
Not much.	Nije mnogo.
I want it to be real.	Želim da bude stvarno.
And she loves her job.	I ona voli svoj posao.
Actually, really good.	Zapravo, stvarno dobro.
Not all, probably.	Ne sve, vjerovatno.
I can't talk to it.	Ne mogu razgovarati s tim.
New car.	Novi auto.
She was good at it.	Bila je dobra u tome.
The only thing is.	Jedina stvar je.
Either you can or you can't.	Ili možeš ili ne možeš.
It's all or nothing.	To je sve ili ništa.
I hope nothing is wrong.	Nadam se da ništa nije u redu.
I want to.	Želim.
I could see there.	Mogao sam da vidim tamo.
This year it has to be.	Ove godine mora biti.
Nobody heard them.	Niko ih nije čuo.
Or you can tell us what you know.	Ili nam možete reći šta znate.
But she can't help it.	Ali ona ne može pomoći.
This is my new car.	Ovo je moj novi auto.
Didn't you see him?	Zar ga nisi vidio?
She was good.	Bila je dobra.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
Either you do it or you don't.	Ili to uradiš ili ne.
Not even my father.	Nije ni moj otac.
But no one asked her.	Ali niko je nije pitao.
She was no longer there.	Više nije bila tamo.
You should see it here.	Trebao bi to vidjeti ovdje.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
It was more than enough for us.	Bilo nam je više nego dovoljno.
He should be back by now.	Trebao bi se vratiti do sada.
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
Do what you want.	Radi šta želiš.
That's something.	To je nešto.
But you can't.	Ali ne možete.
I actually like it.	Zapravo mi se sviđa.
He would finish his work first.	On bi prvi završio svoj posao.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
You loved me.	Ti si me volio.
I love, love, love!!!.	Volim, volim, volim!!!.
But we have to do this.	Ali moramo ovo da uradimo.
We can do that anytime.	To možemo učiniti bilo kada.
That will not happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
I wonder which one of us it is.	Pitam se ko je to od nas.
He never does that.	On to nikada ne radi.
I know this is small.	Znam da je ovo malo.
They will not stay there.	Oni neće ostati tamo.
Now we have.	Sada imamo.
I don't know anything about that.	Ne znam ništa o tome.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to da uradim.
It's always been a problem for me.	Za mene je to uvijek bio problem.
I was glad he was doing it, not me.	Bilo mi je drago da on to radi, a ne ja.
Life is good !.	Život je dobar!.
I mean, it's just one day.	Mislim, to je samo jedan dan.
I'm good.	Ja sam dobro.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
That's what it's about.	O tome se radi.
Maybe a little too much.	Možda malo previše.
You never know when it's going to happen.	Nikad ne znaš kada će se dogoditi.
I'm pretty sure it was him.	Prilično sam siguran da je to bio on.
But nothing is ever that simple.	Ali ništa nikada nije tako jednostavno.
A little hard, actually.	Malo teško, zapravo.
He didn't have much himself.	On sam nije imao mnogo.
No problem.	Nema problema.
In fact, not any.	U stvari, ne bilo koji.
I don't like it here anymore.	Ne sviđa mi se više ovde.
I love very much.	Jako volim.
He went to work.	Otišao je na posao.
What he saw was not real.	Ono što je video nije bilo stvarno.
But that's really not much.	Ali, to zaista nije mnogo.
It's not easy.	Nije lako.
The reason is too many people.	Razlog je previše ljudi.
I'm glad you came.	Drago mi je što si došao.
That's okay.	To je u redu.
Another guy.	Još jedan momak.
You can't do things.	Ne možete raditi stvari.
But they know he lives.	Ali oni znaju da živi.
It shouldn't be like that.	Ne bi trebalo biti tako.
I didn't know where he was.	Nisam znao gdje je.
People know who you are.	Ljudi znaju ko ste.
And this one looks real enough.	A ovaj izgleda dovoljno stvarno.
It just doesn't happen.	Samo se ne dešava.
And they were probably right.	I vjerovatno su bili u pravu.
Maybe he was.	Možda je bio.
He does it easily.	Lako to radi.
The only problem is how to do it.	Jedini problem je kako to uraditi.
I've been doing this for a long time.	Radim ovo dugo vremena.
We need.	Treba nam.
U.	U.
He will give you exactly what you need.	On će vam dati tačno ono što vam treba.
It’s even more than that.	To je čak i više od toga.
I'm done.	Završio sam.
I don't think he wants to go home!	Mislim da ne želi ići kući!
She loves you.	Ona te voli.
I'm doing the right thing.	Radim pravu stvar.
He loves no one.	On ne voli nikoga.
There is still much to be done and said.	Ima još mnogo toga da se uradi i kaže.
Besides, nothing real.	Osim toga, ništa stvarno.
I think so, a little.	Mislim da jeste, malo.
I have to be with you.	Moram biti s tobom.
And we can talk.	I možemo razgovarati.
I did that too.	I ja sam to uradio.
Who he was.	Ko je on bio.
It would be difficult.	Bilo bi teško.
When life goes well, little seems to happen.	Kada život ide dobro, malo toga se čini.
You have to know that.	Morate to znati.
It still is.	I dalje jeste.
It was us and them.	Bili smo mi i oni.
Not so much.	Nije toliko.
He obviously knew where they were.	Očigledno je znao gdje su.
Maybe he would.	Možda bi.
Over and over again.	Ponovo i ponovo.
But they can do it.	Ali oni to mogu.
It's so simple and difficult.	To je tako jednostavno i teško.
This can’t happen, it can’t be real.	Ovo se ne može dogoditi, ne može biti stvarno.
This can't be.	Ovo ne može biti.
Like you don't want to be here.	Kao da ne želiš biti ovdje.
It was a good year.	Bila je to dobra godina.
I've never seen him.	Nikad ga nisam video.
I'm not sure exactly.	Nisam siguran tačno.
You and me, it can still happen.	Ti i ja, to se još uvijek može dogoditi.
Do your job as if you can leave.	Radite svoj posao kao da možete otići.
Whether you are.	Bilo da jesi.
If she did, he would, and she wouldn't be there.	Da jeste, imao bi, a ona ne bi bila tu.
They did nothing.	Nisu uradili ništa.
It was already afternoon.	Već je bilo popodne.
Everything would be fine now.	Sada bi sve bilo dobro.
And be with you.	I biti s tobom.
Yes, next week.	Da, sljedeće sedmice.
And he got it.	I dobio ga je.
And you need to know that.	I ti to treba da znaš.
I didn't know about that.	Nisam znao za to.
I really love you.	Zaista te volim.
Right or wrong.	U pravu ili ne.
He doesn't do what he says.	Ne radi ono što kaže.
It won't be long, it can't be long.	Neće dugo, ne može biti dugo.
Where did he go?	Gdje je otišao?
I don't know if he was or not.	Ne znam da li je bio ili nije.
I know you are.	Znam da jesi.
Now I have a job.	Sada imam posao.
You don't know how much.	Ne znaš koliko.
I'm here now.	Sada sam ovdje.
Until they wanted to know who he was.	Sve dok nije želeo da znaju ko je on.
We were the first.	Bili smo prvi.
I haven't finished it yet.	Nisam je još završio.
He's a real, real guy.	On je pravi, pravi momak.
It must be something, he told himself.	To mora biti nešto, rekao je sebi.
I don't know since when.	Ne znam od koga.
And so it was.	Tako je i bio.
It won't do anything for us.	Neće nam ništa.
But there is more.	Ali ima još toga.
She doesn't have to say anything.	Ona ne mora ništa da kaže.
I don't want to go.	Ne želim da idem.
I didn't know that either.	Ni ja to nisam znao.
You know, the real me.	Znaš, pravi ja.
Everything will be better.	Sve bude bolje.
But it is more, much more.	Ali to je više, mnogo više.
That’s what’s so hard.	To je ono što je tako teško.
I don't know what that would be.	Ne znam šta bi to bilo.
So far, everything is working properly.	Do sada sve radi kako treba.
No.	Neću.
He thinks well.	On misli dobro.
There seemed to be so much.	Činilo se da je tako mnogo.
He tried to say something.	Pokušao je nešto reći.
She knew better now.	Sada je znala bolje.
You were looking for me.	Tražio si me.
You never will.	Nikad nećeš.
Which probably says something good about us.	Što vjerovatno govori nešto dobro o nama.
But only you can do that.	Ali samo ti to možeš.
Not if you don't want to.	Ne ako ne želiš.
It is 'so in itself'.	To je 'samo po sebi tako'.
And at home.	I kod kuće.
He's not the only one talking about it.	On nije jedini koji govori o tome.
In fact, that is not enough.	Zapravo, to nije dovoljno.
Everyone but us.	Svi osim nas.
He was sure he had seen this before.	Bio je siguran da je ovo već vidio.
He needs to get to it fast.	Mora brzo doći do njega.
They couldn't bring her back.	Nisu je mogli vratiti.
I love him for that.	Volim ga zbog toga.
They were like us.	Bili su kao mi.
That was hard.	To je bilo teško.
But he couldn't do that.	Ali on to nije mogao.
I'm tired of it.	Umoran sam od toga.
He was sure of that.	U to je bio siguran.
I was, really.	Bio sam, zaista.
You did that.	To ste uradili.
No one will help me.	Niko mi neće pomoći.
But you just can't.	Ali jednostavno ne možeš.
That's all from us.	To je sve od nas.
He doesn't have to be a friend.	Ne mora biti prijatelj.
It was so fast.	Bilo je tako brzo.
There is a problem.	Postoji problem.
But the story is not about that.	Ali priča nije o tome.
But it will be soon.	Ali uskoro će biti.
But he was not there.	Ali nije ga bilo.
I've never seen anything like it.	Nikad nisam video tako nešto.
I'm surprised to see you, actually.	Iznenađen sam što te vidim, zapravo.
But it wasn't a car.	Ali to nije bio auto.
Say what I want to say.	Reći šta želim da kažem.
He was probably right.	Verovatno je bio u pravu.
It's more for us.	To je više za nas.
I haven't seen anyone play that way.	Nisam video da neko igra na taj način.
He says it well.	On to dobro kaže.
But he couldn't, not yet.	Ali nije mogao, ne još.
I am life.	Ja sam život.
I'm leaving tomorrow.	Idem sutra.
It is never easy.	Nikad nije lako.
To want to live again.	Da želi ponovo da živi.
I don't know what to think about it.	Ne znam šta da mislim o tome.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
And it is there to this day.	I tu je do danas.
I have to tell you again.	Moram da ti kažem ponovo.
We've never been here before.	Nikada prije nismo bili ovdje.
But if not.	Ali ako nije.
No, it wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
I just didn't see it.	Jednostavno nisam vidio.
What happened is better.	Što je bilo, bolje je.
Do it he did.	Uradi to on je uradio.
I have no idea who you are.	Nemam pojma ko si ti.
I work here today.	Radim ovdje danas.
I'm sorry to say that.	Žao mi je što to kažem.
It's really quite obvious.	Zaista je prilično očigledno.
Not much, but something.	Ne mnogo, ali nešto.
Easy to carry.	Lako se nosi.
I don't know what will happen tomorrow.	Ne znam šta će biti sutra.
This is for you.	Ovo je za tebe.
He told me he wouldn't be home for a while.	Rekao mi je da ga neko vrijeme neće biti kod kuće.
I think it must help us.	Mislim da nam mora biti od pomoći.
Probably is.	Verovatno jeste.
She can stay.	Ona može ostati.
And that’s something we didn’t have last year.	A to je nešto što prošle godine nismo imali.
That's all I can say.	Toliko mogu reći.
He was there to help him.	Bio je tu da mu pomogne.
I've never seen him before.	Nikad ga prije nisam vidio.
I can be found here.	Mogu se naći ovdje.
And not only that.	I ne samo to.
We have to be better.	Moramo biti bolji.
That was good and bad.	To je bilo dobro i loše.
Now we know that.	Sada to znamo.
I need to see if the team is doing well.	Moram da vidim da li tim dobro radi.
But not so simple.	Ali ne tako jednostavno.
But no, not before.	Ali ne, ne prije.
I can't be sure.	Ne mogu biti siguran.
But now it was okay.	Ali sada je bilo u redu.
I don't think it's good.	Mislim da nije dobro.
I'm not there right now.	Trenutno nisam tamo.
It was good, but it could have been better.	Bilo je dobro, ali moglo je i bolje.
It certainly wasn't here.	Ovdje sigurno nije bilo.
To see her.	Da je vidim.
All of him.	Svi on.
Maybe that was my problem.	Možda je to bio moj problem.
I have to go for help.	Moram ići po pomoć.
It doesn't have to be much.	Ne mora biti puno.
Must be.	Mora biti.
Now you can.	Sada možeš.
According to.	Prema.
She is a true friend.	Ona je pravi prijatelj.
He doesn't have to say more.	Ne mora više da kaže.
You didn't come.	Nisi došao.
Why would I.	Zašto bi.
But he couldn't, not yet.	Ali nije mogao, ne još.
Nobody knows.	Niko ne zna.
There were a lot of them.	Bilo ih je puno.
Do it.	Uradite to.
This is not difficult to do.	Ovo nije teško uraditi.
Indeed, there is.	Zaista, postoji.
Can anyone help me?	Može li mi neko pomoći?
I doubt he'll be back.	Sumnjam da će se vratiti.
But that didn't happen at all.	Ali to se uopšte nije dogodilo.
I know him better than you.	Znam ga bolje od tebe.
I really think something is wrong.	Stvarno mislim da nešto nije u redu.
And today is your first day.	A danas je tvoj prvi dan.
He went to work.	Otišao je na posao.
I think you will be a good father.	Mislim da ćeš biti dobar otac.
I probably should.	Verovatno bih trebao.
I didn't expect something like that.	Nisam očekivao tako nešto.
But there are no people.	Ali nema ljudi.
I'd like you to do that.	Voleo bih da to uradiš.
I was a guy.	Bio sam momak.
I'm really glad you could do that.	Zaista mi je drago da si to mogao.
If you say so.	Ako ti tako kažeš.
Or not from me.	Ili ne od mene.
Even if you can.	Čak i ako možeš.
But for now.	Ali za sada.
We have everything.	Imamo sve.
We couldn't reach him.	Nismo mogli doći do njega.
Now he's done with it.	Sada je završio s tim.
They can see it.	Oni to mogu vidjeti.
He didn't look well.	Nije izgledao dobro.
This can be quite difficult.	To može biti prilično teško.
And you know it.	I ti to znaš.
Yes, and yes and yes.	Da, i da i da.
He really wanted to leave.	Jako je želio da ode.
Now, everyone knows that.	Sada, svi to znaju.
I didn't know how.	Nisam znao kako.
There is much more.	Ima još mnogo toga.
I really want this.	Zaista želim ovo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
It could be tomorrow.	Moglo bi biti sutra.
This works really well.	Ovo radi jako dobro.
I wondered how he did it.	Pitao sam se kako je to uradio.
I'm pretty sure you know, too.	Prilično sam siguran da i ti znaš.
And it still may not be good.	I još uvijek možda neće biti dobro.
I'm going to do it now.	Idem da uradim to sada.
I couldn't find my car.	Nisam mogao naći svoj auto.
He was sure he wouldn't.	Bio je siguran da neće.
Not everything is as it seems.	Sve nije kako izgleda.
It must be said.	Mora se reći.
I know more than you.	Znam više od tebe.
There wasn't much to say.	Nije bilo toliko za reći.
That might tell us something.	To bi nam moglo reći nešto.
And so it was and that is true.	I tako je bilo i to je istina.
He thought he was ready.	Mislio je da je spreman.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
And I probably can't.	I vjerovatno ne mogu.
What could be this problem.	Šta može biti ovaj problem.
And you have to do it.	I moraš to da uradiš.
he thought.	mislio je.
It was a good question.	Bilo je to dobro pitanje.
It was another really good day.	Bio je to još jedan zaista dobar dan.
I never told anyone this.	Ovo nikad nikome nisam rekao.
Don't say that.	Ne govori tako.
Has it ever been.	Da li je ikada.
Just not so fast.	Samo ne tako brzo.
I've never seen anything like it.	Nikada nisam video tako nešto.
You are not one of us.	Ti nisi jedan od nas.
Everyone already knows you need to do that.	Svi već znaju da to treba da uradite.
It's for me.	Za mene je.
I would do that.	Uradio bih to.
Why, why, why.	Zašto, zašto, zašto.
You have to be the one to make things happen.	Morate biti ti koji će se stvari dogoditi.
This will not be a problem for me.	Ovo mi neće biti problem.
Heard.	Čuo se.
He was so tired.	Bio je tako umoran.
I wonder about that.	Pitam se o tome.
Yes.	Da.
We needed both of us.	Trebao nam je oboje.
That should be obvious by now.	To bi već trebalo da bude očigledno.
It just isn't.	Jednostavno nije.
I was there too.	I ja sam bio tamo.
No, not yet.	Ne, ne još.
Money couldn't buy it.	Novac ga nije mogao kupiti.
There was no one at the time	U to vrijeme nije bilo nikoga
Obviously not too much.	Očigledno ne previše.
You should do everything you can.	Trebalo bi da uradite sve što možete.
I lost someone here many years ago.	Izgubio sam nekoga ovdje prije mnogo godina.
I think he's right.	Mislim da je u pravu.
Maybe it will help you.	Možda ti pomogne.
No, never again.	Ne, nikad više.
You just don’t have to say anything about it.	Jednostavno ne morate ništa reći o tome.
I wouldn’t put a lot of money into it.	Ne bih dao mnogo novca na to.
You should go to work.	Trebao bi ići na posao.
They were all alive.	Svi su bili živi.
Enough time.	Dovoljno vremena.
He wouldn't do that.	On to ne bi uradio.
And to no avail.	I do ništa dobro.
So it was hard for him.	Tako da mu je to bilo teško.
You're just doing your job.	Samo radiš svoj posao.
It only seems one way.	Izgleda samo na jedan način.
For me, it’s real.	Za mene je to stvarno.
How to stay in yourself.	Kako ostati u sebi.
This was obvious.	Ovo je bilo očigledno.
You have to let me do this my way.	Moraš mi dozvoliti da ovo uradim na moj način.
It doesn't work either.	Ni to ne radi.
Yes, it is.	Da, da jeste.
They weren't there.	Nisu bili tamo.
She wouldn't want you to know that.	Ona ne bi htela da to znaš.
You can easily do this here.	Ovo možete lako učiniti ovdje.
That was a long time.	To je bilo dugo.
But I can't be sure.	Ali ne mogu biti sigurni.
Maybe he didn't actually come back.	Možda se zapravo nije vratio.
Just a little longer.	Samo još malo.
He is only the first.	Taj je samo prvi.
Just like he knew it would be.	Baš kao što je znao da će biti.
But there is a problem.	Ali postoji problem.
And so on.	I tako dalje.
It doesn’t happen, it could never really happen.	Ne dešava se, nikada se zaista ne bi moglo dogoditi.
Time is not money.	Vrijeme nije novac.
I lost.	Izgubio sam.
Not here either.	Ni ovdje.
How true that is.	Kako je to istina.
Did you have a good day?	Jesi li imao dobar dan?
I didn't ask for long.	Nisam dugo tražio.
And she was.	I bila je.
I don't think so.	Mislim da neće.
I didn't think you wouldn't be here that long.	Nisam mislio da te neće biti tako dugo.
You do not know.	Ne znaš.
But nothing happens.	Ali ništa se ne dešava.
It will usually just go away.	Obično će jednostavno otići.
A lot has happened.	Mnogo toga se dogodilo.
Except for a few things.	Osim nekoliko stvari.
She knew it wouldn't be.	Znala je da neće biti.
When he was done, he was done.	Kad je završio, završio je.
And there is no next time, there is only time.	I nema sljedećeg puta, postoji samo vrijeme.
Now everything works as it should.	Sada sve radi kako treba.
Everything should be fine.	Sve bi trebalo biti u redu.
You did them.	Ti si ih uradio.
That was easy for me.	To je bilo lako za mene.
You have to do it a little bit.	Morate to raditi po malo.
I could help.	Mogao bih pomoći.
But they are there.	Ali oni su tamo.
I was just tired.	Samo sam bio umoran.
We were very much into it.	Bili smo veoma u tome.
This is obviously true.	Ovo je očigledno tačno.
And that may be the reason why it is so difficult.	I to je možda razlog zašto je tako teško.
Not much.	Mnogo toga nije.
I don't think you should, you know.	Mislim da ne bi trebao, znaš.
From both of you.	Od vas oboje.
I could tell he wanted to tell me something else.	Mogao sam reći da mi želi reći još nešto.
That's where it happened.	Tamo se to dogodilo.
They didn’t know and it’s that simple.	Nisu znali i to je tako jednostavno.
They both don't work together.	Oboje zajedno ne radi.
Obviously a lot of you.	Očigledno mnogo vas.
This was the real one.	Ovo je bio pravi on.
He wondered if that was true.	Pitao se da li je to istina.
But you won't get it from me anymore.	Ali od mene više nećeš dobiti.
That was the idea.	To je bila ideja.
But obviously not.	Ali očigledno nije.
I'm really glad we did that.	Zaista mi je drago što smo to uradili.
And we will be back.	I mi ćemo se vratiti.
But you're right.	Ali u pravu si.
He really loved me, you know.	On me je zaista voleo, znaš.
I couldn't say exactly what.	Nisam mogao reći šta tačno.
He will find a way.	On će naći način.
Maybe he'll be better.	Možda će mu biti bolje.
I don't want to do this anymore.	Ne želim ovo više da radim.
I wonder that.	Pitam se to.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
He asked for money.	Tražio je novac.
You work together or alone, but you work well.	Radite zajedno ili sami, ali dobro radite.
The story is good.	Priča je dobra.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
It's okay, she said, and nothing more.	U redu je, rekla je, i ništa više.
I wish you were there.	Bi da si bio tamo.
But there is no one here.	Ali ovdje nema nikoga.
Can anyone help.	Može li neko pomoći.
It seemed better for that.	Činilo se da je bolje za to.
He left with a lot of money.	Otišao je sa mnogo novca.
Do not tell me.	Nemoj mi reći.
Do what you want!	Radi šta želiš!
Only you don't know it yet.	Samo ti to još ne znaš.
And only when something happens.	I to samo kada se nešto dešava.
They don't know.	Oni ne znaju.
I didn’t know what he was talking about and I said.	Nisam znao o čemu priča i rekao sam.
We would do it again.	Uradili bismo to ponovo.
He knew about it.	Znao je za to.
It couldn't go on.	Nije moglo dalje.
So few people know that.	Tako malo ljudi to zna.
You really have to go where the people are.	Zaista morate ići tamo gdje su ljudi.
Tomorrow will be just another day for me.	Sutra će biti samo još jedan dan za mene.
You will soon.	Uskoro ćeš.
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
There was none of that.	Nije bilo ništa od toga.
Maybe that's what happened.	Možda se to i dogodilo.
It was as if he had heard something.	Kao da je nešto čuo.
He is not one.	On nije jedan.
I can't seem to help.	Čini se da ne mogu pomoći.
Yes, why not.	Da, zašto ne.
But we didn't.	Ali nismo.
There really is no more than that.	Zaista nema više od toga.
I just need more time.	Samo mi treba još vremena.
She always was.	Uvek je bila.
But it should be.	Ali trebalo bi da bude.
That's your way.	To je tvoj put.
You are a happy man.	Ti si sretan čovjek.
There's a door.	Tu su vrata.
He saw me.	Video me je.
I was quite surprised.	Bio sam prilično iznenađen.
But it is not always so.	Ali nije uvek tako.
I never thought it would be you.	Nikad nisam mislio da ćeš to biti ti.
I know what you're doing.	Znam šta radiš.
But you're right.	Ali u pravu si.
I didn't think it was okay.	Nisam mislio da je u redu.
It's a good job we're here.	Dobar je posao što smo ovdje.
I'm fine and I'm happy.	Dobro sam i sretan sam.
There are probably more.	Verovatno ih ima još.
This just can't be right.	Ovo jednostavno ne može biti u redu.
I guess it may never have been there.	Pretpostavljam da možda nikada nije bilo tamo.
But, yes, that's me.	Ali, da, to sam ja.
I won't do that with you.	Neću to raditi s tobom.
That must be difficult.	To mora da je teško.
He is just himself.	On je samo on sam.
What is.	Što je.
It is OK.	U redu je.
I've been for a long time.	Ja sam za dugo.
It’s not something you can buy.	To nije nešto što možete kupiti.
Now we knew we were right.	Sada smo znali da smo u pravu.
Do you do this alone? 	Da li ovo radite sami?
Say it like that.	Reci to tako.
It is very difficult for me to do that.	Veoma mi je teško da to uradim.
This was not her.	Ovo nije bila ona.
It was just like yesterday.	To mi je bilo kao juče.
That was exactly it.	To je bilo upravo to.
And not too much.	I ne previše.
Maybe a little earlier.	Možda malo ranije.
I could do this.	Mogao bih ovo da uradim.
I can't be.	Ne mogu biti.
I know what you mean.	Znam šta si mislio.
That's what you need today.	To ti treba danas.
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
I'll tell you what you want to know.	Reći ću ti šta želiš da znaš.
The more things, the better.	Što više stvari, to bolje.
I guess not.	Pretpostavljam da nije.
This is for me.	Ovo je za mene.
Were you at the party last week?	Jeste li bili na zabavi prošle sedmice?
Don't you say?	Ne kažeš?
You should all come.	Trebali biste svi doći.
It won't be easy.	Neće biti lako.
And he will be gone soon.	I on će uskoro otići.
No problem to date.	Nema problema do danas.
And let me just tell you something.	I samo da ti kažem nešto.
He said he had no idea.	Rekao je da nema pojma.
You are more than that.	Ti si više od toga.
I never was.	Nikada nisam bio.
Not for both.	Ne za oboje.
She doesn't.	Ona ne .
Only bad things.	Samo loše stvari.
That's my job.	To je moj posao.
He was probably safe with him.	Sa njim je vjerovatno bio siguran.
Real life.	Pravi život.
Another one tomorrow.	Još jedan sutra.
And it must be a good thing.	I sigurno je to dobra stvar.
One she knows.	Jedan koji ona zna.
You thought you had it.	Mislio si da je imaš.
I'm not sure.	Nisam siguran.
Everything that was there.	Sve što je bilo tamo.
You can’t do it that way.	Ne možete to učiniti na taj način.
More than you think you know.	Više nego što mislite da znate.
It was all right with me.	Sve je to bilo u redu sa mnom.
You know what we do.	Znaš šta radimo.
There is not much to see.	Nema mnogo za vidjeti.
Can anyone help me?	Može li mi neko pomoći?
That is something we need to do.	To je nešto što treba da uradimo.
I need to know what's going on here.	Moram da znam šta se ovde dešava.
This is actually happening.	To se zapravo dešava.
He had a job and he did it.	Imao je posao i uradio ga je.
I could be more, be better.	Mogao bih biti više, biti bolji.
He should come back with us.	Trebao bi se vratiti s nama.
I'm not sure what's next.	Nisam siguran šta dalje.
Not so much about that.	Ne toliko o tome.
There will be no problem.	Neće biti problema.
I couldn't help him.	Nisam mu mogao pomoći.
But it would be bad.	Ali bilo bi loše.
He was happy.	Bio je sretan.
My father or me.	Moj otac ili ja.
I hope it helps.	Nadam se da će pomoći.
We knew he was there.	Znali smo da je tamo.
In fact, you shouldn't.	U stvari, ne bi trebalo.
I don't know what they were.	Ne znam šta su bili.
I'll get there.	Ja ću doći tamo.
This is pretty easy to do.	Prilično je lako ovo raditi.
Surely you know.	Sigurno znaš.
But that is true.	Ali da je istina.
He returned to work yesterday.	Juče se vratio na posao.
And it's not that.	I nije to.
Everyone just knows that.	To jednostavno svi znaju.
Or, you know.	Ili, znaš.
She now knows what will happen and she knows she wants it.	Ona sada zna šta će se dogoditi i zna da to želi.
No, not people.	Ne, ne ljudi.
We wouldn’t be completely human if we weren’t.	Ne bismo bili potpuno ljudi da nismo.
All right.	U redu.
They can't do it now.	Oni to sada ne mogu.
It wasn't even supposed to win.	Nije čak ni trebalo pobijediti.
He doesn't know about it yet.	On još ne zna za to.
I know what will happen there.	Znam šta će se tamo dogoditi.
Not just mine.	Ne samo moj.
She knew she wasn't.	Znala je da nije.
I don't know how many times.	Ne znam koliko puta.
All right.	U redu.
He didn't ask for it.	On to nije tražio.
There I am, and there you are.	Tu sam ja, a tu si i ti.
More than that, he now knew he had never loved her.	Više od toga, sada je znao da je nikada nije volio.
Mine won't be.	Moj neće biti.
That could not have happened.	To se nije moglo dogoditi.
Not even who you were.	Čak ni ko si bio.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
But it goes beyond that.	Ali to ide dalje od toga.
And now they know there isn't.	A sada znaju da nema.
You can't get them.	Ne možete ih dobiti.
No one has heard of me.	Niko nije čuo za mene.
We need to know who did it.	Moramo znati ko je to uradio.
I still have to work.	Još moram da radim.
Surely someone would see.	Sigurno bi neko video.
We know this is difficult.	Znamo da je ovo teško.
You saw me.	Video si me.
She did and they said yes.	Ona jeste i oni su rekli da.
He was.	On je bio.
I know, but.	Znam, ali .
I don't know what you're going to do.	Ne znam šta ćeš uraditi.
He left this morning.	Otišao je jutros.
It was you.	To si bio ti.
it's really simple.	zaista je jednostavno.
All because of me.	Sve zbog mene.
Maybe it's not like mine, maybe it's not like yours.	Možda nije kao moj, možda nije kao tvoj.
Maybe more than that.	Možda i više od toga.
They've never been before.	Nikada ranije nisu.
She didn't want to play with me.	Nije htela da se igra sa mnom.
He probably won't do that.	Verovatno to neće uraditi.
We were supposed to be a team, but we weren’t.	Trebali smo biti tim, ali nismo.
I didn't do anything there.	Nisam ništa radio tamo.
Nothing real, nothing helpful.	Ništa stvarno, ništa od pomoći.
There was nothing that you could do about it.	Ništa nisi mogao učiniti.
He just got it.	Upravo je dobio.
It's not just about talking here.	Ovde se ne priča samo.
They are not there.	Oni nisu tamo.
In fact, it was very simple.	U stvari, bilo je vrlo jednostavno.
I arrived.	Stigao sam.
Maybe I would do it.	Možda bih to uradio.
That's all right.	To je sve u redu.
But what she told me was enough.	Ali ono što mi je rekla bilo je dovoljno.
That makes it very difficult to help you.	Zbog toga vam je veoma teško pomoći.
I just don't see it.	Ja to jednostavno ne vidim.
Was a little earlier.	Bio malo ranije.
But this time.	Ali ovaj put.
Where have you been?	Gdje si bio?
It can't be that bad.	Ne može biti tako loše.
Who knows how many people.	Ko zna koliko ljudi.
Could he do that? 	Da li bi on to mogao?
he wondered.	pitao se on.
But nothing was there.	Ali ništa nije bilo tamo.
Besides,.	Osim toga,.
This must be true.	Ovo mora da je tačno.
You couldn't get them easily.	Nisi ih mogao lako dobiti.
I doubt it a little.	Malo sumnjam u to.
If it is.	Ako bude.
I didn't expect it not to.	Nisam očekivao da neće.
And maybe not.	A možda i ne.
No one was ready.	Niko nije bio spreman.
I dont know that.	Ja to ne znam.
We immediately said yes.	Odmah smo rekli da.
You can buy anything there.	Tamo možete kupiti bilo šta.
No, that's none of my business.	Ne, to nije moja stvar.
She just was.	Ona je jednostavno bila.
Quite a bit, actually.	U stvari, prilično.
That looks pretty good.	To izgleda prilično dobro.
We better not work.	Bolje je da ne radimo.
There are just more of them.	Samo ih je više.
It's not getting any better.	Ne ide na bolje.
How can this be?	Kako ovo može biti?
You have to know where it is.	Morate znati gdje je.
I know you had to do that.	Znam da si to morao da uradiš.
Yes, it can be difficult.	Da, može biti teško.
There is nobody.	Nema nikoga.
I hope it works well.	Nadam se da radi dobro.
I should be doing my job.	Trebalo bi da radim svoj posao.
Do things together.	Radite stvari zajedno.
But nothing for yourself.	Ali ništa za sebe.
I wasn't sure what.	Nisam bio siguran šta.
See that it works properly.	Vidi da radi kako treba.
I saw it.	Video sam to.
And there is not much time.	I nema puno vremena.
Don't do it to yourself.	Ne radi to sebi.
It's just the way it is.	To je jednostavno tako kako je.
He likes to do it.	On to voli da radi.
I thought you were more than you looked.	Mislio sam da si više nego što izgledaš.
This could be the way to do it.	Ovo bi mogao biti način da se to uradi.
He's too sorry for you.	Sa tobom je previše žao.
So it is today.	Tako je i danas.
But they are not the only ones.	Ali oni nisu jedini.
We will too.	I mi ćemo.
I wouldn't do such a thing.	Ne bih uradio tako nešto.
And they were.	I bili su.
See what's up.	Vidi šta ima.
If ever.	Ako ikada.
I would like to do more than that.	Voleo bih da radim više od toga.
But that's not my way.	Ali to nije moj način.
Maybe it still is.	Možda i dalje jeste.
Not sure what it really is.	Nije siguran šta je stvarno.
More is not always better.	Više nije uvijek bolje.
Not that he ever said much.	Nije da je ikada rekao mnogo.
And that's a good story.	I to je dobra priča.
It's working well now.	Sada radi dobro.
I didn't tell anyone what was going on.	Nikome nisam rekao šta se dešava.
You have to go.	Moraš ići.
It never did.	Nikad nije.
She said she could no longer work here.	Rekla je da ne može više raditi ovdje.
That's for sure now.	To je sada sigurno.
I know nothing can happen to you.	Znam da ti se ništa ne može dogoditi.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
John sees this.	John vidi ovo.
None of that.	Ništa od toga.
I have to do something about it.	Moram nešto da uradim sa tim.
Without you, this cannot happen.	Bez vas, to se ne može dogoditi.
How can I do that.	Kako mogu to da uradim.
I'll go too.	I ja ću otići.
We had a few ourselves.	I sami smo imali nekoliko.
Very good person.	Vrlo dobra osoba.
I could not.	Nisam mogao.
For you.	Za tebe.
I'm really sorry, but.	Zaista mi je žao, ali .
Which didn't happen.	Što se nije dogodilo.
It's not that simple.	Nije baš tako jednostavno.
That is not always true.	To nije uvek tačno.
He will never tell you that you did a good job.	Nikada vam neće reći da ste uradili dobar posao.
A lot, actually.	Mnogo, zapravo.
They passed.	Prošle su.
I can't stay here.	Ne mogu ostati ovdje.
How long will we stay.	Koliko ćemo ostati.
Something happened, something happened, something happened.	Nešto se dogodilo, dogodilo se, nešto se dogodilo.
He's not sure.	On nije siguran.
That's us.	To smo mi.
He was ready for anything.	Bio je spreman na sve.
I know.	Ja znam.
This can be a problem.	Ovo može biti problem.
I am so happy to do this job.	Tako sam sretan što radim ovaj posao.
Someone will come right away.	Neko će odmah doći.
And people at the time couldn’t believe it.	A ljudi u to vrijeme nisu mogli vjerovati.
That's not a problem.	To nije problem.
That looks good.	To izgleda dobro.
And that's what he will do.	I to će on raditi.
He certainly doesn't know.	On sigurno ne zna.
It is.	Da, jeste.
I know exactly what happened.	Znam tačno šta se dogodilo.
That should be easy.	To bi trebalo biti lako.
It was a door.	Bila su to vrata.
We don't know where we are now.	Ne znamo gdje smo sada.
And that's what you want.	I to je ono što želiš.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
It seemed to me.	Činilo mi se.
I like it, he says.	Sviđa mi se, kaže.
He's trying to reach you.	On pokušava doći do tebe.
If it was that simple, he would have been here earlier.	Da je tako jednostavno, bio bi ovdje ranije.
The job was good.	Posao je bio dobar.
Or not.	Ili ne.
He can't say.	Ne može reći.
And we will.	I mi ćemo.
I don't want to know things.	Ne želim da znam stvari.
That may be all of this.	To je možda sve ovo.
It just seems like it could go either way.	Samo se čini da bi to moglo ići na bilo koji način.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
She talks a lot.	Ona puno priča.
No, more than that.	Ne, više od toga.
You really should.	Zaista bi trebali.
He can easily come and go there.	On može lako doći i otići tamo.
You couldn't see it.	Nisi to mogao vidjeti.
That's your job now.	To je sada tvoj posao.
She was much more than that.	Ona je bila mnogo više od toga.
He had nothing more to say.	Više nije imao šta da kaže.
I'm so tired.	Tako sam umoran.
I didn't think so.	Nisam tako mislio.
I wasn't good.	Nisam bio dobar.
This is maybe.	Ovo je možda.
Maybe that's why.	Možda je to razlog zašto.
She loves him very much.	Ona ga jako voli.
It’s something that would completely happen to me.	To je nešto što bi mi se potpuno dogodilo.
I have to go home.	Moram ići kući.
You know what's what.	Znaš šta je šta.
He said nothing.	Nije rekao ništa.
No time for that.	Nema vremena za to.
He didn't have it now, but he would soon.	Sada ga nije imao, ali bi uskoro.
Say something good or something bad.	Reci nešto dobro ili nešto loše.
I'm for it.	Ja sam za to.
Nobody saw it.	Niko to nije video.
Not like us today.	Ne kao mi danas.
I don't even know what to say about it.	Ne znam ni šta da kažem o tome.
I'm glad they're new.	Drago mi je da su novi.
Even last year.	Čak i ove prošle godine.
She won't.	Ona neće.
Not a little.	Ni malo.
For me, money is nothing.	Za mene novac nije ništa.
Do this for me.	Uradi ovo za mene.
I love getting them.	Volim ih dobiti.
I know why you're here.	Znam zašto si ovde.
He loved this team.	Voleo je ovaj tim.
But he doesn't have time for this right now.	Ali on trenutno nema vremena za ovo.
I didn't think it existed.	Nisam mislio da postoji.
It wasn't like that.	Nije bilo tako.
We do this often.	Ovo često radimo.
More time than we have.	Više vremena nego što imamo.
Never heard of it.	Nikad čuo.
I really can't.	Zaista ne mogu.
I shouldn't have.	Nisam trebao.
Not much about it.	Nema mnogo o tome.
Life is good.	Život je dobar.
Not even with.	Čak ni sa.
I hope so.	Nadam se da je to tako.
There is no money in that.	U tome nema novca.
That was really it.	To je zaista bilo to.
It's not really there.	To zapravo nije tamo.
Not much, but something.	Ne mnogo, ali nešto.
She was alone.	Bila je ona sama.
I don't know how, but he was right.	Ne znam kako, ali bio je u pravu.
There were a lot of us that day.	Bilo nas je puno toga dana.
It won't be obvious.	Neće biti očigledno.
Can't you talk to him yourself?	Zar ne možete sami razgovarati s njim?
That can be difficult.	To može biti teško.
That's not a problem.	To nije problem.
We have to go back now.	Moramo se vratiti sada.
None of that for him.	Ništa od toga za njega.
I don't see why you're doing this.	Ne vidim zašto to radiš.
Not all is well.	Nije sve dobro.
But there is much to be done.	Ali ima mnogo toga da se uradi.
We don't do that.	Mi to ne radimo.
There are more.	Ima ih još.
You should too.	Trebao bi i ti.
Even when it's so good.	Čak i kada je tako dobro.
We have a life.	Imamo život.
This is not safe.	Ovo nije sigurno.
Please can anyone help.	Molim vas može li neko pomoći.
I can't, actually.	Ne mogu, u stvari.
But it's people's business.	Ali to je posao ljudi.
It looks pretty easy.	Izgleda prilično lako.
I have to work on myself.	Moram da radim na sebi.
He told me a lot about himself.	Rekao mi je puno o sebi.
Maybe something from me.	Možda nešto od mene.
You mean well.	Misliš dobro.
He got there first.	On je stigao tamo prvi.
It will be yours too.	I tvoj će biti.
It was as if she knew something.	Kao da je znala nešto.
We're sorry too.	I nama je žao.
How have you been?	Kako si bio?
It wasn't like that.	Nije bilo tako.
I decided to go alone.	Odlučio sam da idem sam.
And there is no one.	I nema nikoga.
I mean, we could.	Mislim, mogli bismo.
That is simply what we need to do.	To je jednostavno ono što treba da uradimo.
I'm sure he'll be with you soon.	Siguran sam da će uskoro biti s tobom.
We don't know what it was.	Šta je to bilo, ne znamo.
You can't say no.	Ne možeš reći ne.
Who really knows.	Ko stvarno zna.
I do not know how.	Ne znam kako.
She will come right away.	Ona će odmah doći.
I didn't expect it to be that way.	Nisam očekivao da će biti tako.
You never know what you'll get.	Nikad ne znaš šta ćeš dobiti.
It must be me.	Mora da sam ja.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
If anyone can do it, they can.	Ako neko to može, može.
Do not be.	Nemoj biti.
There was no one to talk to.	Nije bilo s kim razgovarati.
He did it tonight.	On je to uradio večeras.
I didn't know what to do.	Nisam znao šta da radim.
That was what we needed.	To je bilo ono što nam je trebalo.
He did nothing wrong.	Nije učinio ništa loše.
I couldn't find anything.	Nisam mogao naći ništa.
Can someone please what could be the reason.	Može li neko da vas molim šta bi mogao biti razlog.
I can not now.	Ne mogu sada.
I'm very afraid of that.	Jako se toga bojim.
I like to think so.	Volim da tako mislim.
The day has come.	Došao je dan.
Enough for him.	Dosta za njega.
You can't stay.	Ne možeš ostati.
What is this? 	Šta je ovo?
he asked.	pitao.
It wasn't necessary.	Nije trebalo.
But this man is not.	Ali ovaj čovjek nije.
Nobody has done that before.	Niko to ranije nije radio.
I could be back at work in thirty days.	Mogao bih se vratiti na posao za trideset dana.
I can't go back.	Ne mogu se vratiti.
Mine was the first.	Moj je bio prvi.
Happy, no, that's not it.	Sretan, ne, to nije to.
That seems very unlikely.	To izgleda vrlo malo vjerovatno.
I could too.	Mogao bih i ja.
It was more than that.	Bilo je više od toga.
I think it's pretty obvious what's there.	Mislim da je prilično očigledno šta je tu.
It was only a matter of time before people would do that.	Bilo je samo pitanje vremena kada će ljudi to učiniti.
But you don't have to.	Ali ne morate.
It is good.	Dobro je.
Business is going fast.	Posao ide brzo.
Okay, okay, this was good.	Dobro, dobro, ovo je bilo dobro.
There was too much of it.	Bilo je previše toga.
All these years and years.	Sve ove godine i godine.
I really mean it.	Zaista to mislim.
It would simply be a question of what is what.	To bi jednostavno bilo pitanje šta je šta.
We would know who they are.	Znali bismo ko su oni.
I go to work.	Idem na posao.
It was yours.	Bio je tvoj.
She now lives at home.	Ona sada živi kod kuće.
They were already here.	Već su bili ovdje.
But there is only this to say.	Ali ima samo ovo da se kaže.
Really, really easy.	Zaista, stvarno lako.
You can't leave.	Ne možeš otići.
And this was now.	A ovo je bilo sada.
You were here.	Bili ste ovdje.
We can't stay here.	Ne možemo ostati ovdje.
But he only goes to the door.	Ali on ide samo na vrata.
Maybe everything.	Možda sve.
Mine is even more.	Moj je čak i više.
I did everything I could.	Uradio sam sve što sam mogao.
I think that's the question now.	Mislim da je to pitanje sada.
I would never do something like that.	Nikad ne bih uradio tako nešto.
It's too hard that way.	Previše je teško na taj način.
We have to go there.	Moramo ići tamo.
Been there and done that.	Bio sam tamo i uradio to.
You can't be everything to everyone.	Ne možeš svima biti sve.
Nobody told him to do that.	Niko mu nije rekao da to uradi.
I came.	Došao sam.
I'm sure he'll be back.	Siguran sam da će se vratiti.
But someone was there, okay.	Ali neko je bio tamo, u redu.
You can do this while we have you.	Možete to učiniti dok vas imamo.
Does anyone know how to play? 	Da li neko zna kako se igra?
he asked.	pitao.
I should have been there for me.	Trebao sam da bude tu za mene.
They never were and probably never will be.	Nikada nisu bili i vjerovatno neće biti.
There are very few of them now.	Sada ih ima vrlo malo.
I think there is a reason for that.	Mislim da postoji razlog za to.
You were right about me.	Bio si u pravu za mene.
I'm tired.	Umoran sam.
That would be too obvious.	To bi bilo previše očigledno.
You know, it's pretty simple.	Znate, prilično je jednostavno.
I still had them.	Još sam ih imao.
And you have to help me.	I moraš mi pomoći.
That's not really a problem.	To zapravo i nije problem.
What is he talking about.	O čemu on priča.
I know what he means.	Znam šta želi da kažem.
No one is.	Niko nije.
And he would be right.	I bio bi u pravu.
I'm glad he's here.	Drago mi je da je ovdje.
And that was many years ago.	I to je bilo prije mnogo godina.
I just said it doesn’t happen.	Jednostavno sam rekao da se to ne dešava.
That was three years ago.	To je bilo prije tri godine.
It was bad enough.	Bilo je dovoljno loše.
He expected this.	On je ovo očekivao.
We never did that again.	Nikad to više nismo uradili.
Probably very little.	Vjerovatno vrlo malo.
It no longer exists.	Više ne postoji.
I didn't mean that.	Nisam to mislio.
But it's easy.	Ali to je lako.
But now they are gone.	Ali sada ih nema.
It could have been anyone.	Mogao je biti bilo ko.
That's what we do.	To je ono što mi radimo.
He will never give me back.	Nikada mi neće vratiti.
That is simply true.	To je jednostavno istina.
It's getting better and better.	Sve je bolje i bolje.
There is nothing.	Nema ništa.
I just didn't know.	Samo nisam znao.
And he would.	I on bi.
Don't do that.	Nemoj na to.
I do bad things.	Radim loše stvari.
That was something they did.	To je bilo nešto što su uradili.
All those years.	Sve te godine.
There is a reason for that.	Za to postoji razlog.
You don't need it.	Ne treba ti.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
It's so hard for all of us.	Svima nam je tako teško.
They are real people.	Oni su pravi ljudi.
You can do it for me.	Možeš to uraditi za mene.
We did things.	Uradili smo stvari.
Even that, in itself, is not easy.	Čak ni to, samo po sebi, nije jednostavno.
There was no more money.	Nije bilo više novca.
I’m not sure if that’s a good idea or not.	Nisam siguran da li je to dobra ideja ili ne.
We are here.	Ovde smo.
I'd tell you earlier.	Rekao bih ti ranije.
I didn't say much today.	Danas nisam puno rekao.
But that's not the point here.	Ali to nije stvar ovdje.
I see it happening.	Vidim da se to dešava.
He loved you.	Voleo te je.
And do it.	I uradi to.
Are you .	Jesi li .
They don't know.	Oni ne znaju.
But you have to trust me.	Ali moraš mi vjerovati.
The weather is very bad.	Vrijeme je jako loše.
I can not tell you.	Ne mogu ti reći.
That's how it should work.	Tako bi to trebalo da radi.
Something is happening.	Nešto se dešava.
I can help if needed.	Mogu pomoći ako treba.
How difficult that can be.	Kako to može biti teško.
But that was not good enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
Whatever he could say to himself, he did everything.	Bilo šta da bi mogao sebi da kaže, sve je uradio.
This can happen.	Ovo se može dogoditi.
Maybe it would be good to do it here.	Možda bi i bilo dobro da to uradimo ovde.
There is someone who can help you.	Postoji neko ko vam može pomoći.
I saw this.	Video sam ovo.
Good or bad.	Dobro ili loše.
Say it with me.	Reci to sa mnom.
I'm glad you're here this morning.	Drago mi je da ste jutros.
Too much, maybe.	Previše, možda.
Now they were gone.	Sada ih nije bilo.
We don't know what is true.	Ne znamo šta je istina.
We have to help him.	Moramo mu pomoći.
We will come.	Doći ćemo.
I hope he knows what he's doing.	Nadam se da zna šta radi.
He really, really loves me.	On me zaista i zaista voli.
I was very glad about that.	Bilo mi je jako drago zbog toga.
I have no problem with that.	Nemam problem sa tim.
You really don't think so, but do you think so.	Zaista ne mislite da jeste, ali da li mislite.
Which is.	Koji je.
We know him.	Znamo ga.
I'm not doing that.	Ne radim to.
But that is not the case.	Ali to nije tako.
He was safe.	Bio je siguran.
But no one really is.	Ali niko zapravo nije.
Few days.	Nekoliko dana.
I'm still working on it.	Još uvijek radim na tome.
He works for me.	On radi za mene.
She knew that.	To je znala.
But enough of that.	Ali dosta toga.
We need to talk.	Moramo razgovarati.
I won't be back for a while.	Neću se vratiti neko vrijeme.
That's how he likes to think about himself.	Tako voli da misli o sebi.
He didn't expect that either.	Ni on to nije očekivao.
I know what the problem is!	Znam u čemu je problem!
Just a little longer.	Samo još malo.
He has no friends.	Nema ni prijatelja.
He wasn't a bad guy, really.	Nije bio loš momak, zaista.
I know we can do it.	Znam da to možemo.
I went there.	Otišao sam tamo.
There was none of that.	Nije bilo ništa od toga.
But it does not exist.	Ali ne postoji.
It is better to come earlier.	Bolje je doći ranije.
Everything is going well.	Sve ide dobro.
This must be the year.	Ovo mora biti godina.
But maybe that's more my problem than yours.	Ali možda je to više moj problem nego tvoj.
None of us knows what to do.	Niko od nas ne zna šta da radimo.
She knew she was.	Znala je da jeste.
It's not safe here.	Ovdje nije sigurno.
It was time to be alone.	Bilo je vrijeme da budem sam.
You've had it long enough.	Imaš ga dovoljno dugo.
Either you know your job or you don’t.	Ili znate svoj posao ili ne znate.
You just can't win.	Jednostavno ne možeš pobijediti.
But that wasn't the only time it happened.	Ali to nije bio jedini put da se to dogodilo.
He seems to be right.	Čini se da je u pravu.
It should be easy.	Trebalo bi biti lako.
He didn't understand.	Nije shvatio.
This was very simple.	Ovo je bilo vrlo jednostavno.
This is not happening at the moment.	Trenutno se to ne dešava.
Is he.	Je li on.
It's still not right.	I dalje nije u redu.
And he was the only one.	I bio je jedini.
That seems safe enough.	To izgleda dovoljno sigurno.
I probably didn't want to know.	Verovatno nisam htela da znam.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
But he's wrong.	Ali nije u pravu.
I was sorry for him.	Bilo mi je žao zbog njega.
I needed money.	Trebao mi je novac.
So everything goes.	Tako da sve ide.
This has happened several times.	Ovo se dogodilo nekoliko puta.
I'm going now.	Ja idem sada.
It's getting better and better.	Sve je bolje i bolje.
Even too much.	Čak i previše.
Do you know that?	Da li to znate.
I knew very well where everyone was.	Znao sam vrlo dobro gdje su svi.
I've never been here.	Nikad nisam bio ovde.
She's afraid of you.	Ona te se boji.
I don't know how to say that.	Ne znam kako da to kažem.
That's pretty good.	To je dosta dobro.
It took him a while.	Trebalo mu je neko vrijeme.
Even these and many more.	Čak i ove i još mnogo toga.
You would understand that you have them.	Shvatio bi da ih imaš.
There was no one there.	Tamo nije bilo nikoga.
He was very alone.	Bio je veoma sam.
So I don’t have enough time right now.	Tako da trenutno nemam dovoljno vremena.
You know, like a way to know what's next.	Znate, kao način da znate šta dalje.
Not much more to say about it.	Nema mnogo više da se kaže o tome.
Besides, you told us things we didn't know before.	Osim toga, rekli ste nam stvari koje ranije nismo znali.
But it was something.	Ali to je bilo nešto.
Yes, it was.	Da, bilo je.
I didn't want to ask earlier.	Nisam htela da pitam ranije.
That's what he told me.	To mi je rekao.
I got this.	Dobio sam ovo.
I thought it was going to be really hard, but it’s not.	Mislio sam da će biti zaista teško, ali nije.
Just a little longer.	Samo još malo.
It's not me anymore.	To više nisam ja.
He had never seen them before.	Nikad ih prije nije vidio.
She won't come to you.	Ona neće doći kod tebe.
I was alone.	Bio sam sam.
Looks good, feels good.	Dobro izgleda, dobro se osjeća.
He meant what he said earlier.	Mislio je ono što je ranije rekao.
Nice to see you.	Bilo nam je drago vidjeti vas.
I don't want to see anyone.	Ne želim nikoga da vidim.
I guess we were right.	Pretpostavljam da smo bili u pravu.
This has never happened before.	To se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
I knew something was wrong.	Znao sam da nešto nije u redu.
Like, a lot more.	Kao, puno više.
This man is gone.	Ovaj čovjek te više nema.
He never tried.	Nikad nije pokušao.
I just did what I was supposed to do.	Upravo sam uradio ono što je trebalo da uradim.
I think there were a lot of people.	Mislim da je mnogo ljudi bilo.
We knew we could do better.	Znali smo da možemo bolje.
We don't need that.	Ne treba nam to.
And we can give life.	I mi možemo dati život.
That was him.	To je bio on.
This is not it.	Ovo nije to.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo u redu.
He'll tell you it's your father.	Reći će ti da je to tvoj otac.
We are so glad.	Tako nam je drago.
And so it is.	I tako je.
Everything will be.	Sve će biti.
I actually rather expected it.	Zapravo sam to prije očekivao.
He had few friends.	Imao je malo prijatelja.
No one will do it for you.	Niko to neće uraditi za tebe.
You will never know why.	Nikad nećeš znati zašto.
That's a problem, a real problem.	To je problem, pravi problem.
But there is.	Ali postoji.
Not so bad.	Nije tako loše.
I hope he gets it.	Nadam se da će dobiti.
I will stay.	Ja ću ostati.
But there may be too many.	Ali možda ih je previše.
Live your life day by day.	Živi svoj život dan po dan.
I can be there for you.	Mogu biti tu za tebe.
You can trust him.	Možeš mu vjerovati.
I know you.	Znam te.
Something is not working.	Nešto ne radi.
Someone did, that's for sure.	Neko jeste, to je sigurno.
Which would be one.	Koji bi bio jedan.
I haven't heard before.	Nisam čuo ranije.
I have to stay here.	Moram ostati ovdje.
But this is not what this is.	Ali ovo nije ono što je ovo.
But apparently not this time.	Ali očigledno ne ovaj put.
She's home for you.	Na kući je za tebe.
It is so.	To je tako.
he thought.	mislio je.
Probably is.	Verovatno jeste.
No no no no no.	Ne ne ne ne ne.
It will be like that again.	Tako će biti ponovo.
Not even to go to dinner.	Čak ni da idem na večeru.
They couldn't.	Nisu mogli.
He arrived on time.	Stigao je na vrijeme.
No problem.	Nije problem.
I'm very good at it.	Ja sam jako dobar u tome.
He did poorly there.	Loše je radio tamo.
We are fine together.	Dobro nam je zajedno.
She said she was both.	Rekla je da je oboje.
It does those things really easily.	To zaista lako radi te stvari.
I'm not really.	Nisam zaista.
There is no one who can help you.	Ne postoji niko ko ti može pomoći.
The car couldn't go on.	Auto nije mogao dalje.
Apparently, he wasn't in it for the money.	Očigledno, nije bio u tome zbog novca.
He wants to come home.	On želi da dođe kući.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
Never again to say.	Nikada više za reći.
Why they did it.	Zašto su to uradili.
I'll tell you what's going on.	Reći ću ti šta se dešava.
He was just here.	On je upravo bio ovde.
But this is not the time for that.	Ali ovo nije vrijeme za to.
It wants for you what you want for yourself.	Ono želi za tebe ono što ti želiš za sebe.
When he arrived, something was wrong.	Kada je stigao, nešto nije bilo u redu.
I wasn't happy about that.	Nije mi bilo drago zbog toga.
It was a really good story.	Bila je to zaista dobra priča.
He said why not.	Rekao je zašto ne.
How can they not know.	Kako da ne znaju.
And this will.	I ovo će.
But that is not happening.	Ali to se ne dešava.
Are you done?	Jesi li završio?
I don't know what she thinks, what she knows and what she doesn't know.	Ne znam šta ona misli, šta zna a šta ne zna.
But there is more to it than that.	Ali ima više od toga.
It's very good.	Veoma je dobro.
I have enough.	Imam dosta.
You probably know the reason.	Vjerovatno znate razlog.
I knew what he really meant.	Znao sam šta je zaista mislio.
I just thought you should know.	Samo sam mislio da bi trebao znati.
I do not know what is happening.	Ne znam šta se dešava.
More than that.	Više toga.
They were here for the first time.	Prvi put su bili ovdje.
Where he had to be.	Gdje je morao biti.
He told me a little.	Malo mi je rekao.
This is something you do for you.	Ovo je nešto što radiš za tebe.
She knew she would have to see him soon.	Znala je da će ga uskoro morati vidjeti.
I just knew.	Samo sam znao.
He can't do that.	On to ne može.
And people.	I ljudi.
It is.	Da, jeste.
I have no idea when I will get a new one.	Nemam pojma kada ću dobiti novi.
And that's a good thing.	I to je dobra stvar.
But he wasn't here.	Ali on nije bio ovdje.
He is a friend.	On je prijatelj.
Maybe much more.	Možda mnogo više.
It was so obvious he had no idea what to do.	Bilo je tako očigledno da nije imao pojma šta da radi.
He doesn't know what he's doing.	On ne zna šta radi.
I know that completely.	Znam to potpuno.
It's better.	Je bolje.
I did it myself.	Sam sam to uradio.
And very happy about that.	I veoma sretan zbog toga.
What is it.	Šta je to.
Not that there’s anything wrong with that.	Nije da ima nešto loše u tome.
He had something to tell me.	Imao je nešto da mi kaže.
That was wrong, none of that.	To nije bilo u redu, ništa od toga.
If we do it right, they never will.	Ako to uradimo kako treba, oni nikada neće.
I can not believe.	Ne mogu vjerovati.
That will come next week.	To će doći sljedeće sedmice.
When it was us.	Kad smo to bili mi.
Yes, good guy.	Da, dobar momak.
I should see that.	Trebao bih to vidjeti.
I said it was mine.	Rekao sam da je moj.
It's not just him.	Nije samo on.
I doubt we'll get more tonight.	Sumnjam da ćemo večeras dobiti više.
The team needs to work harder.	Tim mora više da radi.
He can't get to you.	Ne može doći do tebe.
I know what my problem is.	Znam u čemu je moj problem.
For the better, obviously.	Na bolje, očigledno.
Something for tomorrow.	Nešto za sutra.
Not so fast.	Ne tako brzo.
I was not happy.	Nisam bio sretan.
It's been a long time.	Bilo je to dosta vremena.
What did he know?	Šta je znao.
I don't know if that's such a good idea.	Ne znam da li je to tako dobra ideja.
Your father.	Tvoj otac.
And he knows it.	I to zna.
I was good for you.	Bio sam dobar za tebe.
There are so many now.	Sada ih ima toliko.
But that was just me.	Ali to sam bio samo ja.
This is a good story.	Ovo je dobra priča.
No one will stay here.	Niko neće ostati ovdje.
That's more than enough for me today.	Danas mi je toga više nego dovoljno.
She would be there.	Ona bi bila tamo.
There is more to do.	Ima još toga za uraditi.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
I'm happy for you.	Drago mi je zbog tebe.
You know, he was right.	Znate, bio je u pravu.
We can't take it anymore.	Ne možemo više.
I doubt he'll ever come back.	Sumnjam da će se ikada više vratiti.
I would love to see that.	Voleo bih to da vidim.
One is not too good.	Jedan nije previše dobar.
Why didn't you come yesterday?	Zašto nisi došao juče?
There is something you should probably know.	Postoji nešto što bi verovatno trebalo da znate.
But it still won't work.	Ali i dalje neće raditi.
I just wanted to see you.	Samo sam htela da te vidim.
But that was it.	Ali, to je bilo to.
That is a very good question.	To je veoma dobro pitanje.
That's what she does.	To je ono što ona radi.
We knew that.	Znali smo to.
But it doesn't work tonight.	Ali večeras ne radi.
Even more, it seems.	Još više, čini se.
I'm sorry.	Žao mi je.
They are with me.	Oni su sa mnom.
He is there alone.	On je sam tamo.
You have to stay with me.	Moraš ostati sa mnom.
I have to go home soon.	Moram uskoro kući.
I'm just not sure.	Samo nisam siguran.
Get it.	Dobiti ga.
And he saw something else.	I video je još nešto.
And that was it.	I to je bilo to.
I've never been in it.	Nikada nisam bio u tome.
It wasn't a day.	Nije bio dan.
I can do anything.	Mogu sve.
That says something.	To nešto govori.
I can't believe it's almost here.	Ne mogu vjerovati da je skoro ovdje.
But I have one problem.	Ali imam jedan problem.
It's not enough.	Nije dovoljno.
But well, maybe that's not a problem.	Ali dobro, možda to i nije problem.
It's just a matter of time.	To je samo pitanje vremena.
They are still there.	I dalje su tamo.
I never saw him.	Nikad ga nisam vidio.
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
They knew nothing about it.	Nisu znali ništa o tome.
And it really is.	I zaista jeste.
Us.	Nama.
I've had enough of you.	Dosta mi je tebe.
I just need to see her.	Samo treba da je vidim.
No, he's gone now.	Ne sada ga nema.
He wanted much, much more.	Želeo je mnogo, mnogo više.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
And she tells you.	I ona ti kaže.
What if this and what if that.	Šta ako ovo, a šta ako ono.
I'd like to see you there.	Volio bih te vidjeti tamo.
Maybe a little more.	Možda još malo.
This is simple.	Ovo je jednostavno.
I don't see how he couldn't.	Ne vidim kako nije mogao.
No more can be said than that.	Ne može se reći više od toga.
That is what it is, nothing more.	To je ono što jeste, ništa više.
That's right, there are more.	Tačno, ima ih više.
She can't do anything to us.	Ona nam ne može ništa.
You can’t do things the right way.	Ne možete raditi stvari na pravi način.
To pray more.	Da se više molim.
I'm really sorry.	Zaista mi je žao.
That was my only truth.	To je bila moja jedina istina.
Obviously, few people know about this.	Očigledno, malo ljudi zna za ovo.
You do not know? 	Ne znaš?
He says.	On kaže.
Or yes, no one told me.	Ili da jeste, niko mi nije rekao.
That's how he saw me.	Tako me je video.
All right, if that's the case.	U redu, ako je tako bilo.
He was not ready for that day.	Nije bio spreman za taj dan.
He didn't want you to know.	Nije želio da znaš.
But now he knew that was not true.	Ali sada je znao da to nije istina.
But now everyone seemed to know that.	Ali sada se činilo da svi to znaju.
If he has it.	Ako ga ima.
Someone, you tell yourself.	Neko, kažeš sebi.
This one is back.	Ovaj se vratio.
That was a few years ago.	Bilo je to prije nekoliko godina.
They knew who they were.	Znali su ko su.
It's just one day.	To je samo jedan dan.
He knew what it was.	Znao je šta je to.
But we have better.	Ali imamo bolje.
even for me.	čak i za mene.
I looked for.	Tražio sam.
You can really see everything.	Zaista se vidi sve.
But it was not easy.	Ali nije bilo lako.
She will know.	Ona će znati.
He just said he didn't want to.	Samo je rekao da ne želi.
Easy for him.	Lako za njega.
Can anyone tell me what's wrong with that.	Može li mi neko reći šta nije u redu s tim.
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije.
They couldn't even do that.	Čak ni to nisu mogli.
This is not me, obviously.	Ovo nisam ja, očigledno.
I do not know.	Ne znam.
I'm sorry, she said, but.	Žao mi je, rekla je, ali.
No, not now.	Ne, ne sada.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
And he did.	I on je to uradio.
Maybe there is such a thing.	Možda postoji tako nešto.
We know nothing about where he went.	Ne znamo ništa o tome gdje je otišao.
It looks really hard.	Izgleda zaista teško.
I shouldn't have gone.	Nisam trebao da idem.
We don't like it.	Ne sviđa nam se.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
That's how you live.	Tako se živi.
We have plenty of time.	Imamo dosta vremena.
You don't have to do this now.	Ne morate ovo sada da radite.
Tell him to do things.	Reci mu da uradi stvari.
It's not easy anymore.	Više nije jednostavno.
There is something wrong here.	Ovdje nešto nije u redu.
And still to this day.	I dalje do danas.
He tried to speak, but could not.	Pokušao je da govori, ali nije mogao.
I think he's good.	Mislim da je dobar.
I didn't think it was a good idea.	Nisam mislio da je to dobra ideja.
You should see that.	Trebao bi to vidjeti.
He was tired.	Bio je umoran.
They are just people.	Oni su samo ljudi.
It's all true.	Sve je to istina.
This is not easy to do.	Ovo nije lako uraditi.
And it really wasn't true.	I zaista to nije bila istina.
He himself did not work.	On sam nije radio.
I never heard from him again.	Nikad se više nisam čuo s njim.
And for how long.	I koliko dugo.
I'm sure that won't be a problem.	Siguran sam da to neće biti problem.
You told me that yourself.	Sam si mi to rekao.
She didn't say that.	Ona to nije rekla.
That's right.	Tako je.
I love you.	Volim te.
A little more than me.	Nešto više od mene.
I have you now.	Imam te sada.
You know what's going on.	Znaš šta se dešava.
There is a reason.	Tu je razlog.
He doesn't really like me, 'she said.	On me baš i ne voli', rekla je.
She knew a lot about herself.	Znala je mnogo o sebi.
It's just a job.	To je samo posao.
And that was probably a good thing.	I to je vjerovatno bilo dobro.
This was not the way a man lived.	Ovo nije bio način da čovjek živi.
It works for me.	Radi za mene.
There is nothing to do now.	Sada nema šta da se uradi.
And he's a bad guy.	I on je loš momak.
But they weren’t a few years ago.	Ali nisu bili prije nekoliko godina.
This was so.	Ovo je bilo tako.
I want to be sure.	Želim biti siguran.
Yes it can be.	Da može biti.
You just have to believe.	Jednostavno treba vjerovati.
You were there.	Bio si tamo.
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
When was it?	Kad je bilo?
He loves it, and he loves me.	On to voli, i voli mene.
And now, it won't.	A sada, neće.
I know you know things.	Znam da znaš stvari.
But not for me and him.	Ali ne za mene i njega.
But someone has to.	Ali neko mora.
Just for a few days.	Samo na nekoliko dana.
I love him more and more.	Sve više ga volim.
Very much.	Veoma.
How's yours.	Kako je tvoj.
He loved it.	Voleo je to.
You should have seen that!	Trebao si to vidjeti!
He is right in his own way.	On je u pravu na svoj način.
Yes, this was the day.	Da, ovo je bio dan.
Could he have done more?	Da li je mogao više?
He did it.	Uradio je to.
That's all you need to know.	To je sve što treba da znaš.
Which is very, very hard to do.	Što je veoma, veoma teško uraditi.
She has a problem.	Ona ima problema.
And no one saw him.	I niko ga nije video.
But who could see that.	Ali ko bi to mogao da vidi.
It used to be.	Nekada je bilo.
It wasn't hard.	To nije bilo teško.
I'll tell you what happens.	Reći ću ti šta će se dogoditi.
It's not easy to say.	Nije baš lako reći.
I didn't mean it.	Nisam mislio.
My job was only a matter of time.	Moj posao je bio samo pitanje vremena.
That was him.	To je bio on.
I don't think that's a bad thing.	Mislim da to nije loš posao.
So it happened at this time.	Tako se dogodilo u ovo vrijeme.
He told me he did.	Rekao mi je da jeste.
It's a new way.	To je novi način.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
I have no problem.	nemam problema.
We do this as in.	Ovo radimo kao u .
No, that wasn't good.	Ne, to nije bilo dobro.
Like mine.	Kao i moj.
And it is.	I to je.
Drive him home today.	Vozi ga kući danas.
You have to be your own friend.	Moraš biti sam sebi prijatelj.
But it could.	Ali moglo je.
Now he's back.	Sada se vratio.
Nothing will happen to you.	Ništa ti se neće dogoditi.
.	.
I've worked with him before.	Radio sam s njim ranije.
We were from, not in that.	Bili smo od, a ne u tome.
He had to.	Morao je.
It works well for me.	Kod mene radi dobro.
I hope it comes soon.	Nadam se da će uskoro doći.
We can't bring it back now.	Ne možemo to sada vratiti.
But this time he had to.	Ali ovaj put je morao.
He really wanted something more.	On je zaista želeo nešto više.
We know who they are.	Znamo ko su oni.
This must be done.	Ovo se mora uraditi.
I can't believe he's here.	Ne mogu vjerovati da je ovdje.
I was happy to help.	Bio sam sretan što mogu pomoći.
I thought it was good.	Mislio sam da je dobro.
They know better.	Oni znaju bolje.
More than fine.	Više nego u redu.
This is fine.	Ovo je u redu.
He didn't want to do this.	On nije želio ovo da uradi.
It was really easy.	Bilo je zaista lako.
I thought you'd be home by now.	Mislio sam da ćeš već biti kod kuće.
I was really happy that they did.	Bio sam zaista sretan što su to uradili.
He got there.	Stigao je tamo.
Works.	Radi.
Who wants to drive?	Ko želi da vozi?
I'm sure not.	Siguran sam da ne.
And you will.	I hoćeš.
I didn't know when you would be.	Nisam znao kada ćeš biti.
I'm not happy.	Nisam sretan.
And that's a good thing.	I to je dobra stvar.
And you're probably right.	I vjerovatno si u pravu.
I'll go and talk to him.	Otići ću i razgovarati s njim.
It was just me.	Bio sam samo ja.
In fact, he really wanted it.	U stvari, on je to jako želeo.
Do more now.	Sada uradi više.
You know what this is.	Znaš šta je ovo.
She told herself she wouldn't.	Rekla je sebi da neće.
I don't know what he did to you.	Ne znam šta ti je uradio.
If not, nothing will happen.	Ako nema, ništa se neće dogoditi.
Which was true enough.	Što je bilo dovoljno tačno.
No you're not.	Ne nisi.
I don't know anything about that.	Ne znam ništa o tome.
He said he had never heard of it before.	Rekao je da to nikada ranije nije čuo.
Probably a lot of time.	Vjerovatno puno vremena.
So long.	Tako dugo.
I know you can.	Znam da možeš.
What do you need.	Šta treba.
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žao, tako mi je žao.
I can't talk to you.	Ne mogu razgovarati s tobom.
I'm sorry it was her.	Žao mi je što je to bila ona.
I have no idea what it is.	Nemam pojma šta je to.
Everyone but him.	Svi osim njega.
Now I know enough to say what it was.	Sada znam dovoljno da kažem šta je to bilo.
I really love these things.	Zaista volim ove stvari.
I understood that better now.	Sada sam to bolje shvatio.
I didn't know it at the time.	U to vrijeme to nisam znao.
I did it for him.	Uradio sam to za njega.
These are people.	Ovo su ljudi.
It's there.	Tamo je.
You look like him.	Izgledaš kao on.
I still have that problem.	I dalje imam taj problem.
She is right.	U pravu je.
And he had nothing better to do.	I nije imao ništa bolje da radi.
And it's that simple.	I to je tako jednostavno.
I was in it.	Bio sam u tome.
A little more.	Još malo.
When you're right, you're right.	Kada si u pravu, u pravu si.
That should be more than enough.	To bi trebalo biti više nego dovoljno.
But now I'm happy.	Ali sada sam sretan.
Besides,	Osim toga,
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
You don't like the job.	Ne sviđa ti se posao.
Do whatever it takes.	Uradite sve što radi.
That is really difficult for us.	To nam je zaista teško.
There was plenty of time for you to tell me the truth.	Bilo je dosta vremena da mi kažeš istinu.
I ask that.	Pitam to.
They said so much.	Toliko su rekli.
I was really sorry for him.	Bilo mi ga je stvarno žao.
Maybe a lot, and maybe not so much.	Možda je mnogo, a možda i ne toliko.
He wanted to be alone.	Želeo je da bude sam.
If what you’re doing works for you, that’s fine.	Ako to što radite radi za vas, to je u redu.
But I still need help.	Ali i dalje mi treba pomoć.
People he needed to see.	Ljudi koje je trebao vidjeti.
He won't do it.	Neće to učiniti.
And you can't buy them anymore.	I više ih ne možete kupiti.
We just aren't.	Jednostavno nismo.
They could be back soon.	Mogli bi se vratiti uskoro.
I really should.	Stvarno bih trebao.
I never did.	Nikad nisam.
Not exactly.	Ne baš tako.
Do it right.	Uradi to kako treba.
It's not like he can see me.	Nije kao da me može vidjeti.
And it is.	I jeste.
It's not enough.	Nije dovoljno.
It's just that it's hard to do.	Samo što je to teško učiniti.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
And that's me.	A to sam ja.
This we can know.	Ovo možemo znati.
But this one actually works pretty well.	Ali ovaj zapravo radi prilično dobro.
He knew both.	Znao je oboje.
Tell me if it isn't.	Reci mi ako nije.
But that's how it goes.	Ali tako to ide.
She said it was fine.	Rekla je da je dobro.
He wasn't there, but he knows.	Nije bio tamo, ali zna.
I can't say when.	Ne mogu reći kada.
He decided not to.	Odlučio je da nije.
.	.
As it is, it cannot.	Kako jeste, ne može.
No one could.	Niko nije mogao.
But he said it would not happen.	Ali on je rekao da se to neće dogoditi.
It seemed to be true.	Činilo se kao da je istina.
There was nothing more for him here.	Za njega ovdje nije bilo ništa više.
It can be anything.	Može biti bilo šta.
But it's nothing.	Ali nije ništa.
I'm sorry about last night.	Žao mi je zbog sinoć.
It's still mine.	I dalje je moj.
He couldn't stay to see what he had done to him.	Nije mogao ostati da vidi šta mu je uradio.
I guess they would be fine.	Pretpostavljam da bi bili u redu.
I never wanted that.	Nikad to nisam želeo.
She loves her job.	Ona voli svoj posao.
Not us.	Ne nama.
I couldn't completely before.	Prije nisam mogao potpuno.
And I'm fine with that.	I u redu sam s tim.
Something tells me we can do better.	Nešto mi govori da možemo bolje.
I would do anything for you.	Učinio bih sve za tebe.
But he knew what was going to happen.	Ali znao je šta će se dogoditi.
We know how to do it.	Znamo kako da to uradimo.
The team was bad.	Tim je bio loš.
And you can only see it.	I možete to samo vidjeti.
Just the truth.	Samo istina.
I think we need to know more about that.	Mislim da moramo znati više o tome.
Yes, even more than now.	Da, čak i više nego sada.
This was not my idea.	Ovo nije bila moja ideja.
I don't know why he doesn't talk.	Ne znam zašto ne priča.
Don't tell me you're not.	Nemoj mi reći da nisi.
But there is.	Ali ima.
I'm sure not.	Siguran sam da nije.
I told him good work.	Rekao sam mu dobar posao.
And it was so good for me.	I bilo je tako dobro za mene.
It was hard, it was hard.	Bilo je teško, bilo je teško.
He didn't know how much, or how bad.	Nije znao koliko, ni koliko loše.
A few days ago it worked well.	Prije nekoliko dana radio je dobro.
I knew that for sure.	Znao sam to sigurno.
I didn't hear.	Nisam čuo.
He can talk, but he doesn't talk.	Može da priča, ali ne priča.
You will be.	Ti ćeš biti.
He never said why.	Nikad nije rekao zašto.
He was very tired, and he just wanted to go home.	Bio je jako umoran, i samo je htio kući.
But how to buy it.	Ali kako to kupiti.
Maybe so.	Možda je tako.
He never will.	Nikad neće.
Only one worked.	Samo jedan je radio.
As if that never happened.	Kao da se to nikada nije dogodilo.
We have a good one.	Imamo jedan dobar.
She lives alone now.	Sada živi sama.
I had a reason.	Imao sam razlog.
At the party.	Na zabavi.
Not that you were.	Nije da si bio.
He said no.	Rekao je da nije.
But he couldn't say that.	Ali on to nije mogao reći.
Too much.	Previše.
I hope you get the job.	Nadam se da ćeš dobiti posao.
You don't know what's waiting for you.	Ne znaš šta te čeka.
You know everything you need to know.	Znaš sve što treba da znaš.
But he knew.	Ali on je znao.
It is neither here nor there.	To nije ni ovdje ni tamo.
I'm afraid he's lost.	Bojim se da se izgubio.
We don't have to do anything tonight.	Ne moramo ništa da radimo večeras.
What he wants.	Što on želi.
And it goes on.	I ide dalje.
Maybe no one was good enough.	Možda niko nije bio dovoljno dobar.
I don't know well.	Ne znam dobro.
Hard to do.	Teško za uraditi.
It's pretty simple.	Prilično je jednostavno.
Let me tell you something.	Da ti kažem nešto.
I knew my job.	Znao sam svoj posao.
This is often not true.	Ovo često nije tačno.
There is a good reason for that.	Za to postoji dobar razlog.
That was never a problem.	To nikada nije bio problem.
I just think so.	Samo mislim da je tako.
Actually, they didn't know.	Zapravo, nisu znali.
And so on.	I tako dalje.
I can't even.	Ne mogu čak.
I love working there.	Volim raditi tamo.
True, it never was.	Istina, to nikada nije bilo.
I guess that could happen.	Pretpostavljam da bi se to moglo dogoditi.
There was very little of that.	Bilo je vrlo malo toga.
It doesn't seem so difficult anymore.	Više ne izgleda tako teško.
But it doesn't have to be.	Ali ne mora biti.
But she knew there was nothing she could do.	Ali znala je da ništa ne može učiniti.
But often it is not done.	Ali često se to ne radi.
That's mine.	Taj je moj.
No one could know.	Niko nije mogao znati.
You don't know how to do it.	Ne znate kako to učiniti.
She wouldn't be.	Ne bi bila.
I want him.	Želim ga.
We can't get it back from that.	Ne možemo to vratiti od toga.
He loved us.	Voleo nas je.
But there should be no one here.	Ali ovdje ne bi trebalo biti nikoga.
And so it goes.	I tako to ide.
Can anyone do that.	Može li neko to da uradi.
I have no idea what's going on.	Nemam pojma šta se dešava.
She said she knew.	Rekla je da zna.
Something is wrong here.	Nešto ovdje nije u redu.
And he realized something else.	I shvatio je još nešto.
He knew that.	On je to znao.
As if he wanted it that way.	Kao da je tako želio.
They would never do that.	Oni to nikada ne bi uradili.
If that's what it is.	Ako je to ono što je.
You never asked me anything.	Nikad me ništa nisi pitao.
But here we are.	Ali tu smo.
I tried to talk.	Pokušao sam razgovarati.
Nobody ever tells me anything.	Niko mi nikad ništa ne govori.
If done well, it really works.	Ako se uradi dobro, zaista radi.
It's about how it makes you feel.	Radi se o tome kako ti se to čini.
I went back to that.	Vratio sam se na to.
And it's good to have to.	I dobro je da treba.
He wasn't.	Nije bio.
All or nothing.	Sve ili ništa.
I was quite surprised and asked if it was really there.	Bio sam prilično iznenađen i pitao sam da li je to zaista bilo tamo.
I think everyone should know that.	Mislim da bi to svi trebali znati.
But that's because of who they are.	Ali to je zbog toga ko su oni.
No money.	Nema novca.
He seemed to have a friend.	Činilo se da je imao prijatelja.
But it seems too obvious.	Ali izgleda previše očigledno.
That's a really good story.	To je stvarno dobra priča.
I'm ready now.	Sada sam spreman.
This is not good.	Ovo nije dobro.
It probably should have been.	Verovatno je trebalo da bude.
Tomorrow will do even more than today.	Sutra će učiniti čak i više nego danas.
And there is a reason.	I postoji razlog.
He didn't say that.	On to nije rekao.
I told him she didn't live there.	Rekao sam mu da ona ne živi tamo.
Maybe you're a little.	Možda si malo.
They do not know the truth.	Oni ne znaju istinu.
And so on and so forth.	I tako dalje i tako dalje.
I'm not sure why that is.	Nisam siguran zašto je to tako.
This is the first time this has happened.	To je prvi put da se to dešava.
Until last night.	Do sinoć.
I told you this.	Rekao sam ti ovo.
But he didn't really have us.	Ali on nas zapravo nije imao.
Which was fine.	Što je bilo u redu.
he thought.	mislio je.
No, it won't.	Ne, neće.
But it wasn't what you thought.	Ali nije bilo ono što mislite.
He was no longer looking for work.	Više nije tražio posao.
I think I could help you.	Mislim da bi ti mogao pomoći.
It's not working yet.	Za sada ne radi.
These were the first people.	To su bili prvi ljudi.
Or because of you.	Ili zbog tebe.
Not even that one.	Ne ni taj.
I mean, we're not sure.	Mislim, nismo sigurni.
I mean it.	Mislim to.
It can't help what it looks like.	Ne može pomoći kako to izgleda.
So he could be like me.	Tako da bi mogao biti kao ja.
I know him well.	Znam ga dobro.
I can't bring it back.	Ne mogu to vratiti.
And we didn’t know them before time.	I nismo ih znali prije vremena.
That would never be him.	To nikad ne bi bio on.
I guess he's right.	Pretpostavljam da je u pravu.
She doesn't want anything to do with me.	Ona ne želi da ima ništa sa mnom.
He said he didn't like it.	Rekao je da mu se ne sviđa.
And that would be good.	I to bi dobro.
Wear it!	Nosi ga!
I work for a living.	Radim za život.
They wouldn't know about it.	Ne bi znali za to.
There was something.	Nešto je bilo.
There was a lot to say.	Bilo je mnogo toga za reći.
He should stay with us.	Trebao bi ostati s nama.
He had it all, but it still wasn’t enough.	Imao je sve, ali i dalje nije bilo dovoljno.
He asked me what it was.	Pitao me je šta je to.
More than him, actually.	Više nego on, zapravo.
There just wasn’t time for that.	Jednostavno nije bilo vremena za to.
He did it.	On je to uradio.
As far as I know.	Koliko ja znam.
But that’s the way she says nothing.	Ali to je način na koji ona ništa ne govori.
This doesn't seem right to me.	Ovo mi se ne čini u redu.
We are here today.	Tu smo danas.
Someone will do it for you.	Neko će to uraditi za vas.
Few people know about this.	Malo ljudi zna za ovo.
Say it.	Reci.
You do it a lot.	Radite to puno.
That's how it was for me.	Tako mi je bilo.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
I wonder where she lives now.	Pitam se gdje ona sada živi.
I won't be able to see them.	Neću moći da ih vidim.
I know something and you don't.	Znam nešto i ti ne znaš.
I can't leave.	Ne mogu otići.
I better see if he's home.	Bolje da vidim da li je kod kuće.
I think he works too much from it.	Mislim da previše radi od njega.
I really want to.	Veoma želim.
He was here.	Bio je ovdje.
I just know.	Samo znam.
He is such a good guy.	On je tako dobar momak.
You never did that.	Nikad to nisi radio.
I don't need a job.	Ne treba mi posao.
He had to be.	Morao je biti.
That's what he wanted.	To je ono što je želio.
He was the one who should have known things.	On je bio taj koji je trebao znati stvari.
Live with us.	Živi sa nama.
That's a lot more.	To je mnogo više.
Everyone knows someone.	Svi znaju nekoga.
But people will always say something.	Ali ljudi će uvijek nešto reći.
Maybe more than once.	Možda više puta.
Maybe you like it.	Možda ti se sviđa.
But only one.	Ali samo jedan.
It's so hard for us !.	Tako nam je teško!.
We shouldn't need that.	To nam ne bi trebalo.
You have to go there with him.	Moraš ići tamo s njim.
I didn't really want to know.	Nisam htela da znam zaista.
I don't know what to think.	Ne znam šta da mislim.
I just love it.	Samo volim to.
I can't say.	Ne mogu reći.
Yes, just a few things.	Da, samo nekoliko stvari.
That's how it will be.	Tako će biti.
No one had much to say.	Niko nije imao mnogo da kaže.
What he could do, he did.	Šta je mogao da uradi, uradio je.
Something has to stay.	Nešto mora ostati.
He knew what it looked like.	Znao je kako to izgleda.
He's not trying.	Ne pokušava.
But still nothing.	Ali još uvek ništa.
So it might not work for me.	Tako da mi to možda neće raditi.
He wondered what she would say.	Pitao se šta će ona reći.
Plus, it seems to work well.	Osim toga, izgleda da radi dobro.
There were none.	Nije ih bilo.
Probably would.	Vjerovatno bi.
As if it were easy.	Kao da bi bilo lako.
She does what she has to do.	Ona radi ono što mora.
Hard.	Teško.
And it's not very good.	I nije baš dobro.
He gave him everything he had ever asked for.	Dao mu je sve što je ikada tražio.
A little.	Malo.
He can't do anything.	Ne može ništa.
Ready to go.	Spreman da idem.
And he was obviously tired.	I on je očigledno bio umoran.
But tomorrow will be.	Ali sutra će biti.
I know nothing more than you about it.	Ne znam ništa više od tebe o tome.
He was three years old at the time.	Imao je tri godine u to vrijeme.
She's not here anymore.	Ona više nije ovdje.
He will be fine.	On će biti dobro.
You don't know what you did.	Ne znaš šta si uradio.
In fact, it is.	U stvari jeste.
You couldn't.	Nisi mogao.
That is exactly what it is.	To je upravo ono što je.
If they are not, they are not.	Ako nisu, nije.
We still don't know exactly why they did it.	Još uvijek ne znamo zašto su to tačno uradili.
It's good to be back !.	Dobro je vratiti se!.
She will know you loved her.	Ona će znati da si je volio.
I never wanted to do this.	Nikad nisam želeo ovo da uradim.
He was glad to be back.	Bilo mu je drago što se vratio.
Nobody knows what to do.	Niko ne zna šta da radi.
He'll be on time.	Doći će na vrijeme.
Everything looks good and works well.	Sve izgleda dobro i radi dobro.
He just left.	Upravo je otišao.
He is one of us.	On je jedan od nas.
We would be together.	Bili bismo zajedno.
Too much of that is happening.	Previše se toga dešava.
And it will never be that way again.	I nikada više neće biti tako.
I like that a lot.	To mi se mnogo sviđa.
It's good to see you.	Dobro je vidjeti te.
Only.	Samo.
And it was good.	I bilo je dobro.
That's what she wants.	To je ono što ona želi.
I need a lot.	Treba mi dosta.
And so it can be.	I tako može biti.
It's very good.	Je veoma dobro.
He worked for a very long time.	Radio je veoma dugo.
They are nothing.	Oni su ništa.
You're the first one here.	Ti si prvi ovdje.
There are several things you can do about it.	Za to možete učiniti nekoliko stvari.
Is it? 	Je li?
But he wasn't quite that.	Ali on nije bio baš to.
Not with us.	Ne sa nama.
That's it.	To je to.
Tim is a good friend.	Tim je dobar prijatelj.
I did what you said.	Uradio sam ono što si rekao.
And indeed, there is much more.	I zaista, ima još mnogo toga.
But he had the money himself.	Ali on je sam imao novac.
I did it myself.	I sam sam to uradio.
She knew exactly what she was doing.	Tačno je znala šta radi.
I saw that myself.	To sam i sam vidio.
Tim.	Tim.
But it's hard.	Ali teško je.
He can't leave.	On ne može otići.
I have no problem with that.	Nemam problema sa tim.
It doesn't work today.	Danas ne radi.
And it's all because of you.	I sve je to zbog tebe.
Here and there.	Tu i tamo.
I know what's good now.	Znam šta je sada dobro.
I think you're one.	Mislim da si jedan.
He could always say.	Uvek je mogao da kaže.
I had such a good life.	Imao sam tako dobar život.
But maybe this is good too.	Ali možda je i ovo dobro.
The truth is the problem now.	Istina je sada problem.
He should have been here by now.	Trebao je biti ovdje do sada.
I should go back.	Trebao bih se vratiti.
We are you at the moment.	Mi smo ti trenutno.
This is just for us.	Ovo je samo za nas.
So many times.	Toliko puta.
I know you can see them too.	Znam da ih i ti možeš vidjeti.
It's true.	To je istina.
I know what it's like.	Znam kako je to.
He decided not to do that.	Odlučio je da to ne učini.
It is often difficult to say what she thinks.	Često je teško reći šta ona misli.
He now had three.	Sada je imao tri.
I never got to that.	Nikad nisam stigao do toga.
He could only do as he had to.	Mogao je samo da uradi kako mora.
It could be anything.	Moglo bi biti ništa.
It just doesn't exist.	To jednostavno ne postoji.
I said very little.	Rekao sam vrlo malo.
They will help me.	Oni će mi pomoći.
She said who she was.	Rekla je ko je ona.
He got there first.	On je stigao tamo prvi.
Exactly what you want.	Tačno ono što želite.
He himself was not much better either.	Ni on sam nije bio mnogo bolje.
I was pretty good.	Bio sam prilično dobar.
It's not that simple.	Nije tako jednostavno.
One.	Jedan.
Tell me again.	Reci mi ponovo.
We were just people.	Bili smo samo ljudi.
He's waiting for me.	On me čeka.
Nobody lives there.	Tamo niko ne živi.
Maybe this is another one.	Možda je ovo još jedan.
But that is not happening here.	Ali to se ovde ne dešava.
I feel sorry for you.	Žao mi je zbog tebe.
I wish it was.	Voleo bih da jeste.
So far so good.	Za sada dobro.
Nobody seems to know what's going on.	Izgleda da niko ne zna šta se dešava.
I have one.	Ja imam jedan.
He knew how to do it.	Znao je kako to da uradi.
But she doesn't follow him.	Ali ona ne ide za njim.
This often happens.	Ovo se često dešava.
I couldn’t believe he could see.	Nisam mogao vjerovati da može vidjeti.
I will not say.	Neću reći.
It works really well.	Stvarno dobro radi.
Not us, actually.	Ne mi, zapravo.
We will not stay.	Nećemo ostati.
I don't know what to say or do to you.	Ne znam šta da ti kažem ili uradim.
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije.
Not us, not me.	Ne mi, ne ja.
That's not what it does.	To nije ono što radi.
You're doing much better.	Ide ti mnogo bolje.
But it is.	Ali to je.
Or it's just me.	Ili sam samo ja.
You can actually get more out of it.	Zapravo možete dobiti više od toga.
And a friend.	I prijatelja.
I just want you to know.	Samo želim da znaš.
And this is it.	I to je ovo.
My father did nothing wrong.	Moj otac nije uradio ništa loše.
It was him.	Bio je on.
Everything was as it should be.	Sve je bilo kako treba.
I need to see something.	Moram nešto da vidim.
I want to love someone.	Želim da volim nekoga.
But there seems to be a problem.	Ali, izgleda da postoji problem.
There are three of them.	Ima ih tri.
Plus, you could do a lot better.	Osim toga, mogli biste mnogo bolje.
I knew it was them.	Znao sam da su to oni.
The code does what it needs to do.	Kod radi ono što treba.
They would probably say we did a good job.	Vjerovatno bi rekli da smo uradili dobar posao.
He knew this day would come.	Znao je da će doći ovaj dan.
And this is what you want.	A ovo je ono što želite.
He was never heard from again.	Nikad se više nije čuo za njega.
You have to help me.	Moraš mi pomoći.
I'm still working on it.	Još uvijek radim na tome.
And that can't be right.	A to ne može biti tačno.
He said it might help.	Rekao je da bi to moglo pomoći.
I'll give it to you.	Ja ću to dati.
You are alone.	Sami ste.
In fact, a lot of money.	U stvari, dosta novca.
This has always been a problem.	Ovo je uvijek bio problem.
Not a day.	Ne dan.
I couldn't do it anymore.	Nisam to više mogao.
Even that was not certain.	Čak ni to nije bilo sigurno.
He had plenty of time.	Imao je dosta vremena.
But there were three.	Ali bila su tri.
We won't give you money.	Nećemo vam dati novac.
He wondered if it was all true.	Pitao se da li je sve to istina.
It looks like rain.	Izgleda kao kiša.
But maybe it is.	Ali možda jeste.
It’s something we know we’re doing.	To je nešto što znamo da radimo.
She knew she was right.	Znala je da je u pravu.
But maybe he didn't need both.	Ali možda mu oboje nisu trebali.
Everyone knew.	Svi su znali.
It works for now.	Za sada radi.
He had heard this before.	Čuo je ovo ranije.
But not today.	Ali ne danas.
Only the first.	Samo prvi.
than to be.	nego biti.
He never did.	Nikada nije.
I'm home.	Kod kuće sam.
He had to come.	Morao je doći.
We had enough.	Imali smo dovoljno.
Oh my!	O moj!
Enough of that.	Dosta toga.
I just can’t go a little longer.	Jednostavno ne mogu otići još malo.
He can do whatever he wants.	Može da radi šta hoće.
You almost had me there.	Skoro si me imao tamo.
They will definitely be there.	Oni će sigurno biti tamo.
Maybe he should go home.	Možda bi se trebao vratiti kući.
Maybe there is one long before that.	Možda postoji jedan mnogo prije toga.
That cannot be true.	To ne može biti istina.
If not further.	Ako ne dalje.
It's okay if you can't be friends with everyone.	U redu je ako ne možeš biti prijatelj sa svima.
She said she never told anyone.	Rekla je da nikada nikome nije rekla.
I really don't know how to do this.	Ja stvarno ne znam kako da ovo uradim.
I don't know, I wasn't one.	Ne znam, nisam bio jedan.
He doesn't do anything for me.	On ništa ne radi za mene.
But that's right.	Ali tako je.
But there is nothing to say.	Ali nema šta da se kaže.
I like this job.	Sviđa mi se ovaj posao.
He couldn't stay here long.	Nije mogao dugo ostati ovdje.
He didn't want me.	Nije me želio.
Not with him, that's for sure.	Ne sa njim, to je sigurno.
It's up to you.	Do tebe je.
We can't go tonight or tomorrow.	Ne možemo ići večeras ili sutra.
He'll probably be back for more.	Vjerovatno će se vratiti po još.
It is exactly what it is.	To je upravo ono što je.
But maybe they knew.	Ali možda su znali.
Is this good.	Da li je ovo dobro.
I'll buy it.	Ja ću to kupiti.
He decided what to do.	Odlučio je šta će uraditi.
And he will.	I hoće.
It might even have been true.	Možda je čak i bila istina.
He tried to say something but couldn't.	Pokušao je nešto reći, ali nije mogao.
I should.	Trebao bi.
It's good to go the way you are.	Dobro je ići kako jeste.
I had no idea he would be here.	Nisam imao pojma da će biti ovdje.
One more day.	Još jedan dan.
It's not as hard as it should be.	Nije tako teško koliko bi trebalo da bude.
What are you doing today?	Šta radiš danas?
I hope someone can help.	Nadam se da neko može pomoći.
Certainly not!	Sigurno ne!
We are human.	Mi smo ljudi.
It may not be so.	Možda i neće biti tako.
Life was for life again.	Život je ponovo bio za život.
I didn't try.	Nisam pokušao.
I heard that too.	I ja sam to čuo.
Maybe it really was.	Možda je to zaista bio.
Maybe he was right.	Možda je bio u pravu.
Maybe it's true.	Možda je istina.
To be better.	Da bude bolje.
And the work works.	I posao radi.
I won't tell you anything about it.	Neću vam ništa reći o tome.
I don't want to see anyone.	Ne želim nikoga da vidim.
Did he mean you?	Da li je mislio na vas?
They told him to leave.	Rekli su mu da ode.
I'm afraid nothing good.	Bojim se da ništa dobro.
He just doesn't know.	On jednostavno ne zna.
We really don't know what happened.	Zaista ne znamo šta se dogodilo.
I would never expect anything from you.	Nikad ne bih očekivao od tebe.
There is a good reason.	Postoji dobar razlog.
Everyone knows how much we like it here.	Svi znaju koliko nam se ovdje sviđa.
But there was no time for that.	Ali nije bilo vremena za to.
None of us were sure what to say.	Niko od nas nije bio siguran šta da kaže.
What do you want, he wondered.	Šta hoćeš, pitao se.
So this is very good for that.	Tako da je ovo jako dobro za to.
I know you were just a good friend.	Znam da si samo bio dobar prijatelj.
I better go now.	Bolje da idem sada.
Besides, it was just another day.	Osim toga, bio je to samo još jedan dan.
I couldn't see well.	Nisam mogao dobro da vidim.
There would be nothing like real life.	Ne bi bilo ništa kao pravi život.
He was a good man.	Bio je dobar čovjek.
I haven't done anything good here.	Nisam uradio ništa dobro ovde.
But it could have been anyone.	Ali to je mogao biti bilo ko.
He would do it.	On bi to uradio.
I have to do more.	Moram učiniti više.
We knew who we were.	Znali smo ko smo.
I was like that.	Bio sam tako.
I hope he stays.	Nadam se da će ostati.
I wondered what she really said.	Pitao sam se šta je zaista rekla.
Will you help us?	Hoćeš li nam pomoći?
But she is what she is.	Ali ona je ono što jeste.
I don't know what they are.	Ne znam šta su.
But not too busy.	Ali ne previše zauzet.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisam mogao vjerovati u to.
He said good.	Rekao je dobro.
There are a lot.	Ima ih puno.
No, nothing yet.	Ne, još ništa.
I wasn't here last year.	Nisam bio ovde prošle godine.
I'll go home too.	I ja ću ići kući.
I'm tired of it.	Umoran sam od toga.
I've never seen that before.	Nikad to ranije nisam video.
Is she waiting for him now.	Čeka li ga ona sada.
And no one has ever seen that.	I to niko nikada nije video.
Apparently I didn't do it for the money.	Očigledno to nisam uradio zbog novca.
I'm afraid it's that simple.	Bojim se da je to tako jednostavno.
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
You will find something.	Naći ćeš nešto.
You've never been there.	Nikada nisi bio tamo.
All he could do was wear it.	Sve što je mogao je da je nosi.
You did your best !.	Dao si sve od sebe!.
I need this.	Treba mi ovo.
There was little.	Tamo je bilo malo.
It was something more.	Bilo je to nešto više.
And maybe he's right.	I možda je u pravu.
That's for a good day.	To je za dobar dan.
Your life is busy.	Tvoj život je zauzet.
But she wasn't and she wasn't.	Ali nije bila i nije.
Yes, yes, it must be.	Da, da, mora da je to.
He heard nothing.	Nije čuo ništa.
That is true enough.	To je dovoljno tačno.
I think he's afraid of that.	Mislim da se toga boji.
But you couldn't know that.	Ali to niste mogli znati.
He was the first.	Bio je kao prvi.
And so he came to me.	I tako je došao do mene.
I saw what was happening.	Video sam šta se dešava.
I just don't know how to do it.	Samo ne znam kako da to uradim.
I know exactly what you mean.	Znam tačno na šta misliš.
It is so.	To je tako.
I hope you get enough.	Nadam se da ćeš dobiti dovoljno.
And there isn't much to say.	I nema mnogo toga za reći.
For nothing.	Ni za šta.
Maybe he would go.	Možda bi otišao.
But it would take time and money.	Ali za to bi trebalo vremena i novca.
I want to know how the game plays.	Želim da znam kako igra igra.
Better that than nothing.	Bolje to nego ništa.
I'll be back soon.	Ja ću se brzo vratiti.
You weren't your own.	Nisi bio svoj.
There's so much more you don't know.	Ima još toliko toga što ne znaš.
Very much.	Veoma.
I wonder how long he's been here.	Pitam se koliko je dugo tu.
I don't know where he might be.	Ne znam gdje bi mogao biti.
Or he thought he had it.	Ili je mislio da ga ima.
What you need to do is.	Ono što treba da uradite je.
I don't have much money.	Nemam mnogo novca.
No one could say what happened.	Niko nije mogao reći šta se dogodilo.
I need a job.	Treba mi posao.
I can't trust him.	Ne mogu mu vjerovati.
How do we proceed?	Kako ćemo dalje?
I knew.	Znao sam.
I think it will be soon.	Mislim da će to biti uskoro.
But it can be anywhere.	Ali to može biti bilo gdje.
I've been there before.	Bio sam tamo ranije.
He is not one of you.	On nije jedan od vas.
It happens more and more.	Dešava se sve više i više.
He did so much.	On je uradio toliko toga.
He wanted to live.	Želeo je da živi.
We are not.	Mi nismo.
But that's exactly it.	Ali to je upravo to.
No one could see him, but neither could he see anyone.	Niko ga nije mogao vidjeti, ali ni on nije mogao vidjeti nikoga.
It never has and it never will.	Nikad nije i nikada neće.
Maybe she's here.	Možda je ona ovde.
But she didn't know why.	Ali nije znala zašto.
Maybe there is a new one.	Možda postoji novi.
Not much time.	Nema puno vremena.
He was tired, so tired.	Bio je umoran, tako umoran.
They haven't been here yet.	Još nisu bili ovdje.
But he's not here yet.	Ali još nije tu.
It's either there or it's not.	Ili je tu ili nije.
It won't work.	To neće raditi.
So much for that.	Toliko o tome.
The truth is as it was many years ago.	Istina je kao i prije mnogo godina.
I thought he was leaving.	Mislio sam da će otići.
We had a job and we did it.	Imali smo posao i uradili smo ga.
I can't be sure.	Ne mogu biti siguran u to.
That's why we're here.	Zbog toga smo ovde.
I should never have told you that.	Nikada ti to nisam trebao reći.
We can do whatever you want.	Možemo učiniti sve što želite.
I know that, now.	Znam to, sada.
But I mean it.	Ali mislim to.
She already told me no.	Već mi je rekla ne.
He has to go now.	Mora da ide odmah.
He knew nothing.	Nije znao ništa.
This was not supposed to be.	Ovo nije trebalo biti.
We should have seen him.	Trebali smo ga vidjeti.
He needed me.	Trebao sam mu.
It's usually easy to tell.	Obično je lako reći.
I think that's what he's trying to do.	Mislim da je to ono što on pokušava da uradi.
Live with it.	Živi s tim.
Nothing does anything.	Ništa ne čini ništa.
Not here.	Ne ovdje.
This is all.	Ovo je sve.
She didn't want to leave.	Nije htela da ode.
No, he couldn't talk now.	Ne, nije mogao sada da priča.
He also had something on him.	Imao je i nešto na sebi.
It's not in a few days.	To nije za nekoliko dana.
This job needed me.	Ovaj posao me je trebao.
But it doesn't have to be that way anymore.	Ali više ne mora biti tako.
Nobody does that anymore.	To više niko ne radi.
I love work.	Volim posao.
I have no doubt.	Ne sumnjam.
Maybe that's not true for you.	Možda to nije istina za vas.
He was looking for you.	On je tražio tebe.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
I mean still.	Mislim na i dalje.
But you're really going to be fine.	Ali stvarno ćeš biti dobro.
That's what it looks like, she said.	Tako izgleda, rekla je.
But there is no help.	Ali nema pomoći.
And it really can be, and maybe it isn’t.	I zaista može biti, a možda i nije.
That would be it.	To bi bilo to.
I've never seen them before.	Nikad ih prije nisam vidio.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I'm not sure, really.	Nisam siguran, zaista.
You and only you want.	Ti i samo ti hoćeš.
And that didn't happen.	A to se nije dogodilo.
Who knows you're with us.	Ko zna da si sa nama.
I'm just working.	Ja samo radim.
He will do anything.	Sve će učiniti.
He was looking for you.	On je tražio tebe.
There is nothing we can do.	Ne možemo ništa učiniti.
He thought so.	On je tako mislio.
Or maybe.	Ili možda.
They didn't do this.	Ovo nisu uradili.
When she wants to do something, she does it.	Kada želi nešto da uradi ona to radi.
I thought you meant it.	Mislio sam da si to mislio.
Probably can't handle it.	Verovatno ne može da se nosi sa tim.
I love to work.	Volim raditi.
This is actually not a good idea.	Ovo zapravo i nije dobra ideja.
I haven't seen it before.	Nisam to ranije vidio.
But now it's fine, he told himself again.	Ali sada je dobro, rekao je sebi ponovo.
I loved those things.	Voleo sam te stvari.
You still have them.	Još ih imaš.
What about you? 	Šta je s tobom?
he asked.	pitao.
Maybe that was the problem.	Možda je to bio problem.
That's not a problem.	To nije problem.
Except, it's not.	Osim, nije.
Or right away.	Ili odmah.
How are you.	Kako si.
I thought he was leaving.	Mislio sam da će otići.
Just one of you.	Samo jedan od vas.
It's not like that.	Nije kako je.
I saw it.	Video sam to.
I do not know.	Ne znam.
This is going to be hard.	Ovo će biti teško.
I will not do that.	Neću to učiniti.
He wasn't home yet.	Još nije bio kod kuće.
Enough with that.	Dosta s tim.
No idea.	Nema pojma.
But that's what's happening here.	Ali to se ovde dešava.
I told him no.	Rekao sam mu ne.
And you.	I ti si.
I know everything.	Ja znam sve.
I'm really doing this.	Zaista radim ovo.
All this, and more.	Sve ovo, i još mnogo toga.
She can do better than that.	Ona može bolje od toga.
Like now.	Kao i sada.
You did it.	Ti si to napravio.
He didn't ask about me.	Nije pitao za mene.
We will definitely win.	Sigurno ćemo pobijediti.
We are not what happens to us.	Mi nismo ono što nam se dešava.
Everyone knows by now.	Svi znaju do sada.
Maybe he didn't think so.	Možda on nije tako mislio.
I would love that.	Voleo bih to.
So will everyone.	Tako će i svi.
I hope you come back.	Nadam se da ćeš se vratiti.
This is all he can do.	Ovo je sve što može.
We will never return.	Nikada se nećemo vratiti.
I don't know if that's a good thing.	Ne znam da li je to dobra stvar.
I'm sure not.	Siguran sam da ne.
No one could say why they were there.	Niko nije mogao reći zašto su tamo.
But that's him.	Ali to je on.
I see nothing more we can do now.	Ne vidim ništa više što sada možemo učiniti.
Right in the afternoon.	Odmah popodne.
Now you know.	Sada znaš.
I was too surprised.	Bio sam previše iznenađen.
Few people know that.	Malo ljudi to zna.
Nobody knew what could be done.	Niko nije znao šta se može učiniti.
She can't do that.	Ona to ne može.
I can't say anything yet.	Ne mogu još ništa reći.
She didn't say that much, and she never will.	Nije rekla toliko, i nikada neće.
Tell me why.	Reci mi zašto.
It's like that.	To je kao da.
I knew it was happening.	Znao sam da se to dešava.
That would be like your father.	To bi bilo kao tvoj otac.
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
The problem is money.	Problem je novac.
I knew he knew that too.	Znao sam da je i on to znao.
Okay, he could do this right.	U redu, mogao bi ovo učiniti kako treba.
And this would be.	I ovo bi bilo.
That might help.	To bi moglo pomoći.
My father was never a happy man.	Moj otac nikada nije bio sretan čovjek.
He didn't want to talk.	Nije želio razgovarati.
What do you think.	Šta mislite.
What did they do to me.	Šta su mi uradili.
The question is what can be done.	Pitanje je šta se može učiniti.
I should have known better.	Trebao sam znati bolje.
Someone is here.	Neko je ovde.
he asked.	pitao.
And in fact, he loved it.	I u stvari, voleo je to.
I'll tell you it's happening.	Reći ću ti da se to dešava.
He always says that.	On to uvek kaže.
Maybe not.	Možda i ne bi.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
You should know.	Trebao bi znati.
I hope you come back soon !.	Nadam se da ćeš se uskoro vratiti!.
He did not ask what the reason was.	Nije pitao šta je razlog.
Someone had to.	Neko je morao.
But it won't be that simple.	Ali to neće biti tako jednostavno.
Really? 	Zaista?
you said.	ti si rekao.
It's pretty easy.	Prilično je lako.
They knew about the work we were doing.	Znali su za posao koji radimo.
It was so simple what he was doing.	Bilo je tako jednostavno to što je radio.
Maybe that was good.	Možda je to bilo dobro.
You're back.	Vratio si se.
I actually went there.	Ja sam zapravo otišao tamo.
I want to tell you even more.	Želim da ti kažem još više.
It is true that man himself knows how to live.	Istina je da čovjek sam zna da živi.
I guess that's all for now.	Pretpostavljam da je to za sada sve.
They said they would do this.	Rekli su da će ovo uraditi.
The team moves on.	Tim ide dalje.
He was alone.	Bio je sam.
I seem to have thought so.	Čini mi se da sam to mislio.
He wanted a better life for himself.	Želio je sebi bolji život.
I can't say anything about that.	Ne mogu ništa reći o tome.
Maybe that’s exactly the way you think it should be.	Možda je to upravo način na koji mislite da bi trebalo da bude.
But we know we have a life.	Ali znamo da imamo život.
They didn't know it.	Oni to nisu znali.
But it's not about that anymore.	Ali više se ne radi o tome.
I do not have anyone.	Nemam nikoga.
It wasn't much.	Nije bilo mnogo.
Maybe he even loves you.	Možda te čak i voli.
Not so with me.	Nije tako sa mnom.
And well, it was for me.	I dobro, bilo je za mene.
Not that there are many.	Nije da ima mnogo.
And he knew so much about so much.	I znao je toliko o toliko.
You're doing it right.	Radiš to kako treba.
Not even for myself.	Čak ni za sebe.
Everything works.	Sve radi.
So it was the following year.	Tako je bilo i sljedeće godine.
I have my own car.	Imam svoj auto.
I want you to do what you want.	Želim da radiš ono što želiš.
He heard nothing.	Nije čuo ništa.
Good job, if you can get it.	Dobar posao, ako ga možete dobiti.
I'm back.	Vratio sam se.
I don't know where he is right now.	Ne znam gdje je trenutno.
Maybe it will be you.	Možda ćeš to biti i ti.
And that's bad.	I to je loše.
He loves you very much.	On te mnogo voli.
In fact, there is a problem.	U stvari, tu je problem.
I'm not sure.	Nisam siguran.
He will not come.	On neće doći.
But no, no one was like her.	Ali ne, niko nije bio kao ona.
He loves us very much.	On nas mnogo voli.
But it couldn't be.	Ali nije moglo biti.
We have enough of them.	Imamo ih dovoljno.
We did a good job.	Uradili smo dobar posao.
So ready for me.	Tako spreman za mene.
But they didn't do it.	Ali oni to nisu uradili.
I wish we had more time.	Voleo bih da smo imali više vremena.
I already bought it.	Već sam ga kupio.
I do it a lot.	Ja to radim dosta.
It never, ever happened.	Nikad, nikad se nije dogodilo.
More than the day before.	Više nego dan ranije.
I don't.	Ja ne .
I'm not ready to talk to you yet.	Nisam još spreman razgovarati s tobom.
And someone did.	I neko jeste.
Difficult question!	Teško pitanje!
But it wasn't even that.	Ali nije bilo ni to.
But it is neither here nor there.	Ali to nije ni ovdje ni tamo.
But more needs to be done.	Ali mora se učiniti više.
Actually, she didn't know what this was.	Zapravo, nije znala šta je ovo.
We'll both be better tomorrow.	Sutra ćemo oboje biti bolje.
They are no longer without money.	Oni više nisu bez novca.
He wants more people tonight.	Večeras želi više ljudi.
Not even this.	Čak ni ovo.
We have done a lot today.	Danas smo mnogo uradili.
We never would.	Ne bismo nikada.
I will be his father.	Ja ću mu biti otac.
I'm going to be a bad guy.	Ja ću biti loš momak.
That was the story here too.	To je bila priča i ovdje.
What was the reason?	Šta je bio razlog?
I didn't know until today.	Nisam znao do danas.
Now he decided that was enough.	Sada je odlučio da je dosta.
You would too.	I ti bi.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
You can do more than you think.	Možete učiniti više nego što mislite.
So it can be done.	Tako da se to može uraditi.
And never will.	I nikad neće.
He says everything will be fine.	Kaže da će sve biti u redu.
I did it.	Ja sam to napravio.
He didn't know.	Nije znao.
I had it.	Imao sam je.
But they are very sure.	Ali oni su veoma sigurni.
I don't know if it works or not.	Ne znam da li radi ili ne.
I want her there.	Želim je tamo.
But we don't do that.	Ali mi to ne radimo.
I will do it.	Ja ću to uraditi.
It will give us more time together.	To će nam dati više vremena zajedno.
So there is little we can do.	Tako da malo toga možemo učiniti.
He was probably already gone, she would be fine.	Vjerovatno je već otišao, ona bi bila dobro.
This is a new team.	Ovo je novi tim.
That's what they did.	To je ono što su uradili.
We are both.	Oboje smo.
None of this is easy.	Ništa od toga nije lako.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
He was looking for a job.	Tražio je posao.
It was more than that, much more.	Bilo je to više od toga, mnogo više.
No! 	Ne!
But it works well.	Ali radi dobro.
I'm really glad to see you.	Zaista mi je drago da te vidim.
It wasn't as easy to do as he thought.	To nije bilo tako lako učiniti kao što je mislio.
I didn't see it.	Nisam to vidio.
I just couldn't.	Jednostavno nisam mogao.
You know he can't.	Znaš da ne može.
You never know what might happen.	Nikad ne znaš šta bi se moglo dogoditi.
It could be done quickly.	Moglo bi se brzo uraditi.
He had never heard of such a thing.	Nikad nije čuo za tako nešto.
It won't be that easy.	To neće biti tako jednostavno.
For me.	Za mene.
Do only what you want.	Radite samo ono što želite.
I hope you like the new job.	Nadam se da ti se sviđa novi posao.
And with that, you didn't do anything.	I s tim, ništa niste uradili.
You could have told him exactly what you thought.	Mogao si mu reći tačno šta misliš.
I'm sure we can do that.	Siguran sam da to možemo učiniti.
I know he's my friend.	Znam da mi je prijatelj.
I don't work for you anymore.	Više ne radim za tebe.
I love doing my job.	Volim da radim svoj posao.
Actually a lot.	Zapravo mnogo.
Not much more now.	Sada ne mnogo više.
She does her job really well.	Ona zaista dobro radi svoj posao.
He should have known something was wrong.	Trebao je znati da nešto nije u redu.
The man is gone.	Čovjek je otišao.
That is true enough.	To je dovoljno tačno.
There is no one here.	Ovde nema nikoga.
You don't want to know why someone did something.	Ne želite da znate zašto je neko nešto uradio.
Like you said.	Kao što ste rekli.
This is a must see.	Ovo se mora vidjeti.
You really don't know.	Stvarno ne znaš.
And she never was.	I nikad nije bila.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
Until he was.	Sve dok nije bio.
Which wouldn't.	Što ne bi.
I want you to know it's not you.	Želim da znaš da to nisi ti.
Like me.	Kao ja.
But, really, anything would.	Ali, zaista, bilo šta bi.
I want to be sure.	Želim da budem siguran.
She was pretty good at it.	Bila je prilično dobra u tome.
Everything and nothing.	Sve i ništa.
Little by little, he began to speak.	Malo po malo, počeo je da govori.
Obviously this is happening.	Očigledno se to dešava.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
And she's good.	I ona je dobra.
This time he was safe.	Ovaj put je bio siguran.
He only had three houses.	Imao je samo tri kuće.
He hasn't said anything so far.	Do sada nije ništa rekao.
But not from people.	Ali ne od ljudi.
Very often.	Vrlo često.
I'm not so surprised.	Nisam toliko iznenađen.
But he would come back.	Ali on bi se vratio.
No one promised.	Niko nije obećao.
It doesn't have to be.	Ne mora biti.
Maybe it was.	Možda je bilo.
This is your lucky day.	Ovo je tvoj sretan dan.
This is my friend.	Ovo je moj prijatelj.
She is alone.	Ona je sama.
They said it wasn't a problem.	Rekli su da nije problem.
I was glad to see that.	Bilo mi je drago to vidjeti.
It doesn't work that easy.	Ne radi tako jednostavno.
I do not know either.	Ne znam ni ja.
But more than that.	Ali više od toga.
Three or more.	Tri ili više.
I was fine with that.	Bio sam u redu sa tim.
I was nothing to him.	Nisam mu bila ništa.
I don't know for sure.	Ne znam sigurno.
I won't talk to you for long.	Neću još dugo razgovarati s tobom.
Work together if you can.	Radite zajedno, ako možete.
He doesn't want to talk to me.	Ne želi razgovarati sa mnom.
Please we have a few more stories.	Molim vas da imamo još nekoliko priča.
Very good, very good.	Vrlo dobro, vrlo dobro.
I'm sure he's working with you.	Siguran sam da radi sa tobom.
You can't be helped.	Ne može ti se pomoći.
I'm glad he's gone.	Drago mi je da je otišao.
I'm not ready now.	Nisam sada spreman.
I did the right thing.	Uradio sam pravu stvar.
And it's not good.	I nije dobro.
He wasn't sure why he came.	Nije bio siguran zašto je došao.
I think you could do that.	Mislim da bi ti to mogao.
What are we doing now? 	Šta sada radimo?
They said nothing.	Ništa nisu rekli.
If you want.	Ako želiš.
.	.
Nobody needed it.	Niko nije trebao.
To tell me the truth.	Da mi kažeš istinu.
John is a good friend.	John je dobar prijatelj.
And he does things.	I radi stvari.
I wouldn't have that.	Ne bih to imao.
As the first.	Kao prvi.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
And it was very difficult for me.	I bilo mi je jako teško.
We both know who he means.	Oboje znamo na koga misli.
So are we.	I mi smo.
They are me.	Oni su ja.
You can, but not me.	Možeš, ali ne ja.
I just want to be sure.	Samo želim da budem siguran.
What's happening? 	Šta se dešava?
Please, just don't.	Molim te, samo nemoj.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Možda to i ne želi.
I have no idea how true that is.	Nemam pojma koliko je to istina.
We like that.	Sviđa nam se to.
Something about that.	Nešto o tome.
It just has to be you.	Samo moraš biti ti.
She has no idea what she's talking about.	Ona nema pojma o čemu priča.
I'd like him to come.	Voleo bih da dođe.
You must return.	Morate se vratiti.
But it wasn't always like that.	Ali nije uvijek bilo tako.
We haven't had time to do anything for a long time.	Dugo nismo imali vremena da bilo šta uradimo.
If not already.	Ako već nije.
Whether everything will be alright or not.	Da li će sve biti u redu ili ne.
That's what your father would want.	To bi tvoj otac želeo.
Looks like a good thing.	Izgleda kao dobra stvar.
I would say yours.	Rekao bih tvoj.
I'm not doing anything.	Ne radim ništa.
I can't do it tomorrow.	Ne mogu baš sutra.
For today, or.	Za danas, ili.
You have it.	Imaš ga.
It's just, it's not.	Samo, nije.
I'm not going.	Neću ići.
I'll find him.	Naći ću ga.
I looked good.	Izgledao sam dobro.
She knew nothing more.	Više ništa nije znala.
She just won't.	Ona jednostavno neće.
If we can’t give you what you want, we’ll tell you.	Ako vam ne možemo dati ono što želite, reći ćemo vam.
I'm here with you.	Ja sam sa tobom ovde.
Unless they are what you are.	Osim ako nisu ono što jesi.
He immediately realized that something was wrong.	Odmah je shvatio da nešto nije u redu.
I could tell.	Mogao bih reći.
As long as he's there.	Sve dok je tamo.
I know better.	Znam bolje.
So much to say.	Toliko toga za reći.
It simply cannot be done.	To se jednostavno ne može uraditi.
There was no one.	Nije bilo nikoga.
I didn't ask her.	Nisam je pitao.
He doesn't see her.	On je ne vidi.
New.	Novi.
It couldn't.	Nije moglo.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
I hope you find her.	Nadam se da ćeš je naći.
But it didn't happen that way.	Ali to se nije tako dogodilo.
How does he do it?	Kako on to radi?
I'm here for you.	Ja sam ovdje za tebe.
We don't have to tell him anything.	Ne moramo mu ništa reći.
They just know it's him.	Oni samo znaju da je to taj.
This was very good.	Ovo je bilo jako dobro.
Life for life.	Život za život.
I was pretty busy.	Bio sam prilično zauzet.
He should have lived.	Trebao je da živi.
I do not want.	Ne želim.
And everyone will know what you did.	I svi će znati šta ste uradili.
I'm quite glad about that.	Prilično mi je drago zbog toga.
Or were even there.	Ili su čak bili tamo.
That would be fine.	To bi bilo u redu.
You shouldn't do that, but you just can't help it.	Ne biste trebali to raditi, ali jednostavno ne možete pomoći.
This time can be better.	Ovaj put može biti bolji.
They were all there.	Svi su bili tamo.
I don't know what we did.	Ne znam šta smo uradili.
What will happen to you?	Šta će biti s tobom?
He didn't want to talk.	Nije želio razgovarati.
And so did he.	I tako on.
And they could.	I mogli su.
He did his best to help.	Dao je sve od sebe da pomogne.
That tells us very little.	To nam govori vrlo malo.
Besides, you can't do it.	Osim toga, ne možete to učiniti.
You went here.	Otišao si ovde.
That was it, now he saw it.	To je bilo to, sada je to vidio.
We would be.	Bili bismo.
But you shouldn't.	Ali ne bi trebalo.
But now he wanted more.	Ali sada je želio više.
She just doesn't know what it's about.	Ona jednostavno ne zna o čemu se radi.
That's the question, isn't it?	To je pitanje, zar ne?
But she didn't know it.	Ali ona to nije znala.
I'm not sure why it doesn't work.	Nisam siguran zašto ne radi.
I saw some of that from him.	Vidio sam nešto od toga od njega.
If you don't know what they are.	Ako ne znate šta su to.
That is hard.	To je teško.
But don't be long.	Ali nemoj dugo.
You never loved me.	Nikad me nisi volio.
Good or bad, it has its day.	Dobro ili loše, ima svoj dan.
Life was good.	Život je bio dobar.
Why did you come without telling us?	Zašto si došao a da nam nisi rekao?
He didn't know what to do either.	Ni on nije znao šta da radi.
But for me it’s not a game.	Ali za mene to nije igra.
And further.	I dalje.
As if he's not here.	Kao i da nije ovde.
We need some time.	Treba nam malo vremena.
He meant it.	Mislio je to.
It's here .	Tu je .
I said I should buy one.	Rekao sam da bi trebao kupiti jedan.
I just did the job.	Samo sam uradio posao.
You know what's in there.	Znaš šta je tamo.
Do it for yourself.	Uradi to za sebe.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
I don't see the problem.	Ne vidim problem.
You won't know for a while.	Nećeš znati neko vrijeme.
I wouldn't do that.	Ne bih to uradio.
That's really it.	To je to zaista.
It was not easy for him.	Nije mu bilo lako.
It shouldn't have been done either.	Ni to nije trebalo uraditi.
They were better.	Bili su bolji.
They shouldn't have.	Nisu trebali.
I wish he could.	Voleo bih da može.
I know you got one.	Znam da si dobio jedan.
I wonder what they did with it.	Pitam se šta su uradili sa tim.
He told himself to go for it.	Rekao je sebi da ide na to.
It's as good as it is.	Dobro je koliko i jeste.
He didn't see her.	Nije je vidio.
Business as good as yours.	Posao dobar kao i tvoj.
Now to work.	Sada na posao.
I’m not saying it’s going to happen.	Ne kažem da će se to dogoditi.
He could have easily said that.	Mogao je to lako reći.
And he never saw it.	I nikad to nije video.
She knew she couldn't do it.	Znala je da to ne može učiniti.
Yes to all of that.	Da za sve to.
If it does, the team should be fine.	Ako to uradi, tim bi trebao biti u redu.
They did nothing.	Ništa nisu uradili.
Not sure what to think.	Nije siguran šta da misli.
Everyone seems to.	Čini se da svi.
We said it was nothing.	Rekli smo da to nije ništa.
He thought.	Mislio je.
He works harder than anyone who works for him.	Radi više od bilo koga ko radi za njega.
So you can really see what's going on.	Tako da zaista možete vidjeti šta se dešava.
And that's exactly the problem.	I upravo je to problem.
He would arrive on time.	Stigao bi na vrijeme.
But he didn't say that.	Ali on to nije rekao.
I would be happy to have it.	Bio bih sretan da ga imam.
I can.	Mogu.
Everything we have, you would have.	Sve što mi imamo, imali biste i vi.
You were absolutely right.	Bio si potpuno u pravu.
I've never been there before.	Nikad prije nisam bio tamo.
He probably wouldn't expect that.	Vjerovatno to ne bi očekivao.
This is a story only time can tell.	Ovo je priča koju samo vrijeme može reći.
Time goes by really fast.	Vrijeme zaista brzo ide.
It wasn't very difficult.	Nije bilo jako teško.
You don't like that one.	Ne sviđa ti se taj.
And she would.	I ona bi.
I need you to know something.	Moram da znaš nešto.
It must be a matter of time.	Sigurno je samo pitanje vremena.
That should help a lot.	To bi trebalo mnogo da pomogne.
Enough time.	Dovoljno vremena.
He saw it.	Video je to.
He can see too much.	On može vidjeti previše.
I haven't finished my work yet.	Još nisam završio svoj posao.
The story is there.	Priča je tamo.
There's nothing you can do.	Ne možeš ništa da uradiš.
Apparently they didn't.	Očigledno nisu.
I mean never.	Mislim nikad.
Or tried.	Ili pokušao.
You have to do something.	Moraš nešto da uradiš.
I worked there.	Radio sam tamo.
There was only one man there who could be him.	Tamo je bio samo jedan čovjek koji bi mogao biti on.
I'm pretty sure.	Prilično sam siguran.
This is exactly what he needed.	Ovo je upravo ono što mu je trebalo.
If someone can help me.	Ako mi neko pomogne.
He loves them.	On ih voli.
Another is gone, and another.	Još jedan je otišao, i još jedan.
There is so much to do.	Ima toliko toga da se uradi.
There is no one there either.	Ni tamo nema nikoga.
No, it's not me.	Ne, nisam ja.
I didn’t want to tell him how good it was for him.	Nisam želio da mu kažem koliko je dobro za njega.
And maybe you're one too.	A možda ste i vi jedan.
There was more.	Bilo je i više.
I'm here with you.	Ovde sam sa tobom.
He's just driving.	On se samo vozi.
Dan.	Dan.
I did a pretty good job.	Uradio sam prilično dobar posao.
I can not see anything.	Ne vidim ništa.
Only you know.	Samo ti znaš.
Life is good.	Život je dobar.
I didn't think anyone else lived here.	Nisam mislio da još neko živi ovdje.
I don't know what the problem is.	Ne znam u čemu je problem.
Usually he could.	Obično je to mogao.
But that's probably not here.	Ali to nije vjerovatno ovdje.
Do we have to do something right?	Mora da radimo nešto kako treba?
I wish you had told me about this.	Voleo bih da si mi rekao za ovo.
That was one.	To je bio jedan.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Jeste li sigurni da želite ovo učiniti?
And it really is, the more the better.	I zaista jeste, što više to bolje.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
He returned the following year.	Sljedeće godine se vratio.
But there was something even better.	Ali bilo je nešto još bolje.
Not that there were more.	Nije da ih je više bilo.
I never went back.	Nikada se nisam vratio.
I say yes people.	Ja kažem da ljudi.
He made it look easy there.	Napravio je da izgleda lako tamo.
Or both.	Ili oboje.
I have to go soon.	Moram da idem uskoro.
What he just said himself.	Ono što je upravo sam rekao.
You know you will.	Znaš da ćeš.
This is for both of you.	Ovo je za vas oboje.
What is she doing?	Šta to ona radi?
He knows it's not good for him.	Zna da to nije dobro za njega.
That's the way.	To je način.
I never wanted that, you know.	Nikad to nisam želeo, znaš.
We know the truth.	Znamo istinu.
This is no time for fun.	Ovo nije vrijeme za zabavu.
The problem was that he was right.	Problem je bio što je bio u pravu.
For fun.	Za zabavu.
But you did it.	Ali ti si to uradio.
I'm not going now.	Ne idem sada.
He's here.	On je ovde.
Someone will come.	Neko će doći.
If there ever is.	Ako ikada bude.
You have to do this.	Moraš ovo da uradiš.
I still do it often.	I dalje to često radim.
I want to work for you.	Želim da radim za tebe.
I was a little sorry for him.	Bilo mi ga je malo žao.
I never saw her again.	Nikad je više nisam video.
He won't tell me no.	Neće mi reći ne.
Really a lot.	Zaista mnogo.
I said one of us had to do something.	Rekao sam da jedan od nas mora nešto da uradi.
No one should.	Niko ne bi trebao.
There was only one.	Bio je samo jedan.
He should still be here.	Trebao bi još biti ovdje.
Work.	Posao.
Or maybe it was just me.	Ili sam to možda bio samo ja.
Someone was there.	Neko je bio tamo.
That is hard.	To je teško.
He came alone.	Došao je sam.
Now you can talk to him about what you need.	Sada možete razgovarati s njim o tome šta vam treba.
He will give it to you.	On će vam ga dati.
You were absolutely right this time.	Bio si potpuno u pravu ovaj put.
It was his first time.	Bio mu je to prvi put.
Just so people know it's still there.	Samo da ljudi znaju da je još uvijek tu.
Now this question.	Sada ovo pitanje.
My father is not happy.	Moj otac nije sretan.
Maybe, but not soon.	Možda, ali ne uskoro.
And for now, that's fine.	I za sada je to u redu.
That's the only thing that works.	To je jedina stvar koja radi.
I didn't tell him anything.	Nisam mu ništa rekao.
I knew he would do it.	Znao sam da će to učiniti.
I heard him say that himself.	I sam sam ga čuo kako to govori.
Maybe he's right.	Možda je u pravu.
I never knew so little about myself.	Nikada nisam znao tako malo o sebi.
But he didn't, he never could.	Ali nije, nikada nije mogao.
And he doesn't know anything now.	A on sada ništa ne zna.
I hope you are not alone tonight.	Nadam se da večeras niste sami.
I wasn't there.	Nisam bio tamo.
I hope someone can help me.	Nadam se da mi neko može pomoći.
I am happy today.	Danas sam sretan.
But there is something else.	Ali postoji još nešto.
He was good.	Bio je dobar.
To be happy.	Da budem sretan.
I like it very, very much.	Sviđa mi se jako, jako.
Yeah, that's not happening.	Da, to se ne dešava.
Not more than a few years.	Ne više od nekoliko godina.
Not that she knew about this, she wouldn't.	Ne da je znala za ovo, ne bi.
I couldn’t believe this was happening so fast.	Nisam mogao vjerovati da se ovo dogodilo tako brzo.
There were things that needed to be done.	Bilo je stvari koje je trebalo uraditi.
You heard me.	Čuo si me.
Without it, he will not know that he is not afraid.	Bez toga, on neće znati da se ne boji.
But there is no one who does everything.	Ali ne postoji niko ko radi sve.
It was unlikely.	Bilo je malo vjerovatno.
We need to do something, and fast!	Moramo nešto učiniti, i to brzo!
Car	Auto
That's it.	To je to.
But he knew little about it.	Ali malo je znao o tome.
But not about how to get there.	Ali ne o tome kako doći tamo.
Not much.	Ne mnogo.
Have a nice trip!	Sretan put!
This is a very good car.	Ovo je veoma dobar auto.
I'm still yours.	I dalje sam tvoj.
I didn't.	Nisam.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
To be better now.	Da bude bolje odmah.
And maybe a lot more.	A možda i puno više.
It has to be there.	Mora biti tamo.
You have enough.	Imaš dovoljno.
We know it can be done.	Znamo da se to može uraditi.
That was fine with me.	To je bilo u redu sa mnom.
I saw he was home.	Vidio sam da je kod kuće.
I think that's what it's about.	Mislim da se o tome radi.
Can't you come back next year?	Zar se ne možeš vratiti sljedeće godine?
And he wasn't there.	I nije ga bilo.
But obviously, that's not true.	Ali očigledno, to nije istina.
Do as much as you can.	Uradite koliko možete.
And there are a lot of them.	A ima ih dosta.
He told me he was tired.	Rekao mi je da je umoran.
I saw it.	Video sam to.
He often has to stay at home.	Često mora ostati kod kuće.
As if none of that is real.	Kao da ništa od toga nije stvarno.
I'm here for the first time.	Ovde sam prvi put.
They know we're here.	Oni znaju da smo ovde.
So it won't be in that. 	Tako da neće biti u tome. 
Anything is better than me.	Bilo šta je bolje nego što sam ja.
I think that could be the reason.	Mislim da bi to mogao biti razlog.
It’s a good idea if you like it.	Dobra je ideja ako vam se sviđa.
Apparently he wasn't, I'd say.	Očigledno nije bio, rekao bih.
I was here.	Bio sam ovde.
But that's enough.	Ali dosta je.
He got them first.	On ih je prvi dobio.
I hope you're doing well.	Nadam se da ti sve ide.
This is so small.	Ovo je tako malo.
But he couldn't do it alone.	Ali on to nije mogao sam.
Lots of things here.	Mnogo toga ovde.
She just said what she thought.	Samo je rekla šta misli.
Who was she? 	Ko je ona bila?
he wondered.	pitao se on.
And he knew.	I znao je.
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
I really hope he is well.	Zaista se nadam da će mu biti dobro.
But no, not really.	Ali ne, ne baš.
Like it's going to happen.	Kao da će se to dogoditi.
It would take some time.	Trebalo bi malo vremena.
There is nothing there for us.	Tamo nema ništa za nas.
I don't know why, exactly.	Ne znam zašto, tačno.
I doubt anything would be good.	Sumnjam da bi bilo šta dobro.
I'm sorry, but.	Žao mi je, ali .
I am working on that.	Radim na tome.
I better not go.	Bolje da ne idem.
But she has a problem.	Ali ona ima problem.
But that will not be enough.	Ali, to neće biti dovoljno.
It was much better.	Bilo je mnogo bolje.
He had to love them.	Morao je da ih voli.
I just didn't know what exactly he was doing.	Samo nisam znao šta tačno radi.
This works well.	Ovo radi dobro.
We don't need much.	Ne treba nam mnogo.
I don't know where he is.	Ne znam gdje je.
He is what we need.	On je ono što nam treba.
There must be more.	Mora da ih ima više.
But not mine.	Ali ne moj.
We told him about it.	Rekli smo ga od toga.
That is not enough.	To nije dovoljno.
Really.	Zaista.
And sooner than he expected.	I prije nego što je očekivao.
The job is good.	Posao je dobar.
We have to go tonight.	Moramo ići večeras.
I have no doubt about that.	Ne sumnjam u to.
He always had.	Uvek je imao.
But this may not be enough.	Ali ovo možda neće biti dovoljno.
You just said that.	Upravo si to rekao.
But I wouldn't say, I can't say.	Ali ne bih rekao, ne mogu reći.
No one had anything to say.	Niko nije imao šta da kaže.
I know he knew.	Znam da je znao.
There was no time for that.	Nije bilo vremena za to.
I didn't want to tell him.	Nisam htela da mu kažem.
I knew what they were.	Znao sam šta su.
We don't know anymore.	Sada više ne znamo.
I'll be there soon.	Doći ću uskoro.
I know that well enough.	Znam to dovoljno dobro.
We were fine there for a while, but something happened last night.	Neko vrijeme smo tamo bili dobro, ali sinoć se nešto dogodilo.
If you can help.	Ako možete pomoći.
It's going well.	Dobro ide.
That is the real problem now.	To je sada pravi problem.
Those who know don't talk.	Ko zna ne priča.
There should have been more.	Trebalo je biti više.
Nobody saw her.	Niko je nije video.
We shouldn't do this.	Ne bismo trebali ovo da radimo.
So far he is too.	Do sada je i on.
Or maybe there was something.	Ili je možda nešto bilo.
When he's good, he's really good.	Kad je dobar, zaista je dobar.
And it is simply not there.	A jednostavno ga nema.
And not in a good way.	I to ne na dobar način.
I don't know, I don't want to know.	Ne znam, ne želim da znam.
Not you, obviously.	Ne ti, očigledno.
He couldn't leave.	Nije mogao da ode.
I had none of that.	Nisam imao ništa od toga.
Not all, but there are many.	Nisu svi, ali ima ih mnogo.
But he did not leave.	Ali on nije otišao.
Don't talk but just see.	Ne govori već samo vidi.
What is that.	Što je to.
He says he won't go.	Kaže da neće ići.
I've never seen him before.	Nikad ga prije nisam vidio.
A lot of things happened today.	Danas se dogodilo mnogo stvari.
He seemed to see everything.	Činilo se da vidi sve.
That is so true.	To je tako istina.
This may or may not be a good thing.	Ovo može, ali ne mora biti dobra stvar.
Except not this time.	Osim što ovaj put nije.
I'm your friend	ja sam tvoj prijatelj
I saw that he was afraid.	Vidio sam da se boji.
This is obviously not true.	Ovo očigledno nije tačno.
I've never heard of such a thing.	Nikad nisam čuo za tako nešto.
Maybe you think so.	Možda mislite.
Maybe you will be.	Možda ćeš biti.
Like, I'm really sorry.	Kao, stvarno mi je žao.
And we have them.	I mi ih imamo.
They won't work.	Oni neće raditi.
Nothing happened.	Ništa se nije dogodilo.
Not only did he leave.	Ne samo da je otišao.
Why they had everything behind me.	Zašto su imali sve za mnom.
I know you want to go to work.	Znam da želiš na posao.
We have to do both.	Moramo da uradimo oboje.
As you were.	Kao što si bio.
That was true.	To je bilo tačno.
Want to see how it is?	Želite li vidjeti kako je?
I'm going a little.	Idem po malo.
I had to do this.	Morao sam ovo da uradim.
And no one came to see it.	I niko nije došao da to vidi.
And a lot of people.	I puno ljudi.
But it happens that way.	Ali to se dešava tako.
It must look really good.	Mora da izgleda stvarno dobro.
It doesn't work that way.	To ne radi tako.
If we ever.	Ako smo ikada.
Work on it.	Radite na tome.
It's simple.	To je jednostavno.
You should have seen him.	Trebao si ga vidjeti.
I asked him if anyone else knew about it.	Pitao sam ga da li još neko zna za to.
I can't tell you much.	Ne mogu ti puno reći.
That was probably enough.	To je vjerovatno bilo dovoljno.
It just wouldn't happen.	To se jednostavno ne bi dogodilo.
I couldn't see anyone.	Nisam mogao nikoga da vidim.
You need to talk to me.	Moraš razgovarati sa mnom.
What do you think we could do?	Šta misliš da bismo mogli da uradimo?
I wanted better for him.	Želeo sam bolje za njega.
That's probably what he should have said.	Vjerovatno je to trebalo reći.
I didn't ask her.	Nisam je pitao.
I certainly didn't.	Ja sigurno nisam.
This and much more.	Ovo i još mnogo toga.
You should come back with me.	Trebao bi se vratiti sa mnom.
In fact, it's pretty simple.	U stvari, prilično je jednostavno.
I'll tell you what they did.	Reći ću ti šta su uradili.
He still didn't have the path he wanted.	Još uvijek nije imao put koji je želio.
Do this, that or that.	Uradite ovo, ono ili ono.
But just more.	Ali samo još.
It could have happened.	Moglo se dogoditi.
I know how he thinks.	Znam kako on misli.
He knows perfectly well what he is doing.	On potpuno dobro zna šta radi.
That's what she said.	Tako je rekla.
I thought it was a good idea at the time.	Mislio sam da je to bila dobra ideja u to vrijeme.
Or not alone.	Ili ne sami.
That is exactly what is happening.	Upravo to se dešava.
You can help me here.	Možete mi pomoći ovdje.
I can do it better than him.	Ja to mogu bolje od njega.
It wasn't easy before.	Prije nije bilo lako.
And you are here.	A ti si tu.
He didn't leave.	Nije otišao.
She was still fine.	I dalje je bila u redu.
He doesn't think about tomorrow.	On ne misli na sutra.
I had no idea what was going to happen.	Nisam imao pojma šta će se dogoditi.
He's not happy.	Nije sretan.
He will never talk to you again.	Nikada više neće razgovarati s tobom.
Do what you have to.	Uradi šta moraš.
That is still true today.	To je i danas stvarno.
Maybe that was the problem.	Možda je to bio problem.
Yes, they should.	Da, trebali bi.
But they were not new.	Ali nisu bili novi.
That is no longer true.	To više nije istina.
We can help you.	Možemo vam pomoći.
Something happened to him.	Nešto mu se dogodilo.
He said he heard something.	Rekao je da je nešto čuo.
That's okay.	To je u redu.
He's obviously fine.	On je očigledno dobro.
This is what we need to do.	Ovo nam treba da radi.
It would be.	Bilo bi.
There are not enough of them.	Nema ih dovoljno.
I had to talk to him.	Morao sam razgovarati s njim.
It is no longer played.	Više se ne igra.
I saw it myself.	I sam sam to video.
It will either be found or not, but here.	Ili će se naći ili ne, ali ovdje.
Pretty long.	Prilično dugo.
I wish you well.	Želim sve dobro.
Very few people know that.	Vrlo malo ljudi to zna.
And you're right.	I u pravu si.
I told him there was something wrong with that.	Rekao sam mu da nešto nije u redu s tim.
I'm busy this morning.	Zauzet sam jutros.
A person or thing that.	Osoba ili stvar koja.
That doesn't happen anymore.	To se više ne dešava.
I want to work on it.	Želim da radim na tome.
I just feel sorry for them.	Samo mi ih je žao.
They don't know what work is.	Ne znaju šta je posao.
And much more for sure.	I još mnogo toga sigurno.
He wasn't ready.	Nije bio spreman.
He was not a happy man.	On nije bio sretan čovjek.
Have you ever been there?	Jesi li ikada bio tamo?
But that is not the case.	Ali to nije tako.
Why would they want that?	Zašto bi to želeo?
That can't be true!	To ne može biti istina!
I guess it was me.	Pretpostavljam da sam to bio ja.
He needs to do that.	To treba da uradi.
You know how you can.	Znaš kako možeš.
And she does.	I ona to radi.
This can be quite difficult.	Ovo može biti prilično teško.
Now they know.	Sada znaju.
He can go on.	Može ići dalje.
I don’t think he was bad in himself.	Mislim da sam po sebi nije bio loš.
Very often they are the first.	Vrlo često su oni prvi.
Nothing could be done.	Ništa se nije moglo učiniti.
This is not true at all.	Ovo uopšte nije tačno.
They did this.	Oni su ovo uradili.
They will not leave.	Oni neće otići.
She is so good.	Ona je tako dobra.
But we can see that the time may come.	Ali možemo vidjeti da vrijeme može doći.
She knows exactly what to do.	Ona tačno zna šta da radi.
It's nothing.	To nije ništa.
Yes, that's a good idea.	Da, to je dobra ideja.
He wasn't good.	Nije bio dobar.
I went and did it.	Otišao sam i uradio to.
That's better for you.	To je bolje za tebe.
You just didn't see them.	Samo ih nisi video.
But that's okay, she told herself.	Ali to je u redu, rekla je sebi.
My money is on 'no'.	Moj novac je na 'ne'.
He doesn't do anything.	On ne radi ništa.
Or bad for you.	Ili loše za tebe.
She didn't know if she could do it.	Nije znala može li to učiniti.
Almost there, now.	Skoro tamo, sada.
I knew you would come.	Znao sam da ćeš doći.
But we do this.	Ali mi radimo ovo.
She works for me.	Ona radi za mene.
It seemed like it wasn’t going to happen now.	Činilo se da se to sada neće dogoditi.
He didn't expect a question.	Nije očekivao pitanje.
Not that he said when he would be here.	Nije da je rekao kada će biti ovdje.
He did everything.	Uradio je sve.
But we are still working.	Ali i dalje radimo.
Not much, but a few.	Ne puno, ali nekoliko.
I'm telling you it was too real.	Kažem ti da je bilo previše stvarno.
That's not right.	Da nije u redu.
I know what he wants and needs.	Znam šta želi i treba.
I don't do any of those things.	Ne radim ništa od toga.
That's right.	Tako ti je.
But he won't stay there.	Ali neće ostati tamo.
He never wants to see them again.	Nikada ih više ne želi vidjeti.
They don't know.	Oni ne znaju.
I wasn't there.	Nisam bio tamo.
He really is.	On zaista jeste.
That was pretty good.	To je bilo prilično dobro.
Nothing more to do.	Ništa više za raditi.
But you are mine.	Ali ti si moj.
Maybe that's the reason.	Možda je to razlog.
Hard to say.	Teško za reći.
Someone had.	Neko je imao.
There seems to be more waiting.	Čini se da se više čeka.
I'm nothing now.	Sada sam ništa.
And how to get it.	I kako to dobiti.
Not so good for you people.	Ne toliko vam ništa dobro, ljudi.
He was not well.	Nije mu bilo dobro.
I hope he comes back soon.	Nadam se da će se uskoro vratiti.
They know themselves.	Oni znaju sebe.
I think that's the one.	Mislim da je to taj.
Yes he was.	Da bio je.
But this is your day.	Ali ovo je tvoj dan.
There are probably too many people there, he said.	Vjerovatno ima previše ljudi tamo, rekao je.
You can never tell.	Nikad ne možeš reći.
It was just a question of when.	Bilo je samo pitanje kada.
The money must still be there.	Novac mora i dalje biti tamo.
He was very happy.	Bio je veoma sretan.
He knew what was coming.	Znao je šta će doći.
He doesn't do anything.	On ništa ne radi.
He knew his job.	Znao je svoj posao.
You'll never get it.	Nikad ga nećeš dobiti.
Which is not good.	Što nije dobro.
Besides.	Osim toga.
But even here.	Ali čak i ovde.
He had to tell him.	Morao je da mu kaže.
That, in fact, they were there.	Da su, u stvari, bili tamo.
It will be soon.	Uskoro će biti.
I didn't know what was going on.	Nisam znao šta se dešava.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
You didn't see anything.	Nisi ništa video.
That's the reason.	To je razlog.
I didn't realize that until now.	Nisam to shvatio do sada.
He didn't seem to have one.	Činilo se da ga nije imao.
And neither are we.	A nismo ni mi.
How much, they didn't know yet.	Koliko, još nisu znali.
I'm not sure why it doesn't work now.	Nisam siguran zašto sada ne radi.
You must leave immediately.	Morate otići odmah.
It took a few days.	Trebalo je nekoliko dana.
I needed it now.	Trebao mi je sada.
But they shouldn't.	Ali nisu trebali.
You know.	Da, znaš.
There they are.	Tu su.
I heard what you did.	Čuo sam šta si uradio.
We are human.	Mi smo ljudi.
But there is more.	Ali ima još toga.
We just had something.	Samo smo imali nešto.
Maybe it still works.	Možda i dalje radi.
But he couldn't see anything.	Ali nije mogao ništa da vidi.
He just loves me.	Samo me voli.
There was only one.	Bio je samo jedan.
We'll find him together.	Zajedno ćemo ga naći.
Now he needed time for himself.	Sada mu je trebalo vremena za sebe.
It really is what you are.	Stvarno je ono što jesi.
That will give us enough time.	To će nam dati dovoljno vremena.
I didn't even know what to say.	Nisam ni znao šta da kažem.
We can work.	Možemo raditi.
She knew what she wanted.	Znala je šta želi.
One guy said.	Jedan momak je rekao.
Have fun there.	Zabavi se tamo.
The thing was, he had no idea if he could.	Stvar je bila u tome da nije imao pojma da li može.
And he never came back.	I nikad se nije vratio.
I want it now.	Želim to odmah.
He didn't look surprised to see me.	Nije izgledao iznenađen što me vidi.
You have to do it this way.	Morate to uraditi na ovaj način.
It was obvious he had more to say.	Bilo je očigledno da ima više da kaže.
It's not like he didn't know that himself.	Nije kao da on sam to nije znao.
There aren't too many of them.	Previše ih nema.
Now you could.	Sada bi to mogao.
Like, really hard.	Kao, stvarno teško.
I have it here.	Imam ga ovdje.
This was not for him.	Ovo nije bilo za njega.
I have much more to give.	Imam još mnogo toga za dati.
Right now.	Upravo sada.
But it is.	Ali jeste.
He couldn't believe what he had done.	Nije mogao vjerovati šta je uradio.
Don't tell anyone what's really going on.	Ne govori nikome šta se zaista dešava.
A little.	Malo.
I know you can't help yourself.	Znam da si ne možeš pomoći.
And that's just the thing.	I to je samo stvar.
No one will.	Niko neće.
Three times more.	Tri puta više.
I'm asking you.	Pitam vas.
Which was good.	Što je bilo dobro.
I didn't and I won't.	Nisam i neću.
I think she has a good reason.	Mislim da ona ima dobar razlog.
I wanted it bad.	Želeo sam to loše.
She knows exactly why.	Ona tačno zna zašto.
Which couldn't be.	Što nije moglo biti.
Everyone knew about it.	Svi su znali za to.
He came.	Došao je.
I know there is more to it than that.	Znam da ima više od toga.
We never would.	Nikad ne bismo.
All that.	Sve to .
There is no help from anyone.	Nema pomoći ni od koga.
You can trust me.	Možeš mi vjerovati.
All about yourself.	Sve o sebi.
That's pretty true.	To je prilično tačno.
We were sure.	Bili smo sigurni.
They don't know how long.	Ne znaju koliko dugo.
It really was.	Zaista je bilo.
I never heard from him.	Nikad se nisam čuo s njim.
I definitely have to.	Sigurno moram.
I really like it.	Stvarno mi se sviđa.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Možda je to dobra stvar.
Maybe you alone.	Možda vi sami.
I bought another one.	Kupio sam još jedan.
And it's all for me.	I sve je za mene.
And now he was gone.	A sada ga više nije bilo.
I'm glad to see you!	Drago mi je da te vidim!
I'm afraid of that.	Bojim se toga.
And even more.	I još više.
But he was not there.	Ali on nije bio tamo.
He always does.	On to uvek čini.
Good so far.	Dobro do sada.
He didn't ask.	Nije pitao.
But she didn't say that.	Ali ona to nije rekla.
It looks like money.	Izgleda kao novac.
I did well.	Dobro sam uradio.
As it can be.	Kao što može biti.
He knew something was better for him.	Znao je da je nešto bolje za njega.
I know a lot of people.	Znam puno ljudi.
Let's do this together.	Uradimo ovo zajedno.
I will not say.	Neću reći.
No one is sure.	Niko nije siguran.
And that was true.	I to je bilo tačno.
If anyone can do it, so can she.	Ako neko to može, može i ona.
Or maybe he can, but not tonight.	Ili možda može, ali ne večeras.
This is not a game.	Ovo nije igra.
He knew a lot.	Znao je mnogo.
he said to himself.	rekao je sebi.
He did not come.	Nije došao.
And you know it.	I ti to znaš.
There wouldn't be enough for everyone.	Ne bi bilo dovoljno za sve.
This was not good.	Ovo nije bilo dobro.
He can talk, but he doesn't talk.	Može da priča, ali ne priča.
That will tell you a lot.	To će ti puno reći.
If the man saw it is not certain.	Ako je čovjek vidio nije sigurno.
I've never done that.	Nikad to nisam radio.
I don't see anyone here.	Ne vidim nikoga ovdje.
It seems not.	Čini se da nije.
Help for today.	Pomoć za danas.
You're the only one who can tell.	Ti si jedini koji može reći.
It's hard for me.	Teško mi je.
But not here, not now.	Ali ne ovdje, a ne sada.
I want to do the right thing.	Želim da uradim pravu stvar.
He did a pretty good job.	Uradio je prilično dobar posao.
He did it this morning.	Uradio je to jutros.
I just love them.	Samo ih volim.
She didn't want to talk about anything anymore.	Nije htela više ni o čemu da priča.
I hope he comes back.	Nadam se da će se vratiti.
They were together last night.	Sinoć su bili zajedno.
It works fine.	Radi u redu.
He had no life at home.	Nije imao život kod kuće.
I really love everything.	Zaista volim sve.
And now, now she knew more.	A sada, sada je znala više.
It's easy to say.	Lako je reći.
Not much, but we don’t do it for the money.	Nije puno, ali mi to ne radimo zbog novca.
He's probably right.	Verovatno je u pravu.
Except we're not.	Osim što nismo.
I am simply a man who has a job.	Ja sam jednostavno čovjek koji ima posao.
A lot is happening here.	Mnogo toga se dešava ovde.
We have what we need.	Imamo ono što nam treba.
He doesn't want to leave.	On ne želi da ode.
It still works.	Još uvijek radi.
For now, it seems to be working.	Za sada se čini da radi.
But you don't need my help.	Ali ti ne treba moja pomoć.
No one could help you.	Niko ti nije mogao pomoći.
Yes, it is true, he said.	Da, istina je, rekao je.
This is to be you and be sure.	Ovo je biti ti i biti siguran.
You shouldn't either.	Ni ti ne bi trebao.
My friend is here now.	Moj prijatelj je sada ovdje.
He's still there.	On je još uvek tamo.
We don't know what we could find there.	Ne znamo šta bismo tamo mogli naći.
This is a question.	Ovo je pitanje.
You have so much time.	Toliko imaš vremena.
But it was too much.	Ali bilo je previše.
Today no one is trying.	Danas niko ne pokušava.
This time, he thinks so.	Ovaj put, on to misli.
It's there.	To je tamo.
He would think.	Mislio bi.
She knew.	Znala je.
And they were probably right, he knew.	I vjerovatno su bili u pravu, znao je.
Nothing ever happens.	Nikada se ništa ne dešava.
More than you think.	Više nego što mislite.
It still goes on.	I dalje ide dalje.
But please.	Ali molim te.
It wasn’t something he did a lot of.	To nije bilo nešto što je mnogo radio.
But this is not the case either.	Ali ni ovo nije tako.
What it makes you want to do.	Šta to čini da želite da radite.
They had no idea.	Nisu imali pojma.
Just for work.	Samo za posao.
I really love them too much.	Zaista ih previše volim.
Very soon.	Mnogo skoro.
That's what we do.	To je ono što mi radimo.
And nothing can.	I ništa ne može.
He's talking about us.	On govori o nama.
You were both there, and you both know.	Oboje ste bili tamo, i oboje znate.
And this is not much.	A ovo nije mnogo.
I don't seem to be able to do this.	Čini se da ne mogu ovo da uradim.
To be able to do that.	Da bi to mogao.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
But there it is.	Ali tu je.
Where he was supposed to stay.	Gdje je trebalo ostati.
I said you need my help.	Rekao sam da ti treba moja pomoć.
Soon, very soon.	Uskoro, vrlo brzo.
And probably next month.	A vjerovatno i sljedećeg mjeseca.
We weren't.	Nismo bili.
But they are.	Ali oni su .
That's just not right.	To jednostavno nije u redu.
And it can be anything.	A može biti bilo šta.
And many times.	I to više puta.
The problem is that it certainly works.	Problem je što sigurno radi.
I didn't ask for this.	Nisam tražio ovo.
It took time.	Za to je trebalo vremena.
No one ever works.	Niko nikada ne radi.
That was fast.	To je bilo brzo.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
If you do, you know what you did.	Ako to uradiš, znaš šta si uradio.
He has arrived.	Stigao je.
Everyone will be here.	Svi će biti ovdje.
He would be his own again.	Ponovo bi bio svoj.
That's it.	Taj je.
He got the job.	Dobio je posao.
I'm pretty tired.	Prilično sam umoran.
And he's not the only one.	I nije on jedini.
But he saw nothing.	Ali nije video ništa.
I told you how it was.	Rekao sam ti kako je.
He immediately understood what was happening.	Odmah je shvatio šta se dešava.
Maybe that's it.	Možda je to to.
They had time.	Imali su vremena.
You could say.	Moglo bi se reći.
You can now return to work.	Sada se možete vratiti na posao.
I still don't know.	I dalje ne znam.
We certainly don't know that.	Mi to sigurno ne znamo.
Now she knows better.	Sada ona zna bolje.
He didn't want anything to do with it.	Nije želio ništa s tim.
He has many ideas.	Ima mnogo ideja.
Okay, you can come if you want.	Dobro, možete doći ako želite.
He went further.	Otišao je dalje.
Or maybe that was just me.	Ili sam to možda bio samo ja.
I have no thoughts.	Nemam misli.
And it actually works well.	I zapravo to dobro radi.
I'm so glad about that.	Tako mi je drago zbog toga.
No, I won't say that.	Ne, neću to reći.
But they knew where it was.	Ali oni su znali gdje je.
Or someone could.	Ili bi neko mogao.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
I couldn't say anything.	Nisam mogao ništa reći.
And it happened.	I to se dogodilo.
This can happen quite easily.	To se može dogoditi prilično lako.
He decided it would be day.	Odlučio je da to bude dan.
But that's not it.	Ali to nije to.
Now he could only wait.	Sada je mogao samo da čeka.
She knew everything.	Znala je sve.
He's the one who has to live with it.	On je taj koji mora da živi sa tim.
They were right.	Bili su u pravu.
He told me to do this.	On mi je rekao da ovo uradim.
There were too many people.	Bilo je previše ljudi.
It was true and it was not true.	Bila je istina i nije bila istina.
I really like it.	Jako mi se sviđa.
In fact, it's very easy.	U stvari, vrlo je lako.
Do them if you want.	Uradi ih ako želiš.
I have one here.	Imam jedan ovde.
I think it would be better if no one.	Mislim da bi bilo bolje da niko.
I got it.	Imam to.
I like it to be simple, but to be good.	Volim da bude jednostavno, ali da bude dobro.
None of us said anything.	Niko od nas nije rekao ništa.
Not just us.	Ne samo mi.
There is nothing better.	Ne postoji ništa bolje.
, '.	, '.
Only that.	Samo to.
This happened this year.	Ovo se dogodilo ove godine.
You're not doing everything you can.	Ne radiš sve što možeš.
One by one.	Jedan po jedan.
I didn't expect it to be like that.	Nisam očekivao da će biti tako.
Neither do you.	Ni ti mene.
It just has to be.	To jednostavno mora biti.
I wasn't home.	Nisam bio kod kuće.
You know it, but you don’t know it for good.	Vi to znate, ali ne znate za dobro.
It's hard to see.	Teško je to vidjeti.
I don't want you here.	Ne želim te ovdje.
I hope it's true.	Nadam se da je istina.
You had a good secure job.	Imao si dobar siguran posao.
She didn't know what to say or not say.	Nije znala šta će reći ili ne reći.
It is not enough to say.	Nije dovoljno reći.
So it has been so far.	Tako je bilo i do sada.
That was real.	To je bilo stvarno.
But you won't find me again.	Ali više me nećeš naći.
Probably even more.	Vjerovatno čak i više.
But now he has too much to do.	Ali sada ima previše toga da uradi.
It's not that simple.	Nije tako jednostavno.
But that was not the question.	Ali to nije bilo pitanje.
I had a lot to say.	Imao sam mnogo toga da kažem.
It's true and you know it.	Istina je i ti to znaš.
I don't know exactly how much we'll see.	Ne znam koliko ćemo tačno vidjeti.
And we need to do more than that.	I moramo da uradimo više od toga.
He couldn't and shouldn't.	Nije mogao i ne bi trebao.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda i nije.
I've never heard of such a thing.	Nikad nisam čuo za tako nešto.
She wants to be helpful.	Ona želi da bude od pomoći.
But not now.	Ali sada nije tako.
No one knew exactly what would happen.	Niko nije tačno znao šta će se dogoditi.
She is talking to me.	Ona priča sa mnom.
Maybe he can.	Možda može.
As it should be.	Kako treba da bude.
I know it's him.	Znam da je on.
I never understood why.	Nikad nisam shvatio zašto.
People know me there.	Ljudi me tamo znaju.
But it was.	Ali to je bilo.
They used to be like .	Ranije su bili kao .
He was just doing his job.	On je samo radio svoj posao.
More than ever.	Više nego što je ikada bilo.
She wanted to be there.	Tamo je htela da bude.
I'm too scared to do anything.	Previše se bojim da nešto uradim.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't.	Prilično sam siguran da on to ne radi.
I've been there before.	Bio sam tamo ranije.
I'm not really here.	Nisam stvarno ovdje.
It happens often.	Često se dešava.
I don't need long.	Ne treba mi dugo.
So it actually goes pretty well.	Tako da to zapravo ide prilično dobro.
You don't have to do anything!	Ne moraš ništa da radiš!
Its to much.	Mnogo je.
He's the day before.	On je dan ranije.
I don't want to be.	Ne želim da budem.
You are so good to us.	Tako si dobar prema nama.
You're good too.	I ti si dobar.
There really is no way it can be.	Zaista ne postoji način da to bude.
Maybe he knows something about it.	Možda on zna nešto o tome.
Or time.	Ili vrijeme.
That was something.	To je bilo nešto.
Unless something is done.	Osim ako se nešto ne uradi.
He did exactly what he had to.	Uradio je tačno ono što je morao.
And you know that.	I ti to znaš.
He didn't say more for a while.	Neko vrijeme više nije rekao.
I thought he would do it.	Mislio sam da će to učiniti.
You should do those things.	Trebao bi raditi te stvari.
I'm glad we're doing it.	Drago mi je da to radimo.
He was ready for it.	Bio je spreman na to.
But he never seemed to get enough.	Ali činilo se da mu nikad nije dosta.
For now.	Za sada.
He couldn't help it.	Ne bi mogao pomoći.
All this happened many years ago.	Sve se ovo dogodilo prije mnogo godina.
It seemed many years ago.	Činilo se prije mnogo godina.
I should know these things.	Trebao bih znati ove stvari.
It's not just us.	Nismo samo mi.
Nothing you want better.	Ništa što bi želio bolje.
Do it now.	Uradite to odmah.
Is it okay if.	Da li je u redu ako .
He knew that now.	Sada je to znao.
I didn't say that.	Nisam to rekao.
It was mine now.	Sada je bio moj.
It works, everything works.	Radi, sve radi.
We need to talk about it.	Moramo razgovarati o tome.
I can't even.	Ne mogu čak.
It's just not my thing.	Samo nije moja stvar.
But something seems to be wrong.	Ali čini se da nešto nije u redu.
The money was there.	Novac je bio tamo.
We have to make sure people are safe.	Moramo biti sigurni da su ljudi sigurni.
He wanted them to know that he liked the idea.	Želio je da znaju da mu se sviđa ideja.
I am totally in favor.	Potpuno sam za.
Life is now.	Život je sada.
They wouldn't do that.	Oni to ne bi uradili.
You did it.	Ti si to uradio.
And he knew it.	I on je to znao.
I still think we have that.	I dalje mislim da to imamo.
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to istina.
I was happy he was there.	Bio sam sretan što je tamo.
Maybe it’s just something that exists.	Možda je to jednostavno nešto što postoji.
I hope he gets better.	Nadam se da će mu biti bolje.
The problem is that they are not.	Problem je što nisu.
I want them to know that.	Želim da to znaju.
He's wasted enough time already.	Već je izgubio dovoljno vremena.
I'm sure he will.	Siguran sam da hoće.
Nobody knows, really.	Niko ne zna, zaista.
It's pretty good.	Prilično je dobro.
Tim loves him.	Tim ga voli.
We really can't do anything more than that.	Zaista ne možemo učiniti ništa više od toga.
I don't know for sure, and you certainly don't.	Ne znam sigurno, a ti sigurno ne znaš.
I asked if he did this.	Pitao sam da li je ovo uradio.
I'm telling you.	Kažem ti.
A little is enough.	Malo je dovoljno.
Like, I really like it.	Kao, stvarno volim.
You need to talk to me about it.	Moraš razgovarati sa mnom o tome.
And he was.	I on je bio.
Let me do it.	Da to uradim.
He wasn't even sure if he could say anything.	Nije čak bio siguran da li može nešto da kaže.
She loves school and can go.	Ona voli školu i može ići.
And there we are.	I tu smo mi.
You said you could.	Rekao si da možeš.
And yes, it's true.	I da, istina je.
It's good to see you.	Dobro je vidjeti te.
Not much, but a few.	Ne puno, ali nekoliko.
It could be so.	Moglo bi biti tako.
She knew she could say no.	Znala je da može reći ne.
We'll talk about that soon.	O tome ćemo uskoro razgovarati.
But this is not right either.	Ali ni ovo nije u redu.
I can do something for you.	Mogu učiniti nešto za tebe.
You really don't know.	Ti zaista ne znaš.
It would not be easy to work better.	Ne bi bilo lako raditi bolje.
I feel much better.	Čini mi se da mi je mnogo bolje.
They did more than that.	Uradili su više od toga.
I can't do anything good here.	Ne mogu da uradim ništa dobro ovde.
I know that's true.	Znam da je to istina.
That's not the right way.	To nije pravi način.
That's the reason.	To je razlog.
There was something.	Nešto je bilo.
I know it’s not easy, but you can make it look good.	Znam da nije lako, ali možete učiniti da izgleda dobro.
What, she didn't know.	Šta, nije znala.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
We have dinner tonight.	Večeras imamo večeru.
It's not really about that.	Ne radi se zapravo o tome.
Now that they were together, he didn't know what to do.	Sada kada su bili zajedno, nije znao šta da radi.
How long are we going to stay here?	Koliko dugo ćemo ostati ovdje?
He says.	On kaže.
And he's my friend.	I on mi je prijatelj.
Maybe too much.	Možda i previše.
I'm just saying.	Samo kažem.
It's pretty easy.	Prilično je lako.
But I can't.	Ali ne mogu.
I saw too much, not too much.	Video sam previše, ne previše.
To say the right thing.	Da kažem pravu stvar.
I don't like it here.	Ne sviđa mi se ovde.
You just were.	Samo si bio.
Nobody asked me that before.	To me niko ranije nije pitao.
It's hard to see.	Teško je to vidjeti.
He doesn't seem to have any friends.	Izgleda da nema prijatelja.
It doesn't always work.	Ne radi uvijek.
Apparently they didn't.	Očigledno to nisu uradili.
Maybe it's not you.	Možda nisi ti.
That's right, that's right.	Tako je, tako je.
I'm glad he's with me.	Drago mi je da je sa mnom.
He's here now.	On je sada ovde.
We can talk about it here.	Možemo razgovarati o tome ovdje.
He just told me.	Upravo mi je rekao.
This can't happen.	Ovo se ne može dogoditi.
She just didn't tell me.	Samo mi nije rekla.
Now that it really happened, he didn't say anything.	Sada kada se to zaista dogodilo, nije rekao ništa.
True, she didn't really know too much.	Istina, ona zapravo nije znala previše.
It was never a problem for me.	Za mene to nikada nije bio problem.
This time it is.	Ovaj put jeste.
He should be there.	Trebao bi biti tamo.
Something is obviously wrong.	Očigledno nešto nije u redu.
Who and where, how and why, when and what.	Ko i gdje, kako i zašto, kada i šta.
It's just not going to happen.	To se jednostavno neće dogoditi.
I was just thinking about you.	Samo sam mislio na tebe.
You told me that.	Rekao si mi to.
I have seen this happen many times.	Video sam da se to dešava mnogo puta.
Always exactly three.	Uvek tačno tri.
I like it a lot.	Mnogo mi se sviđa.
That's exactly what he wants to do with it.	To je upravo ono što on želi da uradi s tim.
It's hard to believe.	Teško je vjerovati.
We have enough.	Imamo dovoljno.
We do it.	Mi to radimo.
What was she on?	Na čemu je bila.
No, you don't have to do everything yourself.	Ne, ne morate sve sami da radite.
That has to come back.	To se mora vratiti.
This is the truth.	Ovo je istina.
I'll get one soon.	Uskoro ću dobiti jedan.
I'll help you tomorrow.	Pomoći ću ti sutra.
Nobody said.	Nije rekao niko.
It's a really simple question.	To je zaista jednostavno pitanje.
Better here than there.	Bolje ovde nego tamo.
This seems to be true.	Čini se da je ovo tačno.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda i nije.
You can tell me.	Možeš mi reći.
We have to hurry.	Moramo brzo.
That's right.	Tako je.
We know everything.	Znamo sve.
Is there anything else? 	Ima li još nešto?
We're.	Mi smo.
That way no one would see you.	Tako te niko ne bi video.
No, it's not that good.	Ne, nije tako dobro.
I'll say you said so.	Reći ću da si tako rekao.
It shouldn't be.	Ne bi trebalo biti.
You are something to see.	Ti si nešto za vidjeti.
This would not be right.	Ovo ne bi bilo u redu.
There was no time for anything.	Nije bilo vremena ni za šta.
I saw.	Vidio sam.
They didn't know he was here yet.	Još nisu znali da je ovdje.
It was her.	Bila je to ona.
This was fine with him.	Ovo mu je bilo u redu.
And he finished.	I završio je.
All right.	U redu.
But maybe it's just me.	Ali možda sam to samo ja.
Is that a.	Je li to a.
She doesn't know why she says that.	Ona ne zna zašto to kaže.
He's just a friend.	On je samo prijatelj.
As if we didn't have enough.	Kao da nismo imali dovoljno.
Life is waiting for you.	Život te čeka.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu ide.
It's just bad.	Jednostavno je loše.
Video can help you with that.	Video vam može pomoći u tome.
I know well.	Znam dobro.
I didn't have to tell him.	Nisam mu morao reći.
I have to say something.	Moram nešto da kažem.
Only, that's what was needed.	Samo, to je ono što je trebalo.
I'm really sorry.	Veoma mi je žao.
He will be at the party tonight.	On će biti na zabavi večeras.
Obviously he shouldn't be there.	Očigledno je da ne bi trebalo biti tamo.
He worked earlier today.	Radio je ranije danas.
Are you sure?.	Jesi li siguran?.
He had a few days.	Imao je nekoliko dana.
It’s a whole new life.	To je potpuno novi život.
But she has to go home.	Ali ona mora da ide kući.
I'm sorry, she says.	Žao mi je, kaže ona.
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to istina.
Not really, she said.	Ne baš, rekla je.
He decided.	Odlučio se.
But he doesn't want to help us either.	Ali ni on ne želi da nam pomogne.
It's just not safe.	To jednostavno nije sigurno.
That's how it should be.	Tako je i trebalo bi da bude.
No, that's not right.	Ne, to nije u redu.
They were both higher.	Oboje su bili više.
That is what is wanted.	To je ono što se želi.
It happened fast.	Dogodilo se brzo.
You never know what you'll find.	Nikad ne znaš šta ćeš naći.
I really want to do this.	Zaista želim ovo da uradim.
You can't just do that.	Ne možete samo tako.
Tom will do it by tomorrow.	Tom će to uraditi do sutra.
They didn't have it.	Nisu ga imali.
A little while ago.	Malo prije.
It’s just like that, and it’s okay.	To je jednostavno tako, i to je u redu.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
How could he at all.	Kako bi uopšte mogao.
I'm pretty happy.	Prilično sam sretan.
Work and life.	Posao i život.
I have an appointment.	Imam sastanak.
They were there at the time.	Oni su bili tamo u to vrijeme.
That will not happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
he asked.	pitao.
They should have been here.	Trebali su biti ovdje.
Maybe stay and work here.	Možda ostati i raditi ovdje.
If you think about it, it can certainly be done.	Ako na to mislite, to se sigurno može učiniti.
This has happened to me right now.	Ovo mi se dogodilo upravo sada.
I didn't expect to do that.	Nisam očekivao da ću to učiniti.
I love this a lot.	Volim ovo mnogo.
It's too easy.	Previše je lako.
So it won't work.	Tako da neće ići.
And you probably will.	I vjerovatno hoćeš.
Very good question.	Vrlo dobro pitanje.
That was not the question.	To nije bilo pitanje.
More than a few were not so easy.	Više od nekoliko nije bilo tako lako.
He may not think so, but he is.	Možda ne misli tako, ali jeste.
Which they did without me being there.	Što su i uradili, a da ja nisam bio tamo.
That was all she was to him.	To je bilo sve što je ona za njega.
It shouldn't be.	Ne bi trebao biti.
He had no idea how long before that.	Nije imao pojma koliko dugo prije toga.
We don't know who our father was.	Ne znamo ko nam je bio otac.
I loved her so much.	Toliko sam je volio.
He had his day.	Imao je svoj dan.
Why is she doing this?	Zašto ona ovo radi?
It was with him.	Bilo je sa njim.
So simple.	Tako jednostavno.
To which he must return.	Na koje se mora vratiti.
Something she said was wrong.	Nešto što je rekla nije bilo u redu.
In fact, they didn't know.	Zapravo, nisu znali.
I couldn't find it at the time.	Nisam ga mogao naći u to vrijeme.
But not bad.	Ali nije loše.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
But I can't find anything about it.	Ali ne mogu naći ništa o tome.
Here and here.	Ovdje i ovdje.
I didn't have time for that.	Nisam imao vremena za to.
It couldn't be.	Nije moglo biti.
I want you with me.	Želim te sa mnom.
He is.	On jeste.
It works really well for almost everything.	Zaista dobro radi za skoro sve.
And if there were three of them, that was a lot.	A ako ih je bilo tri, to je bilo puno.
You could have come home.	Mogao si doći kući.
I'll tell you something else.	Reći ću ti još nešto.
But he doesn't say.	Ali on ne kaže.
He will come tonight.	Doći će večeras.
I didn't feel sorry for her.	Nije mi je bilo žao.
What does she want from us?	Šta ona hoće od nas?
You need to work harder.	Morate više raditi.
If you are a new friend.	Ako ste novi prijatelj.
We can go back beyond that.	Možemo se vratiti i dalje od toga.
He decided he wanted me.	Odlučio je da me želi.
It was too much for me.	Bilo je to previše za mene.
She said maybe she did.	Rekla je da možda jeste.
And do it well.	I uradi to dobro.
Everything can be true.	Sve može biti istina.
You.	Vi.
I have no idea why it doesn't work now.	Nemam pojma zašto sada ne radi.
But she is.	Ali ona jeste.
I think that day will be soon.	Mislim da će taj dan biti uskoro.
It was like she was there.	Kao da je bila tamo.
You did just that.	Vi ste upravo to uradili.
But there was more.	Ali bilo je još toga.
I decided.	Odlučio sam.
Maybe you already know that, and maybe you don’t.	Možda to već znate, a možda i ne.
I wondered what he thought.	Pitao sam se šta on misli.
And there's a lot going on.	I tu ide mnogo toga.
I'm not doing this properly.	Ne radim ovo kako treba.
What year is this?	Koja je ovo godina?
I know it is.	Znam da jeste.
Tell me who did this.	Reci mi ko je ovo uradio.
It doesn't do anything other than that.	Ne radi ništa osim toga.
You've been in it for a long time.	Već dugo ste u tome.
I won't talk to you about it tonight.	Neću o tome razgovarati s tobom večeras.
This time he was actually there.	Ovaj put je zapravo bio tamo.
Or maybe he couldn't.	Ili možda nije mogao.
But a little more.	Ali malo više.
And he knows it.	I on to zna.
And they knew why.	I znali su zašto.
Now even more than before.	Sada još više nego ranije.
For me, it's not life.	Za mene to nije život.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
For a while.	Na neko vrijeme.
I just asked you what you want.	Upravo sam te pitao šta želiš.
This is not true.	Ovo nije tačno.
Can be.	Može biti.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
He obviously has something else to say.	Očigledno je da ima još nešto da kaže.
I really like the idea.	Zaista mi se sviđa ideja.
I'm surprised how well it works.	Iznenađen sam koliko dobro radi.
The idea is this.	Ideja je ovo.
I'm.	Ja sam.
You have to tell us something.	Moraš nam nešto reći.
It didn't seem to be.	Činilo se da nije.
Like me, she wants it.	Kao i ja, ona to želi.
And in fact, that may be the problem.	I zapravo je možda u tome problem.
I know what he does.	Znam šta radi.
I want more time.	Želim više vremena.
I'm sorry this happened.	Žao mi je što se to dogodilo.
I wonder why.	Pitam se zašto.
You're thirty.	Imaš trideset.
I would make you one.	Ja bih ti napravio jedan.
Maybe I won't be.	Možda i neću biti.
I thought it was just me.	Mislio sam da sam samo ja.
And if they are not, they are not.	A ako nisu, nisu.
I can never be.	Nikada ne mogu biti.
You can tell by.	Možete reći po.
They are still with me.	I dalje su sa mnom.
Me too, actually.	I ja, zapravo.
I wish you were.	Voleo bih da jesi.
Maybe not.	Možda i neće.
They will return.	Oni će se vratiti.
I'm so glad to be here.	Tako mi je drago što sam ovdje.
He's not happy about it.	Nije mu drago zbog toga.
I have to go.	Moram ići.
He didn't say that exactly, but.	Nije to tačno rekao, ali.
Yesterday was that day.	Jučer je bio taj dan.
I love you.	Volim te.
Where he wasn't sure.	Gdje nije bio siguran.
But it didn't happen that way.	Ali to se nije dogodilo baš tako.
I don't like the way it looks.	Ne sviđa mi se kako izgleda.
Tom is as busy as last year.	Tom je zauzet kao i prošle godine.
But even so.	Ali čak i tako.
It was her.	Bila je to ona.
Not to be.	Ne biti.
He wasn't there all those years.	Sve te godine nije bio tu.
I should have been with you.	Trebao sam biti s tobom.
Or started.	Ili počeo.
I just didn't want that life.	Jednostavno nisam želeo taj život.
They are human just like you.	Oni su ljudi kao i ti.
Have fun!	Zabavi se!
From us to you.	Od nas do vas.
He's here now.	Sada je ovdje.
Today is the first day, for now it is good.	Danas je prvi dan, za sada je dobro.
And he left.	I on ode.
One was today.	Jedan je bio danas.
It could be.	Moglo bi biti.
This is not good enough.	Ovo nije dovoljno dobro.
I want it to be so good.	Toliko želim da bude dobro.
Work, work.	Posao, posao.
It's actually very easy.	To je zapravo vrlo lako.
But he does a lot.	Ali pravi puno.
He will come.	On će doći.
And it works.	I to radi.
I thought it would be.	Mislio sam da će biti.
I was a little surprised.	Bio sam malo iznenađen.
The man didn't look surprised to see them.	Čovjek nije izgledao iznenađen što ih je vidio.
It was me.	Bio si ja.
That should be more than enough.	To bi trebalo biti više nego dovoljno.
And he said he wasn't the only one.	I rekao je da nije jedini.
I don't know how he knows, but he knows.	Ne znam kako zna, ali zna.
I know we can.	Znam da možemo.
No one had to tell me anything.	Niko mi ništa nije morao reći.
But really, I like it.	Ali stvarno, sviđa mi se.
You have to tell me the truth.	Moraš mi reći istinu.
I really wonder about this.	Zaista se pitam ovo.
It was a good thing.	Bila je to dobra stvar.
We had nothing to do with it.	Nismo imali ništa s tim.
We know what we did.	Znamo šta smo uradili.
Maybe he's your friend.	Možda ti je prijatelj.
And she's very good at it.	I jako je dobra u tome.
I'm there too.	I ja sam tamo.
And he was.	I on je bio.
He was not happy about it.	Nije bio sretan zbog toga.
That is exactly what is happening now.	Upravo to se sada dešava.
But he was really good.	Ali njega je zaista bilo jako dobro.
I'm glad you have money.	Drago mi je da imaš novca.
He couldn't tell what it was.	Nije mogao reći šta je to bilo.
I love you!.	Volim vas!.
Maybe too much.	Možda previše.
We know we have to help ourselves.	Znamo da si moramo pomoći.
Me, this is me.	Ja, ovo sam ja.
You can be sure that some of it will come back to you.	Možete biti sigurni da će vam se nešto od toga vratiti.
I haven't heard much about it.	Nisam čuo mnogo o tome.
Something was wrong, he knew it, without knowing why.	Nešto nije bilo u redu, znao je to, a da nije znao zašto.
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije.
I can't see it.	Ne mogu to vidjeti.
I see you have that.	Vidim da imaš taj.
It was too much for him.	Bilo je to previše za njega.
Was that it? 	Je li to bilo to?
Is that, yes.	Je li to, da.
I've worked for you long enough.	Radio sam za tebe dovoljno dugo.
If you need anything else, we’ll tell you.	Ako vam treba još nešto, reći ćemo vam.
It shouldn't be.	To ne bi trebalo da bude.
I didn't want to, but.	Nisam htela, ali.
I don't see it.	Ne vidim to.
But there is something else.	Ali postoji još nešto.
Like everyone.	Kao i svi.
They are not a problem.	Oni nisu problem.
We'll tell you how.	Reći ćemo vam kako.
But he could talk.	Ali mogao je da priča.
I don't think so.	Ne mislim tako.
I wasn't even home.	Nisam čak ni bio kod kuće.
It seems to me that this must be true.	Čini mi se da ovo mora biti tačno.
That doesn’t really talk to me.	To zapravo ne govori sa mnom.
I have nothing more.	Nemam ništa više.
They will never be right again either.	Ni oni nikada više neće biti u pravu.
But you don't know that.	Ali ti to ne znaš.
Not you.	Ne i ti.
See if you need it.	Vidi da li ti treba.
I would hear something.	Čuo bih nešto.
Or maybe it is.	Ili možda jeste.
I'm just not sure what.	Samo nisam siguran šta.
Which it probably does.	Što vjerovatno i radi.
But we do nothing.	Ali mi ništa ne radimo.
Maybe it's someone who didn't love me.	Možda je to neko ko me nije volio.
That, in fact, is what she wants.	To je, u stvari, ono što ona želi.
But there it is.	Ali tamo je.
I think so.	Mislim.
So could he.	Mogao bi i on.
I really don't want to see them either.	Ni ja ih zaista ne želim vidjeti.
There is so much to do.	Ima toliko toga da se uradi.
Don't say no.	Nemoj reći ne.
You were right the first time.	Bio si u pravu prvi put.
No one had a video.	Niko nije imao video.
I just got home when you came.	Upravo sam se vratio kući kad si ti došao.
For a while, that's all.	Neko vrijeme, to je sve.
He has.	On ima.
She didn't even know what it was anymore.	Više nije ni znala šta je.
And he did his best.	I dao je sve od sebe.
That wasn't really an issue.	To zapravo nije bilo pitanje.
I heard about it.	Čuo sam za to.
He should be back tomorrow.	Trebao bi se vratiti sutra.
She actually said it many times.	Zapravo je to rekla više puta.
That was not true.	To nije bilo tačno.
Not good for that.	Nije dobro za to.
Everyone but me.	Svi osim mene.
That's not how.	To nije kako.
He was very tired.	Bio je veoma umoran.
Or you had it.	Ili ste ga imali.
I shouldn't say anything.	Ne bih trebao ništa reći.
You did them well.	Dobro si ih uradio.
He had no problem.	Nije imao problema.
That's how it goes.	Tako to ide.
The one who told me she couldn't tell me.	Ona koja mi je rekla da mi ne može reći.
This has been a problem for some time.	Ovo je problem već neko vrijeme.
It's something you have.	To je nešto što imaš.
That's it.	To je ono.
We couldn't do anything.	Ništa nismo mogli.
I wish you wouldn't say that.	Voleo bih da to ne kažeš.
Don't say that now.	Ne govori to sada.
I don't know what to do, really.	Ne znam šta da radim, zaista.
I didn't mean you.	Nisam mislio na tebe.
But he will come.	Ali doći će.
There you are.	Tu ste.
Plus, it's pretty good for you.	Osim toga, to je prilično dobro za vas.
He seems quite happy now.	Sada izgleda prilično sretan.
But he did not come as she did.	Ali on nije došao kao ona.
Now she knew it wasn't like that.	Sada je znala da nije tako.
There was no one here.	Ovdje nije bilo nikoga.
It seems to work.	Izgleda da radi.
You are so happy.	Ti si tako sretan.
Yes, he's back.	Da, vratio se.
It could no longer be said.	Više se nije moglo reći.
Someone who didn't want him here.	Neko ko ga nije želeo ovde.
There was more.	Bilo je još toga.
I knew.	Znao sam.
That should have been enough.	To je trebalo biti dovoljno.
See if he comes back.	Vidi hoće li se vratiti.
You don't want that.	Ti to ne želiš.
I know how busy you are.	Znam koliko si zauzet.
I didn't know how to do it.	Nisam znao kako to da uradim.
Now everything is working properly for him.	Sada mu sve radi kako treba.
Like this.	Kao i ovo.
I mean, you know what he's gonna say.	Mislim, znaš šta će reći.
No, he wasn't like them.	Ne, nije bio kao oni.
You better do it.	Bolje da to uradiš.
It's hard to see what's wrong with that.	Teško je vidjeti šta nije u redu s tim.
I’d rather buy everything.	Više bih volio kupiti sve.
This was not what it was supposed to be.	Ovo nije bio ono što je trebao biti.
That's what you told me.	Tako ste mi rekli.
He just wasn't real.	On jednostavno nije bio pravi.
I do them all.	Sve ih radim.
This will be it.	Ovo će biti to.
Good job!	Dobar posao!
They had no idea why.	Nisu imali pojma zašto.
Only if you can.	Samo ako to možeš.
I do not know what to say.	Ne znam šta da kažem.
Maybe you shouldn't.	Možda ne bi trebao.
He knew she couldn't do it and you could.	Znao je da ona to ne može, a ti si mogao.
I'll.	Ja ću.
But it happened.	Ali dogodilo se.
This is my story.	Ovo je moja priča.
It was right here, right now.	Bilo je upravo ovdje, upravo sada.
He will come to me.	Doći će kod mene.
Put.	Put.
He would do anything.	On bi sve uradio.
Indeed, it is.	Zaista, jeste.
I'm not sure how that happened.	Nisam baš siguran kako se to dogodilo.
But it may not be much time.	Ali možda neće biti puno vremena.
It wouldn't be, it couldn't be, it can't be.	Ne bi bilo, ne bi moglo biti, ne može biti.
Or who she was.	Ili ko je ona bila.
I know there's more.	Znam da ima još toga.
We have to go now.	Moramo otići sada.
I need this.	Treba mi ovo.
It never will be.	Nikada neće biti.
And saw you and your life.	I video tebe i tvoj život.
But not so much.	Ali ne toliko.
Maybe better than, you know, anyone before.	Možda bolje nego, znate, bilo ko ranije.
I think it will be fine.	Mislim da će biti u redu.
But there was more to it than that.	Ali bilo je i više od toga.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo u redu.
Maybe the man was right.	Možda je čovjek bio u pravu.
If you don't like it, fine.	Ako ti se ne sviđa, u redu.
I knew that was it.	Znao sam da je to to.
Someone has to say that.	Neko to mora da kaže.
Was that so?	Da li je bilo tako.
I gave him mine.	Dao sam mu svoj.
I think you could do him good.	Mislim da bi mu mogao učiniti dobro.
Yes, we can talk.	Da, možemo razgovarati.
You say that.	Ti to kažeš.
He's gone now.	Sada ga nema.
He plays us.	On nas igra.
I love both.	Oboje volim.
But it's there.	Ali to je tamo.
Where is he now?	Gdje je sada.
I don't have to talk to you.	Ne moram razgovarati s tobom.
I've had enough of that too.	Dosta mi je i toga.
I would know the truth!	Znao bih istinu!
But it works for us.	Ali radi za nas.
You wouldn't tell me.	Ne bi mi rekla.
We all need to work on it together.	Moramo svi zajedno raditi na tome.
He will not return.	Neće se vratiti.
And she just told him she loved him.	I upravo mu je rekla da ga voli.
I don't want this.	Ne želim ovo.
He didn't want anything to do with me.	Nije želio ništa sa mnom.
I wouldn't know what to tell him.	Ne bih znao šta da mu kažem.
I don't have much to say.	Nemam puno za reći.
Now, we have to do it this way.	Sada, moramo to uraditi na ovaj način.
So it was for me now.	Tako je bilo i za mene sada.
This is one.	Ovo je jedan.
I had to do something.	Morao sam nešto da uradim.
But that's not the point here.	Ali to nije stvar ovdje.
I've certainly never heard that before.	To sigurno nikada ranije nisam čuo.
I will be with you.	Ja ću biti s tobom.
It would take something small.	Trebalo bi nešto malo.
I have.	Imam.
We should have talked.	Trebali smo razgovarati.
That's all he needs.	To je sve što mu treba.
That's not really right.	To u stvari nije u redu.
I don't know who.	Ne znam ko.
He said no.	Rekao je da nije.
I have my own.	Ja imam svoj.
He wanted it badly.	Želio je to jako.
He will help me a lot.	On će mi mnogo pomoći.
That's the only way to do it.	To je jedini način da se to uradi.
I knew better than that.	Znao sam bolje od toga.
And that this can happen multiple times.	I da se ovo može dogoditi više puta.
He knew what to do.	Znao je šta treba da uradi.
But if it is.	Ali ako jeste.
He couldn't or didn't want to say anything about it.	O tome nije mogao ili htio reći ništa.
They are really still there.	Oni su zaista još tamo.
Or more than that.	Ili više od toga.
I want you to tell me what you think.	Želim da mi kažeš šta misliš.
Maybe never.	Možda nikad.
You're still here.	Još si tu.
She lives it.	Ona to živi.
Maybe there were more.	Možda ih je bilo više.
That will never happen now.	To se sada nikada neće dogoditi.
It will be this one.	To će biti ovaj.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
I wouldn't want that.	Ne bih to želio.
I have no idea how that happened.	Nemam pojma kako se to dogodilo.
She said, it's you.	Rekla je, ti si taj.
I think he'll be here soon.	Mislim da će uskoro doći.
How would anyone know for sure?	Kako bi neko znao sigurno?
But that is not the case today.	Ali to danas nije tako.
They are no more.	Više nisu.
I was sure he would help me.	Bio sam siguran da će mi pomoći.
A lot could happen.	Moglo bi se dogoditi mnogo toga.
You should know this.	Ovo bi trebalo da znate.
It's still there.	Još uvijek je tu.
I'm not even sure what.	Nisam ni siguran o čemu.
You knew he would.	Znao si da hoće.
Now she knew why.	Sada je znala zašto.
Just say you don't want to.	Samo reci da to ne želiš.
In a way it is.	Na jedan način jeste.
Maybe you can help me.	Možda mi možeš pomoći.
Obviously it is.	Očigledno jeste.
I mean no you don't do that.	Mislim ne ti to ne radiš.
They can do both.	Oni mogu oboje.
You shouldn't do this.	Ne biste trebali ovo raditi.
But life goes on.	Ali život ide dalje.
I'm not done yet, and he's not done.	Ja još nisam završio, a on nije završio.
I never thought it was that bad.	Nikad nisam mislio da je tako loše.
Never do this.	Nikad ne radi ovo.
I didn't want anything to do with it.	Nisam želio ništa s tim.
Good good!	Dobro dobro!
Someone has to say what we did.	Neko mora da kaže šta smo uradili.
Here we are.	Tu smo mi.
I had a few.	Imao sam nekoliko.
I've never seen him look like that before.	Nikada ga prije nisam vidio tako da izgleda.
I hope that's not true.	Nadam se da to nije istina.
Or a car?	Ili auto?
She was fine.	Bila je u redu.
Not that year, not any year.	Ni te godine, ni bilo koje godine.
There really isn’t too much going on here.	Zaista se ovdje ne dešava previše.
Nothing is wrong.	Ništa nije u redu.
If you want me to do it.	Ako želiš da to uradim.
I really don't know what to do.	Zaista ne znam šta da radim.
It seems that so much could have happened.	Čini se da se toliko toga moglo dogoditi.
This cannot happen.	Ovo se ne može dogoditi.
None of you told anyone.	Niko od vas nikome nije rekao.
You will be mine.	Biti ćeš moj.
He says he needs money.	Kaže da mu treba novac.
But there is.	Ali postoji.
If you can do that, it's pretty simple, really pretty simple.	Ako to možete učiniti, to je prilično jednostavno, zaista prilično jednostavno.
I shouldn't have done that.	Nisam to trebao učiniti.
Nobody expected that.	Niko to nije očekivao.
I'm not sure what she is.	Nisam siguran šta je ona.
You're welcome.	Nema na čemu.
Really, that's enough.	Zaista, dosta je.
No, he decided.	Ne, odlučio je.
It was a job.	Bio je to posao.
I've seen enough.	Video sam dovoljno.
What is?.	Šta je?.
There is nothing to be desired here.	Ovde nema šta da se želi.
We were there and we did it.	Bili smo tamo i to smo uradili.
That's such a good thing.	To je tako dobra stvar.
I guess neither are you.	Pretpostavljam da nisi ni ti.
Or would he want that.	Ili da li bi on to želeo.
It hasn't been for a while.	Nije bilo neko vrijeme.
I'm sure that was true.	Siguran sam da je to bilo tačno.
He doesn't talk to me like he used to.	Ne priča sa mnom kao prije.
Only.	Samo.
If you can.	Ako može.
I wish we had more time there.	Voleo bih da smo tamo imali više vremena.
It's true, it's true.	Istina je, istina je.
I'm not sure what's wrong.	Nisam siguran šta nije u redu.
I don't have much more to say really.	Nemam mnogo više da kažem zaista.
Not much more than that.	Ne mnogo više od toga.
What did you say?	Šta si rekao?
That was actually true and they knew it.	To je zapravo bila istina i oni su to znali.
I don't do it that much.	Ne radim to toliko.
I can see for myself.	Mogu i sam da vidim.
There are always some.	Uvijek ih ima.
If they can do it, so can you.	Ako oni to mogu, možete i vi.
You can't be.	Ne možeš biti .
You have so much to say.	Imaš toliko toga za reći.
And that was what I arrived for earlier.	I to je bilo ono što sam ranije stigao.
I sure would.	Sigurno bi.
I have no idea what the problem might be.	Nemam pojma u čemu bi mogao biti problem.
That is what we have to work on.	To je ono na čemu moramo da radimo.
She didn't want to go there.	Nije htela da ide tamo.
And it works well.	I dobro radi.
I'm really sorry.	Zaista mi je žao.
This is not not for us.	Ovo nije ne za nas.
Or maybe it wouldn't.	Ili možda i ne bi.
Not here.	Ne ovde.
She knew she had to work fast.	Znala je da mora brzo da radi.
I was very tired.	Bio sam jako umoran.
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno si u pravu.
Good day to all.	Dobar dan svima.
Did he do the right thing? 	Da li je uradio pravu stvar?
he wondered.	pitao se on.
Yes, he would get to school.	Da, stigao bi u školu.
I can't say what she thinks.	Ne mogu reći šta ona misli.
It will never happen.	Nikada se neće dogoditi.
I began to wonder when that would happen.	Počeo sam da se pitam kada će se to dogoditi.
I will not do anything wrong.	Neću učiniti ništa loše.
He was happy to see him.	Bio je sretan što ga vidi.
I don't want to stay here.	Ne želim ostati ovdje.
And we don't know what to do.	I ne znamo šta da radimo.
More than good.	Više nego dobro.
He is telling the truth.	On govori istinu.
I was surprised.	Bio sam iznenađen.
Yes, she was.	Da, bila je.
He bought the car from a car dealer.	Auto je kupio od auto kuće.
It was just my life.	To je bio samo moj život.
I'm glad to see you,' he said.	Drago mi je da te vidim', rekao je.
And that says a lot.	I to mnogo govori.
He had to do this.	Morao je ovo da uradi.
But you know it was.	Ali znaš da je bilo.
We would never do that.	Mi to nikada ne bismo uradili.
She wants to play.	Ona želi da se igra.
I can see again.	Mogu ponovo da vidim.
He always says what he thinks.	Uvek kaže šta misli.
You not.	Ti ne.
I don't know if we can do much more.	Ne znam da li možemo učiniti mnogo više.
She really is.	Zaista ona.
So far so good.	Za sada je dobro.
That never happened.	To se nikad nije dogodilo.
Not from me.	Ne od mene.
To do everything you can on your own.	Da uradite sve što možete sami.
I've actually heard that before.	Zapravo sam to već čuo.
Even you know it.	Čak i ti to znaš.
I shouldn't have.	Nisam trebao.
We're not there yet.	Još nismo tamo.
It wouldn't be right.	Ne bi bilo u redu.
I saw it.	Video sam to.
He knew what would happen.	Znao je šta bi se dogodilo.
There were so many of us.	Toliko nas je bilo.
I had no idea.	Nisam imao pojma.
I was both those people.	Ja sam oboje bio ti ljudi.
This actually happened.	Ovo se zapravo dogodilo.
Can you pick me up?	Možeš li doći po mene.
Do what you have to.	Uradi ono što moraš.
I'm afraid not.	Bojim se da ne.
And no one.	I niko.
I really need it.	Zaista mi treba.
I still don’t see why we couldn’t stay a little longer.	Još uvijek ne vidim zašto ne bismo mogli ostati malo.
He knew what to do.	Znao je šta da radi.
But what we knew about.	Ali ono o čemu smo znali.
So long.	Tako dugo.
Just to see if he's there.	Samo da vidim da li je tamo.
Yours does too.	I tvoj ima.
No, we don't.	Ne, mi to ne radimo.
We can be better than we used to be.	Možemo da bude bolje nego što je bilo.
That's all.	Sve je to.
This is my job.	Ovo je moj posao.
The problem was that he was right.	Problem je bio u tome što je bio u pravu.
The way is here.	Put je tu.
He admitted it.	On je to priznao.
They are probably right.	Verovatno su u pravu.
Or it is.	Ili jeste.
It worked really well for him.	Zaista je dobro radio za njega.
I'm not quite ready.	Nisam baš spreman.
I think no.	Mislim da ne.
To buy or not to buy, that is the question.	Kupiti ili ne kupiti, to je pitanje.
That won't be good for me either.	Ni to neće biti dobro za mene.
It exists now.	Sada postoji.
They know there's something there, but they can't get there.	Znaju da tu nešto ima, ali ne mogu doći do toga.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
So no one was surprised.	Tako da niko nije bio iznenađen.
I just had to say it.	Samo sam to morao reći.
And maybe he was just surprised.	A možda je samo bio iznenađen.
It was a good thing.	Bila je to dobra stvar.
From now on, they will no longer work for you.	Od sada, oni više neće raditi za vas.
You didn't come.	Nisi došao.
They knew better.	Oni su znali bolje.
Hope is here.	Nada je tu.
You don't need a reason anymore.	Više ti ne treba razlog.
I seemed surprised.	Činilo se da sam iznenađen.
I was there this morning.	Bio sam tamo jutros.
They are not like you.	Oni nisu kao ti.
It can't be just me.	Ne mogu biti samo ja.
You will go on without me.	Ići ćeš dalje bez mene.
It won't be so bad.	Neće biti tako loše.
Lots and lots of money.	Mnogo i puno novca.
That's what the team does.	To radi tim.
For life.	Za život.
In truth, that problem already exists.	Istina, taj problem već postoji.
None of us are.	Niko od nas nije.
He is one of us.	On je jedan od nas.
It's much better.	Mnogo je bolje.
And so I can.	I tako mogu.
Actually, it was a story before for me.	Zapravo, za mene je to bila priča prije.
He still didn't mean it.	I dalje to nije mislio.
I am my own problem.	Ja sam svoj problem.
He left.	Otišao je.
There would be no more.	Ne bi bilo više.
I'm not now.	Nisam sada.
I have no idea.	Nemam pojma.
And it was just quick.	I bilo je samo brzo.
He says little else is known.	Kaže da se još malo toga zna.
This is a good question.	Ovo je dobro pitanje.
What money does she have at all.	Koji novac ona uopšte ima.
I was there and I did it.	Bio sam tamo i uradio to.
No more.	Nema više.
I thought he was a good man.	Mislio sam da je dobar čovjek.
But it doesn't work.	Ali ne radi.
You just need to know how to do it right.	Trebalo bi samo znati kako to učiniti kako treba.
As if she was more than that.	Kao da je bila više od toga.
I was pretty sure it was going to happen.	Bio sam prilično siguran da će se to dogoditi.
And it didn't.	I nije.
I can't stay.	Ne mogu ostati.
He was never friends with me.	Nikad nije bio prijatelj sa mnom.
It must still work.	Mora da još radi.
That.	To.
Obviously, he would have much more than that.	Očigledno bi imao mnogo više od toga.
She won't do that to him.	Ona mu to neće učiniti.
He wasn't in the house at all.	Uopšte nije bio u kući.
Everything is getting better.	Sve ide na bolje.
And she was good.	I bila je dobra.
No more people.	Nema više ljudi.
Good for everyone.	Dobro za sve.
This may not be good.	Ovo možda nije dobro.
It was never much.	Nikada nije bilo mnogo.
Even if they are people.	Čak i ako su ljudi.
He said what he had to say and that's it.	Rekao je ono što je imao da kaže i to je to.
I, in fact, am neither here nor there.	Ja, zapravo, nisam ni ovdje ni tamo.
As it has to be.	Kako mora biti.
For so long.	Toliko dugo.
I never finished.	Nikad nisam završio.
he asked me.	pitao me je.
Not so strong.	Nije tako jako.
It's bad.	Loše je.
I'm so sorry, she said.	Tako mi je žao, rekla je.
Lots of time from now on.	Mnogo vremena od sada.
You have to help me.	Moraš mi pomoći.
Except for myself.	Osim sebi.
More money this time.	Ovaj put više novca.
It was someone.	Bio je to neko.
So much more.	Toliko više.
I think that was the problem.	Mislim da je to bio problem.
We won't be.	Nećemo biti.
He is not.	On nije.
I don't know what this is about.	Ne znam o čemu se radi.
They already had my money.	Već su imali moj novac.
They didn't seem to be.	Činilo se da nisu.
But I wonder.	Ali pitam se.
It's very good.	Veoma je dobro.
I did it myself.	Sam sam to uradio.
I'm sure she'll be fine.	Siguran sam da će biti u redu.
But that's what it wasn't.	Ali to je ono što nije bilo.
It was too much for us.	Bilo je to previše za nas.
That really didn't happen to us.	To se nama zaista nije dogodilo.
Which is what happened.	Što se i dogodilo.
I want to make sure you're okay.	Želim biti siguran da si dobro.
You told me you weren't.	Rekao si mi da nisi.
I think he's right here.	Mislim da je upravo ovdje.
I'm back.	Vratio sam se.
I made one.	Napravio sam jedan.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
I love everything.	Volim sve.
He did it well.	On je to dobro radio.
I know about him, only.	Znam za njega, samo.
He should leave before he comes.	Trebao bi otići prije nego što on dođe.
I would really love to see him.	Zaista bih ga volio vidjeti.
Just not today.	Samo ne danas.
She was at home.	Bila je kod kuće.
Tell me that again.	Reci mi to ponovo.
Or we can do it together.	Ili to možemo zajedno.
We couldn't see anything.	Nismo mogli ništa vidjeti.
And you know she's not a problem.	I znaš da ona nije problem.
The problem was that they were hard to come by.	Problem je bio što ih je bilo teško doći.
I would come back.	Vratio bih se.
No one will know.	Niko to neće znati.
But we didn't do that.	Ali mi to nismo uradili.
Not much more than that.	Ne mnogo više od toga.
Not just me, but them too.	Ne samo ja, nego i oni.
Everyone knows you are.	Svi znaju da jesi.
This was not the case.	Ovo nije bilo tako.
It was never enough.	Nikada nije bilo dovoljno.
He was really here.	On je zaista bio ovde.
I'm as good as you.	Ja sam dobar kao i ti.
I will believe.	Ja ću vjerovati.
With that, on.	Sa tim, na.
They will come home.	Oni će doći kući.
I knew this day would come.	Znao sam da će doći ovaj dan.
This has not happened so far.	Ovo se do sada nije dogodilo.
He didn't know why that was either.	Ni on nije znao zašto je to tako.
There are many of them now.	Sada ih je mnogo.
It was as safe as home.	Bilo je sigurno kao kuće.
If we only knew what awaited us.	Da smo samo znali šta nas čeka.
Now is the time to do it.	Sada je vrijeme da to uradite.
I should say no.	Trebao bih reći ne.
It looks like it's where it is now.	Izgleda kao da je tamo gdje je sada.
No, that wasn't true either.	Ne, ni to nije bila istina.
They were there now.	Sada su bili tamo.
Mine was better.	Moj je bio bolji.
And you can't.	I ne možeš.
That's right, with.	Tako je, sa.
That's not him.	To nije on.
How will you get there?	Kako ćeš doći?
I will be.	Biti ću.
Like your father before you.	Kao tvoj otac prije tebe.
He knows better now.	Sada zna bolje.
We have to do something.	Moramo nešto učiniti.
I've never seen this before.	Nikada prije nisam vidio ovo.
I asked him what he was doing.	Pitao sam ga šta radi.
I've never seen him before.	Nikada ga ranije nisam vidio.
It doesn't do much.	Ne radi mnogo.
That is not the case.	To nije tako.
The problem is that my code doesn't do anything.	Problem je što moj kod ne radi ništa.
And this time it was even better.	A ovaj put je bilo još bolje.
I know it was good.	Znam da je bilo dobro.
It won't work.	Neće raditi.
It is hard.	Teško je.
Problem for sure.	Problem sigurno.
Even if you think it is, it probably isn’t.	Čak i ako mislite da jeste, vjerovatno nije.
So I can believe it.	Tako da mogu vjerovati.
I can do anything for you.	Mogu ti sve.
But he's just not right.	Ali on jednostavno nije u pravu.
I was glad I was done.	Bilo mi je drago što sam završio.
It just happens.	To se jednostavno dešava.
I don't know.	Ne znam baš.
He saw them today.	Danas ih je vidio.
I wanted them home.	Htio sam ih kući.
No one will ever find them.	Niko ih nikada neće naći.
But no one would do that.	Ali niko to ne bi uradio.
I still can’t believe the team is back.	Još uvijek ne mogu vjerovati da se tim vratio.
It was just that.	To je jednostavno bilo to.
I've never seen anyone with that.	Nikada nikoga nisam vidio s tim.
You don't look good.	Ne izgledaš dobro.
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to istina.
No one knew what happened.	Niko nije znao šta se dogodilo.
He doesn't talk.	On ne govori.
There is something wrong with me.	Nešto nije u redu sa mnom.
That's how it should be.	Tako treba da bude.
I hope you know what you're doing.	Nadam se da znaš šta radiš.
He wouldn't want that.	On to ne bi želio.
I can already tell.	Već mogu reći.
Time was like nothing.	Vrijeme je bilo kao ništa.
It's up to you.	Do tebe je.
Everyone is right.	Svi su u pravu.
They couldn't do anything with him.	Nisu mogli ništa s njim.
And how much is.	I koliko je.
But she's wrong.	Ali ona nije u pravu.
If we do this together.	Ako ćemo ovo raditi zajedno.
There were too many people now.	Sada je ljudi bilo previše.
She lives alone.	Živi sama.
But they themselves seemed to know nothing better.	Ali činilo se da ni oni sami ne znaju ništa bolje.
If he's here, fine.	Ako je ovde, dobro.
We are here to do the job.	Ovdje smo da uradimo posao.
I would too.	I ja bih.
You are my father.	Ti si moj otac.
Everyone said that.	Svi su to rekli.
It is unlikely that this will be true	Malo je vjerovatno da će to biti istina
Several things happened this week.	Nekoliko stvari se dogodilo ove sedmice.
This will be easy.	Ovo će biti lako.
That does not exist in our country.	To kod nas ne postoji.
Things to do and not to do.	Stvari koje treba raditi i ne raditi.
It was time for me to do it.	Bilo je vrijeme da to uradim.
When he's gone, he's gone!	Kad ga nema, nema ga!
But there is more to it than that.	Ali ima i više od toga.
He understood me.	On me je shvatio.
Nobody knows who did it or why.	Niko ne zna ko je to uradio ni zašto.
It happens, and it happens a lot.	Dešava se, i dešava se mnogo.
And no one is.	I niko nije.
You can do anything.	Možeš sve.
We like something very much.	Nešto nam se mnogo sviđa.
Consequently.	Zbog toga.
Lots of time.	Puno vremena.
And so tell me.	I tako mi reci.
You weren't yours last night.	Sinoć nisi bio svoj.
Maybe there is something.	Možda postoji nešto.
I do both.	Ja radim oboje.
There is.	Ima.
Me, me, me.	Ja, ja, ja.
It could be more.	Moglo bi i više.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
If only it wasn't.	Samo da nije.
I did things.	Uradio sam stvari.
I still have so many friends there.	Još uvek imam toliko prijatelja tamo.
He had a lot of them.	Imao ih je dosta.
He did what needed to be done.	Uradio je ono što je trebalo učiniti.
Yes we can.	Da, možemo.
But he wouldn't have that.	Ali on to ne bi imao.
But we are human.	Ali mi smo ljudi.
He did not tell anyone what he saw.	Nikome nije rekao šta je video.
But I doubt I can do this.	Ali sumnjam da mogu ovo da uradim.
He was his own again.	Ponovo je bio svoj.
He said little.	Malo je rekao.
He didn't know what else he could do.	Nije znao šta više može učiniti.
I said no, this doesn't work.	Ja sam rekao ne, ovo ne radi.
It is done in this way.	To se radi na ovaj način.
What is it for you?	Šta je za tebe?
There is a lot to do.	Ima mnogo toga da se uradi.
Not that you'll ever be able to see it.	Nije da ćete to ikada moći vidjeti.
He went to see her.	Otišao je da je vidi.
It could be bad.	Moglo bi biti loše.
In fact, it never would.	U stvari, nikada ne bi.
I'm sure of it.	Siguran sam u to.
And maybe he's not the only one.	I možda nije jedini.
This is the story.	Ovo je priča.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
She doesn't like these things.	Ona ne voli ove stvari.
There's something wrong with that, you know.	Nešto nije u redu s tim, znaš.
Maybe he could too.	Možda bi i on mogao.
And it's probably a good thing it's not.	I vjerovatno je dobro što nije.
I know you want some.	Znam da želiš malo.
Dan, no problem.	Dan, bez problema.
You know he'll do it himself.	Znaš da će to učiniti sam.
I thought I'd go for it.	Mislio sam ići na to.
I wouldn't want that.	Ne bih to želio.
More and more.	Sve više i više.
He knows now.	On sada zna.
I wouldn't be good at it.	Ne bih bio dobar u tome.
See how it is.	Vidi kako je.
Maybe that's what will happen.	Možda će se tako i dogoditi.
One of my friends did.	Jedan moj prijatelj jeste.
I'm fine now.	Sada sam dobro.
I really didn’t have time this year.	Ove godine zaista nisam imao vremena.
Can this happen?	Može li se to dogoditi?
I've never seen it before.	Nikada prije nisam vidio.
I don't have to see him again.	Ne moram ponovo da ga vidim.
He was right there.	Bio je baš tamo.
You can say more.	Možete reći više.
A father who is a father.	Otac koji je otac.
It wouldn't be so bad.	Ne bi bilo tako loše.
He didn't say much.	Nije mnogo rekao.
I couldn't do that.	Nisam to mogao.
I can't stay.	Ne mogu ostati.
That's the real deal.	To je pravi posao.
This is what we do for a living.	To je ono što mi radimo za život.
But they are people.	Ali oni su ljudi.
So simple.	Tako jednostavno.
That's good how you're doing.	To je dobro kako ti ide.
This will help a lot, my father said.	Ovo će mnogo pomoći, rekao je moj otac.
Not much is happening there.	Tamo se ne dešava mnogo.
They didn't tell me anything.	Ništa mi nisu rekli.
They were supposed to meet at thirty.	Trebali su u trideset na sastanak.
But that is what we have.	Ali to je ono što imamo.
But maybe that wasn't true.	Ali možda to nije bila istina.
It seems they are wrong.	Čini se da nisu u pravu.
I didn't say more.	Nisam rekao više.
But you knew it.	Ali ti si to znao.
You said that this is not enough for you anymore.	Rekao si da ti ovo više nije dovoljno.
There is no one to talk to.	Nema s kim razgovarati.
But he obviously doesn't need anyone.	Ali on očigledno nikome ne treba.
I haven't heard from you yet.	Nisam se još čuo.
I didn't really want the truth.	Nisam zaista želeo istinu.
But not often.	Ali ne često.
For anything good it will do.	Za bilo šta dobro to će učiniti.
We know nothing more than that.	Ne znamo ništa više od toga.
He's not planning anything good.	Ne planira ništa dobro.
But it wasn't her.	Ali to nije bila ona.
It does not exist	Ne postoji
I don't know when you'll be here.	Ne znam kada ćeš biti ovde.
You obviously want something from me.	Očigledno želiš nešto od mene.
I hope it helps you.	Nadam se da će vam pomoći.
I don't know if this will be a problem.	Ne znam da li će ovo biti problem.
There are a lot.	Ima ih puno.
He didn't know how or when.	Nije znao kako ni kada.
But he was not the only one.	Ali to nije bio jedini.
But this is my job.	Ali ovo je moj posao.
I didn't have to do that.	Nisam morao to da radim.
I mean, it's bad for business.	Mislim, loše je za posao.
I knew quite a bit.	Prilično sam znao.
.	.
It was true.	Bila je istina.
You couldn't believe it.	Niste mogli vjerovati.
That didn't happen here.	To se ovdje nije dogodilo.
Nothing can find him here today.	Danas ga ništa ne može naći ovdje.
We need to talk about it.	Moramo razgovarati o tome.
But it does more than that.	Ali radi više od toga.
She knows it well.	Ona to dobro zna.
And that is immediately apparent.	I to se odmah vidi.
Maybe he.	Možda on.
But I have a question.	Ali imam pitanje.
This was too much for you.	Ovo je bilo previše za tebe.
That won't help me much.	To mi neće puno pomoći.
That's right.	Tako je.
Nothing good is happening.	Ništa dobro se ne dešava.
It seemed.	Činilo se.
It's okay to be tired.	U redu je biti umoran.
I don't know myself.	Ne znam ni sam.
I really do.	Ja zaista.
He needs to do a better job.	On treba da uradi bolji posao.
But that was many years ago.	Ali to je bilo prije mnogo godina.
We have a problem.	Imamo problema.
What can I do?	Šta mogu uraditi.
I mean, really, really bad.	Mislim, stvarno, jako loše.
It's all true.	To je sve istina.
But that doesn’t seem to be a problem here.	Ali izgleda da to nije problem ovdje.
He wanted it bad.	Želio je to loše.
He was very good.	Bio je veoma dobar.
I'm sorry, he said.	Žao mi je, rekao je.
And he didn't expect that to happen.	I nije očekivao da će se to dogoditi.
Other than that, he did nothing.	Osim toga, ništa nije uradio.
But you can do it for me.	Ali ti to možeš učiniti za mene.
The man simply said nothing.	Čovjek jednostavno ništa nije rekao.
He said it would not happen.	Rekao je da se to neće dogoditi.
He would be ready for that.	Bio bi spreman za to.
.	.
And maybe you know why.	A možda znate i zašto.
We both knew what he would do with it.	Oboje smo znali šta bi on uradio s tim.
You know that.	Vi to znate.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
I'm not sure about anything really.	Nisam siguran ni u šta zaista.
I know this can't be what you wanted.	Znam da ovo ne može biti ono što si htela.
I mean, there were a lot of them.	Mislim, bilo ih je puno.
I have no idea why.	Nemam pojma zašto.
It's hard for me.	Teško mi je.
If they had money, there was no problem.	Ako su imali novca, nije bilo problema.
I'm sorry about him.	Žao mi je zbog njega.
He needs some time.	Treba mu malo vremena.
I don't know who they were.	Ne znam ko su bili.
Maybe that's how he says it.	Možda je tako kako on to kaže.
That was my idea.	To je bila moja ideja.
Who is this man?	Ko je taj čovjek?
I think you know.	Mislim da znaš.
That happened a few years ago.	To se dogodilo prije nekoliko godina.
I can't believe he's doing this.	Ne mogu vjerovati da on ovo radi.
I know that.	Znam to.
I just thought you should know.	Samo sam mislio da bi trebao znati.
I had to stay.	Morao sam ostati.
She knew he knew.	Znala je da on zna.
I think we can.	Mislim da možemo.
Not just for the money.	Ne samo zbog novca.
If anyone could, it would be him.	Ako bi neko mogao, to bi bio on.
But there may be a way.	Ali tu možda postoji način.
I don't like it here.	Ne sviđa mi se ovde.
It has never been a problem for us.	Za nas to nikada nije bio problem.
That was my only hope.	To je bila moja jedina nada.
Much remains to be done.	Mnogo toga još treba uraditi.
I asked her.	Zamolio sam je.
And so on and so forth and so on.	I tako dalje i tako dalje i tako dalje.
And nothing would be better for me.	I ništa mi ne bi bilo bolje.
I mean, it was for me.	Mislim, bilo je za mene.
We knew right away.	Odmah smo znali.
You both just know.	Oboje jednostavno znate.
More would be better.	Više bi bilo bolje.
But there is a lot to see here.	Ali ovdje ima puno toga za vidjeti.
He doesn't have time for this.	On nema vremena za ovo.
They are still there for you.	I dalje su tu za tebe.
You could never tell.	Nikad nisi mogao reći.
It's not about that.	Ne radi se o tome.
My job is to see these things.	Moj posao je da vidim ove stvari.
I really mean it.	Zaista to mislim.
He didn't say why.	Nije rekao zašto.
And if you do.	I ako to uradite.
It can be found here.	Može se naći ovdje.
Please do it for me.	Molim te, uradi to za mene.
And he saw further.	I vidio je dalje.
He didn't know what to think.	Nije znao šta da misli.
He would get a good day for work.	Dobio bi dobar dan za posao.
I know right away what he's saying.	Odmah znam šta govori.
I just want to say this.	Samo želim ovo da kažem.
I don't know what she's talking about.	Ne znam o čemu ona priča.
That's what he is.	To je ono što on jeste.
Yes, they are fine.	Da, dobro su.
No help.	Nema pomoći.
Just do it.	Samo uradi to.
I'm better now.	Sada sam bolje.
That's what she said.	To je ono što je rekla.
He didn't even have to say much that way.	Na taj način nije ni trebao mnogo da kaže.
Neither can I.	Ne mogu ni ja.
That should say it all.	To bi trebalo reći sve.
It must be because of the weather, she said.	Mora da je zbog vremena, rekla je.
This is a very bad time.	Ovo je jako loše vrijeme.
I just couldn’t do the job.	Jednostavno nisam mogao raditi posao.
All right with me.	U redu sa mnom.
He is with me.	On je sa mnom.
You have to be what you are.	Moraš biti ono što jesi.
He was a happy man.	Bio je sretan čovjek.
What did he mean?	Šta je mislio.
I don't like it much.	Ne sviđa mi se mnogo.
You said earlier.	Rekao si ranije.
I would need a lot.	Trebalo bi mi jako puno.
It's here, actually.	Ovde je, zapravo.
Tell me something about yourself.	Reci mi nešto o sebi.
He couldn't know.	Nije mogao znati.
No one could have done it better.	Niko to nije mogao bolje.
I mean I hope so.	Mislim nadam se.
There wasn't much time.	Nije bilo puno vremena.
Now it doesn't exist.	Sada to ne postoji.
It's not good to talk.	Nije dobro razgovarati.
Or more than that.	Ili više od toga.
What he does today may not work tomorrow.	Ono što radi danas, možda neće raditi sutra.
You said something this morning.	Rekao si nešto jutros.
I figured it out myself.	Sam sam to shvatio.
No one would have to know.	Niko ne bi morao znati.
But obviously there is.	Ali očigledno ima.
You are not his friend.	Ti mu nisi prijatelj.
I was only here for a few days.	Bio sam ovdje samo nekoliko dana.
We're all here now.	Sada smo svi ovdje.
I wonder if this is good.	Pitam se da li je ovo dobro.
More people will leave.	Još više ljudi će otići.
I can never stay.	Nikada ne mogu ostati.
Just very tired.	Samo jako umoran.
Yes, just maybe.	Da, samo možda.
I have no problem with that.	Nemam problema sa tim.
I guess it was you.	Pretpostavljam da si to bio ti.
Are you ready?	Da li si spreman?
I know you want to be with me.	Znam da želiš sa mnom.
Never say that.	Nikad to ne reci.
This is the thing.	Ovo je stvar.
Which still exists today.	Koji i danas postoji.
Nothing was too much of a problem.	Ništa nije bilo previše problema.
But not that one.	Ali ne taj.
But this was real.	Ali ovo je bilo stvarno.
You wanted me for yourself.	Želeo si me za sebe.
But he's right, he told himself.	Ali u pravu je, rekao je sebi.
That's your problem, not mine.	To je tvoj problem, a ne moj.
That wasn't him.	To nije bio taj.
That is just a game.	To je samo igra.
It looks easy enough !.	Izgleda dovoljno lako!.
Can you help?	Možete li pomoći?
We can do anything.	Možemo sve.
I asked him how much money he wanted.	Pitao sam ga koliko novca želi.
If you want, you will.	Ako hoćeš, hoćeš.
Maybe none of that actually happened.	Možda se ništa od toga zapravo nije dogodilo.
Let's do this.	Uradimo ovo.
I'm sorry this is happening to you.	Žao mi je što ti se ovo dešava.
That is not true here.	To ovdje nije istina.
But he shouldn't have.	Ali nije trebao.
He told us that.	On nam je to rekao.
They could be anywhere.	Mogli bi biti bilo gdje.
He is ready to do it.	On je spreman da to uradi.
We just knew something was wrong.	Samo smo znali da nešto nije u redu.
But that's not really true.	Ali to zapravo nije istina.
It works well.	Radi dobro.
That might be me.	To sam možda ja.
That's not a good thing.	To nije dobra stvar.
He was such a real guy.	Bio je tako pravi momak.
I'm not afraid.	Ne bojim se.
Or a little more.	Ili još malo.
Not good or bad, it just is.	Nije dobro ili loše, jednostavno jeste.
I want to work with you.	Želim da radim sa tobom.
There was nothing we could do about it.	Tu nismo mogli ništa.
That's good, 'she says.	To je dobro', kaže ona.
I know what you mean.	Znam šta misliš.
You can't be my friend anymore.	Ne možeš mi više biti prijatelj.
What did you like to do?	Šta si voleo da radiš.
There is something wrong.	Tu nešto nije u redu.
But that is never enough.	Ali to nikad nije dovoljno.
But that is not the reason.	Ali to nije razlog.
I want you to know something.	Želim da znaš nešto.
I never have.	Još nisam nikad.
What do you think about that?	Šta mislite o tome?
He didn't look surprised to see them.	Nije izgledao iznenađen što ih je vidio.
but it just can't.	ali to baš i ne može.
I still want to.	I dalje želim.
Maybe she was right.	Možda je bila u pravu.
Yes, you can come.	Da, možete doći.
I think people will see that.	Mislim da će ljudi to vidjeti.
It's happening.	To se dešava.
He usually plays well here.	Ovdje obično svira dobro.
You are the first.	Ti si prvi.
We've already said it all.	Već smo sve rekli.
He loves it.	On to voli.
You won't bring me back.	Nećeš me vratiti.
I thought you were the only one.	Mislio sam da si ti jedini.
This is the way.	Ovo je put.
What do you think will happen next?	Šta mislite da će se sljedeće dogoditi?
Which.	Koji.
If you can't, that's fine too.	Ako ne možete, i to je u redu.
Yes I can.	Da, mogu.
You know what you got.	Znaš šta imaš.
He would love that, he said.	On bi to volio, rekao je.
And they were.	I bili su.
You never know !.	Nikad ne znaš!.
And there seem to be a lot of them.	A čini se da ih ima mnogo.
Lots of times.	Puno puta.
And they were right.	I bili su u pravu.
I know you can do this.	Znam da možeš ovo.
I don't even know how to do it.	Ne znam ni kako bi to uradio.
He had never seen anything like it before.	Nikada ranije nije video tako nešto.
I left.	Otišao sam.
You did the right thing	Uradili ste pravu stvar
I'm not asking.	Ne pitam.
She was just more than herself.	Bila je samo više od sebe.
I didn't even want to come here.	Nisam čak ni htio doći ovdje.
He can't stay.	Ne može ostati.
She loves to play.	Ona voli da se igra.
You know what needs to be done.	Znate šta treba da se uradi.
We just couldn’t believe it.	Jednostavno nismo mogli vjerovati.
I wondered what that meeting might be about.	Pitao sam se o čemu bi taj sastanak mogao biti.
He's wrong.	On nije u pravu.
I didn't know you were.	Nisam znao da jesi.
He says no.	On kaže ne.
It was simple.	Bilo je jednostavno.
I wanted more than that.	Želeo sam više od toga.
And it's a little better there.	I tu je malo bolje.
You weren't.	Nisi bio.
This is how it has to be.	Ovo je kako mora biti.
That's a lot of money.	To je puno novca.
And that's hard.	I to je teško.
You know if.	Znate da li.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
I wondered how he got there.	Pitao sam se kako je stigao tamo.
I don't know why.	Ne znam baš zašto.
I still have them.	Još ih imam.
I shouldn't have said that.	Nisam to trebao reći.
It's good.	To je dobro.
Not unless there was something in it for him.	Ne osim ako je u tome bilo nešto za njega.
I can never.	Ne mogu nikada.
That's the problem here.	To je problem ovdje.
I will do it.	Ja ću učiniti.
I don't know how he did it.	Ne znam kako je to uradio.
By itself ,.	Samo po sebi,.
These are people.	To su ljudi.
I just thought.	Samo sam mislio.
It's so good.	Tako je dobro.
They told me everything looked good.	Rekli su mi da sve izgleda dobro.
Someone knows everything about us.	Neko zna sve o nama.
.	.
I'm not sure it will ever be.	Nisam siguran da će ikada biti.
I just want to be home again.	Samo želim ponovo biti kod kuće.
We can't know.	Ne možemo znati.
You're here a lot.	Mnogo si ovde.
I've never seen her before.	Nikad je ranije nisam video.
Who is she? 	Ko je ona?
When we are at home we do not work.	Kad smo kod kuće ne radimo.
I didn't mean that.	Nisam to mislio.
He could do it himself.	Mogao bi i sam.
I haven't figured out how to do that.	Nisam shvatio kako to da uradim.
How can you even know that?	Kako to uopšte možeš znati?
Something he had never seen before.	Nešto što nikada ranije nije vidio.
No, in that.	Ne, u to.
It must be hard for him to say anything.	Mora da mu je teško da bilo šta kaže.
Which was fine.	Što je bilo u redu.
Indeed, this is true.	Zaista, ovo je istina.
I don't know what, but it's bad.	Ne znam šta, ali je loše.
Everyone can see it.	Svi to mogu vidjeti.
I don't think anyone even knew he was there.	Mislim da niko nije ni znao da je tamo.
That would be.	To bi bilo.
More on that here.	Više o tome ovdje.
I don't want to talk to you.	Ne želim razgovarati s tobom.
Yes, it's not just us.	Da, nismo samo mi.
I just couldn't.	Jednostavno nisam mogao.
''.	''.
I'm not really for that.	Nisam baš za to.
I don't think it will.	Mislim da neće.
That happened to him.	To mu se dogodilo.
You can't, you just won't.	Ne možeš, jednostavno nećeš.
We don't need it anymore.	Ne treba nam više.
No problem.	Nema problema.
Which it was.	Što je i bilo.
Not anymore.	Ne više.
It could be us.	Mogli bismo biti mi.
Maybe he's telling me.	Možda mi kaže.
I didn't want to be there.	Nisam htela da budem tamo.
Yes, this is difficult.	Da, ovo je teško.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
Not this time.	Ovaj put nisu.
It's not a game.	To nije igra.
I just love seeing him.	Samo volim da ga vidim.
Not like you.	Ne kao ti.
Everything seems to be working.	Čini se da sve radi.
It can be found here.	Može se naći ovdje.
If anyone can help please do so.	Ako neko može da pomogne molim vas da uradite.
It was pretty hard for us.	Bilo nam je prilično teško.
That was your father.	To je bio tvoj otac.
But it wasn't me.	Ali to nisam bio ja.
I guess they will.	Pretpostavljam da hoće.
No, it's true.	Ne, istina je.
He came to the door.	Došao do vrata.
It was still good.	I dalje je bilo dobro.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I have to do it.	Moram to da uradim.
Mine came to me that way.	Moj je došao do mene na taj način.
That was the way to do it.	To je bio način da se to uradi.
I'm not really like that.	Nisam baš tako.
Even a lot of money.	Čak i mnogo novca.
She's my money?	Ona je moj novac?
I wasn't good enough.	Nisam bio dovoljno dobar.
I don't think it should be.	Mislim da ne bi trebao biti.
Tell us what you know.	Reci nam šta znaš.
What could be better?	Šta može biti bolje?
Things are really bad.	Stvari su zaista loše.
And maybe a good thing about that.	A možda i dobra stvar u tome.
I didn't ask for him.	Nisam ga tražio.
And he's not the only one.	I nije on jedini.
Is that your car over there?	Je li to tvoj auto tamo?
I couldn't go any further.	Nisam mogao ići više.
I don't know if that's the reason.	Ne znam da li je to razlog tome.
But we couldn't do that.	Ali nismo to mogli.
But tell me.	Ali reci mi.
This seems to be really good for you.	Čini se da je ovo stvarno dobro za vas.
You have to do this.	Moraš ovo da uradiš.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
She wants him to know she loves him.	Ona želi da on zna da ga voli.
We can do this.	Možemo ovo.
I have to go now, he said.	Moram ići sada, rekao je.
I just got back from him.	Upravo sam se vratio od njega.
I can see better what needs to be done.	Mogu bolje da vidim šta treba da se uradi.
They had a reason.	Imali su razlog.
It was simple, really.	Bilo je jednostavno, zaista.
But it wasn't that simple.	Ali to nije bilo tako jednostavno.
I can't say anything more.	Ne mogu reći ništa više.
I'm doing pretty well.	Ide mi prilično dobro.
He was the first.	Bio je jedan prvi.
No, you need someone there, don't you.	Ne, treba ti neko tamo, zar ne.
I like what you have to say.	Sviđa mi se šta imaš da kažeš.
You can go anywhere.	Možete ići bilo gdje.
This is the way it goes.	Ovo je način na koji to ide.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
She's coming towards us.	Ona ide prema nama.
We would both.	Oboje bismo.
It was like that.	Bilo je tako.
What was real? 	Šta je bilo stvarno?
he wondered.	pitao se on.
It's better than nothing.	Bolje je nego ništa.
More on that in a bit.	Više o tome u malo.
It's not safe.	Nije sigurno.
He needs it.	Treba mu.
True.	Istina.
You can not.	Ne možeš.
And it's not good.	I nije dobro.
You can't do it all by yourself.	Ne možete sve sami.
Not that he wanted to be.	Nije da je želio biti.
He was very good.	Bio je veoma dobar.
This is not.	Ovo nije.
I would ask you, but .	Pitao bih te, ali .
She never told me what it was.	Nikad mi nije rekla šta je to.
But this was much more than a few.	Ali ovo je bilo mnogo više od nekoliko.
She is she.	Ona je ona.
She loves him.	Ona ga voli.
It's that simple for me.	Za mene je to tako jednostavno.
I'm sorry how hard it was.	Žao mi je koliko je bilo teško.
Little by little.	Malo po malo.
He certainly knew better than that.	On je sigurno znao bolje od toga.
You're probably right.	Verovatno si u pravu.
He asked where else.	Pitao je gdje još.
They could never leave.	Nikada nisu mogli otići.
Now you can get it all.	Sada možete dobiti sve.
She doesn't want me.	Ona me ne želi.
And much more.	I još mnogo toga.
I really hope so.	Zaista se nadam.
There can only be one.	Može biti samo jedan.
That is not true.	To nije tačno.
You look good.	Dobro izgledaš.
I love life.	Volim život.
That's what it's really about.	O tome se zaista radi.
Nobody knows what or how much.	Niko ne zna ni šta, ni koliko.
There was only one here.	Ovdje je bio samo jedan.
But they will be there.	Ali oni će biti tamo.
He would see her for the first time.	Vidio bi je prvi put.
Nothing is that hard.	Ništa nije tako teško.
That's enough.	To je dosta.
Not true.	Nije istina.
We couldn't do this without him.	Ne bismo mogli ovo bez njega.
It was real.	Bilo je stvarno.
And we were right.	I bili smo u pravu.
I did something right.	Uradio sam nešto kako treba.
We couldn't do this without you.	Ne bismo ovo mogli bez tebe.
I'm sure that happens.	Siguran sam da se to dešava.
It's good to know, to be with that way.	Dobro je znati, biti sa na taj način.
I was ready to go.	Bio sam spreman da idem.
And he is right about that.	I u tome je u pravu.
He was there for a while.	Tamo je bio neko vrijeme.
You have a life.	Imaš život.
It's still good.	I dalje je dobro.
He couldn't see anything wrong.	Nije mogao vidjeti ništa loše.
Not really.	Ne baš.
I've never been.	Nikad nisam bio.
You can still do this.	Još uvijek možete ovo učiniti.
We have to work now.	Sada moramo raditi.
Maybe that's true.	Možda je to istina.
He didn't have to tell himself that.	Nije morao to sebi da kaže.
More than that, he knew it was true.	Više od toga, znao je da je to istina.
You should talk to him about it.	Morao bi razgovarati s njim o tome.
I want to be the new me.	Želim da budem novi ja.
I need help saying it's enough.	Treba mi pomoć da kažem da je dosta.
Or he can tell me no.	Ili mi može reći ne.
I want this time.	Želim ovaj put.
Do it if you want or not.	Uradi to ako želiš ili ne.
You could see that.	Mogao si to vidjeti.
He brought me back.	Vratio me.
He had a bad one.	Imao je loš.
But it's not there.	Ali to nije tamo.
This is not the way.	Ovo nije način.
I love this car.	Volim ovaj auto.
I often think of him.	Često mislim na njega.
But so far.	Ali do sada.
Never heard of him.	Nikad čuo za njega.
How can you tell?	Kako možeš reći?
No one ever has.	Niko nikada nije.
That's exactly what we all do.	Upravo to svi radimo.
And we had no idea.	I nismo imali pojma.
You always want there to be another one.	Uvijek želiš da postoji još jedan.
I had no problem with that.	Nisam imao problema sa tim.
That's the story.	To je priča.
She always works too hard.	Ona uvek radi previše.
He can talk now.	Može sada da priča.
You should go there.	Trebao bi otići tamo.
I didn't know what he was talking about.	Nisam znao o čemu govori.
I can't be.	Ne mogu biti.
But he did nothing.	Ali on ništa nije uradio.
About what .	O čemu .
Even better, no one knew who he was.	Još bolje je da niko nije znao ko je on.
We have to.	Moramo .
There is not enough time.	Nema dovoljno vremena.
I'm glad you told me.	Drago mi je da si mi rekao.
They will go for it.	Oni će ići na to.
He would never have it.	Nikada je ne bi imao.
For a very long time.	Za veoma dugo vremena.
I just want to be home.	Samo želim biti kod kuće.
He'll tell you what he saw.	Reći će vam šta je video.
You told him the truth.	Rekao si mu istinu.
We cannot say that there is only one right way.	Ne možemo reći da postoji samo jedan pravi način.
See if he can get there.	Vidi da li može doći tamo.
It wasn't long.	Nije bilo dugo.
He tried.	Pokušao je.
I myself have even been there a few times.	I sam sam čak bio tamo nekoliko puta.
I had no idea what to say or how.	Nisam imao pojma šta da kažem ili kako.
But, you know, that's what it is.	Ali, znate, to je ono što jeste.
You must want that.	Mora da to želiš.
It does not exist.	Ne postoji.
You don't like this.	Ne sviđa ti se ovo.
You can go back to work tomorrow.	Sutra se možete vratiti na posao.
She didn't say.	Nije rekla.
None of this is enough.	Ništa od toga nije dovoljno.
I don't think you know.	Mislim da ne znaš.
But they had a good day.	Ali imali su dobar dan.
They won't see me here.	Neće me vidjeti ovdje.
And the new one isn't much better either.	A ni novi nije mnogo bolji.
I have to say this.	Moram ovo reći.
He had never seen anything like it.	Nikad nije video tako nešto.
I knew something was wrong.	Znao sam da nešto nije u redu.
Everyone will believe him.	Svi će mu vjerovati.
It must be good.	Mora da je dobro.
He bought it.	On ga je kupio.
Nobody ever says that.	Niko to nikad ne kaže.
We don't.	Mi ne .
I am in.	Ja sam u.
I didn't know you'd be here.	Nisam znao da ćeš biti ovde.
She really is what you think she is.	Ona je zaista ono što mislite da jeste.
But there is more.	Ali ima još toga.
There were too many of them.	Bilo ih je previše.
Now he wondered if she would ever see him again.	Sada se pitao hoće li ga ikada više vidjeti.
I really should go back.	Stvarno bih se trebao vratiti.
They will help you.	Oni će vam pomoći.
They know what we did.	Oni znaju šta smo uradili.
I had all three until yesterday.	Imao sam sve tri do juče.
Good so far.	Dobro do sada.
Just like that.	Jednostavno tako.
It's too hard.	Previše je teško.
But that is not happening.	Ali to se ne dešava.
You did everything.	Uradio si sve.
I didn't even know what he was talking about.	Nisam ni znao o čemu priča.
You were so good today.	Bio si tako dobro danas.
It can be good and bad.	To može biti dobro i loše.
You will get to that.	Doći ćeš do toga.
He looked pretty good.	Izgledao je prilično dobro.
It has never been difficult.	Nikada nije bilo teško.
I would have to say no.	Morao bih da kažem ne.
He wants to talk.	Želi razgovarati.
I couldn't go on.	Nisam mogao dalje.
They were there and they did it.	Bili su tamo i to su uradili.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I'm ready.	Spreman sam.
Only once.	Samo jedan put.
It's been a while.	Bilo je to neko vrijeme.
I'll tell you this.	Reći ću ti ovo.
I didn't know what to do with him.	Nisam znao šta da radim s njim.
One of you.	Jedan od vas.
In fact, very easy.	U stvari, vrlo lako.
I really didn't.	Zaista nisam.
It won't help.	Neće pomoći.
It was good for him to be busy.	Bilo mu je dobro da bude zauzet.
She also said she did.	Rekla je i da jeste.
But that was not enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno.
They weren't even human.	Nisu čak ni bili ljudi.
He thought not.	Mislio je da nije.
That will come.	To će doći.
Someone must have seen something.	Mora da je neko nešto video.
He's been there before.	Bio je tamo ranije.
Only maybe, but not here.	Samo možda, ali ne ovde.
We will stay there.	Tamo ćemo ostati.
Or her.	Ili ona.
It was really hard.	Bilo je stvarno teško.
That's how it's done.	Tako se to radi.
He couldn't do without him.	Nije mogao bez njega.
I really like it.	Stvarno mi se sviđa.
No, not just someone.	Ne, ne samo neko.
But, you know, it's true.	Ali, znate, to je istina.
That would be easy.	To bi bilo lako.
This can be done.	Ovo se može uraditi.
I'm really fed up.	Stvarno mi je dosta.
What's going on here? 	Šta se dešava ovde?
But that's not good for me.	Ali to nije dobro za mene.
I can't do anything right.	Ne mogu da uradim ništa kako treba.
I really hope this is true.	Zaista se nadam da je ovo istina.
I think we are safe enough now.	Mislim da smo sada dovoljno sigurni.
It was always small, good.	Uvek je bilo malo, dobro.
No no.	Ne ne.
I don't see many people.	Ne vidim puno ljudi.
I know it's them.	Znam da su to oni.
He knew he was right.	Znao je da je u pravu.
In fact, you were better than good, you were good.	U stvari, bio si bolji nego dobro, bio si dobar.
I hope some of you can help me.	Nadam se da mi neko od vas može pomoći.
He could do this properly.	Mogao bi ovo uraditi kako treba.
Too busy to go.	Previše zauzet da bih otišao.
There was nothing he could do.	Nije moglo ništa.
I would say that.	Ja bih to rekao.
I have that too.	Imam i to.
Maybe he'll leave, maybe not.	Možda će otići, a možda i ne.
She never was.	Ona to nikada nije bila.
Anyone but him.	Bilo ko osim njega.
No, that wasn't right either.	Ne, ni to nije bilo u redu.
I’m not saying that can’t happen.	Ne kažem da se to ne može dogoditi.
I want one too.	I ja želim jedan.
Maybe we could.	Možda bismo mogli.
And that wasn't all.	I to nije bilo sve.
He's not bad.	On nije loš.
It could be tomorrow.	Moglo bi biti sutra.
She knew she had a problem.	Znala je da ima problem.
He lives here.	On živi ovdje.
He didn't say more.	Nije rekao više.
The first is this.	Prvi je ovo.
Together we can do this.	Zajedno možemo ovo da uradimo.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
And getting better.	I sve bolje.
I did it that way.	Ja sam to tako radio.
It still was.	I dalje je bilo.
And he shouldn't have left.	I nije trebao da ode.
I actually did it pretty often.	Zapravo sam to radio prilično često.
And he does.	I pravi.
And I couldn't believe it.	I nisam mogao vjerovati.
I would be very glad.	Bilo bi mi veoma drago.
Why so much? 	Zašto toliko?
I had it.	Imao sam to.
You're not.	Nisi.
What is this.	Šta je ovo.
I want him right here.	Želim ga upravo ovdje.
And they are probably right.	I vjerovatno su u pravu.
He doesn't do anything.	On ništa ne radi.
Not here, not now.	Ne ovdje, ne sada.
As if it doesn't exist.	Kao da ne postoji.
I didn't want to either.	Ni ja nisam htela.
I think it is.	Mislim da je.
I don’t know why and how it happened.	Ne znam zašto i kako se to dogodilo.
We're doing well here.	Dobro nam ide ovdje.
It's just not enough.	Samo nije dovoljno.
But for now, the good times have been good.	Ali za sada su dobra vremena bila dobra.
This morning, really.	Jutros, zaista.
He couldn't find it.	Nije ga mogao naći.
Few people live there.	Malo ljudi tamo živi.
He was right.	Bio je u pravu.
Paint everything.	Boji sve.
No, don't tell me.	Ne, nemoj mi reći.
I'll find them.	Naći ću ih.
That would be a good idea.	To bi bila dobra ideja.
What year is this?	Koja je ovo godina?
It will come, if you want it to come.	Doći će, ako želiš da dođe.
I've had enough.	Imao sam dosta.
She's been here a long time.	Ona je tu dugo vremena.
And so will he.	I tako će i on.
And maybe it will.	A možda i bude.
Even if it's bad, even if it's really bad.	Čak i ako je loše, čak i ako je stvarno loše.
But I never would.	Ali nikada ne bi.
I have to go again.	Moram ponovo da idem.
Probably too much.	Verovatno previše.
He needed something more.	Trebalo mu je nešto više.
He would be safe here.	Ovdje bi bio siguran.
Everything except, in fact.	Sve osim, u stvari.
I'm so glad you could come.	Tako mi je drago što si mogao doći.
There are many, many of them there.	Ima ih mnogo, mnogo tamo.
I'm fine now.	Sada sam dobro.
I've never seen that before.	Nikad to prije nisam vidio.
This was not true.	Ovo nije bila istina.
And few people do that.	I malo ljudi to radi.
This is not me.	Ovo nisam ja.
But you have to go.	Ali morate ići.
You didn't know any better.	Nisi znao za bolje.
Which he is now.	Što on sada i jeste.
He obviously doesn't want to help me.	On očigledno ne želi da mi pomogne.
I can help him with that.	Mogu mu pomoći u tome.
Did you know what.	Da li ste znali šta.
It's not about that at all.	Ne radi se uopšte o tome.
I wouldn't buy this again.	Ne bih ovo ponovo kupio.
It's easy and it should be fine.	Lako je i trebalo bi da bude u redu.
He won't talk to us.	Neće razgovarati s nama.
We know they are not.	Znamo da nisu.
We have to bring you back ourselves.	Moramo te sami vratiti.
He told me.	Rekao mi.
She knew something was wrong.	Znala je da nešto nije u redu.
She will leave, but he will not stay.	Ona će otići, ali on neće ostati.
They would be fine.	Bili bi u redu.
It's you, isn't it?	To si ti, zar ne?
But it could be.	Ali moglo bi biti.
But that's not why we did it.	Ali to nije razlog zašto smo to uradili.
The first day was fine.	Prvi dan je bio u redu.
I have done this several times.	Uradio sam ovo više puta.
That could not be done.	To se nije moglo uraditi.
Just a car.	Samo auto.
Several times.	Nekoliko puta.
It was easy.	Bilo je lako.
That's all I could say.	Toliko bih mogao reći.
It could be that.	Moglo bi biti to.
I got you.	Imam te.
And he did it very well.	I to je uradio veoma dobro.
You should have known that.	Trebao si to znati.
He simply is.	On jednostavno jeste.
He did a lot.	Uradio je mnogo.
He was just tired.	Samo je bio umoran.
I had to ask about that too.	Morao sam da pitam i za to.
Okay, not bad.	U redu nije loše.
I know you work, but.	Znam da radiš, ali.
I'd just like him to leave.	Samo bih volio da ode.
That was three days ago.	To je bilo prije tri dana.
I just wanted to say.	Samo sam htio reći.
Three for three.	Tri za tri.
No, there was no time.	Ne, nije bilo vremena.
I wouldn't.	Ne bi.
I was the first to see this.	Bio sam prvi koji je ovo vidio.
It was a good afternoon.	Bilo je dobro popodne.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
But I'm not sure it works.	Ali nisam siguran da radi.
You can stay there tonight.	Možeš ostati tamo večeras.
But she wasn't, really.	Ali nije bila, zaista.
I couldn't take it anymore.	Nisam mogao više.
I knew it well.	Znao sam to dobro.
Good is good.	Dobro je dobro.
This is true, very true.	Ovo je tačno, veoma tačno.
It could be your lucky day.	To bi mogao biti tvoj sretan dan.
Maybe just a little.	Možda samo malo.
That will be enough.	To će biti dovoljno.
I was safe there.	Bio sam siguran tamo.
Now I have to buy a few things.	Sada moram kupiti nekoliko stvari.
All right, we'll help you.	U redu, mi ćemo vam pomoći.
She says no.	Ona kaže ne.
Say it.	Reci to.
I still have so many friends there.	Još uvek imam toliko prijatelja tamo.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
He looks exactly like that.	On upravo tako izgleda.
I think it was really good.	Mislim da je bilo stvarno dobro.
He's back now.	Sada se vratio.
I asked her why.	Pitao sam je zašto.
All right, all right.	U redu, u redu.
What would you do there.	Šta bi radio tamo.
I want everything you have.	Želim sve što imaš.
There's nothing I can do for you.	Ne mogu ništa učiniti za tebe.
It wasn't really that good at the time.	U to vrijeme zapravo i nije bilo tako dobro.
Very not good.	Vrlo ne dobro.
And he admitted it.	I on je to priznao.
You got it.	Shvatio si.
I'm happy for you.	Drago mi je zbog tebe.
Was he your friend?	Je li on bio tvoj prijatelj?
I knew it would be.	Znao sam da će biti.
What he needs now is help.	Ono što mu sada treba je pomoć.
He may never see her again.	Možda je više nikada neće vidjeti.
You could do anything, there.	Mogao si sve, tamo.
This is really so.	Ovo je zaista tako.
That is what we are on.	To je ono na čemu smo.
Neither should we.	Ne bi trebali ni mi.
That would be fine.	To bi bilo u redu.
It is not me.	Nisam ja.
That will never happen.	To se nikada neće dogoditi.
And he knows it.	I to zna.
Think of him still.	Misli na njega i dalje.
I know exactly what's going on there.	Znam tačno šta se tamo dešava.
People could talk.	Ljudi bi mogli razgovarati.
He can't come home.	Ne može doći kući.
As if he would do that.	Kao da bi to uradio.
Yes, he meant it.	Da, mislio je to.
He doesn't look too happy to me.	On mi ne izgleda previše sretan.
It's been like that for a few days.	Tako je nekoliko dana.
He just wants to be safe.	On samo želi da bude siguran.
He said and did nothing.	Rekao je i ništa nije uradio.
Or so I would like to believe.	Ili bih želio vjerovati.
No one seemed surprised.	Činilo se da niko nije iznenađen.
I am almost three years old.	Imam skoro tri godine.
Quick question.	Brzo pitanje.
You just said what you think.	Samo ste rekli šta mislite.
You just can't see them.	Jednostavno ih ne možete vidjeti.
He knew he was safe.	Znao je da je siguran.
That was it, just like she said.	To je bilo, baš kao što je rekla.
And that is exactly what is happening.	I upravo se to dešava.
Not much.	Ne mnogo.
Besides, it's just time.	Osim toga, to je samo vrijeme.
Or you don't have to.	Ili ne morate.
There's a lot going on right now.	Trenutno ima dosta toga.
Until it happened to me.	Dok mi se to nije dogodilo.
I've never heard of such a thing.	Nikad nisam čuo za tako nešto.
I don't know what it was.	Ne znam šta je to bilo.
He didn't understand how he could.	Nije shvatio kako bi mogao.
I just want to be told.	Samo želim da mi se kaže.
Now, you know better than to do that.	Sada, znaš bolje nego to učiniti.
It won't be long.	Neće dugo.
U.	U.
He heard nothing.	Nije čuo ništa.
It's just too much.	To je jednostavno previše.
I didn't do that often.	Nisam to često radio.
And what it is, is true.	A ono što jeste, je istina.
They will do anything for you.	Oni će učiniti sve za tebe.
Or a car.	Ili auto.
But he understood why he wanted to leave.	Ali je shvatio zašto želi da ode.
That's what a father should be.	To je ono što bi trebalo da bude otac.
I had to make sure you were real.	Morao sam biti siguran da si ti pravi.
He wanted to know where that might be.	Želio je znati gdje bi to moglo biti.
You don't need help.	Ne treba vam pomoći.
There is simply something wrong with that.	Nešto jednostavno nije u redu s tim.
A little more, please?	Još malo, molim?
It has been before.	I ranije je bilo.
But he was good.	Ali bio je dobar.
If only he could get to that.	Kad bi mogao doći do toga.
But don't tell me no today.	Ali nemoj mi reći ne danas.
I should never have left.	Nikad nisam trebao otići.
I'm fine.	Ja sam u redu.
But they should be.	Ali trebali bi biti.
I hope I can help.	Nadam se da mogu pomoći.
Nobody told me about it.	Niko mi nije rekao za to.
I got it.	Shvatio sam to.
I don't think there's anything we can do about it.	Mislim da tu ništa ne možemo učiniti.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
Probably nobody works.	Vjerovatno niko ne radi.
Your life is now.	Tvoj život je sada.
He is more and more.	On je sve i više.
That's what he didn't understand.	To je ono što on nije shvatio.
They are here.	Oni su ovde.
So it's not good about that.	Tako da nije dobro o tome.
I knew something was happening to him, to us.	Znao sam da mu se nešto dešava, nama.
He was safe now.	Sada je bio siguran.
If they only knew they could do it too.	Kad bi samo znali da i oni to mogu.
It's not easy, it really isn't.	Nije lako, zaista nije.
I've heard it many times.	Čuo sam to mnogo puta.
He's going home.	On ide kući.
That was a good idea.	To je bila dobra ideja.
I know he will.	Znam da hoće.
That is how it should be done.	Tako bi to trebalo da se uradi.
We do everything right.	Radimo sve kako treba.
You are both right.	Oboje ste u pravu.
I don't know why that is.	Ne znam zašto je to tako.
I'm going alone, which is fine.	Idem sam, što je u redu.
But that will never happen.	Ali to se nikada neće dogoditi.
I think what will happen.	Mislim šta će biti.
You brought us back.	Vratio si nas.
I wouldn't have a car there.	Ne bih imao auto tamo.
So it was now.	Tako je bilo i sada.
I never asked him.	Nikad ga nisam pitao.
I need to know more.	Moram da znam više.
You had a pretty good life.	Imao si prilično dobar život.
You are absolutely right about everything.	Potpuno si u pravu za sve.
I hope it helps you.	Nadam se da će ti pomoći.
He's your friend.	On je tvoj prijatelj.
I really do.	Ja stvarno.
Is that right?.	Je li tako?.
He can't go back there anymore.	Tamo se više ne može vratiti.
Just do it.	Samo uradi.
No, that didn't happen.	Ne, nije se to dogodilo.
It was difficult for me.	Bilo mi je teško.
Maybe he doesn't know.	Možda ne zna.
Not today.	Danas nije.
That nothing is wrong.	Da ništa nije u redu.
He is absolutely right.	On je potpuno u pravu.
I was sure it was him.	Bio sam siguran da je to on.
We just have to do our job.	Samo moramo da radimo svoj posao.
I have a problem here.	Imam problema ovde.
The things she said.	Stvari koje je rekla.
But that needs to be said.	Ali to treba reći.
I think you know that.	Mislim da to znaš.
I heard him say that.	Čuo sam ga kako to govori.
I don't have any.	Ja nemam.
You don’t know what you’re doing or what you’re supposed to be doing.	Ne znate šta radite ili šta biste trebali da radite.
They are in the house.	Oni su u kući.
It was really good.	Bilo je stvarno dobro.
I have them now.	Sada ih imam.
And almost nobody knows who they are.	I skoro niko ne zna ko su oni.
He never asked for anything.	Nikad ništa nije tražio.
But that is life.	Ali to je život.
He decided that was enough.	Odlučio je da je to dovoljno.
No, we have you here.	Ne, imamo te ovde.
I haven't started life yet.	Nisam još počeo život.
Anything can, really.	Bilo šta može, zaista.
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
He only wanted me.	Želio je samo mene.
I should have been happy.	Trebao sam biti sretan.
That is indeed true.	To je zaista istina.
I'm sorry about him.	Žao mi ga je.
He had a good life here.	Imao je dobar život ovdje.
It's a.	To je a.
It doesn't have to be.	Ne mora biti.
There is a lot to say.	Ima puno toga za reći.
But no, that's not it.	Ali ne, to nije to.
She said no.	Rekla je da nije.
I want to know what he knows.	Želim da znam šta on zna.
But he knew it was more than that.	Ali znao je da je to više od toga.
You did it right.	Uradili ste to kako treba.
But now I'm not.	Ali sada nisam.
I don't mean that.	Ne mislim to.
That was a good reason.	To je bio dobar razlog.
It could have been before.	To je moglo biti i prije.
This is a good thing.	Ovo je dobra stvar.
But it is.	Ali jeste.
I don't want to know.	Ne želim da znam.
It would be good to be home.	Bilo bi dobro biti kod kuće.
It would never be enough.	Nikada ne bi bilo dovoljno.
That was wrong.	To nije bilo u redu.
So good, so good.	Tako dobro, tako dobro.
We did it.	Uradili smo to.
This was just not right.	Ovo jednostavno nije bilo u redu.
Time is money.	Vrijeme je novac.
That's not what we have here.	To nije ono što imamo ovdje.
There is nothing more to do here.	Ovdje se više nema šta raditi.
He didn't know if they were still alive.	Nije znao da li su još uvek živi.
And not just myself.	I ne samo sebe.
No one could work harder.	Niko nije mogao raditi više.
It may be, it may not be.	Može biti, može biti ne.
I really dont know.	Ne znam stvarno.
She was alone now.	Sada je bila sama.
I'm going for help.	Idem po pomoć.
In fact, there are several of us.	Zapravo, nekoliko nas je.
What to do today?	Šta da radimo danas?
Many, many times.	Mnogo, mnogo puta.
This works for now.	Ovo za sada radi.
That's what he wants to be.	To želi da bude on.
I didn't waste time.	Nisam izgubio vrijeme.
And besides, she's not .	A osim toga, ona nije .
We can't be together.	Ne možemo biti zajedno.
I don't think he can.	Mislim da ne može.
We can go anywhere.	Možemo ići bilo gdje.
He now lives there.	On sada živi tamo.
You know how he works.	Znate kako on radi.
Maybe they were, a little.	Možda su bili, malo.
No problem, really.	Nema problema, zaista.
It can't be that.	To ne može biti to.
I can do it now.	Mogu to sada.
This was enough for that time.	Ovo je bilo dovoljno za to vrijeme.
You couldn't do that.	Nisi to mogao.
He didn't know what was going to happen.	Nije znao šta će se dogoditi.
That's right, one by one.	Tako je, jedan po jedan.
I'm still working on it.	Još uvijek radim na tome.
He was not alone.	Nije bio sam.
It's true.	To je istina.
It's not like now.	Nije kao sada.
I could.	Mogao bih.
We also know who did it.	Znamo i ko je to uradio.
There just isn’t much there.	Tamo jednostavno nema puno toga.
It's not safe here.	Ovdje nije sigurno.
It is easy to get money.	To je lako dobiti novac.
It's true.	To je tačno.
I guess he was right.	Pretpostavljam da je bio u pravu.
I'd like to actually.	Voleo bih to zapravo.
Nothing, and never.	Ništa, i nikad.
And people.	I ljudi.
But there is a way.	Ali postoji način.
I just want to see them.	Samo želim da ih vidim.
Besides, no.	Osim toga, ne.
It wasn't enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno.
I just went on.	Ja sam jednostavno otišao dalje.
She said she was feeling well.	Rekla je da se osjeća dobro.
She doesn't say how old she is.	Ona ne govori koliko ima godina.
It wasn't like that last year.	Nije tako bilo prošle godine.
We need to work harder.	Moramo više raditi.
And if even you don't do that.	A ako čak ni ti to ne uradiš.
What else do you need?	Šta ti još treba?
I would do anything for you.	Sve bih uradio za tebe.
You know you're glad.	Znaš da ti je drago.
It was good to be back there again.	Bilo je dobro vratiti se tamo ponovo.
He must be better than he ever was.	Mora biti bolji nego što je ikada bio.
But there you are.	Ali tu si.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
I guess he's pretty good.	Pretpostavljam da je prilično dobar.
He didn't do it, you know.	On to nije uradio, znaš.
I See You.	Vidim te.
You have to help me.	Moraš mi pomoći.
There is a good reason for that.	Za to postoji dobar razlog.
But she was very much so.	Ali ona je bila veoma to.
Like them.	Kao i oni.
And he would know.	I on bi znao.
Seems right to me.	Čini mi se u pravu.
Tell me what you know.	Reci mi šta znaš.
You can do it again.	Možete to učiniti ponovo.
What do you think we should do?	Šta misliš da treba da uradimo?
And he will.	I hoće.
She didn't want to do anything.	Nije htela ništa da uradi.
It is, and in what way.	Jeste, i na koji način.
We should do it well.	Trebali bi to dobro uraditi.
But if not.	Ali ako nije.
That's fine for now.	To je u redu za sada.
I can be here as I am anywhere.	Mogu biti ovdje kao i bilo gdje.
I still don't know.	I dalje ne znam.
I will be alone.	Ja ću biti sam.
I really wonder what will happen next.	Zaista se pitam šta će se dalje dogoditi.
Lots of problems.	Puno problema.
Now is the time to do it for myself.	Sada je vrijeme da to radim za sebe.
And she needs and loves you.	I ona te treba i voli.
Maybe it's for you too.	Možda je i za tebe.
Either good or bad.	Bilo dobro ili loše.
He doesn't want that life.	On ne želi taj život.
But she knew the real reason.	Ali znala je pravi razlog.
Many times you don't have to do anything.	Mnogo puta ne morate ništa da radite.
You were just.	Bio si samo.
It is simply what it is.	Jednostavno je ono što jeste.
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.	Mislim da u tome nema ništa loše.
We have to.	Moramo.
I know it's not.	Znam da nije.
For both of you.	Za vas oboje.
I know he would say that too	Znam da bi i on to rekao
I know something that might help	Znam nešto što bi moglo pomoći
I was no longer human	Nisam više bio čovjek
I've heard it's happening here	Čuo sam da se to dešava ovde
That must be it.	Mora da se radi o tome.
This is enough.	Ovo je dosta.
Like him.	Kao i on.
I need to talk to you	Moram razgovarati s tobom
I'd.	Ja bih.
He is not afraid.	On se ne boji.
But it never works.	Ali to nikada ne radi.
Or not even that.	Ili čak ni to.
I never even saw him.	Nikad ga nisam ni video.
I didn't expect any of that	Nisam očekivao ništa od toga
She knew exactly what to do.	Tačno je znala šta da radi.
We know that and it should be.	Mi to znamo i trebalo bi da bude.
I'm not sure yet.	Nisam još siguran.
The car wasn't that bad.	Auto nije bio tako loš.
I'm ready to do it	Spreman sam to učiniti
And that wasn't good enough.	A to nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
I mean really, really good	Mislim stvarno, stvarno dobro
She is the only one.	Ona je jedina.
It's really nothing.	Zaista nije ništa.
And that is not obvious.	A to nije očigledno.
I do it hard.	Radim to teško.
This is a good thing for me.	Ovo je dobra stvar za mene.
I think it works.	Mislim da radi.
There's a car waiting for you.	Tamo te čeka auto.
Which he would do.	Što bi on i uradio.
It just looks like something so real.	Samo izgleda kao nešto tako stvarno.
He should have known.	Trebao je znati.
I don't think he even knew about it.	Mislim da nije ni znao za to.
I doubt it ever will be.	Sumnjam da će ikada biti.
Or she was.	Ili je to bila.
I didn't know it was this week	Nisam znao da je to ove sedmice
I'm glad you look so good	Drago mi je što izgledaš tako dobro
A little more time to do what he has to do	Još malo vremena da uradi ono što mora
We don't know what it was.	Ne znamo šta je to bilo.
I know everything that's going on here	Znam sve što se ovde dešava
Maybe I know.	Možda znam.
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
But it's okay.	Ali u redu je.
And here it must be so.	I ovdje mora biti tako.
I think so too.	I ja tako mislim.
If you do, there's a door.	Ako to uradiš, tu su vrata.
Nobody needs you here.	Niko te ovde ne treba.
I have to see something	Moram nešto da vidim
It's just that it's not.	Samo što nije.
I could tell it was them.	Mogao sam reći da su to oni.
Now I'm not so sure.	Sada nisam tako siguran.
It's not that bad.	Nije tako loše.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
I thought it would be easy	Mislio sam da će biti lako
I can not.	Ne, ne mogu.
I hope you know that	Nadam se da to znate
You know how bad the job was.	Znate koliko je loš posao bio.
I wonder if now is the time to ask.	Pitam se da li je sada vrijeme da pitam.
I didn't even see him waiting there	Nisam ga čak ni vidio da čeka tamo
Mine doesn't have it.	Moj to nema.
I used to be him and he will soon be me.	Nekada sam bila on i on će uskoro biti ja.
I didn’t know anything better at the time	Nisam znao ništa bolje u to vrijeme
What exactly do you want?	Šta tačno želiš.
He doesn't see it.	On to ne vidi.
But he had no one to see him.	Ali nije imao ko da ga vidi.
It couldn't be that.	To nije moglo biti to.
I'm so sorry, not really	Tako mi je žao, ne baš
I know you didn't mean that	Znam da nisi tako mislio
Look, if you really want to, you can.	Vidi, ako stvarno želiš to možeš.
You know what you look like.	Znaš kako izgledaš.
I didn't want to know more	Nisam htela da znam više
No one needs to know.	Niko ne treba da zna.
I'll be here	Ja ću biti ovdje
And he's right.	I u pravu je.
I didn't have to tell anyone	Nisam morao nikome reći
She said people can help me with that.	Rekla je da mi ljudi mogu pomoći u tome.
Just do these things.	Samo radi ove stvari.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
She doesn't want to do this either.	Ni ona ne želi ovo da uradi.
I wonder where we are	Pitam se gdje smo
I had no idea what to say.	Nisam imao pojma šta da kažem.
We are a people business.	Mi smo posao ljudi.
He's still there.	On je još uvek tamo.
I guess that's the problem.	Pretpostavljam da je to problem.
You know this now.	Znaš ovo sada.
I was a good guy.	Bio sam dobar momak.
I just know where you are	Samo znam gdje si
He just loved it.	Jednostavno je volio to.
I didn't even see you	Nisam te ni vidio
You don't have to talk to me.	Ne moraš sa mnom razgovarati.
I never want to know	Nikad ne želim da znam
I have said that many times.	To sam više puta rekao.
And, it must be said, a few things to buy.	I, mora se reći, nekoliko stvari koje treba kupiti.
I love you so much.	Volim puno.
I wasn't sure what to do now	Nisam bio siguran šta da radim sada
Except for you and me.	Osim tebe i mene.
I just wish it hadn't been that long	Samo bih volio da nije tako dugo
I hope he comes.	Nadam se da će doći.
She just wanted to see you.	Samo je htela da te vidi.
I don't like it now	Sada mi se ne sviđa
I do not see.	Ne vidim.
I don't know where the problem is.	Ne znam gdje je problem.
He said he did.	Rekao je da jeste.
There is nothing to see there.	Tamo nema šta da se vidi.
But he never would, he knew that now.	Ali nikada neće, sada je to znao.
I never went back to that.	Nikad se nisam vratio na to.
But it goes beyond that.	Ali to ide i dalje od toga.
You know things.	Ti znaš stvari.
As she says.	Kao što ona kaže.
I really like that guy	Stvarno mi se sviđa taj momak
I love money.	Volim novac.
And that can't be good.	A to ne može biti dobro.
I saw the video like all of us	Video sam video kao i svi mi
I never work.	Ja nikad ne radim.
It always is.	Uvek jeste.
I went there today, but no one was home	Danas sam otišao tamo, ali nikoga nije bilo kod kuće
This may not work.	Ovo možda neće učiniti.
I came to tell him that.	Došao sam da mu to kažem.
I sure would.	Sigurno bi.
It's about fun.	Radi se o zabavi.
Life was good.	Život je bio dobar.
You seem to know right away what to do.	Čini se da odmah znate šta da radite.
We can't stay here either.	Ni mi ne možemo ostati ovdje.
I can't be alone with him	Ne mogu biti sama s njim
A real guy.	Pravi momak.
I know it's her right now.	Znam da je to ona odmah.
These are just thoughts.	To su samo misli.
We have everything here.	Ovde imamo sve.
It's true.	To je istina.
And she can stay there.	I ona može ostati tamo.
I've done it before, at home.	Radio sam to ranije, kod kuće.
That's what it looks like.	Tako to izgleda.
I want to know if it works	Želim da znam da li radi
There is enough to wear.	Ima dovoljno da se nosi.
I really hope it helps me	Zaista se nadam da će mi pomoći
I needed to work harder	Trebao sam više raditi
So you can buy it.	Tako da ga možete kupiti.
This is the truth.	Ovo je istina.
That's what he said.	To je on rekao.
You never knew he was there.	Nikad nisi znao da je tu.
They did it all.	Oni su sve to uradili.
That's your life.	To je tvoj život.
I hope he finds something	Nadam se da će naći nešto
I shouldn't talk about it.	Ne bih trebao o tome.
I didn't ask what was going on	Nisam pitao šta se dešava
I didn't do you any harm	Nisam ti učinio ništa loše
He left.	Otišao je.
And it would.	I to bi.
As it is exactly my life.	Kao što je to tačno moj život.
Will something good happen.	Hoće li se nešto dobro dogoditi.
I know there's more.	Znam da ima još toga.
I just didn’t expect it so quickly.	Samo nisam očekivao tako brzo.
It could be done.	To bi se moglo uraditi.
I didn't expect to see you here	Nisam očekivao da ću te vidjeti ovdje
The problem was not there.	Problem nije bio tu.
I went back to what he said	Vratio sam se na ono što je rekao
I see that happening	Vidim da se to dešava
I want to be both, completely.	Želim da budem oboje, potpuno.
You were happy.	Bio si sretan.
None of us are.	Niko od nas nije.
We need rain.	Treba nam kiša.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
Yes, that will be it.	Da, to će biti to.
I just can’t see it that way.	Jednostavno je ne mogu vidjeti na taj način.
It's there.	Tamo je.
I had nothing to do	Nisam imao šta da radim
I hope he is not afraid	Nadam se da se ne boji
Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have.	Možda je video nešto što nije trebalo.
I can't say anything.	Ne mogu ništa reći.
It always has been, and always will be.	Uvek je bilo, i uvek će biti.
You can't be sure.	Ne možete biti sigurni.
But someone has to do it.	Ali neko to mora da uradi.
Even now he wasn't quite sure why.	Čak ni sada nije bio baš siguran zašto.
I'm fine with that.	Dobro sam s tim.
You knew better.	Znao si bolje.
And I'm fine with that.	I ja sam u redu sa tim.
She was right.	Bila je u pravu.
I've had enough.	Dosta mi je toga.
I do what he wants	Ja radim šta on želi
I was just thinking about him	Samo sam mislio na njega
I hope there is someone there	Nadam se da ima nekoga tamo
I just got back to work, as usual	Upravo sam se vratio na posao, kao i obično
I won't do this anymore.	Neću ovo više raditi.
He knew who it was.	Znao je ko je to.
You heard him.	Čuo si ga.
But she says nothing.	Ali ona ne govori ništa.
A lot needs to be done.	Mnogo toga treba uraditi.
There was nothing you could do.	Ništa nisi mogao učiniti.
I didn't tell him everything	Nisam mu sve rekao
Maybe I don't know today	Možda ne znam danas
I would like to see you	Voleo bih da te vidim
I think that's my way	Mislim da je to moj način
Like you.	Kao i ti.
It won't be my first time.	Neće mi biti prvi put.
Yes, it must be him.	Da, mora da je on.
I ask if there is anything else	Pitam da li ima još nešto
I would like someone to help me, or I like it	Volio bih da mi neko pomogne, ili da mi se sviđa
I hope he's not home now	Nadam se da sada nije kod kuće
There is a lot of talk about that as well.	Mnogo se priča i o tome.
It's not hard for anyone.	Nikome nije teško.
I should have done this a few days ago.	Trebao sam ovo uraditi prije nekoliko dana.
He already knew everything.	On je već sve znao.
I think that was obvious	Mislim da je to bilo očigledno
Please, enough.	Molim te, dosta.
I mean, they used to be	Mislim, nekada su bili
Or would.	Ili bi.
We can't do that.	Ne možemo to učiniti.
They just don't know who will.	Samo ne znaju ko će.
I'm not sure how long	Nisam siguran koliko dugo
There is no one to help you.	Nema ko da ti pomogne.
He didn't say anything for a long time.	Dugo vremena nije ništa rekao.
No, not really, he said.	Ne, ne baš, rekao je.
I had to do something.	Morao sam nešto da uradim.
It's good now.	Sada je dobro.
Do it fast.	Uradi to brzo.
I can't say anything	Ne mogu ništa reći
I had no idea what to say	Nisam imao pojma šta da kažem
All you have to do is say.	Sve što treba da uradiš je da kažeš.
I can't believe he didn't come home with us.	Ne mogu vjerovati da nije došao kući s nama.
Now and here.	Sada i ovdje.
But he did none of that.	Ali on nije uradio ništa od toga.
A friend would never do as you did	Prijatelj nikada ne bi uradio kao što si ti uradio
Just tell me that.	Samo mi to reci.
And I knew he was right	I ja sam znao da je u pravu
She's having a party.	Ona pravi zabavu.
We have these.	Imamo ove.
All this.	Sve ovo.
He loves no one.	On ne voli nikoga.
I shouldn't have gone	Nisam trebao ići
When the time comes, he will leave.	Kad dođe vrijeme, on će otići.
I doubt it, but maybe	Sumnjam, ali možda
This is them here.	Ovo su oni ovde.
They knew what it was all about.	Znali su o čemu se radi.
I wonder what else he knows.	Pitam se šta još zna.
I knew it was wrong.	Znao sam da nije u redu.
Now they know better.	Sada znaju bolje.
But she knew nothing.	Ali nije znala ništa.
Yes, he would be there.	Da, on bi bio tamo.
You did what you could.	Uradio si šta si mogao.
But we couldn't.	Ali nismo mogli.
That was the problem.	To je bio problem.
I really like it here	Stvarno mi se sviđa ovdje
I wasn't sure if you've been here before	Nisam bio siguran da li si bio ovdje prije
Everything works for me here.	Ovde mi sve radi.
I just have to be my own	Samo moram biti svoj
I feel better there.	Tamo mi je bolje.
I didn't get to do it	Nisam stigao da to uradim
I want you here with me	Želim te ovdje sa mnom
I am you.	Ja sam ti.
I can't tell you how many times	Ne mogu vam reći koliko puta
I was the only person there	Ja sam bio jedina osoba tamo
There was no help.	Nije se moglo pomoći.
I had no one to help me	Nisam imao ko da mi pomogne
I can't say anything more than that	Ne mogu reći ništa više od toga
There could be more.	Moglo bi biti i više.
I couldn't tell which one it was	Nisam mogao reći koja je to bila
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno ste u pravu.
I just will.	Ja ću samo.
I'll say this.	Reći ću ovo.
I'm glad you're here!	Drago mi je da ste ovdje!
I've been there before and done it	Bio sam tamo ranije i uradio to
I can not anymore	Ne mogu više
Nothing is certain anymore.	Ništa više nije sigurno.
You are a team.	Vi ste tim.
I never want to see her again	Ne želim je više nikada vidjeti
I know it's not.	Znam da nije.
I wasn't sure about any of that	Nisam bio siguran ni u šta od toga
I guess you have one	Pretpostavljam da imaš jedan
And that's what we did.	I to je ono što smo uradili.
It can all be done.	Sve se to može uraditi.
Like never before.	Kao nikad.
We're not there yet.	Još nismo tamo.
I have heard them many times	Čuo sam ih mnogo puta
I didn't need to see him.	Nisam morao da ga vidim.
But it doesn’t have to be that way, she said.	Ali to ne mora biti tako, rekla je.
I know you're very busy	Znam da si veoma zauzet
He was so sorry.	Bilo mu je tako žao.
I'm here now, with you	Sada sam ovdje, sa tobom
Just like home.	Kao kod kuće.
I should tell you that	Trebao bih to da ti kažem
And now it was so.	I sada je bilo tako.
I didn't want to do those things.	Nisam htela da radim te stvari.
You will tell me the truth.	Reći ćeš mi istinu.
It just has to work.	Samo mora da radi.
Everything must be fine.	Sve mora biti u redu.
I love her very much	Ja je jako volim
I just need to know what it is	Samo moram znati šta je to
I wanted to talk to you about last night	Htio sam razgovarati s tobom o sinoć
I think they are a good thing	Mislim da su dobra stvar
Do it the right way.	Radite to na pravi način.
There's nothing there for you.	Tamo nema ništa za tebe.
The way he ended it.	Način na koji je to završio.
I'm better for it now.	Sada mi je bolje zbog toga.
I have something to do tonight	Imam nešto da radim večeras
I can't do this anymore	Ne mogu više s tim
And he seems to be doing a good job.	I izgleda da radi dobar posao.
I just did what they told me to do	Samo sam uradio ono što su mi rekli
This is not true.	To nije istina.
You haven't seen a lot of them.	Nisi ih vidio puno.
What could have happened.	Šta se moglo dogoditi.
I know he's sorry	Znam da mu je žao
Everything you think is true.	Sve što mislite je istina.
I wanted it, I even needed it	Želeo sam to, čak mi je trebalo
Maybe more than it should.	Možda i više nego što bi trebalo.
I didn't even have to ask.	Nisam ni morao da pitam.
I don't know if that's true.	Ne znam da li je to istina.
I just saw it happen	Upravo sam vidio da se to dogodilo
I haven't had it in almost three years	Nisam ga imao skoro tri godine
I was almost sorry	Skoro mi je bilo žao
Do not be .	Nemoj biti .
She wasn't here.	Ona nije bila ovde.
And it doesn't look so good.	I ne izgleda tako dobro.
I do not see.	Ne vidim.
I want to do everything with you	Želim sve da uradim sa tobom
I wondered why that was	Pitao sam se zašto je to tako
A few things, actually	Nekoliko stvari, zapravo
I need to know how bad it is	Moram da znam koliko je loše
But he already knew who was there.	Ali on je već znao ko je tamo.
I have many more things to tell you	Imam još mnogo stvari da ti kažem
I didn't do this just for myself	Nisam ovo uradio samo za sebe
It wasn't fast enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno brzo.
Another car and he would be there.	Još jedan auto i on bi bio tamo.
I know it won't help	Znam da neće pomoći
Either you are, or you are not.	Ili jesi, ili nisi.
This is not easy.	Ovo nije lako.
I don't know what to do, really.	Ne znam šta da radim, zaista.
I'm sure he did	Siguran sam da je to uradio
That is not the case.	To nije tako.
He just likes it too much here.	Samo mu se previše sviđa ovdje.
I have no idea what it is	Nemam pojma šta je to
I don't know how he did it.	Ne znam kako je to uradio.
I was happy to be back	Bio sam sretan što sam se vratio
What I did.	Šta sam učinio.
I've done this many times	Radio sam ovo mnogo puta
He must.	On mora.
I didn't give it.	Nisam ga dao.
She has something about us.	Ona ima nešto o nama.
I see her a lot.	Vidim je puno.
It's pretty easy.	To je prilično lako.
I can do much better.	Mogu mnogo bolje.
This has happened several times	To se dogodilo nekoliko puta
What will happen?	Šta će se dogoditi?
This is no longer a problem.	Ovo više nije problem.
She knew what she wanted.	Znala je šta želi.
I didn't do it today.	Nisam to uradio danas.
Please don't do that.	Molim te nemoj to raditi.
I had to talk to you	Morao sam razgovarati s tobom
He didn't need me anymore.	Nisam mu više trebao.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žao.
I promised him that	To sam mu obećao
Maybe a question.	Možda pitanje.
I know exactly what will happen next.	Tačno znam šta će se dalje dogoditi.
Not just me, but everyone.	Ne samo ja, nego svi.
I hope you know that	Nadam se da to znaš
There was no time now.	Sada nije bilo vremena.
There was something else.	Bilo je još nešto.
I have no idea.	Nemam pojma.
But not tonight, no, not tonight.	Ali ne večeras, ne, ne večeras.
They could do anything.	Mogli bi raditi bilo šta.
I didn't want you to know what my father did.	Nisam želeo da znaš šta je moj otac uradio.
I see, yes.	Vidim, da.
I had nothing to say	Nisam imao šta da kažem
I wasn't even sure who your father was	Nisam ni bio siguran ko je tvoj otac
Or he had them there.	Ili ih je tamo imao.
But it still doesn't work.	Ali i dalje ne radi.
He knew he had to say it.	Znao je da to mora reći.
I'll just leave.	Samo ću otići.
I know how hard it is for you	Znam koliko ti je teško
Maybe this is true.	Možda je ovo tačno.
And see what happens.	I vidi šta se dešava.
It's not just about tonight.	Ne radi se samo o večeras.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
I don't like that.	Ne sviđa mi se to.
This is not true.	Ovo nije istina.
Everyone will know.	Svi će znati.
I knew it was as true as he was	Znao sam da je to istina koliko i on
But this is a problem.	Ali, ovo je problem.
He should know better.	On bi trebao znati bolje.
I didn't have time to tell you	Nisam imao vremena da ti kažem
I don't know if it is.	Ne znam da li je.
It was more than I saw.	Bilo je to više nego što sam ja vidio.
I just wanted you to know this is happening	Samo sam htela da znaš da se ovo dešava
How not.	Kako ne.
They did a very good job for us.	Uradili su veoma dobar posao za nas.
It took me a while for myself	Trebalo mi je malo vremena za sebe
It was good and bad.	Bilo je dobro i loše.
Which probably isn't much.	Što vjerovatno nije puno.
You knew what was going to happen.	Znao si šta će se dogoditi.
There was nothing we could do.	Ništa nismo mogli.
I can see all the houses	Mogu vidjeti sve kuće
I thought it was okay with that	Mislio sam da je u redu sa tim
I haven't told anyone yet.	Još nikome nisam rekao.
I saw nothing wrong with that.	Nisam vidio ništa loše u tome.
I didn't hear anything from home.	Nisam čuo ništa od kuće.
We weren't last year.	Nismo bili prošle godine.
I wish I knew	Voleo bih da znam
I asked her to give me time	Zamolio sam je da mi da vremena
I have no idea what the problem is	Nemam pojma u čemu je problem
It was now.	Sada je bilo.
I asked you three times	Pitao sam te tri puta
I want to do them now	Želim da ih uradim sada
So nothing happens.	Tako da se ništa ne dešava.
That is simply not true.	To jednostavno nije istina.
I want to know how this all happens.	Želim da znam kako se sve ovo dešava.
I couldn't say anything	Nisam mogao reći ništa
I saw you today.	Vidio sam se danas.
I know everything that's going on here	Znam sve što se dešava ovde
We just didn't tell you.	Samo ti nismo rekli.
He just said he saw you a lot.	Samo je rekao da vas je mnogo vidio.
I know you were there last night	Znam da si bio tamo sinoć
I mean, if you do, that's fine	Mislim, ako to uradiš, to je u redu
I can always go to someone and tell them	Uvek mogu otići do nekoga i reći mu
So far so good today.	Do sada je danas bilo dobro.
We could have done more.	Mogli smo i više.
You did this.	Ti si ovo uradio.
I was looking for fun.	Tražio sam zabavu.
I guess you're right	Pretpostavljam da si u pravu
She is now.	Ona je sada.
I couldn't do that yet	Ja to još nisam mogao
I wasn’t sure what, but it was real.	Nisam bio siguran šta, ali bilo je stvarno.
I need to know what you really are	Moram da znam šta si ti zaista
I think that would be helpful.	Mislim da bi to bilo od pomoći.
He won't say anything.	Neće reći ništa.
I know you are, obviously you are	Znam da jesi, očigledno jesi
He wasn't sure what to do next.	Nije bio siguran šta dalje.
I didn't.	Nisam.
It's really very good.	Zaista je jako dobro.
I have to tell you something.	Moram ti nešto reći.
I think he really likes it here.	Mislim da mu se stvarno sviđa ovdje.
Not always, but usually.	Ne uvek, ali obično.
Or anywhere here.	Ili bilo gdje ovdje.
And maybe it's even true.	A možda je čak i istina.
I couldn't do it for him	Nisam mogao to učiniti za njega
I didn't do it.	Ja to nisam uradio.
There was nothing that I could do.	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim.
I would love to see something very soon	Voleo bih da vidim nešto vrlo brzo
I didn't expect this	Nisam ovo očekivao
The truth is.	Istina je.
If you know anything, tell me.	Ako nešto znaš, reci mi.
The question is, rather, whether.	Pitanje je, prije, da li bi.
I had nothing	Nisam imao ništa
We can do it anytime.	Možemo to učiniti bilo kada.
That's right.	Tako su.
But who knows.	Ali ko zna.
I knew he loved me	Znao sam da me voli
He was really good.	Bio je zaista dobar.
He would come back and tell me.	Vratio bi se i rekao mi.
I think that's it	Mislim da je u tome
I didn't want to see this	Nisam htela ovo da vidim
I think they are right	Mislim da su u pravu
I just wanted to see how you were	Samo sam htela da vidim kako si
I wondered what he thought	Pitao sam se šta on misli
She never was.	Nikada nije bila.
I never had anything to do with it.	Nikad nisam imao ništa s tim.
Maybe you have too.	Možda i ti imaš.
I love my job.	Volim svoj posao.
But it is obviously more than that.	Ali očigledno je više od toga.
It would be safe.	Bilo bi sigurno.
I just didn't tell you	Samo ti nisam rekao
The video is enough.	Video je dovoljno.
I had to say something	Morao sam nešto reći
I guess you know too.	Pretpostavljam da i ti znaš.
He did it so well.	Uradio je to tako dobro.
That's not what you want.	To nije ono što želiš.
I have no idea where the door is	Nemam pojma gdje su vrata
No, tell him no.	Ne, reci mu ne.
I know someone who can help	Znam nekoga ko može pomoći
I would be surprised.	Bio bih iznenađen.
It was from me.	Bilo je od mene.
Nothing nothing.	Ništa ništa.
This is not much.	Ovo nije puno.
One.	Jedan.
I'm on it.	Ja sam na tome.
I hope he comes back.	Nadam se da će se vratiti.
He plays, and plays well.	Svira, i igra dobro.
I'm sorry about that to this day	Žao mi je zbog toga do danas
Maybe nothing will happen.	Možda se ništa neće dogoditi.
I knew the truth.	Znao sam istinu.
No one knew what to say.	Niko nije znao šta da kaže.
It's time to see.	Vrijeme je da se vidi.
A lot of it, really.	Dosta toga, zaista.
But for this.	Ali za ovo.
Does he really think so.	Da li on zaista tako misli.
You've been here for a while.	Tu ste već neko vrijeme.
I had so much to do yesterday	Imao sam toliko toga da uradim juče
I just wanted to do a good job.	Samo sam htela da uradim dobar posao.
Follow him !.	Za njim!.
Unless you want them too.	Osim ako ih i ti ne želiš.
She knows it herself.	I sama to zna.
I couldn't help myself	Nisam si mogao pomoći
But other than that, he didn't know what to do.	Ali osim toga, nije znao šta da radi.
You never know what might have happened.	Nikad ne znaš šta se moglo dogoditi.
He knew something was going to happen.	Znao je da će se nešto dogoditi.
And it certainly is.	I sigurno je tako.
I was not happy about that at all	Uopšte nisam bio sretan zbog toga
In fact, this is not true.	U stvari, ovo nije istina.
I just wanted to come see you	Upravo sam htio doći da te vidim
I see him there.	Vidim ga tamo.
You are a good man.	Ti si dobar čovjek.
We do it.	Mi to radimo.
I probably didn't have to tell you that	Vjerovatno ti to nisam morao reći
I wanted more time with you	Želeo sam više vremena sa tobom
I am the truth.	Ja sam istina.
And he loved us.	I on nas je volio.
And now it doesn’t seem to work anymore.	A sada se čini da više ne radi.
I don't have a problem with that, good for you	Nemam problem sa tim, dobro za tebe
I can only see.	Mogu samo da vidim.
This was someone who worked for a living.	To je bio neko ko je radio za život.
Things will be even better than before.	Stvari će biti još bolje nego prije.
I was just there.	Upravo sam bio tamo.
If you like someone, you like it.	Ako ti se neko sviđa, sviđa ti se.
I can't tell you anything more	Ne mogu vam reći ništa više
This seemed like a good idea.	Činilo se da je ovo dobra ideja.
Yes, he's gone.	Da, otišao je.
By now he knew how to do it.	Do sada je znao kako to učiniti.
I want them there too.	I ja ih želim tamo.
I wasn't sure what was going to happen	Nisam bio siguran šta će se dogoditi
I couldn't know that	Ne bih to mogao znati
I was glad I left, but I’m not sure why	Bilo mi je drago što sam otišao, ali nisam siguran zašto
But he's right.	Ali on je u pravu.
That was all he told us.	To je bilo sve što nam je rekao.
This is not me.	Ovo nisam ja.
He loved to play.	Voleo je da se igra.
Only a lot of things happen.	Samo se mnogo stvari dešava.
I had a problem with that	Imao sam problema s tim
That was the real problem.	To je bio pravi problem.
No one really knew what was going on.	Niko zaista nije znao šta se dešava.
I wish this had never happened	Volio bih da se ovo nikada nije dogodilo
He is nothing in himself.	On sam po sebi nije ništa.
In fact, he likes it more than people.	U stvari, on to voli više od ljudi.
I told him it was my car	Rekao sam mu da je to moj auto
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
Loved it.	Volio.
I need to see you now	Moram da te vidim sada
I didn't ask for him.	Nisam ga tražio.
He left.	Otišao je.
Just a thing, maybe.	Samo stvar, možda.
I want to tell him something	Želim nešto da mu kažem
I can do nothing but love you	Ne mogu ništa osim da te volim
I want to stay here for a while	Želim ostati ovdje neko vrijeme
They could still be a team.	I dalje bi mogli biti tim.
Maybe he still wants me.	Možda me još želi.
He would like to help.	Želio bi pomoći.
I know you really like this guy	Znam da ti se stvarno sviđa ovaj momak
I have to.	Moram.
Even more than before.	Čak i više nego ranije.
I will leave and I will not return	Otići ću i neću se vratiti
This is your job.	Ovo je tvoj posao.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
I couldn't tell him	Nisam mu mogao reći
It just wasn't enough.	To jednostavno nije bilo dovoljno.
It's hard, so hard.	Teško je, tako teško.
It's not what it seems.	Nije ono što se čini.
Maybe that's true.	Možda je to istina.
I just figured something out	Upravo sam nešto shvatio
And you know it really was.	I znaš da je to zaista bilo.
I don't think anyone even knew he was there	Mislim da niko nije ni znao da je tamo
I just wanted to.	Samo sam htela.
Looks good, doesn't it?	Izgleda dobro, zar ne.
We have to see.	Moramo vidjeti.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
It's hard to see those things.	Teško je vidjeti te stvari.
That's what I need.	Tako mi treba.
You just did it.	Jednostavno si to uradio.
He was supposed to help me see.	Trebalo je da mi pomogne da vidim.
I wondered where he was now	Pitao sam se gdje je sada
I tell him we're leaving	Kažem mu da ćemo otići
I know it doesn't work that way	Znam da ne ide tako
He never seems to return.	Nikad se, izgleda, vratiti.
We need to know where we are.	Moramo znati gdje smo.
He thought that was enough.	Mislio je da je to dovoljno.
This seems like something that should be simple.	Ovo se čini kao nešto što bi trebalo biti jednostavno.
I didn't ask for this	Nisam tražio ovo
We had something for that.	Imali smo nešto zbog toga.
No one should ever know.	Niko nikada ne bi trebao znati.
It could happen anywhere.	Moglo bi se dogoditi bilo gdje.
I really had nothing to do	Zaista nisam imao šta da radim
Not so far.	Ne do sada.
I could never do without him	Nikad ne bih mogao bez njega
They just.	Oni samo.
But you know, maybe there's something there.	Ali znate, možda i tu ima nešto.
He came ready to play.	Došao je spreman da igra.
Not really, but not much more.	Ne baš, ali nije mnogo više.
I don't see what it is	Ne vidim šta je to
It's really okay.	Zaista je u redu.
It just doesn’t go together.	To jednostavno ne ide zajedno.
He was at home.	Bio je kod kuće.
He still loves her.	On je i dalje voli.
It was a meeting tomorrow.	To je bio sastanak sutra.
Not that she wanted to.	Nije da je htela.
And yes, that would happen.	I da, to bi se dogodilo.
I went back to the meeting.	Vratio sam se na sastanak.
But things are not so bad here.	Ali ovdje stvari i nisu tako loše.
I saw you when you didn't know	Video sam te kad nisi znao
You should do it for me, now	Treba da to uradiš za mene, odmah
This will help a lot.	Ovo će puno pomoći.
He plays well.	On igra dobro.
I'm glad he's here.	Drago mi je da je tu.
I had nothing to do.	Nisam imao šta da radim.
He thinks he knows everything.	On misli da sve zna.
They can't see me.	Ne mogu me vidjeti.
I knew he wanted to come	Znao sam da želi doći
In fact, you can.	U stvari, možete.
I saw them '.	Vidio sam ih'.
I wonder.	Pitam se.
I could have left.	Mogao sam otići.
I should work.	Trebalo bi da radim.
I want what she's up to	Želim ono na čemu je ona
But they are much more than that.	Ali oni su mnogo više od toga.
It never will be and never has been.	Nikada neće biti i nikada nije bilo.
I think there will be problems when he does	Mislim da će biti problema kada to uradi
I was not well at all	Uopšte mi nije bilo dobro
But it happened.	Ali dogodilo se.
I didn't want to work	Nisam htela da radim
I didn't even know he was there	Nisam ni znao da je tamo
I'm not sure if it will be.	Nisam siguran da li će biti.
But he is still with us.	Ali on je i dalje sa nama.
That's what he does.	To je ono što on radi.
He will, if he can.	Hoće, ako može.
I had no idea what he meant	Nisam imao pojma na šta misli
For me, it’s real.	Za mene je to stvarno.
I'm not doing anything wrong.	Ne radim ništa loše.
Or they should.	Ili bi trebali.
That was easy enough.	To je bilo dovoljno lako.
I still had no idea what to tell him.	Još uvijek nisam imao pojma šta da mu kažem.
I have nothing to say about it	Nemam šta da kažem o tome
He started.	Počeo je.
He lives.	Živi.
But there was more to it than that.	Ali bilo je i više od toga.
He couldn't believe what was happening to him.	Nije mogao vjerovati šta mu se dešava.
That happened before that.	To se dogodilo prije toga.
It was very bad for me.	Za mene je bilo jako loše.
I would even love to work there	Čak bih volio da radim tamo
I say who can be here	Ja kažem ko može biti ovde
I mean, someone had to do it.	Mislim, neko je to morao da uradi.
She is not .	Ona nije .
I want you, all of you	Želim vas, sve vas
He told you that.	On ti je to rekao.
We have you now.	Imamo te sada.
I'll go with him tonight	Ići ću s njim večeras
We can deal with that.	Možemo s tim.
There would be no money for me.	Za mene tu ne bi bilo novca.
I knew who you meant	Znao sam na koga si mislio
I would really love that	Ja bih to zaista volio
I just couldn't do it anymore	Jednostavno to više nisam mogao
I just felt sorry for him	Samo mi ga je bilo žao
When he's good, he's good.	Kad je dobar, dobar je.
I don't like it that much.	Ne sviđa mi se baš toliko.
And this just doesn’t look right.	A ovo jednostavno ne izgleda u redu.
And yes, he knows.	I da, on zna.
Someone who could easily get to do what he wants.	Neko koga bi lako mogao dobiti da radi ono što želi.
I'm not a bad guy here	Nisam ja loš momak ovdje
I still have a lot of them	Još ih imam mnogo
A lot of people.	Puno ljudi.
You are a true friend.	Ti si pravi prijatelj.
He did a good job.	Uradio je dobar posao.
And I got it.	I dobio sam.
Who may have known did not say.	Ko je možda znao nije rekao.
That's not a guy.	To nije momak.
I've never had that before.	Nikad to ranije nisam imao.
I can only stay a few days	Mogu ostati samo nekoliko dana
You don't need her.	Ne treba ti ona.
I will not leave you.	Neću otići od tebe.
I knew exactly what to do	Tačno sam znao šta da radim
I didn't want that, not yet	Nisam to želio, ne još
I would love to see him.	Voleo bih da ga vidim.
And there's a reason for that.	I postoji razlog za to.
I'm so happy to be here.	Tako sam sretan što sam ovdje.
They just didn't have the money.	Jednostavno nisu imali novca.
The money didn't look real.	Novac nije izgledao pravi.
They did a good job.	Uradili su dobar posao.
I wanted him to live	Želeo sam da živi
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
But she doesn't think so.	Ali ona ne misli tako.
Indeed, she was.	Zaista, bila je.
If you want.	Ako hoćeš.
I need a lot of help.	Trebalo bi mi puno pomoći.
I want to be completely safe.	Želim biti potpuno siguran.
I confessed.	Priznao sam.
I would do it for myself	Ja bih to uradio za sebe
I just told you that	Upravo sam ti to rekao
I didn't know what was going on	Nisam znao šta se dešava
It must be obvious.	Mora biti očigledno.
I don't think this is true	Mislim da ovo nije tačno
You are alone now.	Sada ste sami.
I've known that for a long time	Znao sam to dugo vremena
I know you want some	Znam da želiš malo
We simply needed the money.	Jednostavno, trebao nam je novac.
I'm not sure what to do.	Nisam baš siguran šta da radim.
It's not what you think.	Nije ono što misliš.
And I have to.	I moram.
Be.	Biti.
I have to do the right thing	Moram da uradim pravu stvar
He loved being there.	Voleo je da bude tamo.
There is nothing more to say.	Nema se šta više reći.
Only from time to time.	Samo s vremena na vrijeme.
Maybe no one.	Možda niko.
I started doing it.	Počeo sam to da radim.
He didn't need this.	Ovo mu nije trebalo.
You can stay as long as you want.	Možete ostati koliko želite.
I saw myself doing it.	Vidio sam sebe kako to radim.
I knew he couldn't be trusted	Znao sam da mu se ne može vjerovati
This is true.	Ovo je tačno.
This is not it.	Ovo nije to.
I still do them	I dalje ih radim
I was still fine.	I dalje mi je bilo dobro.
He wanted to help in any way.	Želio je pomoći na bilo koji način.
But you don't know who we are.	Ali vi ne znate ko smo mi.
That is no longer true.	To više nije istina.
It's always about that.	Uvijek se radi o tome.
And that's okay.	I to je u redu.
I began to doubt it	Počeo sam da sumnjam u to
I was sorry	Bilo mi je žao
Maybe he's gone.	Možda ga nema.
Maybe he'll come back.	Možda će se vratiti.
But no one does that.	Ali to niko ne radi.
This was not a real problem.	Ovo nije bio pravi problem.
I wish he was here with me	Voleo bih da je ovde sa mnom
I really didn't.	Zaista nisam.
I couldn't see enough of them to say	Nisam mogao da ih vidim dovoljno da bih rekao
They did everything right.	Sve su uradili kako treba.
I told him not to tell you	Rekao sam mu da ti ne kaže
I really wanted to go	Stvarno sam htela da idem
He came home with me.	Došao je kući sa mnom.
We were there.	Bili smo tamo.
They were both together, or nothing.	Bili su oboje zajedno, ili ništa.
We were a team.	Bili smo tim.
That's it.	To je to.
It can be anyone.	To može biti bilo ko.
But it’s something we can’t help you with.	Ali to je nešto u čemu vam ne možemo pomoći.
It wasn't like that now.	Sada nije bilo tako.
And you know what, that's okay.	I znaš šta, to je u redu.
I see you're busy	Vidim da si zauzet
I wondered if that was good too	Pitao sam se da li je i to dobro
He knew where.	Znao je gdje.
I knew something bad was going to happen	Znao sam da će se nešto loše dogoditi
I would love to see this	Voleo bih da vidi ovo
It's hard to do.	Teško je to učiniti.
It could not be found.	Nije se moglo naći.
I love you.	Volim te.
I love being here	Volim da si ovde
We don't know what this is about.	Ne znamo o čemu se radi.
I thought not.	Mislio sam da ne.
I think that's obvious	Mislim da je to očigledno
For him.	Za njega.
I wish everything was so easy	Voleo bih da je sve tako lako
I can't do that this time.	Ne mogu to da uradim ovaj put.
Not without me.	Ne bez mene.
I'm not entirely sure	Nisam potpuno siguran
You got the job, so far.	Dobio si posao, do sada.
I was there on time, and so was he	Ja sam bio tamo na vrijeme, a i on
No, I wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
As you thought.	Kao što si mislio.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
When he returned, he was perfectly fine.	Kada se vratio, bio je potpuno dobro.
You don't have to.	Ne morate.
We need more of that	Treba nam više toga
It was just me now.	Sada sam bio samo ja.
It won't help.	Neće pomoći.
That's not good either.	Ni to nije dobro.
I would love to see her again.	Voleo bih da je ponovo vidim.
Indeed, the only one.	Zaista, jedini.
He has to do something.	Mora nešto da uradi.
It must be real.	Mora da je stvarno.
Or very, very little.	Ili vrlo, vrlo malo.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
We were no longer alone.	Više nismo bili sami.
I told you that.	Rekao sam ti to.
That doesn't seem to be right.	Čini se da to nije u redu.
I didn't want to see what happened next	Nisam htela da vidim šta se dalje dešava
It's not like now.	Nije kao sada.
Or too much of me.	Ili previše od mene.
I really wanted to see you do it again	Stvarno sam htela da te vidim da to ponovo radiš
If he's still here.	Ako je još uvijek ovdje.
I guess you don't know.	Pretpostavljam da ne znaš.
I was just wondering something	Baš sam se nešto pitao
I'll just say that.	Reći ću samo to.
I've been here before.	Bio sam ovdje prije.
I'm not surprised, really.	Nisam iznenađen, zaista.
I couldn't help myself	Nisam si mogao pomoći
It is and it is not.	Jeste i nije.
I wondered where we were	Pitao sam se gdje smo
I didn't expect that at all	Nisam to uopšte očekivao
It was all before he left.	Sve je to bilo prije nego što je otišao.
I have to go to work soon	Moram uskoro na posao
I had no money for the trip.	Nisam imao novca za put.
I already know all this	Sve ovo već znam
I was busy.	Bio sam zauzet.
You should never have seen this.	Ovo nikada nisi trebao ni vidjeti.
My job is so good.	Moj posao je tako dobar.
She's you know what.	Ona je znaš šta.
Maybe I could.	Možda bih mogao.
That's right.	To treba.
I mean, we can't be alone	Mislim, ne možemo biti sami
He didn't hear.	Nije čuo.
Do what he says.	Uradi šta kaže.
But it should not have been done.	Ali to nije trebalo učiniti.
It would be better for us.	Bilo bi bolje za nas.
I would have time for that	Imao bih vremena za to
Yes, we have.	Da, da imamo.
A few, actually.	Nekoliko, zapravo.
I still have plenty of time	Imam još dosta vremena
I just thought you needed a little more	Samo sam mislio da bi ti trebalo malo više
He tells us everything.	Sve nam govori.
He didn't want them.	Nije ih želio.
But how is it.	Ali kako je.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
I asked what he meant	Pitao sam na šta misli
He was there, he did it.	Bio je tamo, uradio je to.
I think we only need one	Mislim da nam treba samo jedan
I hope you will help us	Nadam se da ćete nam pomoći
I didn't know what to do about it	Nisam znao šta da radim o tome
I need to know how it is	Moram da znam kako je
They would never tell me.	Nikad mi ne bi rekli.
I don't think that's true	Mislim da to nije istina
Now everything is going.	Sada sve ide.
No, no.	Nisi, ne.
Something has to be done.	Nešto se mora učiniti.
I want that too.	I ja to želim.
I think he knows that	Mislim da on to zna
I could do something	Mogao bih nešto učiniti
She is.	Ona je.
I wish he hadn't said that	Voleo bih da to nije rekao
In fact, he looked pretty good today.	Zapravo, danas je izgledao prilično dobro.
But no one says that.	Ali to niko ne govori.
I left, but not much	Otišao sam, ali ne mnogo
Now, do it.	Sada, uradi to.
I have almost three times more than you	Ja imam skoro tri puta više od tebe
I couldn't help him much	Nisam mu mogao puno pomoći
That this is true.	Da je ovo istina.
I have time.	Imam vremena.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu ide.
You looked like you really wanted to.	Izgledao si kao da to stvarno želiš.
It was time for him	Bilo je vrijeme za njega
I wonder where he is now	Pitam se gdje je sada
He did not say how much it would be.	Nije rekao koliko će to biti.
Maybe it's wrong.	Možda nije u redu.
I could do it myself at home	Mogao bih i sam to raditi kod kuće
I didn't think anyone would do it for someone	Nisam mislio da će neko to učiniti za nekoga
He certainly won't come.	Sigurno neće doći.
I had no idea you could do this.	Nisam imao pojma da možeš ovo da uradiš.
I loved knowing what was going on.	Voleo sam da znam šta se dešava.
I loved them together	Voleo sam ih zajedno
I never thought you would do something like that	Nikad nisam mislio da ćeš uraditi tako nešto
I want to work.	Želim da radim.
But not for him.	Ali ne za njega.
I did everything yesterday and today	Sve sam uradio juče i danas
Not a new problem.	Nije novi problem.
But they didn't have time.	Ali nisu imali vremena.
I didn't really like being at home.	Nisam baš voleo da budem kod kuće.
If so, do something.	Ako jeste, uradite nešto.
I can't believe it's mine	Ne mogu vjerovati da je moja
That's me for the day.	To sam ja za taj dan.
I can't really say what it is	Ne mogu stvarno reći šta je to
Good.	Dobro.
I couldn't do it anymore.	Nisam mogao više.
As far as I know.	Koliko ja znam.
I wonder if it works	Pitam se da li radi
How to do it?	Kako uraditi ?.
I can't tell you anything more	Ne mogu ti ništa više reći
But it seems to have happened.	Ali izgleda da se to dogodilo.
If not, you should.	Ako nije, trebalo bi.
Everything has to be simple, simple, simple.	Sve mora biti jednostavno, jednostavno, jednostavno.
I decided not to do it	Odlučio sam da to ne radim
But he said it.	Ali on je to rekao.
I never told anyone	Nikad nikome nisam rekao
I really think my friend was right	Zaista mislim da je moj prijatelj bio u pravu
What could it be?	Šta bi to moglo biti?
Maybe he just wants to make sure you stay tonight.	Možda samo želi da bude siguran da ćeš ostati večeras.
He should have known better, really.	Trebao je znati bolje, stvarno.
And we really don't know much about it yet.	I zaista još ne znamo mnogo o tome.
And it really is.	I zaista je tako.
And not just mine.	I ne samo moj.
I never did.	Ja nikada.
I like it a lot.	Sviđa mi se mnogo.
I think it was very difficult for him.	Mislim da mu je bilo jako teško.
I was there alone	Bio sam tamo sam
Does anyone else see this?	Da li još neko vidi ovo?
I didn't ask for him	Nisam ga tražio
I just want something simple	Samo želim nešto jednostavno
This is going to be bad.	Ovo će biti loše.
I already knew what was going on	Već sam znao šta se dešava
I've never seen him want anything so bad	Nikad nisam vidio da želi nešto toliko
And maybe even like it.	A možda se čak i sviđa.
I didn't think it would be that hard	Nisam mislio da će biti tako teško
I hope you both come back.	Nadam se da ćete se oboje vratiti.
It won't be so real.	Neće biti tako stvarno.
I would not	Ne bih
She knew about him.	Znala je za njega.
He wondered where he was now.	Pitao se gdje je sada.
It's so long.	Tako je dugo.
I didn't hear you came	Nisam čuo da si došao
Maybe it was too good.	Možda je bilo previše dobro.
He could do that.	To je mogao.
She knew better than to say anything.	Znala je bolje nego bilo šta reći.
So are we.	I mi smo.
Let's see it doesn't happen.	Da vidim da se to ne dešava.
I can't be there anymore	Ne mogu više biti tamo
And much more.	I još mnogo toga.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
I also know who did this to you	Znam i ko ti je to uradio
I want to do this for you	Želim ovo da uradim za tebe
I know that.	Znam to.
He's had enough.	Dosta mu je.
I saw her for the first time last night	Prvi put sam je video sinoć
I need to know the things he said	Moram znati stvari koje je rekao
You can be sure of that.	Možete biti sigurni u to.
I had to know what he wanted	Morao sam da znam šta želi
I just have to be with you	Samo moram biti s tobom
I can't problem that.	Ne mogu problem u tome.
I was surprised when he wasn't	Bio sam iznenađen kada nije
I love working with you	Volim da radim sa tobom
I need help.	Treba mi pomoć.
I know that right now	Znam to odmah
I only know one way to do it.	Znam samo jedan način da to uradim.
Your day will come.	Tvoj dan će doći.
He he he.	On on on.
You can see them.	Možete ih vidjeti.
I won't tell him that	Neću mu to reći
As if it were.	Kao da jeste.
Very much of that.	Veoma od toga.
I wasn't sure	Nisam bio baš siguran
I completely lost it	Potpuno sam ga izgubio
In fact, very few people do.	U stvari, vrlo malo ljudi to radi.
I'm so glad you're here with me	Tako mi je drago što si ovdje sa mnom
But that is simply not true.	Ali to jednostavno nije istina.
I'm not afraid at all.	Uopšte se ne bojim.
I should have known it wouldn't be	Trebao sam znati da neće biti
Are you.	Jesi li.
I want you to do exactly what you want	Želim da radiš tačno ono što želiš
I didn't know about that	Nisam znao za to
I'm so right.	Toliko sam u pravu.
I only saw her a few times	Video sam je samo nekoliko puta
I was anything but, really	Bio sam sve samo ne, zaista
It was a happy meeting.	Bio je to sretan sastanak.
I don't think it should be done.	Mislim da to ne treba raditi.
I see that no one is	Vidim da niko nije
Even to myself.	Čak i sebi.
I say that's not enough	Kažem da to nije dovoljno
The question is difficult.	Pitanje je teško.
I want to know why you did this	Želim da znam zašto si ovo uradio
He's there now.	On je sada tamo.
I know how tired you are	Znam koliko si umoran
Something is still wanting.	Nešto se još uvek želi.
I couldn't leave, not yet	Nisam mogao otići, ne još
I can't do anything alone anymore	Ne mogu više ništa sama
A few times, actually.	Nekoliko puta, zapravo.
I don't know who she is anymore	Ne znam više ko je ona
He knew what he wanted.	Znao je šta želi.
I just never got to that	Jednostavno, nikad nisam stigao do toga
I'll be leaving soon.	Uskoro ću otići.
Good day to all.	Dobar dan svima.
I haven't been here in a while	Nisam bio ovdje neko vrijeme
I needed to see something.	Trebao sam nešto vidjeti.
Not so bad.	Nije tako loše.
I quickly decided not to tell him	Brzo sam odlučio da mu ne kažem
I need to talk to you.	Moram razgovarati s tobom.
This was much more.	Ovo je bilo mnogo više.
Nothing will be gained.	Ništa se neće dobiti.
Really this time.	Zaista ovaj put.
I would buy this again and again and again	Kupio bih ovo ponovo i ponovo i ponovo
I was still so tired	I dalje sam bio tako umoran
I haven't seen her in a while	Nisam je vidio neko vrijeme
I have my own business.	Imam svoj posao.
I know it shouldn't have, but it did	Znam da nije trebalo, ali jeste
No, she didn't want to talk.	Ne, nije htela da priča.
You can't be him.	Ne možeš biti on.
I can't do that yet.	Ja to još ne mogu.
We are here to work.	Ovdje smo da radimo.
I have to do a few things	Moram da uradim nekoliko stvari
She wasn't.	Nije bila.
I thought everything would be better	Mislio sam da će sve biti bolje
There's nothing you can do.	Ne možeš ništa da uradiš.
You just can't.	Jednostavno ne možete.
I'm not sure how much.	Nisam siguran koliko.
They were nothing.	Nisu bili ni o čemu.
He was sure he was.	Bio je siguran da jeste.
I couldn't believe he wanted me	Nisam mogao vjerovati da me želi
Never again.	Nikad više.
And he doesn't.	A on to ne čini.
There will be no more of them.	Neće ih biti više.
They are people.	Oni su ljudi.
Still no one does that.	I dalje to niko ne radi.
I really didn't know that	Zaista to nisam znao
I love her, she loves me	Volim je, ona voli mene
But he knew he was right.	Ali znao je da je u pravu.
A few there.	Nekoliko tamo.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
I have to be more.	Moram biti više.
I think what you did should have been done	Mislim da je to što si uradio trebalo da se uradi
People are here.	Ljudi su ovde.
I think that's it.	Mislim da je to to.
They won't come back.	Neće se vratiti.
He had nothing.	Nije imao ništa.
I have to be busy	Moram da budem zauzet
We didn't need them.	Nisu nam trebali.
I wish it was, but it wasn't.	Voleo bih da jeste, ali nije.
I am now going	Idem sada
It won't be easy.	Neće biti lako.
I am never alone in anything	Nikada nisam sama ni u čemu
I'll stay here	Ja ću ostati ovdje
Isn't anyone too happy about it.	Zar niko nije previše sretan zbog toga.
He never had a problem leaving.	Nikada nije imao problema da ode.
He knows that.	On to zna.
And you know what he said? 	I znaš šta je rekao?
.	.
I had no idea how much	Nisam imao pojma koliko
I had never heard of this before and had no idea.	Nikada ranije nisam ni čuo za ovo i nisam imao pojma.
I told you that earlier	Rekao sam ti to ranije
And this time we're going to do it right.	I ovaj put ćemo to uraditi kako treba.
he thought.	mislio je.
It still doesn't work.	I dalje ne radi.
Not from you.	Ne od tebe.
I want someone who can talk to me	Želim nekoga ko može razgovarati sa mnom
I will leave before tomorrow.	Otići ću prije sutra.
I knew the day would come	Znao sam da će doći dan
I feel sorry for them	Žao mi ih je
I wanted nothing from him or anyone	Nisam htio ništa ni od njega ni od bilo koga
I will help you.	Ja ću vam pomoći.
I wish more people did that	Voleo bih da više ljudi to radi
He never did that again.	Nikad to više nije uradio.
I think it will be good	Mislim da će biti dobro
But only if you want to.	Ali samo ako to želiš.
I wasn't really sure what was waiting for me	Nisam baš bio siguran šta me čeka
I'm glad you're both fine.	Drago mi je da ste oboje dobro.
She goes to school, she says.	Ona ide u školu, kaže.
I shouldn't have been here	Nisam trebao biti ovdje
Whether it was real, he could not say.	Da li je to bio pravi, nije mogao reći.
I just needed the money	Samo mi je trebao novac
I had nothing real	Nisam imao ništa stvarno
He had to go.	Morao je da ide.
Neither are you.	Nisi ni ti.
Hard.	Teško.
I will be alone.	Ja ću biti sam.
I could almost see us there	Skoro da sam mogao da nas vidim tamo
I knew it wouldn't be	Znao sam da neće biti
I'll come get you	Doći ću po tebe
Mine worked well enough.	Moj je radio dovoljno dobro.
I don't know why, she just knows.	Ne znam zašto, ona jednostavno zna.
I say yes and no.	Ja kažem, da i ne.
I'm always tired, so tired	Uvek sam umoran, tako umoran
He didn’t want the job he loved.	Nije želio posao koji je volio.
He never did anything to you.	Nikad ti ništa nije uradio.
It's hard for me to go anywhere.	Teško mi je ići bilo gdje.
If you can tell.	Ako možete reći.
Not even mine, really.	Čak ni moj, zaista.
I know it took a long time	Znam da je trebalo puno vremena
You can work.	Možeš raditi.
It can be helpful.	Može biti od pomoći.
I can't see the door	Ne vidim vrata
If not more.	Ako ne i više.
Nothing happened.	Ništa se nije dogodilo.
I think we knew this	Mislim da smo znali ovo
It should work.	Trebalo bi da ide.
A little for us.	Malo za nas.
There was a lot of that today.	Danas je bilo mnogo toga.
I just wish you'd told me earlier	Samo bih volio da si mi rekao ranije
He wasn't ready for that.	Nije bio spreman za to.
I mean, I hope so.	Mislim, nadam se.
Or maybe even three.	Ili možda čak tri.
I didn't know who the father was	Nisam znao ko je otac
But she doesn't have it.	Ali ona ga nema.
I’m still not sure why that was	Još uvijek nisam siguran zašto je to bilo
I'm not sure why this is happening.	Nisam siguran zašto se to dešava.
I know that everything that is happening is true	Znam da je sve što se dešava istina
It usually was.	Obično je bilo.
He knew people would come after him.	Znao je da će ljudi doći za njim.
Not like before.	Ne kao prije.
I hope to see you again soon	Nadam se da ćemo se uskoro ponovo vidjeti
I just want to know what my father was working on	Samo želim da znam na čemu je moj otac radio
But there are times.	Ali ima vremena.
I wanted to be able to say that	Htio sam to moći reći
I don't know why he did it.	Ne znam zašto je to uradio.
I didn't want to anymore	Nisam više htela
But for me that is not true.	Ali za mene to nije tačno.
I didn't want to know	Nisam htela da znam
We can say what we like.	Možemo reći šta nam se sviđa.
I don't know how they knew so quickly	Ne znam kako su tako brzo znali
I still think so.	I dalje to mislim.
That’s the way it’s done.	To je način na koji se to radi.
Obviously it won’t work for everyone.	Očigledno neće raditi za sve.
I had to ask her why.	Morao sam da je pitam zašto.
Like a car.	Kao auto.
I haven't even started yet.	Nisam još ni počeo.
I won't do it again	Neću to više raditi
I shouldn't have left	Nisam trebao otići
I knew you would be good	Znao sam da ćeš biti dobar
Very few things actually need to be done.	Vrlo malo stvari zapravo treba uraditi.
You were almost there.	Bio si skoro tamo.
To tell me he loves me	Da mi kaže da me voli
I had to ask you now	Morao sam da te pitam sada
I'm afraid this day will never come	Bojim se da ovaj dan nikada neće doći
Just the truth.	Samo istina.
You don't want to do that.	Ne želiš to da uradiš.
I should have found her already	Već sam je trebao naći
Everything my father did.	Sve što je moj otac napravio.
I gave this one life, and I have to give it back	Dao sam ovaj jedan život, i moram ga vratiti
Neither do they.	Ni oni.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
Nobody heard anything.	Niko ništa nije čuo.
I was glad to see that	Bilo mi je drago vidjeti to
I told him all about it	Rekao sam mu sve o tome
But that's enough.	Ali dosta je.
He told me he would come back for me.	Rekao mi je da će se vratiti po mene.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I will never do anything.	Nikada ništa neću uraditi.
She is right.	Ona je u pravu.
Never anything more.	Nikad ništa više.
But he wasn't good at it.	Ali nije bio dobar u tome.
I wish we could do that today	Volio bih da to možemo učiniti danas
A little while ago, maybe	Malo prije, možda
We can't know.	Ne možemo znati.
We just don't know.	Samo ne znamo.
When he comes.	Kad dođe.
Maybe he had to.	Možda je morao.
I know what this is about.	Znam o čemu se radi.
It would be so easy.	Bilo bi tako lako.
I would really love to see that	Zaista bih to volio vidjeti
Tell him he can come and stay with me.	Reci mu da može doći i ostati sa mnom.
You could have told me everything before you left.	Mogao si mi reći sve prije nego što si otišao.
I hope you will too.	Nadam se da ćeš i ti.
I know you have it in you	Znam da to imaš u sebi
It's easy for me.	Za mene je to lako.
I knew it would be very difficult	Znao sam da će biti jako teško
I want to see if that can be done.	Želim da vidim da li se to može uraditi.
I decided this morning, actually	Odlučio sam se jutros, zapravo
It was everything.	Bilo je sve.
I can't help it.	Ne mogu pomoći.
If you are.	Ako ste.
I wasn't a very good person	Nisam bila baš dobra osoba
I can tell, and she can say	Ja mogu reći, i ona može reći
I just didn’t see it work	Jednostavno nisam vidio da radi
But not today.	Ali ne danas.
It must be so.	Mora da je tako.
I thought some of it was still pretty good.	Mislio sam da je nešto od toga još uvijek prilično dobro.
It works now.	Sada radi.
It's something my father must have loved.	To je nešto što je moj otac sigurno volio.
I'm not even happy.	Nisam ni sretan.
I can't say that for myself	Ne mogu to reći za sebe
I didn't want to go without him	Nisam htela da idem bez njega
Nothing bad can happen to you there.	Tamo ti se ništa loše ne može dogoditi.
I love you very much, and	Volim te mnogo, i
But there is something else.	Ali postoji još nešto.
It exists or it doesn't.	Postoji ili nije.
I think he would love to see you	Mislim da bi volio da te vidi
I mean this in a good way.	Mislim ovo na dobar način.
I could tell something was wrong	Mogao sam reći da nešto nije u redu
I hope to be back tonight	Nadam se da ću se vratiti večeras
With me.	Sa mnom.
I don't want them now	Ne želim ih sada
And this is something.	I ovo je nešto.
I don't want to think about anything.	Ne želim ni o čemu da mislim.
They said many things.	Rekli su mnogo stvari.
You lost me because of that.	Izgubio si me zbog toga.
Check this out.	Vidi ovo.
I want it for myself	Želim je za sebe
He wouldn't be there long.	Ne bi dugo bio tamo.
When it's good.	Kad je dobro.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ne znam šta mu se dogodilo.
So are we.	I mi smo.
Any.	Bilo koji.
Or maybe a guy friend.	Ili možda momak prijatelj.
He said people would be there for a while.	Rekao je da će ljudi biti tamo za neko vrijeme.
I'm so tired today.	Danas sam tako umoran.
It was something he wasn't ready for.	To je bilo nešto za šta nije bio spreman.
I was glad he was coming with me	Bilo mi je drago što ide sa mnom
But this took time.	Ali za ovo je trebalo vremena.
That's all I want to see	Samo to želim vidjeti
It was me, just me.	Bio sam to ja, samo ja.
To.	Da bi.
It really could have been any of us	To je zaista mogao biti bilo ko od nas
I'm going to see what we can do	Idem da vidim šta možemo da uradimo
I had no idea he was coming	Nisam imao pojma da će doći
True, it is not so.	Istina, nije tako.
Enough for now.	Za sada dosta.
But I've seen a lot of him today	Ali danas sam ga dosta vidio
I went with him to	Otišao sam s njim u
He had never seen them before.	Nikad ih prije nije vidio.
But not really.	Ali ne baš.
I want you all for myself	Želim vas sve za sebe
I wish she hadn't just said that	Voleo bih da to nije samo rekla
I would do that	Ja bih to uradio
Much things.	Mnogo stvari.
And now it works.	I sada radi.
That wouldn't be money.	To ne bi bio novac.
Yes, that's right.	Da, tako je.
No one ever asked.	Niko nikada nije pitao.
All right, she said.	U redu, rekla je.
And you wouldn't want that.	A ti to ne bi htela.
I had it with him	Imao sam to sa njim
That is a good job.	To je dobar posao.
I hope someone will help me.	Nadam se da će mi neko pomoći.
I have to ask to be sure	Moram da pitam da budem siguran
It's about doing it.	Radi se o tome da se to uradi.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nisam uradio ništa loše.
I had a really bad day yesterday	Jučer sam imao zaista loš dan
I'll tell you what she said.	Reći ću ti šta je rekla.
He is still my father.	On je još uvek moj otac.
It really happened at home.	To se stvarno dogodilo kod kuće.
I asked him what he was doing and if he needed help.	Pitao sam ga šta radi i treba li mu pomoć.
And I would really love to be your friend	I ja bih zaista volio biti tvoj prijatelj
I just need a little help	Samo mi treba malo pomoći
I won't buy them from you	Neću ih kupiti od tebe
I didn't leave right away.	Nisam odmah otišao.
I expected not to be able to help everyone	Očekivao sam da neću moći pomoći svima
I know for sure who you are	Ja sigurno znam ko si ti
You know.	Ti znaš.
We have that one.	Imamo taj.
We never do that.	Mi to nikada ne radimo.
How good is that?	Koliko je to dobro?
I didn't know anything myself	Ni sam nisam znao ništa
I guess so.	Pretpostavljam da je tako.
No money.	Nema novca.
And he never lost this.	I ovo nikada nije izgubio.
I have to go earlier today	Moram da idem ranije danas
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam uradio ništa loše
I thought you'd be here tonight	Mislio sam da ćeš biti tu večeras
I told him I was leaving tomorrow	Rekao sam mu da idem sutra
She's never here.	Ona nikad nije ovdje.
I thought you wanted to be more than that	Mislio sam da želiš biti više od toga
He was three years old.	Taj je imao tri godine.
I should never have done that	Nikad to nisam trebao učiniti
I think you brought me back to life.	Mislim da si me vratio u život.
That's not even a problem.	To čak i nije problem.
I wonder why he does that	Pitam se zašto to radi
Have fun while you can.	Zabavi se dok možeš.
Probably from this morning.	Vjerovatno od jutros.
That actually happened to us.	To nam se zapravo dogodilo.
It was there.	Bilo je tamo.
But he knows that too.	Ali i on to zna.
I made it myself.	Sam sam ga napravio.
Tell him you think that would be a good idea.	Reci mu da misliš da bi to bila dobra ideja.
But that doesn't happen either.	Ali ni to se ne dešava.
One day at a time.	Dan po dan.
If not, nothing.	Ako nije, ništa nije.
And you know there are.	I znate i ima ih.
I wish it were true, but.	Voleo bih da je istina, ali.
I have nothing to tell you, nothing, and there isn't.	Nemam šta da ti kažem, ništa, a ni nema.
I couldn't see anything anymore	Nisam više ništa mogao da vidim
I could never do that	Nikada to nisam mogao učiniti
Just tell him you're doing it.	Samo mu reci da to radiš.
We've only done three.	Mi smo ikada uradili samo tri.
Or both.	Ili oboje.
People know who you are.	Ljudi znaju ko ste.
Nobody did.	Niko nije.
I would not like to say	Ne bih voleo da kažem
To.	Da bi.
He knew what we were going to find here.	Znao je šta ćemo naći ovdje.
I have to do it my way.	Moram to učiniti na svoj način.
I couldn't do this without you	Ne bih mogao ovo bez tebe
I hope you do more.	Nadam se da ćeš učiniti više.
You know that, you know that.	Znaš to, znaš to.
I think this is really true.	Mislim da je ovo zaista tačno.
Yes, that's right.	Da, tako.
There you are.	Tu ste.
I can't do it again	Ne mogu to ponovo
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to učiniti.
We need a lot more and we need it now.	Treba nam mnogo više i treba nam to sada.
But he was not there.	Ali, nije ga bilo.
This will be easy for you.	Ovo će vam biti lako.
I was supposed to see her this morning	Trebao sam da je vidim jutros
That's the story.	To je priča.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
As if we didn't know that.	Kao da to nismo znali.
That's what they said.	To su oni rekli.
I could see everything again	Mogao sam da vidim sve ponovo
And your money.	I tvoj novac.
I can't believe this is happening again	Ne mogu vjerovati da se ovo ponovo dešava
There were real people here.	Ovde su bili pravi ljudi.
I'm not sure how he ended up there	Nisam siguran kako je tamo završio
I like to work alone	Volim da radim sam
But that was not the only reason.	Ali to nije bio jedini razlog.
I lost my team.	Izgubio sam svoj tim.
And he's probably right.	I vjerovatno je u pravu.
They did that for me too.	To su uradili i za mene.
Do that.	Uradi to.
There was no question of whether that would happen.	Nije bilo pitanje da li će se to dogoditi.
I never saw him again.	Nikad ga više nisam video.
He certainly shouldn't have told anyone now.	Sada sigurno nikome nije trebao reći.
He says nothing.	On ništa ne govori.
You really shouldn't talk to him like that.	Zaista ne bi trebao tako razgovarati s njim.
Not bad.	Nije loše.
If not, fine.	Ako nije, u redu.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
He told me about it.	Rekao mi je o tome.
I knew what to say.	Znao sam šta da kažem.
I don't know why not.	Ne znam zašto ne.
Only one.	Samo jedan.
I would do anything, he said.	Sve bih uradio, rekao je.
I mean, that's obvious	Mislim, to je očigledno
I realized.	Shvatio sam.
Maybe you can.	Možda možeš.
You have to do this.	Ovo morate uraditi.
I can't find him	Ne mogu ga naći
I know this carries you	Znam da te ovo nosi
He said he would.	Rekao je da hoće.
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam uradio ništa loše
is.	je.
I didn't need any of that	Nije mi trebalo ništa od toga
She is doing much better.	Ona ide mnogo bolje.
I never saw or heard	Nikada nisam ni vidio ni čuo
This was a problem.	Ovo je bio problem.
I never wanted to do that.	Nikad to nisam želeo da uradim.
That is very, very unlikely.	To je vrlo, vrlo malo vjerovatno.
I think he did it.	Mislim da je to radio.
I didn't even hear him talk	Nisam ga ni čuo da priča
I can’t say good enough about it.	Ne mogu reći dovoljno dobro o tome.
I haven't seen you here before	Nisam te prije vidio ovdje
And now he would expect to know everything.	A sada bi očekivao da zna sve.
I should have stayed on it.	Trebao sam ostati na tome.
He did nothing wrong.	Nije uradio ništa loše.
He could tell when he had done too much.	Mogao je reći kada je učinio previše.
I didn't see who it was	Nisam vidio ko je to bio
I prefer better, but this is not so bad	Više volim bolje, ali ovo nije tako loše
I'm sorry this happened.	Žao mi je što se to dogodilo.
And so he said nothing.	I tako nije rekao ništa.
Maybe I'll see you before that.	Možda te vidim prije toga.
But she's really not well.	Ali ona zaista nije dobro.
I really, really love them.	Zaista, stvarno ih volim.
I couldn't	Ne bih mogao
There are so many.	Toliko toga ima.
Not only that.	Ne samo.
It's been like that for a while, actually.	Tako je već neko vrijeme zapravo.
And they knew.	I znali su.
But this man told us we couldn't leave.	Ali ovaj čovjek nam je rekao da ne možemo otići.
He said the following.	Rekao je sljedeće.
I wonder what he wants this time.	Pitam se šta želi ovaj put.
I'm happy for you	Drago mi je zbog tebe
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
But we are not there yet.	Ali još nismo tamo.
I can be anything you want me to be	Mogu biti sve što želiš da budem
That is simply not true.	To jednostavno nije istina.
I want you to like it here	Želim da ti se sviđa ovdje
And fast.	I to brzo.
But this in itself is not good.	Ali ovo samo po sebi nije dobro.
I have no idea why they would do that	Nemam pojma zašto bi to uradili
I wish there was time for everything to be fine	Voleo bih da je bilo vremena da sve bude u redu
I didn't know what was going on.	Nisam znao šta se dešava.
I never wanted to be a father	Nikada nisam želeo da budem otac
And that's not even the reason.	A to čak nije ni razlog.
I knew he could and would do it	Znao sam da može i da će to učiniti
I didn't get it right	Nisam dobro shvatio
I knew what needed to be done.	Znao sam šta je trebalo učiniti.
I don't know why you thought that.	Ne znam zašto si tako mislio.
I had to do this alone	Morao sam ovo da uradim sam
You know that.	Znaš to.
What is not, is not.	Što nije, nije.
I don't know about that.	Ne znam za to.
I said you can't.	Rekao sam da ne možeš.
I always wanted to know	Uvek sam želeo da znam
I haven't asked her yet, but	Nisam je još pitao, ali
The truth was that no one did.	Istina je bila da niko nije.
It was easy to work with him.	Bilo je lako raditi s njim.
That could be it.	To bi moglo biti i to.
And someone will do just that.	I neko će upravo to učiniti.
I just need some time	Samo mi treba malo vremena
I will never be them	Nikada neću biti oni
Without it, it just worked.	Bez toga, to je samo radio.
I'm back.	Vratio sam se.
I gave you a lot of time	Dao sam ti dosta vremena
I needed them.	Trebali su mi.
I had nothing to do.	Nisam imao šta da radim.
This is too simple.	Ovo je previše jednostavno.
It can be done, and it can be done pretty well.	To se može uraditi, i može se uraditi prilično dobro.
I ask him how he feels about it.	Pitam ga kako se osjeća zbog toga.
It wasn't me.	To nisam bio ja.
He is one of us now.	On je sada jedan od nas.
I decided	Odlučio sam
But why did it happen.	Ali zašto se to dogodilo.
I wouldn't do that.	Ne bih to uradio.
I've been here before	Bio sam ovdje prije
Now I really have to go	Sada zaista moram da idem
And the reason for that is that.	A razlog za to je to.
And everyone knows it.	I svi to znaju.
Everything happens.	Sve se dešava.
I am a.	Ja sam a.
I didn't know you heard that	Nisam znao da si to čuo
Now we know this.	Sada znamo ovo.
You were very, very happy about that.	Bio si veoma, veoma sretan zbog toga.
So much help is needed.	Toliko treba pomoć.
I doubt he'll be back	Sumnjam da će se vratiti
And that should be it.	I to bi trebalo biti to.
That's bad enough.	To je dovoljno loše.
I couldn't say how many there were	Nisam mogao reći koliko ih je bilo
But we knew we had to.	Ali, znali smo da moramo.
He told me so.	On mi je tako rekao.
Until this morning.	Do jutros.
No you're not.	Ne, nisi.
But that doesn't happen.	Ali to se ne dešava.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
He doesn't plan.	On ne planira.
It's a good life.	To je dobar život.
I can't believe what's going on	Ne mogu vjerovati šta se dešava
She knew she would come.	Znala je da će doći.
I've never seen that before	Nikad to prije nisam vidio
I need to see him.	Moram da ga vidim.
I didn't give it to him	Nisam ga dao
I may have to see her	Možda ću morati da je vidim
I'm afraid not much	Bojim se da nije mnogo
All because of me.	Sve zbog mene.
It used to be.	Nekada je bilo.
I thought she was right	Mislio sam da je bila u pravu
She said maybe you should both.	Rekla je da biste možda oboje trebali.
I shouldn't have	Nisam trebao
That was never a problem.	To nikada nije bio problem.
From the sea.	Od mora.
I'm glad it's you.	Drago mi je da si to ti.
I didn't know it happened	Nisam znao da se to dogodilo
And what do you think?	A šta ti misliš?
So far so good.	Do sada ide dobro.
I have no idea how to proceed	Nemam pojma kako dalje
He went for dinner.	Otišao je po večeru.
I could do this.	Mogao bih ovo da uradim.
The reason is that he has done it before.	Razlog je to što je to radio ranije.
I just had a question	Samo sam imao pitanje
But that's the problem.	Ali to je problem.
He didn't leave because of me.	Nije otišao zbog mene.
I love both, but what do you like?	Oboje volim, ali šta ti se sviđa?
I decided not to tell anyone	Odlučio sam da nikome ne kažem
I haven't seen her in a while.	Nisam je vidio neko vrijeme.
It will never be again.	Nikada više neće biti.
No, it's more than that.	Ne, to je više od toga.
I knew it right away	Znao sam to odmah
I often thought of you	Često sam mislio na tebe
It's one on one.	To je jedan na jedan.
We just can't.	Jednostavno ne možemo.
If not, fine.	Ako ne, u redu.
This is what he wanted.	Ovo je želeo.
I should go back.	Trebao bih se vratiti.
She won't work.	Ona neće raditi.
I won't have to.	Neću morati.
I need to talk to him	Moram razgovarati s njim
Like me.	Kao ja.
It was fast.	Bilo je brzo.
I want him to love me	Želim da me voli
Besides you.	Osim tebe.
Everyone will know.	Svi će znati.
Like, we had a lot of friends.	Kao, imali smo dosta prijatelja.
I was like them	Bio sam kao oni
I doubt he'll ever come back	Sumnjam da će se ikada vratiti
We don't do that.	Mi to ne radimo.
That's him.	To je on.
That's what he wants to do.	To je ono što on želi da uradi.
I'm still here.	Ja sam još uvijek ovdje.
Maybe she said something.	Možda je nešto rekla.
I like how it feels	Sviđa mi se kako se to osjeća
I should have helped you before	Trebao sam ti pomoći prije
It's like you.	To je kao ti.
But that would be difficult.	Ali to bi bilo teško.
I guess that was my problem	Pretpostavljam da je tu bio moj problem
This can be good or bad.	Ovo može biti dobro ili loše.
And it's not easy.	I nije lako.
Everything he loved.	Sve što je voleo.
You didn't do anything.	Nisi ništa uradio.
I almost didn't	Skoro da nisam
It was good to be home.	Bilo je dobro biti kod kuće.
They are now from me.	Oni su sada od mene.
He left.	Otišao je.
I didn't have to say too much	Nisam morao da kažem previše
I couldn't reach you	Nisam mogao doći do tebe
As the father should.	Kao što otac treba.
This is because of me.	Ovo je zbog mene.
I still think that's true.	I dalje mislim da je to istina.
What did he mean?	Šta je mislio.
It may never be.	Možda nikada neće biti.
It can do that.	To može učiniti.
Maybe he wasn't as alone as he thought.	Možda nije bio tako sam kao što je mislio.
Man.	Čovjek.
I'll find him if he is	Naći ću ga ako jeste
She was very.	Bila je veoma.
He hasn't been here for a long time.	Nije bio ovdje dugo vremena.
I didn't ask for them.	Nisam ih tražio.
But there is more to it than that.	Ali ima i više od toga.
It is here and now.	To je ovdje i sada.
I didn't know you didn't want that	Nisam znala da to ne želiš
No, you can't do that.	Ne, ne možete to učiniti.
I didn't want to be alone	Nisam htela da budem sama
Can you tell me how to do it.	Možete li mi reći kako da to uradim.
Will probably be back for more.	Vjerovatno će se vratiti po još.
Which could be true.	Što je moglo biti istina.
I'm not sure if that's true.	Nisam siguran da li je to tačno.
This one is better.	Ovaj je bolji.
It's not easy.	Nije lako.
I would be happy if that were the case	Bio bih sretan da je tako
And that was true.	I to je bila istina.
You never got there without it.	Bez toga nikad nisi stigao tamo.
And when that day comes.	I kada dođe taj dan.
I'm just telling it like it is.	Samo kažem kako jeste.
I saw her this afternoon	Video sam je danas popodne
I think he probably will, actually.	Mislim da verovatno hoće, zapravo.
You don't know this.	Ti ne znaš ovo.
I was really happy to get home	Bio sam zaista sretan što sam stigao kući
I knew it was much more than that	Znala sam da je mnogo više od toga
I told him he had to help me.	Rekao sam mu da mi mora pomoći.
You know that well.	Ti to dobro znaš.
I wonder what's going on	Pitam se šta se dešava
My father told me to do it.	Otac mi je rekao da to uradim.
He never did.	Nikad nije.
I won't be able to see her enough	Neću moći da je vidim dovoljno
I just didn't know what the reason was	Samo nisam znao koji je to razlog
I told you.	Rekao sam ti.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žao.
I have to get you again	Moram ponovo po tebe
We don't know that much.	Toliko toga ne znamo.
It was really good.	Bilo je stvarno dobro.
I hope you can help me	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći
Who does that.	Ko to radi.
That's what you're for.	Za to si.
I wasn't sure what to do with it	Nisam bio siguran šta da radim s tim
I don't think that's happening.	Mislim da se to ne dešava.
I wish he was here now	Voleo bih da je sada ovde
What did you tell me?	Što si mi rekao.
I knew what they were	Znao sam šta su
I know what's going on here.	Znam šta se ovde dešava.
I knew he would be there	Znao sam da će biti tamo
I think he wants to leave.	Mislim da želi da ode.
You're with me, so no problem.	Ti si sa mnom, tako da nema problema.
I couldn't do something like that	Nisam mogao da uradim tako nešto
I see what you mean.	Vidim na šta misliš.
Yes, it's true.	Da, to je istina.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
He saw me tonight too.	I večeras me je video.
Isn't that right?	Nije li tako.
I didn't hear him.	Nisam ga čuo.
I know about him.	Znam za njega.
It was so hard for him.	Bilo mu je tako teško.
They are there.	Oni su tamo.
It was good and bad weather.	Bilo je to dobro i loše vrijeme.
But this one could.	Ali ovaj bi mogao.
I couldn't do that	Nisam mogao to da uradim
I know you know what's going on	Znam da znaš šta se dešava
He would be home.	Bio bi kod kuće.
Maybe he wasn't even sure.	Možda čak nije ni bio siguran.
It would be so easy.	Bilo bi tako lako.
I wish he wasn't there	Voleo sam da nije tamo
I don't see anyone.	Ne vidim nikoga.
I just didn't need it	Jednostavno mi nije trebao
He seems to have figured it out.	Čini se da je to shvatio.
I didn't think it would come so soon	Nisam mislio da će doći tako brzo
I have to tell you now.	Moram ti sada reći.
It's still there.	Još je tu.
I need a job.	Treba mi posao.
Maybe it's good.	Možda je dobro.
It's something you do well.	To je nešto što dobro radiš.
You are a person like me.	Ti si osoba kao i ja.
We have to find her.	Moramo je naći.
It seemed like one.	Činilo se kao jedan.
It's not the code itself.	To nije sam kod.
You can't really do them.	Ne možete ih stvarno raditi.
There is some of that.	Nešto od toga ima.
I thought he came and went.	Mislio sam da je došao i otišao.
We were there for a while.	Bili smo tamo neko vrijeme.
Maybe even more.	Možda čak i nešto više.
He is as good as he said.	On je dobar koliko je rekao.
Maybe that was it.	Možda je to bilo to.
I was one until a few years ago	Bio sam jedan do prije nekoliko godina
I'm just going for that day.	Upravo idem za taj dan.
I thought you were sure	Mislio sam da si siguran
I am very happy about that.	Veoma sam sretan zbog toga.
Obviously, we know everything.	Očigledno, znamo sve.
I don't have a job.	Ja nemam posao.
I did this to him	Uradio sam mu ovo
I'm not sure if this is the right path.	Nisam siguran da li je ovo pravi put.
I knew exactly what was going to happen	Tačno sam znao šta će se dogoditi
That's what he did.	To je on uradio.
He went there.	Otišao je tamo.
Tomorrow may never come.	Sutra možda nikada neće doći.
I really wish he was here now	Zaista bih volio da je sada ovdje
I can give you a job	Mogu ti dati posao
Very good question	Vrlo dobro pitanje
I would lose my job and see the problem.	Izgubio bih posao i vidio bi problem.
I didn't have much money.	Nisam imao puno novca.
Maybe not in a bad way.	Možda ne na loš način.
I have to see them.	Moram da ih vidim.
I was already busy	Već sam bio zauzet
I love you too.	Volim i ja tebe.
It wouldn't be the only thing.	Ne bi bila jedina stvar.
Something was wrong here.	Nešto ovdje nije bilo u redu.
I arrived on time.	Stigao sam na vrijeme.
We both work.	Oboje radimo.
I still wouldn't.	I dalje ne bih.
Just not us.	Samo ne mi.
', and is'.	', i je '.
It's a game.	To je igra.
I didn't mean to do this to you	Nisam htela da ti uradim ovo
I am everything.	Sve sam.
I know what needs to be done	Znam šta se mora uraditi
I know exactly what you mean	Znam tačno na šta misliš
I just thought I'd ask	Samo sam mislio da pitam
What you must have been.	Šta si morao biti.
He meant what he said.	Mislio je ono što je rekao.
I really wish that were the case	Zaista bih volio da je tako
It's only for a while.	To je samo na neko vrijeme.
I need to see him.	Moram da ga vidim.
I would very much like that.	To bih jako volio.
I didn't really want to be alone	Nisam baš htela da budem sama
I need to be with him now.	Moram da budem sa njim odmah.
I really like it here	Stvarno mi se sviđa ovdje
Very good, very good.	Vrlo dobro, veoma.
I have for some time	Imam već neko vrijeme
I know you didn't.	Znam da nisi.
But no, this is better.	Ali ne, ovo je bolje.
But it was no more.	Ali više nije bilo.
I don't see why not.	Ne vidim zašto ne.
We could do more.	Mogli bismo više.
Maybe I could help you with that	Možda bih ti mogao pomoći u tome
You could go anywhere.	Mogao si ići bilo gdje.
I really didn't want to be here anymore	Zaista nisam više želio biti ovdje
Until next week !.	Do sljedeće sedmice!.
I just didn't know what to do with it	Jednostavno nisam znao šta da radim s tim
Probably not true either.	Vjerovatno nije ni istina.
He just doesn't know it yet.	On to samo još ne zna.
I have no idea who they are	Nemam pojma ko su oni
He was really happy about it.	Bio je zaista sretan zbog toga.
I've already told him almost everything	Već sam mu rekao skoro sve
And that was it.	I to je bilo to.
I wasn't ready for you.	Nisam bio spreman za tebe.
I'll.	Ja ću.
I know I do	Znam da mi je tako
I didn't just see it	Nisam to samo vidio
He doesn't do any of that.	Ne radi ništa od toga.
I knew exactly what it was	Tačno sam znao šta je to
I'm not surprised.	Nisam iznenađen.
They haven't been in a while.	Nisu već neko vrijeme.
I can not believe	Ne mogu vjerovati
Everything is fine now.	Sada je sve dobro.
It only took a few times.	Trebalo je samo nekoliko puta.
It wouldn't be that simple.	Ne bi bilo tako jednostavno.
I didn't want to	Nisam htela
I won't do that to him	Neću mu to učiniti
I have to do this alone	Moram ovo da uradim sam
I just didn't have the time.	Jednostavno nisam imao vremena.
There was much more.	Bilo je još mnogo toga.
Who knows what he meant.	Ko zna šta je mislio.
But it's not true.	Ali nije istina.
I should have known.	Trebao sam znati.
I'm telling you now.	Kažem ti odmah.
I could immediately tell that something was wrong	Odmah sam mogao reći da nešto nije u redu
That was for me.	To je bilo za mene.
I guess that's obvious	Pretpostavljam da je to očigledno
I told you that earlier.	Rekao sam ti to ranije.
It's not a game anymore.	To više nije igra.
I don't know where he is.	Ne znam gdje je.
Really do not know.	Stvarno ne znam.
I was there many years ago	Bio sam tamo prije mnogo godina
You thought.	Mislio si.
That was next.	To je bilo sljedeće.
It was all a little for him.	Sve je to bilo malo za njega.
And he knows that's exactly what he expected.	I on zna da je to upravo ono što je očekivao.
This isn't just me.	Ovo nisam samo ja.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I never even saw him	Nikad ga nisam ni video
That was for sure.	To je bilo sigurno.
Exactly what he needed.	Upravo ono što mu je trebalo.
I didn't have to say anything	Nisam trebao ništa reći
I can't go home without him	Ne mogu se vratiti kući bez njega
I said I should buy one	Rekao sam da bi trebao kupiti jedan
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
I wasn't there.	Nisam bio tamo.
Maybe you're right.	Možda si u pravu.
I still have a hard time with that	Još uvijek mi je teško s tim
I think I'll be sure of that.	Mislim da to budem siguran.
But only a little.	Ali samo malo.
I really like the way it looks	Zaista mi se sviđa kako izgleda
I knew what you were doing	Znao sam šta radiš
I can do something for you	Mogu učiniti nešto za tebe
Was he.	Da li je bio.
But he was sure he was right.	Ali bio je siguran da je u pravu.
I want to ask them all	Želim da ih pitam sve
I haven't heard anything yet.	Još nisam ništa čuo.
Not as far as I know.	Ne koliko ja znam.
I couldn't help it.	Nisam mogao pomoći.
There is only one problem.	Postoji samo jedan problem.
It's you.	To si ti.
I haven't heard that in a long time	Nisam to čuo tako dugo
I confessed everything	Sve sam priznao
Maybe this will help.	Možda će ovo pomoći.
I wouldn't lose this	Ne bih ovo izgubio
I didn't see him leave.	Nisam ga video da je otišao.
If it is real, something needs to be done and done quickly.	Ako je stvarno, nešto treba učiniti i uraditi brzo.
I've heard of it before	Čuo sam za to ranije
I wish you were here	Voleo bih da si bio ovde
I'm fine without it.	Dobro sam i bez toga.
I almost told you too much	Skoro sam ti rekao previše
I have a lot.	Imam mnogo.
And now is not the time.	A trenutno nije vrijeme.
I hope he's there	Nadam se da je tu
I should have returned it, but I didn't.	Trebao sam ga vratiti, ali nisam.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
I pray you didn't	Molim se da nisi
Money is not a problem.	Novac nije problem.
I didn't know you were coming so fast	Nisam znala da ćeš doći tako brzo
I wish we had.	Voleo bih da imamo.
I can say those things	Mogu reći te stvari
When will you be home.	Kada ćeš biti kući.
I work better alone.	Bolje radim sam.
Like them.	Kao i oni.
I didn't even know what to say	Nisam ni znao šta da kažem
We never said that.	Nikad to nismo rekli.
I just wish I was a little alone there	Samo želim malo sam tamo
Let's do this.	Uradimo ovo.
I wouldn't.	Ne bi.
And there's the game.	I tu je igra.
It's good that we all know what he looks like.	Dobro je da svi znamo kako on izgleda.
Maybe he was right.	Možda je bio u pravu.
And myself.	I sebe.
I told you to do something.	Rekao sam ti da uradiš nešto.
I decided to work	Odlučio sam da radim
It was good to say that.	Bilo je dobro reći to.
This is not right.	Ovo nije u redu.
They shouldn't do that.	Oni to ne bi trebali raditi.
I would know.	Znao bih.
I wonder what this thing is about	Pitam se za šta je tu stvar
I've never done anything like him	Nikad nisam uradio ništa kao on
You're not well.	Nisi dobro.
She didn't even know who his father was.	Nije ni znala ko mu je otac.
Nothing happened, which was good.	Ništa se nije dogodilo, što je bilo dobro.
I wondered if it would always be	Pitao sam se da li će uvek biti
Life is good now.	Život je sada dobar.
It is very difficult.	Veoma je teško.
I didn't expect that either	Ni ja to nisam očekivao
I have to make it look hard	Moram učiniti da izgleda teško
Tell me what you think about it.	Reci mi šta misliš o tome.
I should have worked.	Trebao sam raditi.
I didn't see anything wrong with that	Nisam vidio ništa loše u tome
He tells himself.	Kaže on sebi.
I got them last week	Dobio sam ih prošle sedmice
I hope you're right	Nadam se da si u pravu
I would know about that.	Ja bih znao za to.
Not like him.	Ne kao on.
But she said nothing.	Ali nije rekla ništa.
We have to do something right.	Mora da radimo nešto kako treba.
Life was too busy for that.	Život je bio previše zauzet za to.
It wasn't enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno.
I've seen this too many times.	Video sam ovo previše puta.
Someone who has something to say.	Neko ko ima nešto da kaže.
That could not have happened.	To se nije moglo dogoditi.
I pray he never will	Molim se da nikada neće
I don’t work that way.	Ja ne radim na taj način.
She knew what it was.	Znala je šta je to.
Can you.	Možeš li.
It will be soon.	Uskoro će.
I was almost certain it was	Bio sam skoro siguran da jeste
You want both.	Želiš oboje.
I had a lot of friends	Imao sam puno prijatelja
And it's not.	I nije.
And he didn't want that.	A on to nije želio.
I guess you have to believe.	Pretpostavljam da morate vjerovati.
I mean, he didn't leave	Mislim, nije otišao
Just like them.	Baš kao i oni.
It doesn't work well.	Ne radi dobro.
But she knew.	Ali znala je.
I didn't expect much	Nisam očekivao mnogo
You were good there.	Bio si dobar tamo.
You will see this very soon.	To ćete vidjeti vrlo brzo.
I couldn't go to school	Nisam mogao ići u školu
I promised not to go to him	Obećao sam da neće ići kod njega
Something that needs to be done.	Nešto što se mora uraditi.
I couldn't help but know why	Nisam mogao da ne znam zašto
She wanted to say no.	Htela je da kaže ne.
And not in a good way.	I to ne na dobar način.
I have no idea what happened to him	Nemam pojma šta mu se dogodilo
I've never heard of him	Nikad nisam čuo za njega
I think we have it.	Mislim da ga imamo.
Nothing to do.	Ništa za raditi.
And further.	I dalje.
she thinks.	ona misli.
I'll find the time.	Naći ću vremena.
Besides, you don't do it for money.	Osim toga, to ne radite zbog novca.
But I was first.	Ali ja sam bio prvi.
He decided to stay here.	Odlučio je ostati ovdje.
Home from home.	Kući od kuće.
He can do more.	On može više.
Or it is either way.	Ili je to bilo koji način.
Even so, you never know.	Čak i tako, nikad se ne zna.
While you're there.	Dok ste tamo.
I've been wanting to tell you this for a while.	Već neko vrijeme želim to da vam kažem.
But for me, that's not my problem.	Ali za mene to nije moj problem.
Maybe that's true.	Možda je to istina.
I didn't realize it right away.	Nisam to odmah shvatio.
I think people knew	Mislim da su ljudi znali
He was better than that.	Bio je bolji od toga.
I asked what was true.	Pitao sam šta je istina.
I wasn't sure.	Nisam bio baš siguran.
How it all happens.	Kako se sve to dešava.
I don't want that for anyone	Ne želim to nikome
I want everything you have given me so far and more	Želim sve što si mi do sada dao i više
Friend's money.	Novac prijatelja.
As a person.	Kao osoba.
I think this is another one for me	Mislim da je ovo još jedan prvi za mene
It is neither good nor bad.	Nije ni dobro ni loše.
I should probably go	Verovatno bi trebalo da idem
I guess you have to go	Pretpostavljam da moraš ići
Something will happen.	Nešto će se dogoditi.
It had to be him.	Morao je biti on.
Probably good.	Verovatno je dobro.
Besides, he had nothing to say.	Osim toga, nije imao šta da kaže.
It was never okay.	Nikad nije bilo u redu.
I just had a question.	Samo sam imao pitanje.
I didn't hear anything.	Nisam ništa čuo.
Nothing will happen to you here.	Ovdje ti se ništa neće dogoditi.
I should come soon and see him	Trebao bih uskoro doći i vidjeti ga
I don't know what will happen this year.	Ne znam šta će biti ove godine.
I knew it and she knew it.	Znao sam i ona je to znala.
Now I do a job I love	Sada radim posao koji volim
You're right.	U pravu si.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
We won't talk about it.	Nećemo o tome.
He knows he said too much.	Zna da je rekao previše.
I'll give it to you	Ja ću vam dati
And if there are, do it.	I ako ih ima, uradi to.
I need to know what's going on	Moram da znam šta se dešava
They're fine.	Oni su u redu.
I think it's working better now.	Mislim da sada radi bolje.
I know you can do better	Znam da možeš bolje
I wanted to be him for the first time	Želeo sam da prvi put budem on
I haven't done that in a while.	Nisam to već neko vrijeme.
I have no idea why he's here	Nemam pojma zašto je ovdje
I should have told you last night	Trebao sam ti reći i sinoć
I had to know if	Morao sam da znam da li
She tells him he should probably go home	Ona mu kaže da bi vjerovatno trebao otići kući
They didn't know it.	Oni to nisu znali.
I still couldn't see anything	Još uvijek nisam mogao ništa vidjeti
Now he can't say you haven't tried.	Sada ne može reći da nisi pokušao.
Like everyone.	Kao i svi.
Not so little, actually.	Ne tako malo, zapravo.
Or maybe it is.	Ili možda jeste.
It always has been, and always will be.	Uvek je bilo, i uvek će biti.
We were supposed to win tonight.	Trebali smo pobijediti večeras.
It's nothing, she said.	To nije ništa, rekla je.
I'm glad you're back	Drago mi je da si se vratio
I'm just not good.	Ja sam sve samo ne dobro.
This looks pretty bad.	Ovo izgleda prilično loše.
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam uradio ništa loše
In fact, he didn't know it himself.	Zapravo, ni sam to nije znao.
But that is not enough.	Ali to nije dovoljno.
I don't know if that's a problem.	Ne znam da li je to problem.
I should have been the one.	Ja sam trebao biti taj.
And she was.	I bila je.
I can do it, she told herself	Ja to mogu, rekla je sebi
You didn't tell him that before, and now you're telling him.	Nisi mu to ranije rekao, a sada mu to kažeš.
She knew it had to be that way.	Znala je da mora biti tako.
But it was necessary.	Ali trebalo je.
Nobody ever had to say that.	Niko to nikada nije morao da kaže.
I say this.	Ja kažem ovo.
I know.	Znam.
I didn't mean it that way	Nisam baš tako mislio
Please tell me it's okay to do this.	Molim te reci da je u redu da ovo uradim.
Maybe that would be enough.	Možda bi to bilo dovoljno.
A lot has happened.	Mnogo toga se dogodilo.
It's just like.	To je samo kao.
I often had everything to myself	Često sam imao sve samo za sebe
I just thought he wouldn't know	Samo sam mislio da neće znati
And so it should be from now on.	I tako bi trebalo da bude od sada.
That was all he said.	To je bilo sve što je rekao.
I know what he's doing	Znam šta radi
I knew you meant well	Znao sam da si dobro mislio
I haven't seen anything like that in many, many years	Tako nešto nisam vidio mnogo, mnogo godina
I wondered who did it	Pitao sam se ko je to uradio
It makes you look bad.	Čini da izgledaš loše.
I mean, certainly not	Mislim, sigurno ne
You don't know how to do it right.	Ne znaš kako da to uradiš kako treba.
That's how it was supposed to be.	Tako je trebalo da bude.
He was looking for him.	On je tražio njega.
She has it.	Ona ga ima.
I couldn't believe what he did	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta je uradio
It was very good.	Bilo je jako dobro.
I don't know why, but that's how it was.	Ne znam zašto, ali tako je bilo.
Maybe I'll come home soon	Možda ću uskoro doći kući
I should be the one.	Ja bih trebao biti taj.
I really don’t see how that could have happened.	Zaista ne vidim kako se to moglo dogoditi.
That's how it will be.	Tako će to biti.
I wish I had seen her	Voleo bih da sam je video
I had no idea why that was	Nisam imao pojma zašto je to tako
I wasn't completely sure yet.	Nisam još bio potpuno siguran.
You can't do that.	Ne možeš to učiniti.
He was glad for that.	Bilo mu je drago zbog toga.
I see you have a problem.	Vidim da imaš problem.
I had no idea if he heard me	Nisam imao pojma da li me je čuo
I think he's there now	Mislim da je sada tamo
Something happened to him.	Nešto mu se dogodilo.
That will be quite difficult.	To će biti prilično teško.
You're like him.	Ti si kao on.
I know you know this.	Znam da znaš ovo.
I mean, it was there.	Mislim, bilo je tamo.
I don't think you're right	Mislim da nisi u pravu
Nobody saw it.	Niko to nije video.
Everything happens so fast.	Sve se dešava tako brzo.
I've never done that before.	Nikada to ranije nisam radio.
Maybe he didn't even know about it.	Možda nije ni znao za to.
He wants to stay for a few days.	Nekoliko dana želi ostati.
I just can't be with you again	Jednostavno ne mogu ponovo biti s tobom
I would tell you that	Rekao bih mi to
I was glad for him and I told him	Bilo mi je drago zbog njega i rekao sam mu
It's easy to do.	Lako je to učiniti.
I didn't know what to tell him	Nisam znao šta da mu kažem
I thought he would be here	Mislio sam da će biti ovdje
I didn't know he was there	Nisam znao da je tamo
There's nothing I can do for you today	Ne mogu ništa učiniti za tebe danas
I did it	Ja sam to radio
Maybe I should start working on it	Možda bih počeo da radim na tome
I think your way is better	Mislim da je tvoj način bolji
I am really surprised that he is still with me	Zaista sam iznenađen da je još uvijek sa mnom
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
I have nothing for you.	Nemam ništa za tebe.
Maybe there were more.	Možda ih je bilo više.
He says he's home.	Kaže da je kod kuće.
I love being with him	Volim biti s njim
A friend of a friend	Prijatelj prijatelja
We are so glad you are here.	Tako nam je drago što ste ovdje.
I would never expect this	Ovo nikada ne bih očekivao
I loved everything but myself	Voleo sam sve osim sebe
I decided it wasn't them	Odlučio sam da to nisu oni
Something about that.	Nešto o tome.
I brought you back to life for a few days	Vratio sam te u život na nekoliko dana
I didn't think so	Nisam tako mislio
It must be so.	To mora biti tako.
I wasn’t there and no one told me much	Nisam bio tamo i niko mi nije puno rekao
Which they are not.	Što nisu.
I didn't mean to say that	Nisam htela to da kažem
I like going to work.	Volim da idem na posao.
He was better at it.	Bio je bolji u tome.
That's what I thought.	To sam i mislio.
He must have something to see.	Mora da ima šta da vidi.
I really thought it was you	Stvarno sam mislio da si to ti
He was such a good guy.	Bio je tako dobar momak.
I still had the problem.	I dalje sam imao problem.
They needed to do something.	Trebali su nešto učiniti.
I need to know what's going on next	Moram da znam šta se dalje dešava
I knew you would find him	Znao sam da ćeš ga naći
Maybe you should have stayed home.	Možda si trebao ostati kod kuće.
I wish more people would do this.	Voleo bih da više ljudi ovo radi.
Nothing bad happened.	Ništa loše se nije dogodilo.
I couldn't believe this	Nisam mogao vjerovati u ovo
That's the one.	To je taj.
We knew he had to come.	Znali smo da mora doći.
A simple question.	Jednostavno pitanje.
This was fine with us.	Ovo nam je bilo u redu.
We should have, but no one really did.	Trebali smo, ali niko zaista nije.
I have a good reason for this	Imam dobar razlog za ovo
He didn't even know it existed.	Nije ni znao da postoji.
You have to too.	I ti moraš.
Please.	Molim te.
It's hard for me.	Teško mi je.
I shouldn't have done that	Nisam trebao da to uradiš
I know your job very well	Znam tvoj posao veoma dobro
I just know he did it	Samo znam da je to uradio
Obviously this is not the case.	Očigledno to nije tako.
I want everything now	Želim sve sada
He did nothing wrong.	Nije uradio ništa loše.
I just won't do it.	Jednostavno neću to učiniti.
We'll get back to this soon.	Uskoro ćemo se vratiti na ovo.
I know him better than anyone	Znam ga bolje od bilo koga
None of that happened.	Ništa nije bilo od toga.
I still didn't say anything	I dalje nisam ništa rekao
I don't think they know either.	Mislim da ni oni ne znaju.
You know nothing.	Ti ne znaš ništa.
Or it never even started.	Ili nikada nije ni počeo.
It is hard.	Teško je.
I think that was for me too	Mislim da je to bilo i za mene
That just didn’t happen.	To se jednostavno nije dogodilo.
I'm obviously happy about that	Očigledno sam sretan zbog toga
I needed someone who knew what he was doing	Trebao mi je neko ko zna šta radi
I need you to tell me the truth.	Treba mi da mi kažeš istinu.
DIY.	Uradi sam.
That will completely happen.	To će se potpuno dogoditi.
I haven't been with anyone	Nisam bio ni sa kim
I think it was	Mislim da je bilo
A person cannot help who he is.	Osoba ne može pomoći ko je.
I did all this for you	Sve sam ovo uradio za tebe
He said it himself.	On je to sam rekao.
The truth is, we can't do this alone.	Istina je da ovo ne možemo sami.
You were here.	Bio si ovdje.
I only have a little time to live	Imam samo malo vremena za život
There was no time for work.	Nije bilo vrijeme za posao.
I never got to that	Nikad nisam stigao do toga
I need to talk to him before he leaves.	Moram razgovarati s njim prije nego ode.
He immediately said no.	Odmah je rekao ne.
What will she do?	Šta će ona.
I haven't been there yet, but soon	Nisam još bio tamo, ali uskoro
I wonder who it could be	Pitam se ko bi to mogao biti
I want him to tell me what he really thinks	Želim da mi kaže šta stvarno misli
I didn't want to say anything	Nisam htela ništa da kažem
And he wants a little more.	I želi malo više.
I didn't want to go on with him yet	Nisam još htela da idem dalje sa njim
That day has not yet come.	Taj dan još nije došao.
I knew there was so much more than you	Znao sam da ima mnogo više od tebe
I guess you are.	Pretpostavljam da jesi.
Maybe I already am	Možda sam već
I didn't see it that way either	Ni ja to nisam vidio na taj način
I didn't even want to.	Nisam ni htela.
I was there alone.	Bio sam tamo sam.
I'm sorry you lost her.	Žao mi je što si je izgubio.
But you can see it.	Ali možete ga vidjeti.
You can do it.	Možete to učiniti.
I didn't have to be told that	Nisam morao da mi neko to kaže
And think of money.	I misli na novac.
I hope this can help you.	Nadam se da ti ovo može pomoći.
This one is.	Ovaj jeste.
I haven't even heard of it.	Nisam ni čuo za to.
He was like me.	Bio je kao ja.
Not only what to do, but also how to do it.	Ne samo šta raditi, već i kako to učiniti.
I was just surprised he was playing.	Samo sam bio iznenađen što igra.
Not good.	Nije dobro.
It would be hard for me not to do that	Bilo bi mi teško da to ne uradim
Gone and gone.	Otišao i otišao.
But he's going, as you say.	Ali on ide, kako ti kažeš.
You can go back to work or school.	Možete se vratiti na posao ili u školu.
I didn't have to see him again	Nisam morao ponovo da ga vidim
I know he knows	Znam da on zna
And it seems to work.	I izgleda da radi.
It tells why something happened.	To govori zašto se nešto dogodilo.
Please, this time.	Molim te, ovaj put.
Please for something.	Molim te za nešto.
He knew it wouldn't be.	Znao je da neće biti.
And maybe they were right.	I možda su bili u pravu.
We can do better than that.	Možemo i bolje od toga.
I didn't know how many there were	Nisam znao koliko ih je bilo
I promised him it should be done	Obećao sam mu da to treba da se uradi
But he wants to be.	Ali on želi da bude.
I never knew if it was good or bad	Nikad nisam znao da li je to dobro ili loše
He doesn't know, and he never will.	On ne zna, i nikada neće.
To be or not to be.	Biti ili ne biti.
But he is safe.	Ali on je siguran.
I need to know something	Moram nešto znati
I left.	Otišao sam.
I just saw him last week.	Upravo sam ga vidio prošle sedmice.
I didn't make it	Ja ga nisam napravio
I didn't want that, but that's how it was.	Nisam to htio, ali tako je bilo.
Maybe he saw or heard something.	Možda je nešto vidio ili čuo.
Please don't anymore.	Molim te, nemoj više.
I guess three isn’t that bad	Pretpostavljam da tri nije tako loše
Maybe that's what's happening here.	Možda je to ono što se ovde dešava.
I love being with you	Volim biti s tobom
And so it should be.	I tako treba da bude.
Nice to see you here	Drago mi je što vas vidim ovdje
Tell me what you think.	Reci mi šta misliš.
I wonder what's going on	Pitam se šta se dešava
Everything is fine.	Sve je dobro.
There were so many.	Toliko ih je bilo.
I had it this morning.	Imao sam ga jutros.
There's more, everyone.	Ima još toga, svi.
He could have done it easily.	Mogao je to lako.
He would see her again.	On bi je ponovo video.
I wasn't sure how much	Nisam bio siguran koliko
I know what it is	Znam šta je to
He would get nothing.	Ne bi dobio ništa.
I have no idea what they could be	Nemam pojma šta bi oni mogli biti
And she was right.	I ona je bila u pravu.
I love you so much too	I ja tebe toliko volim
I knew exactly who it was	Tačno sam znao ko je to
I've never had a problem.	Nikada nisam imao problema.
As if no one really knows.	Kao da niko zaista ne zna.
That's not there now.	Toga sada nema.
I can't believe she's really going to be mine	Ne mogu vjerovati da će ona zaista biti moja
I just want to go home now	Samo želim da idem kući sada
But it can't be.	Ali to ne može biti.
I never had any of that	Nikad nisam imao ništa od toga
I haven't seen anything, nothing yet	Nisam video ništa, ništa još
I really, really love them	Zaista, stvarno ih volim
He gave it to you.	On ti ga je dao.
He knows about anything.	On zna o bilo čemu.
And why you came to me.	I zašto si došao kod mene.
You should have done that long enough.	Trebalo je da to radite dovoljno dugo.
That's really good.	To je stvarno dobro.
I couldn't be sure which one	Nisam mogao biti siguran koji
It's hard to say exactly how.	Teško je tačno reći kako.
I need to know these things	Moram da znam ove stvari
I guess he's been there a long time	Pretpostavljam da je tamo već dugo vremena
In fact, they may not know it.	U stvari, oni to možda i ne znaju.
You want to know everything.	Želiš da znaš sve.
I tell you this is the way to go	Kažem vam da je ovo pravi put
Today it would be nothing.	Danas to ne bi bilo ništa.
It's a little hard for me to talk.	Malo mi je teško razgovarati.
I asked him what he was doing.	Pitao sam ga šta radi.
I never meant anything bad	Nikada nisam mislio ništa loše
And they did.	I oni su to uradili.
I love her, but it's not her	Volim je, ali to nije ona
My code doesn't work.	Moj kod to ne radi.
He just loves life.	On jednostavno voli život.
This just doesn't work.	Ovo jednostavno ne radi.
I don't see where the problem is.	Ne vidim gdje je problem.
Not right away.	Ne odmah.
I needed him and he needed me	Trebao sam ga i on mene
Except he's not him.	Osim što on nije on.
I hope you want that to be the case.	Nadam se da želiš da je tako.
Just a thing.	Samo stvar.
I'm not sure if he can	Nisam siguran da li može
We didn't do anything.	Nismo ništa uradili.
I had to say that	Morao sam to reći
In fact, very quickly.	U stvari, vrlo brzo.
He said no, he's fine.	Rekao je ne, dobro je.
And you know more than that.	A ti znaš više od toga.
I went to school yesterday	Jučer sam otišao u školu
But she loves me.	Ali ona me voli.
That may no longer be true.	To možda više nije istina.
It must be one of us.	To mora biti neko od nas.
I wasn't sure myself	Ni sam nisam bio siguran
I didn't know what he was saying	Nisam znao šta govori
I didn't know what to do with it.	Nisam znao šta da radim s tim.
You are here now and there is plenty of time.	Sada ste ovdje i ima dosta vremena.
And very few people know.	I vrlo malo ljudi zna.
How would it be.	Kako bi bilo.
And so he did.	I tako je i učinio.
I couldn't reach him	Nisam mogao doći do njega
Yes, it really is.	Da, stvarno je.
I thought we could help ourselves	Mislio sam da možemo sami sebi pomoći
I wasn't sure where he was	Nisam bio siguran gdje je
He wanted something.	Želio je nešto.
I really would.	Zaista bi.
Yes, it was.	Da, bilo je.
In fact, he asked for a meeting.	U stvari, tražio je sastanak.
This year they.	Ove godine oni.
You couldn't do that.	Nisi to mogao uraditi.
I wish you wouldn't say that	Voleo bih da to ne kažeš
It was the first time for all of us.	Svima nam je to bilo prvi put.
I knew you didn't want me	Znao sam da me ne želiš
I got it.	Imam ga.
Nothing about yourself.	Ništa o sebi.
Tell me how you could do that.	Reci mi kako bi ti to mogao.
I will never talk to you	Nikad neću razgovarati s tobom
I would be completely alone	Bio bih potpuno sam
I could come and go.	Mogao sam doći i otići.
They are there now.	Oni su sada tamo.
He was not alone in being alone.	Nije bio sam u tome što je bio sam.
I won't see them again	Neću ih više vidjeti
I wondered if he would say something	Pitao sam se hoće li nešto reći
I didn't expect that either	Ni ja to nisam očekivao
I wasn't sure what happened	Nisam bio siguran šta se dogodilo
I think it's obvious here and now	Mislim da je to očigledno ovde i sada
He shouldn't have said that.	Nije trebao to da kaže.
You knew.	Znao si.
I should have known that wasn't it	Trebao sam znati da to nije to
I want, I want, I want !.	Želim, želim, želim!.
I expected to see him there	Očekivao sam da ću ga tamo vidjeti
That's really something.	To je zaista nešto.
I wondered when he arrived	Pitao sam se kada je stigao
That would never happen.	To se nikada ne bi dogodilo.
But none of that is true.	Ali ništa od toga nije istina.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
There can only be one way.	To može biti samo na jedan način.
I never did that to him, ever	Nikad mu to nisam uradio, nikada
I'll find my way home	Naći ću put kući
Or so it used to be.	Ili je tako nekada bilo.
It shouldn't have.	Nije trebalo.
When he returned, he did much more.	Kada se vratio, uradio je mnogo više.
There's not much here.	Nema mnogo ovde.
I think you've said enough	Mislim da si dovoljno rekao
I didn't want to.	Nisam htela.
He just loves to play.	On jednostavno voli da se igra.
That won't bring her back to me.	To mi je neće vratiti.
I never understood what it was about	Nikad nisam shvatio o čemu se radi
They did it and they are alive.	Oni su to uradili i živi su.
I'm telling you, there's something wrong with that.	Kažem ti, nešto nije u redu s tim.
Or maybe they are not.	Ili možda nisu.
And it looks better.	I izgleda bolje.
I'm doing the right thing here	Ovdje radim pravu stvar
I just want to be there for you	Samo želim da budem tu za tebe
It’s not as hard to do as you think.	To nije tako teško učiniti kao što mislite.
We did badly.	Loše smo to uradili.
There was nothing that anyone could do.	Niko ništa nije mogao učiniti.
Where are you?.	Gdje si?.
And they will.	I oni će.
I like to think of you there	Volim da mislim na tebe tamo
I was never too sure about that.	Nikada nisam bio previše siguran u to.
I hope you know what you just did	Nadam se da znaš šta si upravo uradio
You know something that could help us.	Znate nešto što bi nam moglo pomoći.
I've only been here three weeks today.	Danas sam ovdje samo tri sedmice.
I just finished it last night	Upravo sam je završio sinoć
I need to know the truth	Moram znati istinu
None of that happened.	Ništa od toga nije bilo.
We have new ones.	Imamo novi.
And they all were.	I svi su bili.
There aren't that many of them.	Nema ih toliko.
He had no idea how long.	Nije imao pojma koliko dugo.
It's so alone.	Tako je sam.
I love my life.	Volim svoj život.
He won't come.	Neće doći.
Maybe that would be good.	Možda bi to bilo dobro.
What will he do.	Što će on.
I need to see that.	Moram to vidjeti.
I wonder if it's good	Pitam se da li je dobro
We can do it.	Mi to možemo uraditi.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Možda malo, možda mnogo.
He has them.	On ih ima.
I want it as much as you do	Želim to koliko i ti
I did this last night	Napravio sam ovo sinoć
I never do it alone	Nikad to ne radim sama
I have to do something right	Mora da radim nešto kako treba
I think we are all fed up	Mislim da nam je svima dosta
I've done that many times	To sam radio mnogo puta
I understood why he had to do it	Shvatio sam zašto je to morao da uradi
And we did.	I mi smo to uradili.
I never knew why	Nikad nisam znao zašto
I never know how to say this	Nikad ne znam kako ovo da kažem
I had another job	Imao sam još jedan posao
Man.	Čovjek.
That's you too.	To si i ti.
He said no.	Rekao je da nije.
I have to go a little further	Moram ići još malo dalje
I would never do that.	Nikad to ne bih uradio.
I told myself you were better off without me	Rekao sam sebi da ti je bolje bez mene
I mean, you know exactly who you are and what you are	Mislim, ti tačno znaš ko si i šta si
She knew this was coming.	Znala je da će ovo doći.
I want him to say more.	Želim da kaže više.
I'm not sorry about that	Nije mi žao zbog toga
I like it very, very much	Sviđa mi se jako, jako
I didn't know how much he would believe	Nisam znao koliko će vjerovati
That I'm not anymore.	Da ja više nisam.
So many times.	Toliko puta.
You probably know that too.	Vjerovatno i ti to znaš.
He knew he never would.	Znao je da nikada neće.
I never expected it to be easy	Nikad nisam očekivao da će biti lako
They knew it wouldn't help.	Znali su da to neće pomoći.
I think it always will be	Mislim da će uvek biti
We know each other well.	Znamo se dobro.
We are not all right, but we are much better.	Nije nam sve u redu, ali nam je mnogo bolje.
It drives well.	Dobro se vozi.
This is often not enough.	Ovo često nije dovoljno.
I think it will be even better.	Mislim da će biti još bolje.
He will help us.	On će nam pomoći.
This makes me me now.	Ovo me sada čini mi.
Actually, that's not always true.	Zapravo, to nije uvijek tačno.
That's what he did.	To je ono što je on uradio.
It's just life.	To je samo život.
I know it couldn't be you	Znam da to nisi mogao biti ti
He is only the first.	On je samo prvi.
I want to know who.	Želim da znam ko.
You already said that.	To si već rekao.
You know what.	Znaš šta.
You said that yourself.	To si i sam rekao.
I may have to come again tomorrow	Možda ću morati doći sutra ponovo
I would have nothing better than to work	Ne bih imao ništa bolje nego raditi
Obviously no one could know about us.	Očigledno niko nije mogao znati za nas.
That was over three years ago.	To je bilo prije više od tri godine.
But no, not much.	Ali ne, ne mnogo.
I wouldn't want to do that	Ne bih to želio da uradim
I could see how much he loved her	Mogao sam vidjeti koliko je voli
I never wanted to go back.	Nikada se nisam htela vratiti.
So much goes into it.	Toliko toga ide u to.
You can see me.	Možete me vidjeti.
You are one of us.	Ti si jedan od nas.
Is this good.	Da li je ovo dobro.
I couldn't help myself.	Nisam si mogao pomoći.
I haven't heard anything about it	Nisam čuo ništa o tome
Neither for you nor for anyone.	Ni za tebe ni za nikoga.
I think that could be a problem.	Mislim da bi to mogao biti problem.
He told me he didn't know.	Rekao mi je da ne zna.
I wish him well.	Želim mu dobro.
It happened so fast, so fast that no one was ready.	To se dogodilo tako brzo, tako brzo da niko nije bio spreman.
Now I know she was right.	Sada znam da je bila u pravu.
I'm glad for that.	Drago mi je zbog toga.
He will never say never.	Nikada neće reći nikad.
I love you so completely.	Volim te tako potpuno.
They did nothing wrong.	Nisu uradili ništa loše.
At any time.	U bilo koje vrijeme.
I've never been before	Nikada ranije nisam bio
I haven't lost my job yet	Još nisam izgubio posao
That in itself was not a problem.	To samo po sebi nije bio problem.
He doesn't know who he is.	On ne zna ko je on.
They shouldn't be there.	Oni ne bi trebali biti tamo.
It goes on and on.	To ide i dalje.
I did it exactly as you told me	Uradio sam to tačno kako si mi rekao
To see him.	Da ga vidim.
It's like that.	To je kao da.
I wasn't sure how to say it	Nisam bio siguran kako da kažem
You can easily do this at home.	To možete lako učiniti kod kuće.
But that is not the question.	Ali to nije pitanje.
And more and more.	I sve više i više.
It's been a while.	Već neko vrijeme.
This does not happen often.	Ovo se ne dešava često.
I never said anything like that	Nikad nisam rekao tako nešto
I wasn't really surprised	Nisam baš bio iznenađen
And it's okay with that.	I u redu je s tim.
It could have been anywhere.	Moglo je biti bilo gdje.
This could be bad.	Ovo bi moglo biti loše.
I didn't even know where he lived	Nisam ni znao gdje živi
Maybe he could help us.	Možda bi mogao da nam pomogne.
Except we're not.	Osim što nismo.
She doesn't have them.	Ona ih nema.
I want it in me	Želim ga u sebi
I've had this problem before	Imao sam ovaj problem prije
I think you should stay here	Mislim da bi trebao ostati ovdje
''.	''.
I need someone.	Treba mi neko.
He looked so good	Tako je dobro izgledao
And just about everything.	I baš sve.
I'm so glad you're here today.	Tako mi je drago što ste danas ovdje.
That was pretty hard.	To je bilo prilično teško.
But there was so much, so much.	Ali bilo je toliko, toliko.
I haven't seen her in days	Nisam je vidio nekoliko dana
This time it was better.	Ovaj put je bilo bolje.
He says he will.	Kaže da hoće.
I just didn't tell him	Samo mu nisam rekla
You did a better job.	Uradio si bolji posao.
I think tomorrow will be a good day	Mislim da će sutra biti dobar dan
That happened here.	To se ovdje dogodilo.
I can still find them	Još mogu naći kao i oni
I really hope you're okay	Zaista se nadam da si dobro
I've heard them all.	Čuo sam ih sve.
I'm glad they didn't	Drago mi je da nisu
I want him to see me again, to see me better.	Želim da me ponovo vidi, da me vidi bolje.
I couldn't believe what was happening	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta se dešava
Something was wrong.	Nešto nije bilo u redu.
That tells you something.	To ti nešto govori.
I can't do anything alone	Ne mogu ništa sam
I still didn't even have a car.	Još uvijek nisam imao ni auto.
But that didn't happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
No or yes.	Ne ili da.
At home, anywhere.	Kod kuće, bilo gdje.
I knew he wanted to live	Znao sam da želi da živi
I have no problem with that	Nemam problema sa tim
It must be good for something.	Mora biti dobro za nešto.
He said he could.	Rekao je da može.
He's not there either.	Ni on nije tamo.
I went for help and finished	Otišao sam po pomoć i završio
I hope you're well	Nadam se da si dobro
He would tell you what he thinks.	Rekao bi ti šta misli.
But only what it is.	Ali samo ono što jeste.
I knew he couldn't be trusted	Znao sam da mu se ne može vjerovati
Say that again.	Reci to ponovo.
I had no idea what was going on	Nisam imao pojma šta se dešava
He doesn't even know where they are.	On čak i ne zna gdje su.
Do it only if you really want to.	Uradite to samo ako to zaista želite.
You have to work for it.	Morate raditi za to.
I never thought that would happen	Nikad nisam mislio da će se to dogoditi
Now it seems to be here.	Sada se čini da je ovdje.
I’ll never be good, and that’s not a bad thing	Nikada neću biti dobar, a to nije loše
I shouldn't.	Ne bih trebao.
She wants everyone to know you can do it.	Ona želi da svi znaju da ti to možeš.
If we do, he's gone.	Ako to uradimo, on je otišao.
I've done this before.	Radio sam ovo ranije.
I think he might have known	Mislim da je možda znao
I should have been there.	Trebao sam biti tamo.
I will always be with you	Uvek ću biti sa tobom
I hope you like it	Nadam se da ti se sviđa
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
I could, you know	Mogao sam, znaš
I had to do it myself	Morao sam to sam
She didn't know what day it was.	Nije znala koji je dan.
You don't know how this is going to happen.	Ne znaš kako će se to dogoditi.
He was good, but you were better.	On je bio dobar, ali ti si bio bolji.
He said no.	Rekao je da nije.
Which is not what I want.	Što nije ono što želim.
And it won't.	I neće.
I probably won't even be there	Verovatno neću ni biti tamo
I told him it was a good idea	Rekao sam mu da je to dobra ideja
Like the team.	Kao i tim.
I'm good at it.	Dobar sam u tome.
Or tell me what he does.	Ili mi reci šta radi.
I've heard them all before.	Sve sam ih već čuo.
I mean really see	Mislim stvarno vidjeti
Probably so.	Vjerovatno će i tako.
I didn't want this	Nisam želeo ovo
I'm not sure what the real reason was.	Nisam baš siguran šta je bio pravi razlog.
I guess you'll have to do it for tonight.	Pretpostavljam da ćeš morati da uradiš za večeras.
It was too easy for him to reach me.	Bilo mu je previše lako doći do mene.
I know this is true	Znam da je ovo istina
Nothing is happening.	Ništa se ne dešava.
I'll give it to him.	Ja ću mu dati.
He can talk.	On može da priča.
I don't want that.	Ne želim to.
There had been no one there for some time.	Već neko vrijeme tamo nije bilo nikoga.
You can tell me.	Možeš mi reći.
As if there is no tomorrow.	Kao da ne postoji sutra.
You have to say something about it.	Moraš nešto reći o tome.
I guess you know now	Pretpostavljam da sada znaš
I really can't say	Zaista ne mogu reći
I'm glad you're my friend too	Drago mi je da si i ti moj prijatelj
I can't do it alone	Ne mogu sam
I couldn't say what happened next	Nisam mogao reći šta se dalje dogodilo
They could see him.	Mogli su ga vidjeti.
He did what he was supposed to do.	Uradio je ono što je trebalo da uradi.
I didn't want anything to do with it	Nisam želio ništa s tim
Maybe I'm still here	Možda sam još uvijek tu
No.	Neću.
I did something for you	Uradio sam nešto za tebe
More next week.	Više sljedeće sedmice.
I know something is going on	Znam da se nešto dešava
And he doesn't seem to be doing anything.	I čini se da ništa ne radi.
I've done this before.	Napravio sam ovo ranije.
You know the truth.	Ti znaš istinu.
I know about those things	Znam za te stvari
I didn't mean to tell you	Nisam htela da ti kažem
But she says nothing.	Ali ona ne govori ništa.
There were always more of them.	Uvijek ih je bilo više.
That would be one way.	To bi bio jedan način.
I love everything there	Volim sve tamo
We are much more now.	Sada smo mnogo više.
You have me '.	Imaš me'.
I can't tell you much more now	Ne mogu vam sada reći mnogo više
I'm just a.	Ja sam samo a.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
And another.	I još jedan.
That's all I want	Samo to želim
I've already heard the party	Već sam čuo zabavu
I know all of you, you all know me	Znam sve vas, svi znate mene
The way we did it.	Način na koji smo to uradili.
It's just me.	To sam samo ja.
I wouldn't think so	Ne bih tako mislio
Not so long ago.	Ni malo prije.
That's a lot.	To je mnogo.
I know who he is	Znam ko je on
Which is true, you can.	Što je istina, možete.
Tell me they're here.	Reci mi da su ovde.
I knew you would	Znao sam da hoćeš
I can never find me here.	Nikada me ne mogu naći ovdje.
She obviously knew.	Očigledno je znala.
Neither did I.	Nisam ni ja.
I knew you didn't want that either	Znao sam da ni ti to ne želiš
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
I know something we can do	Znam nešto što možemo učiniti
You said it yourself.	Sam si to rekao.
I didn't know what to do with it	Nisam znao šta da radim s tim
I didn't do it for myself	Nisam to uradio za sebe
Maybe that's good too.	Možda je i to dobro.
I didn't want to hope	Nisam htela da se nadam
Tell us something.	Govori nam nešto.
As if it doesn't really exist.	Kao da zapravo ne postoji.
That must be enough	Mora biti dovoljno
It just wasn't good.	Jednostavno nije bilo dobro.
Tell me a little about it.	Reci mi malo o tome.
I didn't even know he was here for a while	Nisam ni znala da je ovdje neko vrijeme
I thought it was no no.	Mislio sam da je to ne ne.
I hope it will still be good !.	Nadam se da će i dalje biti dobro!.
Where is He?.	Gdje je on?.
You want to be able to say that you did it.	Želite da možete reći da ste to uradili.
I wondered who he was	Pitao sam se ko je on
This is not right.	Ovo nije u redu.
I almost did it	Skoro sam to uradio
It may not always be so.	Možda nije uvijek tako.
She won't believe it, but he did.	Ona neće vjerovati, ali on jeste.
No one would do that here.	Niko to ne bi uradio ovde.
I didn’t even have a car, and they knew it	Nisam imao čak ni auto, a oni su to znali
I didn't tell anyone	Nisam nikome rekao
And I ever was	I ja sam ikada bio
I never loved her	Nisam je volio, nikad
And they didn't.	A nisu.
I never say anything either	Ni ja nikad ništa ne kažem
I think that's for sure	Mislim da je to sigurno
He won't.	Neće.
We are better than that.	Bolji smo od toga.
She knew what was happening.	Znala je šta se dešava.
I haven't heard anything about it	Nisam čuo ništa o tome
Or maybe not.	Ili možda neće.
But it's not quite there.	Ali nije baš tu.
He wants to talk to you about it.	Želi razgovarati s tobom o tome.
I just have to trust you.	Samo ti moram vjerovati u tome.
But that is what it is	Ali to je ono što jeste
But we have what we have.	Ali imamo ono što imamo.
I know what you told him	Znam šta si mu rekao
I need you to know that.	Moram da to znaš.
I hope he never comes back	Nadam se da se nikada neće vratiti
But it's not up to me.	Ali to nije do mene.
I want it done right.	Želim da se uradi kako treba.
I would say that is true.	Rekao bih da je to tačno.
They are safe.	Oni su sigurni.
There is always a reason.	Uvijek postoji razlog.
It was as you say.	Bilo je kako ti kažeš.
He does his job and more.	Radi svoj posao i više od toga.
That is exactly what is happening.	Upravo to se dešava.
I've been.	Bio sam.
I mean the only one	Mislim jedini
It was only one day.	Bio je to samo jedan dan.
But he didn't know.	Ali nije znao.
Do you.	Da li ti.
They knew it.	Oni su to znali.
That was fine with him.	To mu je bilo u redu.
But there is something else.	Ali postoji još nešto.
And maybe they're right.	I možda su u pravu.
I want you, you are mine	Želim te, ti si moj
I will never say.	Nikad neću reći.
I think that is very, very likely.	Mislim da je to vrlo, vrlo vjerovatno.
It's not right.	Nije u redu.
Or something like that.	Ili tako nešto.
Car.	Auto.
But she knew it herself.	Ali i sama je to znala.
But it was not so.	Ali nije bilo tako.
I told him.	Rekao sam mu.
I asked him if he was a father	Pitao sam ga da li je otac
That's good, very good.	To je dobro, veoma dobro.
He could not be a happy man.	Nije mogao biti sretan čovjek.
That would be something.	To bi bilo nešto.
I guess we all should have known better	Pretpostavljam da smo svi trebali znati bolje
That also seems to be true.	Čini se da je i to istina.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
I didn't get anything there.	Tamo nisam ništa dobio.
I couldn't do it without you	Ne bih to mogao bez tebe
And that should be it.	I to bi trebalo biti to.
Something like that would be wrong.	Tako nešto ne bi bilo u redu.
It doesn't happen if you don't do something fast.	To se ne dešava ako nešto ne uradite brzo.
But it was none of that.	Ali to nije bilo ništa od toga.
I always wondered what it was	Uvek sam se pitao šta je to
It never happened.	Nikad se nije dogodilo.
I had nothing on me.	Nisam imao ništa na sebi.
I've already tried	Već sam pokušao
Just a thing.	Samo stvar.
But that was no longer true.	Ali to više nije bila istina.
This takes time.	Za ovo treba vremena.
Neither good nor bad.	Ni dobro ni loše.
He was too busy and happy to know he was happy.	Bio je previše zauzet i sretan da bi znao da je sretan.
A friend had to tell me it wasn’t my story	Prijatelj mi je morao reći da to nije moja priča
That was better.	To je bilo bolje.
I was so happy.	Bio sam tako sretan.
I know he still loves me	Znam da me i dalje voli
I hope not, but who knows	Nadam se da neće, ali ko zna
There were several of them.	Bilo ih je nekoliko.
I wanted things my way	Želeo sam stvari na svoj način
She feels safe.	Osjeća se sigurno.
There didn't seem to be any.	Činilo se da ih nije bilo.
I couldn't believe it	Nisam mogao vjerovati
I just thought you wanted to know	Samo sam mislio da bi htela da znaš
There were several of them.	Bilo ih je nekoliko.
Are you sure you knew who he was?	Jeste li sigurni da ste znali ko je on.
We were still alive.	Još smo bili živi.
Never, she said.	Nemoj nikad, rekla je.
He has no idea at the moment.	Trenutno nema pojma.
I certainly wanted to.	Ja sam sigurno htela.
We knew we couldn’t stay much longer.	Znali smo da ne možemo ostati još dugo.
He should have talked.	Trebao je razgovarati.
But not yours.	Ali ne tvoj.
I don't know why that didn't happen.	Ne znam zašto se to nije dogodilo.
I thought you'd be safe if you never knew	Mislio sam da ćeš biti siguran ako nikad ne znaš
Does it really exist ???.	Da li zaista postoji???.
It just didn't seem right.	Samo se nije činilo u redu.
I knew that right now	Znao sam to upravo sada
He was a person.	On je bio osoba.
All right, yes.	U redu, da.
And no, you may not.	I ne, možda nećeš.
I was sure of it	Bio sam siguran u to
She was there for a few days.	Bila je tamo nekoliko dana.
This is what he was looking for.	Ovo je ono što je tražio.
I have nothing more to tell you	Nemam više šta da vam kažem
I know what he's planning	Znam šta planira
I was really sorry	Zaista mi je bilo žao
But you know someone.	Ali znaš nekoga.
I didn't want to see him.	Nisam htela da ga vidim.
You know how to play.	Znate kako se igra.
I wanted more than that	Želeo sam više od toga
No, he didn't get it.	Ne, nije to shvatio.
I should have told him	Trebao sam mu reći
I didn't expect it, really	Nisam očekivao, zaista
You know he will.	Znaš da hoće.
I can't say that anymore	Ne mogu to više reći
I could say no	Mogao sam reći ne
But I was already tired	Ali već sam bio umoran
I think we should talk about it	Mislim da bi trebali razgovarati o tome
I'm really not a very good person.	Ja zaista nisam baš dobra osoba.
Not even me.	Čak ni mi.
I still wanted to be with him.	I dalje sam htela da budem sa njim.
I think maybe something is better.	Mislim da je možda nešto bolje.
This is going to be bad.	Ovo će biti loše.
I would do anything for him.	Sve bih uradio za njega.
I don't know why anyone would want this job.	Ne znam zašto bi neko želeo ovaj posao.
He says that will probably happen this year as well.	Kaže da će se to vjerovatno dogoditi i ove godine.
I knew something was wrong	Znao sam da nešto nije u redu
I think even she knew what was going to happen.	Mislim da je čak i ona znala šta će se dogoditi.
He won't tell me why he's here.	Neće mi reći zašto je ovdje.
He looks surprised she's here too.	Izgleda iznenađen što je i ona ovdje.
It's like a game.	To je kao igra.
That's what he said.	Tako je on to rekao.
I am very happy about that.	Veoma sam sretan zbog toga.
I know it's hard	Znam da je teško
I should do it right now.	Trebao bih to raditi upravo sada.
I still haven't seen who did it	Još uvijek nisam vidio ko je to uradio
I knew he was one of us	Znao sam da je on jedan od nas
I guess that was too obvious	Pretpostavljam da je to bilo previše očigledno
It seems like it’s really together for you.	Čini se da vam je to zaista zajedno.
I was not allowed to see him	Nije mi bilo dozvoljeno da ga vidim
Nobody has a problem with that.	Niko nema problema sa tim.
I'm not that.	Nisam to.
I have to work tonight	Moram raditi večeras
I think it will be good	Mislim da će biti dobro
The only question is when and which job.	Pitanje je samo kada i koji posao.
I won't tell everyone	Neću to reći svima
She says she's not here.	Ona kaže da nije ovdje.
I want my money to be yours too	Želim da moj novac bude i tvoj
We can buy you anything you want.	Možemo vam kupiti sve što želite.
I shouldn't be wondering.	Ne bi trebalo da se pitam.
But there is no time.	Ali nema vremena.
It's easy to see.	To je lako vidjeti.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo u redu.
I don't know if it really is.	Ne znam da li zaista jeste.
It's just a journey.	To je samo put.
I would always love her	Uvek bih je voleo
You said it all.	Sve ste rekli.
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
I really think you will	Zaista mislim da hoćeš
That was enough for now.	Za sada je to bilo dovoljno.
Not that it could.	Nije da bi moglo.
That's right.	Tako je.
He couldn't believe what he heard.	Nije mogao vjerovati šta je čuo.
You'll soon see why.	Uskoro ćete vidjeti zašto.
I can't tell you much about it	Ne mogu vam reći puno o tome
I will no longer be my own.	Neću više biti svoj.
This was not easy.	Ovo nije bilo lako.
I was happy I didn't say anything	Bio sam sretan što nisam ništa rekao
So much.	Tako puno.
He loved life.	Voleo je život.
It's a really hard time.	Zaista je teško vrijeme.
I didn't see you there.	Nisam te vidio tamo.
I knew one would come	Znao sam da će jedan doći
I often think of him	Često mislim na njega
And he is.	I on je .
I didn't mean any of that	Nisam mislio ništa od toga
She wouldn't either.	Ni ona ne bi.
I'm glad he got home.	Drago mi je što je stigao kući.
I really didn't know what to tell him	Zaista nisam znao šta da mu kažem
I know about all this	Znam za sve ovo
You know what that is.	Znaš šta je to.
No you're not.	Ne, nisi.
She said nothing.	Nije rekla ništa.
I knew what was going on here	Znao sam šta se ovde dešava
Yes you are.	Da jesi.
I had no idea about it.	Nisam imao pojma o tome.
Tomorrow is that day.	Sutra je taj dan.
This is what makes us.	To je ono što nas čini.
I didn't think he had that in him	Nisam mislio da to ima u sebi
I should have been with you	Trebao sam biti s tobom
But something is happening.	Ali, nešto se dešava.
It's like he's trying to tell me something.	Kao da mi pokušava nešto reći.
I'll pick you up.	Doći ću po tebe.
I knew he had to be there	Znao sam da mora biti tamo
I need more help and you can help me	Treba mi još pomoći i ti mi možeš pomoći
He wasn't always.	Nije uvek bio.
Too much now.	Previše toga sada.
But only if that would be good.	Ali samo ako bi to bilo dobro.
I started going to school	Počeo sam ići u školu
I know what they are	Znam šta su
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije tako.
I couldn't afford it	Nisam to sebi mogao dozvoliti
I need to talk to him	Moram razgovarati s njim
I can still do it.	I dalje to mogu.
I didn't even have to say that	Nisam ni morao to da kažem
You can't tell what she thinks about it.	Ne možete reći šta ona misli o tome.
Good, good job.	Dobro, dobar posao.
It was necessary.	Trebalo je.
There is nothing about it.	Nema ništa o tome.
Very few people try.	Vrlo malo ljudi pokušava.
I've never seen him without it	Nikad ga nisam video bez toga
They were almost there.	Bili su skoro tamo.
Yes, some of that.	Da, nešto od toga.
I'm going to get him	Idem po njega
He saw too much.	Video je previše.
I didn't ask for much	Nisam tražio puno
I've never seen anything like it	Nikad nisam video tako nešto
Pretty long.	Prilično dugo.
Don't be sorry.	Nemoj da ti bude žao.
He's a good guy.	On je dobar momak.
That was it.	To je bilo.
If he’s for it, it’s.	Ako je on za to, to je.
I can't believe he's doing all this	Ne mogu vjerovati da radi sve ovo
You couldn’t buy it at the time.	Nisi ga mogao kupiti u to vrijeme.
I didn't ask for myself	Nisam tražio zbog sebe
That's what he did.	To je on uradio.
It wasn't long enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno dugo.
Yes, from time to time.	Da, s vremena na vrijeme.
I didn't want to either	Nisam ni ja htela
And maybe they're here too.	A možda su i ovdje.
I won't even tell you	Neću ti ni reći
I'm the one here with you	Ja sam taj koji je ovdje sa tobom
I have heard him say so many times	Čuo sam ga kako je rekao toliko puta
I need another one, and another one and another one.	Treba mi još jedan, i još jedan i još jedan.
I really have no idea about anything anymore	Zaista više nemam pojma ni o čemu
I didn't even have to say anything	Nisam ni morao ništa da kažem
I see you're doing it	Vidim da to radiš
I only heard it a few times	Čuo sam ga samo nekoliko puta
Not today, not tomorrow, next week or next month.	Ne danas, ne sutra, sljedeće sedmice ili sljedećeg mjeseca.
And even more.	I još više.
I was sure there was something there	Bio sam siguran da tu nešto ima
If you do.	Ako ti uradiš.
And it is.	I jeste.
But he was here now.	Ali sada je bio ovdje.
There is talk of it.	Priča se o tome.
I ask who is ready to do it	Pitam ko je spreman da to uradi
As she knew.	Kako je znala.
I want to talk to you about it	Želim razgovarati s tobom o tome
That's bad.	To je loše.
I guess he didn't have to go	Pretpostavljam da nije morao da ide
I didn't know you were going to be	Nisam znala da ćeš biti
The new code should do everything you need.	Novi kod bi trebao učiniti sve što vam treba.
Which wasn't long.	Što nije bilo dugo.
I know exactly how this is played	Znam tačno kako se ovo igra
I'm not ready for that.	Nisam spreman za to.
I shouldn't have loved this	Nisam trebao da volim ovo
I want it again	Želim to ponovo
Which it may have been.	Što je možda i bilo.
There is too much if this happens.	Ima previše toga ako se ovo dešava.
So much for power.	Toliko o moći.
He must have known that.	On je to sigurno znao.
I didn't even see him	Nisam ga ni vidio
And so far, so good.	I do sada, tako dobro.
I'm pretty sure you know too.	Prilično sam siguran da i ti znaš.
What is.	Šta je.
Maybe you say.	Možda kažeš.
We seem to be doing well.	Čini se da nam ide dobro.
I thought it would all come to me.	Mislio sam da će sve doći do mene.
I never knew there were so many.	Nikada nisam znao da ga ima toliko.
I know exactly who you are	Znam tačno ko si
You're not sure.	Nisi siguran.
He is ready for it.	On je spreman za to.
And we have.	I imamo.
She knew what she wanted to say, but she didn't say it.	Znala je šta želi da kaže, ali nije to rekla.
That's us.	To smo mi.
That will be seen.	To će se vidjeti.
Let someone come.	Da neko dođe.
There, but not there, so to speak.	Tamo, ali ne tamo, da tako kažem.
It was very strong.	Bilo je jako jako.
I really didn't know why	Zaista nisam znao zašto
Work harder.	Radi više.
I thought, but I wanted to say it	Mislio sam, ali htio sam to reći
I have more to say.	Imam još za reći.
I think so.	Mislim i jeste.
I wouldn't, maybe not tonight	Ne bih, možda ne večeras
I did it really badly	Uradio sam to zaista loše
Neither did I.	Nisam ni ja.
There was one car.	Bio je jedan auto.
I have a good reason for that	Imam dobar razlog za to
I wonder a lot about that.	Pitam se mnogo o tome.
He couldn't be here.	Nije mogao biti ovdje.
I didn't want any of that	Nisam htela ništa od toga
But today and only today.	Ali danas i samo danas.
I just love you.	Samo te volim.
They were actually there.	Oni su zapravo bili tamo.
Just a few years.	Samo nekoliko godina.
And this was true.	I ovo je bila istina.
If she wasn't there, he had a problem.	Ako ona nije bila tu, on je imao problem.
That was my day.	To je bio moj dan.
But no one would see that.	Ali niko to ne bi video.
I promised to come back	Obećao sam da ću se vratiti
No, not very often.	Ne, ne baš često.
I really love you so much	Zaista te puno volim
He saw nothing.	Nije video ništa.
I haven't for a while	Nisam već neko vrijeme
I just want to ask you	Samo želim da te pitam
The problem is, he's never been here before.	Problem je što nikad prije nije bio ovdje.
I know that's not what you were looking for	Znam da to nije ono što si tražio
And now this has to happen.	A sada se ovo mora dogoditi.
I am very happy.	Ja sam veoma sretan.
I hope that's okay with you	Nadam se da ti je to u redu
I wonder what he thinks	Pitam se šta on misli
And that was too much for him.	I to je bilo previše za njega.
We are still on it.	Još uvijek smo na tome.
I didn't know what to do with me	Nisam znao šta da radim sa mnom
I know that now more than ever	Sada to znam više nego ikada ranije
I saw what you looked like.	Video sam kako izgledaš.
You loved her.	Voleo si je.
I never see him again	Nikad ga više ne vidim
I really liked that she didn't say that	Zaista sam volio da to nije rekla
I like the way it looks	Sviđa mi se kako izgleda
This is what you want.	Ovo je ono što želiš.
But that's hard to say.	Ali to je teško reći.
That was for sure.	To je bilo sigurno.
That was never very likely.	To nikada nije bilo vrlo vjerovatno.
I think he already knew	Mislim da je već znao
But really nothing more.	Ali zaista ništa više.
But not everything is that simple.	Ali nije sve tako jednostavno.
I know them very well	Znam ih jako dobro
That's not something you'll know.	To nije nešto što ćeš znati.
I guess he did it again	Pretpostavljam da je to ponovo radio
That makes too many of us look bad.	Zbog toga previše nas izgleda loše.
I probably started without being ready enough	Vjerovatno sam počeo a da nisam bio dovoljno spreman
And it works.	I radi.
He never said that.	Nikad to nije rekao.
I would like more than that	Želio bih više od toga
I just want to see them	Samo želim da ih vidim
I wasn't my own at all	Nisam uopšte bio svoj
You don't want to know about it.	Ne želite da znate za to.
I know that looks bad	Znam da to izgleda loše
I wouldn't be here today	Ne bih bio ovdje danas
I think we can do it	Mislim da to možemo
I've never told you that before	Nikad ti to ranije nisam rekao
Not much more than that.	Ne mnogo više od toga.
He will tell us for a few years	Nekoliko godina će nam reći
I want to do this job.	Želim da radim ovaj posao.
He's yours and you probably know he's yours.	On je tvoj i verovatno znaš da je tvoj.
But not yet.	Ali ne još.
I hope very soon.	Nadam se vrlo brzo.
It happens from time to time.	To se dešava s vremena na vrijeme.
I asked someone why	Pitao sam nekoga zašto
I had no idea what to do or say	Nisam imao pojma šta da radim ili kažem
I should have told you all this myself	Trebao sam ti sve ovo sam reći
He said he was busy.	Rekao je da je zauzet.
I had to see them again	Morao sam ih ponovo vidjeti
I hope it's for you	Nadam se da je za tebe
I had time for myself	Imao sam vremena za sebe
I never said that enough	Nikad to nisam dovoljno rekao
And it wasn't all that bad.	I nije sve bilo tako loše.
This had to be him.	Ovo je morao biti on.
Can be.	Može biti.
I think it could be something	Mislim da bi moglo biti nešto
Tell us why.	Reci nam zašto.
I can't see him now.	Ne mogu da ga vidim sada.
And he's right.	I u pravu je.
It's not even that.	Nije čak ni to.
I thought you might be tired	Mislio sam da si možda umoran
I told him what was true.	Rekao sam mu šta je tačno.
That's not a good time.	To nije dobro vrijeme.
I would get there.	Stigao bih tamo.
Everything works well.	Sve radi dobro.
I immediately decided it wasn’t for me.	Odmah sam odlučio da to nije za mene.
It's just like that.	To je jednostavno tako.
But we are not where we should be.	Ali nismo tamo gdje smo trebali biti.
But we are the ones who need to do it.	Ali mi smo ti koji to treba da uradimo.
I couldn't trust anyone	Nisam mogao nikome vjerovati
You will find us there.	Tamo ćete nas naći.
I finished this without a problem	Ovo sam završio bez problema
He tells me everything.	On mi sve govori.
I saw what happened	Video sam šta se dogodilo
It is usually more than enough.	Obično je više nego dovoljno.
I have done that.	Uradio sam to.
It's a bad time.	Loše je vrijeme.
Just a little .	Samo malo .
We can now.	Možemo sada.
You would love him.	Voleo bi ga.
I am sure.	Ja sam siguran.
Nothing to say.	Ništa za reći.
You do not know.	Ne znaš.
Or you need a lot of time.	Ili vam treba puno vremena.
A little further, she told herself	Malo dalje, rekla je sebi
I think we have a problem	Mislim da imamo problem
It was here, she knew it.	Bilo je ovdje, znala je to.
I saw how it was.	Video sam kako je.
I expected you to say what you did	Očekivao sam da ćeš reći šta si uradio
It works for me.	To mi radi.
And a car.	I auto.
It should have been.	Trebalo je biti.
No one has seen it done this way.	Niko nije vidio da se to radi na ovaj način.
No money.	Bez novca.
But not everything is like that.	Ali, nije sve tako.
You really don't have to know.	Vi zaista ne morate znati.
I hope to see him again soon	Nadam se da ću ga uskoro ponovo vidjeti
Do it for us, you know.	Uradite za nas, znate.
I've had enough	Bilo mi je dosta toga
I just don't know what you say you know.	Samo ne znam šta kažeš da znaš.
I hope you will help us.	Nadam se da ćete nam pomoći.
That is not exactly true.	To baš i nije tačno.
I knew it was	Znao sam da jeste
And he wants everyone to know that.	I želi da svi to znaju.
But there is something else.	Ali, postoji još nešto.
It usually doesn't work that way.	Obično ne ide tako.
I guess that was good	Pretpostavljam da je to bilo dobro
Can someone tell me exactly what he meant?	Može li mi neko reći šta je tačno mislio?
But this.	Ali ovo.
That was not for me.	To nije bilo za mene.
I did more than I could	Uradio sam više nego što sam mogao
I can say he doesn't know what to think	Mogu reći da ne zna šta da misli
I didn’t say anything and just left	Nisam ništa rekao i jednostavno sam otišao
I wish I had it.	Voleo bih da ga imam.
I wish it was, but it wasn't	Voleo bih da jeste, ali nije
You don't know either.	Ni ti ne znaš.
I knew it wouldn't be long	Znao sam da neće dugo
It's not difficult at all.	Uopšte nije teško.
Which is .	Koji je .
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
I still want to be with you	I dalje želim biti s tobom
I think you should know that	Mislim da bi to trebao znati
He asked for a meeting.	Tražio je sastanak.
There was more.	Bilo je još toga.
He was at home.	Bio je kod kuće.
Besides, you can't do anything at home.	Osim toga, ne možete ništa da radite kod kuće.
It's just me.	Samo sam ja.
What better way.	Koji bolji način.
You don't want him to be afraid of that.	Ne želite da se on toga boji.
You didn't do anything wrong.	Niste uradili ništa loše.
No, that wasn't it.	Ne, nije to bilo to.
This may or may not be what you want.	Ovo može ili ne mora biti ono što želite.
I've been here for a while.	Ovdje sam već neko vrijeme.
I guess you know that	Pretpostavljam da to znaš
I won't tell you anymore	Neću ti više reći
He had no idea what to say.	Nije imao pojma šta bi trebao reći.
Don't do that.	Ne radite to.
I haven't decided what to do	Nisam odlučio šta da radim
It was just this.	Bilo je samo ovo.
myself or me.	sebe ili mene.
He knew.	On je znao.
I don't know why she told you that.	Ne znam zašto ti je to rekla.
I think it must be okay	Mislim da mora biti u redu
I know what it's like	Znam kako je to
It is not clear why this should not have been done.	Ne vidi se zašto to nije trebalo učiniti.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
We knew he was here.	Znali smo da je ovdje.
But that, apparently, was not enough.	Ali to, očigledno, nije bilo dovoljno.
I need that now.	To mi treba sada.
I thought you understood that	Mislio sam da si to shvatio
Looks like we did something he couldn't.	Izgleda da smo uradili nešto što on nije mogao.
I made them myself	Napravio sam ih sam
I brought him back.	Vratio sam ga.
Please tell me what you think.	Molim te reci mi šta misliš.
I didn't ask him anything	Nisam ga ništa pitao
And they will soon.	I oni to uskoro.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
I'm really happy.	Zaista sam sretan.
Not with me this time.	Ne kod mene ovaj put.
I just needed to get to you	Samo sam trebao doći do tebe
But now he knew the truth.	Ali sada je znao istinu.
I should tell him not to	Trebao bih mu reći da to ne radi
To say what he has to say	Da kaže šta ima da kaže
But it doesn't work very well.	Ali ne radi baš.
And so he came home.	I tako je došao kući.
I didn’t think it could be better than that	Nisam mislio da može biti bolje od toga
It could have been us.	To smo mogli biti mi.
That's the good thing.	To je ono dobro.
I hope you are	Nadam se da jesi
They could be anywhere.	Mogli bi biti bilo gdje.
I would hate to see that.	Ne bih voleo da to vidim.
I wish nothing good came of it.	Voleo bih da ti ništa dobro ne dođe.
I had to do it	Morao sam to uraditi
But that will not be enough.	Ali to neće biti dovoljno.
I told you the truth	Rekao sam ti istinu
It’s not that you were really completely alone.	Nije da ste zaista bili potpuno sami.
I know how it's done.	Znam kako se to radi.
I couldn't say that for myself	Ne bih to mogao reći za sebe
I have to be something	Moram biti nešto
I want him right here	Želim ga upravo ovdje
She lives here.	Ona živi ovde.
But it's not just those things.	Ali nisu to samo te stvari.
It was not so much what he saw as what he did not see.	Nije bilo toliko ono što je vidio koliko ono što nije vidio.
I doubt that's happening	Sumnjam da se to dešava
But I have something to do earlier	Ali imam nešto da radim ranije
I didn't think it was from him	Nisam mislio da je od njega
I know he will	Znam da hoće
I thought he had you	Mislio sam da te ima
I was right.	Bio sam u pravu.
He doesn't do the job.	On ne radi posao.
Here at my place.	Ovdje kod mene.
It can be difficult.	Može biti teško.
None of that happened.	Ništa od toga se nije dogodilo.
We are not like you.	Mi nismo kao ti.
But enough about what is.	Ali dosta o tome šta je.
I didn't want to do that	Nisam htela to da uradim
But it's not.	Ali nije.
It was almost one.	Bio je skoro jedan.
Do you say that?	Da li to kažeš.
You did a good job.	Uradio si dobar posao.
That he is not too tired.	Da nije previše umoran.
But someone did.	Ali neko jeste.
Everything is fine.	Sve je dobro.
I hope you find time for yourself now	Nadam se da ćeš sada naći vremena za sebe
We both know that.	Oboje to znamo.
I almost didn't want to leave anymore	Skoro da više nisam htio otići
I know how much time you have	Znam koliko imaš vremena
I have to work.	Moram da radim.
I just wanted to go to dinner	Samo sam htela da idem na večeru
I haven't seen it before	Nisam to ranije vidio
She knew it wouldn't be easy.	Znala je da neće biti lako.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I did the job.	Uradio sam posao.
And now we know there is a better way.	A sada znamo da postoji bolji način.
I do things the right way	Radim stvari na pravi način
And it should come to things quickly.	I trebalo bi brzo doći do stvari.
I have help for you.	Imam ti pomoć.
And that would be it.	I to bi bio.
But it was, for both of us.	Ali to je bilo, za nas oboje.
Now, not so much.	Sada, ne toliko.
I have it here	Imam ga ovdje
I had to do what needed to be done	Morao sam da uradim ono što je trebalo da se uradi
I just needed to be sure, that's all	Samo sam trebao biti siguran, to je sve
I know what you're not	Znam šta nisi
The team is happy.	Tim je sretan.
I could never tell anyone about him	Nikad nikome nisam mogao reći za njega
I did that too.	I ja sam to uradio.
That is much better than nothing.	To je mnogo bolje nego ništa.
I won't do this again	Neću ovo više raditi
There is something else.	Ima još nešto.
I don't know for sure.	Ne znam sigurno.
There seemed to be nothing wrong with that.	Činilo se da u tome nije ništa loše.
Such a good game.	Tako dobra igra.
It's money.	To je novac.
A way to see them	Način da ih se vidi
It looks better with more money	Bolje izgleda sa više novca
I know a lot from you	Znam od tebe mnogo
I thought he wanted better	Mislio sam da želi bolje
I had no idea you were here	Nisam imao pojma da si ovde
I heard what you said	Čuo sam šta si rekao
He wasn't sure why.	Nije bio siguran zašto.
I didn’t want to go back to the party	Nisam se htio vratiti na zabavu
I never told anyone	Nikad nikome nisam rekao
I saw no one and nothing	Nisam vidio nikoga i ništa
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
She knew what had happened.	Znala je šta se dogodilo.
I'm really sorry about that.	Stvarno mi je žao zbog toga.
I'm not sure about that.	Nisam siguran u to.
It is OK.	U redu je.
But he was ready.	Ali bio je spreman.
He did three things.	Učinio je tri stvari.
I expected too much from you	Očekivao sam previše od tebe
I wondered if that was so	Pitao sam se da li je to tako
But we know.	Ali znamo.
I just tried.	Upravo sam pokušao.
I could talk about anything.	Mogao sam razgovarati o bilo čemu.
I worked on it.	Radio sam na tome.
But it's good to be with him today.	Ali dobro je što si danas s njim.
I bought a car yesterday.	Kupio sam auto juče.
You know what, no.	Znaš šta, ne.
That was really a problem.	To je zaista bio problem.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
I still have that problem	I dalje imam taj problem
I couldn't help it, really	Nisam mogao pomoći, zaista
I think it's bad.	Mislim da je loše.
I can only hope you will too	Mogu samo da se nadam da ćeš i ti
I have no idea how it works	Nemam pojma kako to radi
Everything was like that.	Sve je bilo tako.
And nothing needs to be done.	I ništa ne treba da se radi.
I'm fine now.	Sada sam dobro.
This is you now.	Ovo si ti sada.
Few days.	Nekoliko dana.
I like a good job	Sviđa mi se dobar posao
Everything is fine with him.	Sve je u redu sa njim.
He obviously was.	Očigledno je bio.
No one has understood yet.	Niko još nije shvatio.
I have to tell the truth	Moram reći istinu
And he was obviously at the party.	I on je očigledno bio na zabavi.
To be able to do that.	Da bi to mogao.
I think that's a good idea	Mislim da je to dobra ideja
I can give you anything you want	Mogu ti dati sve što želiš
There was a lot to see.	Bilo je mnogo toga za vidjeti.
She was good.	Bila je dobra.
I mean I'm just really going.	Mislim samo stvarno idem.
I couldn't say why, exactly.	Ne bih mogao reći zašto, tačno.
But apparently there was someone in the house.	Ali očigledno je bilo nekoga u kući.
They certainly wouldn't tell him.	Sigurno mu ne bi rekli.
He needed her to need him.	Trebao mu je da ona treba njega.
We are more than that.	Mi smo više od toga.
There were problems.	Bilo je problema.
I think she would be	Mislim da bi bila
The truth was he couldn't leave.	Istina je bila da nije mogao otići.
I never promised him anything	Nikad mu ništa nisam obećao
I was glad I still had a job	Bilo mi je drago što još uvijek imam posao
I wouldn't say.	Ne bi rekao.
That's what he meant.	Na to je mislio.
I decided not to tell you anything	Odlučio sam da ti ništa ne kažem
That's a really good question.	To je stvarno dobro pitanje.
He decided to work.	Odlučio je da radi.
That day is still one of.	Taj dan je i dalje jedan od.
I haven't told him anything yet	Nisam mu još ništa rekao
It was a job.	Bio je to posao.
I didn't know what it was	Nisam znao šta je to
That's bad for everyone.	To je loše za sve.
It's me.	To sam ja.
It was very, very difficult for me.	Bilo mi je veoma, veoma teško.
I didn't want to stay here at all	Uopšte nisam želio ostati ovdje
Three weeks ago.	Prije tri sedmice.
And now it has happened.	I sada se to dogodilo.
I can already tell what it's about.	Već mogu reći o čemu se radi.
We do not know.	Ne znamo.
Even more than that.	Čak i više od toga.
I mean, look what's going on	Mislim, vidi šta se dešava
I didn't mean those things	Nisam mislio na te stvari
I couldn't believe it was him	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je to on
He was fine.	Bio je dobro.
He will always be there	Uvijek će biti tu
I wasn't my own.	Nisam bio svoj.
I never know what he's going to do	Nikad ne znam šta će da uradi
But it's not just that.	Ali, nije samo to.
I understood what you understood	Shvatio sam šta si ti shvatio
I'm sure he can help you	Siguran sam da ti može pomoći
I didn't even know why	Nisam čak ni znao zašto
She doesn't want you.	Ona te ne želi.
I really wanted to know	Stvarno sam htio znati
He'll be home soon.	Uskoro će doći kući.
He didn't want this.	Nije želio ovo.
I had no money	Nisam imao novca
But not much help.	Ali nema puno pomoći.
I should be happy now.	Trebao bih sada biti sretan.
It was better for me to be alone	Bilo mi je bolje da sam sam
More soon.	Više uskoro.
I had time.	Imao sam vremena.
He wants to be something.	On želi da bude nešto.
He didn't say yes, but he didn't say no.	Nije rekao da, ali nije rekao ne.
Maybe that's why.	Možda je to zbog toga.
I know you wanted that	Znam da si to htela
Not so good.	Ni tako dobro.
He didn't start talking right away.	Nije odmah počeo da govori.
I want you very much	Želim te jako jako
I saw them together.	Video sam ih zajedno.
I didn't want him at all	Nisam ga uopšte htela
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I'm not sure how we're going to do that.	Nisam siguran kako ćemo to uraditi.
I won't tell him anything	Neću mu ništa reći
I have no idea what to do	Nemam pojma šta da radim
I already told you.	Već sam ti rekao.
We always will.	Uvek ćemo.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
That never happened again.	To se nikada više nije dogodilo.
But, the reason.	Ali, razlog.
I never heard or saw anyone	Nisam nikoga ni čuo ni vidio
I thought you could tell me not to go	Mislio sam da bi mi mogao reći da ne idem
It just speaks to itself.	To jednostavno govori samo sebi.
It works for very little.	Radi za vrlo malo.
I felt sorry for him, really.	Bilo mi ga je žao, zaista.
He couldn't be his own.	Nije mogao biti svoj.
I couldn't say	Ne bih mogao reći
I didn't expect this	Nisam očekivao ovo
I did this and it works.	Uradio sam ovo i radi.
I think everyone knows	Mislim da svi znaju
No one would do that.	Niko to ne bi uradio.
What you say goes.	Ono što kažeš ide.
He came.	Došao je.
I'm sorry this has to be done.	Žao mi je što se to mora uraditi.
I went back to work.	Vratio sam se na posao.
But they couldn't.	Ali nisu mogli.
That is not what we do.	To nije ono što mi radimo.
That's your job.	To je tvoj posao.
I've never heard of anyone having that problem.	Nikada nisam čuo da neko ima taj problem.
It will be easy now.	Sada će biti lako.
I have to go now, I'm working	Moram da idem sada, radim
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
And that someone is us.	A taj neko smo mi.
Anyone can help me.	Bilo ko mi može pomoći.
Or more like one and a half.	Ili više kao jedan i po.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
I will never know what it was.	Nikad neću znati šta je to bilo.
I didn't really know.	Zapravo nisam znao.
I knew why he did it	Znao sam zašto je to uradio
I decided.	Odlučio sam.
Now it seems to be working well.	Sada se čini da radi dobro.
I hope your business is going well	Nadam se da vam posao ide dobro
That should be enough.	Trebalo bi biti dovoljno.
He shouldn't have known.	Nije trebao znati.
I hope it's good	Nadam se da je dobro
I didn't do it today	Nisam to uradio danas
It took a while.	Trebalo je malo vremena.
I could have gone there	Mogao sam otići tamo
I can't let you do it alone.	Ne mogu ti dozvoliti da to uradiš sam.
It should be fine.	Trebalo bi biti u redu.
I had no idea what it was about	Nisam imao pojma o čemu se radi
It's not happening.	Ne dešava se.
You saw it too.	I ti si to vidio.
But I decided.	Ali ja sam odlučio.
I gave him some money	Dao sam mu nešto novca
I didn't know he had it	Nisam znao da ga ima
It took me a while to do that.	Za to mi je trebalo neko vrijeme.
It can do a lot, but nothing really good.	Može mnogo, ali ništa stvarno dobro.
But it is true.	Ali to je istina.
Just tell me.	Samo mi reci.
I just wasn’t into it	Jednostavno nisam bio u tome
And maybe it could still be.	A možda bi i dalje moglo biti.
I started next week	Počeo sam sljedeće sedmice
Anyone could have them.	Bilo ko ih je mogao.
Not sure if it will help you.	Nisam siguran da li će vam pomoći.
I felt sorry for them	Bilo mi ih je žao
I know what's going on here	Znam šta se ovde dešava
I know you didn't want to come back	Znam da se nisi htela vratiti
We can't find her.	Ne možemo je naći.
I was happy to get my car back	Bio sam sretan što sam vratio svoj auto
I just wanted to help	Samo sam htio pomoći
We both knew the truth.	Oboje smo znali istinu.
I really should go home.	Stvarno bih trebao ići kući.
I could never be like you	Nikad ne bih mogao biti kao ti
I guess that's really it	Pretpostavljam da je to zaista to
I wouldn't like anything else	Ništa više ne bih volio
I thought he was the one	Mislio sam da je on taj
But other than that, she was fine.	Ali osim toga, bila je dobro.
I have to bring her back	Moram je vratiti
I do.	Ja to radim.
He doesn't love you.	Ne voli te.
But he wouldn't.	Ali on ne bi.
And now he's gone.	A sada ga nema.
But it wasn't up to me.	Ali to nije bilo do mene.
He had never seen that before.	To nikada ranije nije video.
I would never tell you how good she is.	Nikad ti ne bi rekla koliko je dobra.
I haven't seen her many times	Nisam je vidio mnogo puta
I think she's the problem.	Mislim da je ona problem.
I wanted them home too.	I ja sam ih htio kući.
This is for you.	Ovo je za tebe.
I had no idea what to do	Nisam imao pojma šta da radim
This is not the only way to do it.	Ovo nije jedini način da se to uradi.
It's pretty easy.	To je prilično lako.
There really was nothing to do.	Zaista nije bilo šta da se uradi.
He couldn't help himself.	Nije si mogao pomoći.
Everyone.	Svi.
But no one would know about it.	Ali niko ne bi znao za to.
I just know it can be done	Samo znam da se to može
I'm not sure what to do or say	Nisam siguran šta da radim ili kažem
I'm telling you, he was there.	Kažem ti, bio je tamo.
There seemed to be.	Činilo se da ima.
But it doesn't seem to work.	Ali izgleda da ne radi.
She knew exactly what she wanted	Tačno je znala šta želi
I know you won't believe me	Znam da mi nećeš vjerovati
Everything was as it was.	Sve je bilo kako je bilo.
She told me.	Ona mi je rekla.
He should be doing better.	Trebalo bi da mu ide bolje.
I should ask you the following	Trebalo bi da vas pitam sljedeće
He can't help anyone now.	On sada nikome ne može pomoći.
He would go, and he went.	On bi otišao, i otišao je.
They are not alone.	Oni nisu sami.
I would buy them again	Kupio bih ih ponovo
I almost felt sorry for him	Skoro mi ga je bilo žao
He said he would leave, but he did not leave.	Rekao je da će otići, ali nije otišao.
So it doesn’t look like they’re still there.	Tako da ne izgleda kao da su još tamo.
I think you are what you are	Mislim da si ono što jesi
I totally like it	Potpuno mi se sviđa
They used to be.	Nekada su.
He wouldn't have asked a few years ago	Prije nekoliko godina ne bi pitao
I'll know if he did it or not	Ja ću znati da li je to uradio ili ne
I have no doubt about this	Ne sumnjam u ovo
We can do it.	Mi to možemo.
That's not my problem.	To nije moj problem.
Why would they do that? 	Zašto bi to uradili?
he asked.	pitao.
I can't go back now	Ne mogu se sada vratiti
I love you very much	Volim te jako puno
I had no idea how to do it	Nisam imao pojma kako da to uradim
I will not do that.	Neću to učiniti.
He had no idea what was going on.	Nije imao pojma šta se dešava.
I think we'll do this	Mislim da ćemo ovo uraditi
I had to do it this way	Morao sam to uraditi na ovaj način
I didn't have anyone anymore	Nisam više imao nikoga
I know it will be soon	Znam da će to biti uskoro
I wish that hadn't happened	Voleo bih da se to nije dogodilo
But that is exactly the problem.	Ali upravo to je problem.
But no one came to the door.	Ali niko nije došao na vrata.
It seems to be going well.	Čini se da ide dobro.
She and she.	Ona i ona.
I have seen this happen many times.	Video sam da se ovo dešava mnogo puta.
I think you are absolutely right.	Mislim da si potpuno u pravu.
He looks alone.	On izgleda sam.
I want to trust him	Želim mu vjerovati
No one was there.	Niko nije bio tamo.
Nobody would want that.	Niko to ne bi želeo.
She has to do everything herself.	Sve mora sama.
Just to plan something.	Samo da nešto planira.
I can do things for you	Mogu da uradim stvari za tebe
I wouldn't be like them	Ne bih bio kao oni
But that's the problem.	Ali to je problem.
There are problems.	Ima problema.
I loved my life there	Voleo sam svoj život tamo
I haven't had them in a long time, just a few years	Nisam ih imao dugo, samo nekoliko godina
I'm really sorry about that	Zaista mi je žao zbog toga
I know you know that	Znam da to znaš
I had to be that something	Morao sam biti to nešto
He would be ready for it.	Bio bi spreman za to.
It only works the first time.	Radi samo prvi put.
It is OK.	U redu je.
Indeed, nothing seemed.	Zaista, ništa se nije činilo.
I love him and he loves me	Volim njega i on voli mene
She was alone, as before.	Bila je sama, kao i prije.
I want to be happy.	Ja želim biti sretan.
I wondered what was going on	Pitao sam se šta se dešava
I've never done that before.	Nikada to ranije nisam radio.
There must be.	Mora da ima.
The only way.	Jedini način.
I decided.	Odlučio sam.
If he was going to do this, he had to do it.	Ako će ovo da uradi, morao je to da uradi.
This is a new problem.	Ovo je novi problem.
I've never been, not really	Nikad nisam bio, ne baš
This has never been a problem.	Ovo nikada nije bio problem.
I didn't know he was back	Nisam znao da se vratio
I am here to work for you	Ovdje sam da radim za vas
I won't do it again	Neću to ponovo da radim
Or just see me.	Ili vidi samo mene.
I could do that	Mogao sam to da uradim
I didn't mean them	Nisam ih mislio
I wish you were here with me	Voleo bih da si ovde sa mnom
He didn't get them.	Nije ih dobio.
It was a difficult time.	To je bilo teško vrijeme.
I really didn't expect that	Zaista to nisam očekivao
I know where they are.	Znam gdje su.
I can see them.	Mogu ih vidjeti.
I didn't know what to do	Nisam znao šta da radim
Unless you can't do without.	Osim ako ne možeš bez.
I could help you	Mogao bih ti pomoći
Something like that, yes.	Tako nešto, da.
I didn't expect anything	Nisam očekivao ništa
It's simple.	To je jednostavno.
I just didn't want to say anything	Samo nisam htio ništa reći
I'm sorry I said anything	Žao mi je što sam bilo šta rekao
I wouldn't get anything.	Ne bih ništa dobio.
But nothing happened to me.	Ali ništa mi se nije dogodilo.
And that should be it.	I toga bi trebalo biti.
It's hard for me with that.	Teško mi je s tim.
I need to see her again	Moram da je vidim ponovo
He could have said that.	Mogao je to reći.
But for now, he seems to be a good guy.	Ali za sada se čini da je dobar momak.
I should have told you	Trebao sam ti reći
I've never seen her before	Nikad je ranije nisam video
I wouldn't do that.	Ja to ne bih uradio.
I hope they are helpful to you	Nadam se da su vam od pomoći
I see I still know	Vidim da još znam
I can't go on.	Ne mogu dalje.
I see why you did it	Vidim zašto si to uradio
I know this wasn't easy for you	Znam da ti ovo nije bilo lako
He told us that no one came to his door.	Rekao nam je da mu niko nije došao na vrata.
Maybe you're right.	Možda si u pravu.
I have no problem with that at all.	Uopšte nemam problema sa tim.
Even the only true friend.	Čak i jedini pravi prijatelj.
It was so bad.	Tako je bilo loše.
I just want to be my own	Samo želim da budem svoj
Right there.	Baš tamo.
Not so today.	Danas nije tako.
I should say something	Trebao bih nešto reći
Neither is she, true.	Nije ni ona, istina.
None of that happened.	Ništa od toga se nije dogodilo.
That's what we did.	Tako smo i uradili.
It shouldn’t be that hard.	To ne bi trebalo biti tako teško.
But this is so difficult.	Ali ovo je tako teško.
He can't, he can't, he can't.	Ne može, ne može, ne može.
I was glad he still lives there	Bilo mi je drago što on još uvijek živi tamo
I would do that.	Ja bih to uradio.
And these.	I ove.
But there was no one.	Ali nije bilo nikoga.
We don't even know what he looked like.	Ne znamo ni kako je izgledao.
He couldn't find anything.	Nije mogao naći ništa.
We're doing really well.	Zaista nam dobro ide.
I knew it wasn't going to happen	Znao sam da se to neće dogoditi
He left a lot.	Mnogo je otišao.
I'm sure there were problems	Siguran sam da je bilo problema
My father left again.	Moj otac je ponovo otišao.
I really think we'll be together again soon	Zaista mislim da ćemo uskoro ponovo biti zajedno
I will be everything to you	Ja ću biti sve za tebe
That is what is happening here.	To je ono što se ovdje dešava.
I can not tell you.	Ne mogu ti reći.
Obviously it is.	Očigledno jeste.
I had to move on	Morao sam ići dalje
I got it.	Shvatio sam to.
It's all something.	To je sve nešto.
I didn't know there was so much	Nisam znao da ima toliko toga
I wouldn't want to do that.	Ne bih to želio da radim.
This just doesn't look right.	Ovo jednostavno ne izgleda u redu.
We are all good.	Svi smo dobro.
He knows more than us.	On zna više od nas.
I have a problem.	Imam problem.
They all said no.	Svi su rekli ne.
She goes.	Ona ide.
I didn't think it was me	Nisam mislio da sam to ja
He didn't just say that.	On to nije samo rekao.
I tried again	Pokušao sam ponovo
I just knew it was	Samo sam znala da jeste
I'm happy to have him here	Sretan sam što ga imam ovdje
But now it can't be helped.	Ali sada se ne može pomoći.
I've never done that	Nikada to nisam radio
Isn't that something? 	Zar to nije nešto?
It was a little too much.	Bilo je malo previše.
I don't see you here.	Ne vidim te ovdje.
I say no, he doesn't.	Ja kažem ne, on nema.
There are many things we do not know.	Ima mnogo toga što ne znamo.
I didn't even understand	Nisam ni shvatio
Maybe he was the father.	Možda je on bio otac.
I can't say if he knows	Ne mogu reći da li zna
This was too much.	Ovo je bilo previše.
I didn't have to work.	Nisam morao da radim.
You are alone.	Ti si sam.
Maybe he thought he was doing the right thing.	Možda je mislio da radi pravu stvar.
He's here, and he really has something on it.	Ovdje je, i on stvarno ima nešto na tome.
I've seen all this	Vidio sam sve ovo
But it wasn't a game.	Ali to nije bila igra.
I like life.	Sviđa mi se život.
Or anytime, really.	Ili bilo koga, zaista.
We all know this by now.	Svi znamo ovo do sada.
I think he was right	Mislim da je bio u pravu
Don't do these things.	Ne radite ove stvari.
There were no people.	Nije bilo ljudi.
I guess this is true	Pretpostavljam da je ovo istina
As if it could be anyone.	Kao da bi to mogao biti bilo ko.
I was none of that	Nisam bio ništa od toga
She knew too much.	Znala je previše.
I decided he was right	Odlučio sam da je u pravu
Maybe it's just me.	Možda sam samo ja.
I don't know how long you'll stay here.	Ne znam koliko dugo ćeš ostati ovdje.
If only he was with me now.	Da je samo sada sa mnom.
Several times tonight.	Nekoliko puta večeras.
I am thirty years old	Ja imam trideset godina
I think that says a few things.	Mislim da to govori nekoliko stvari.
I couldn't let that happen	Nisam to mogao dozvoliti
But he will have to say that.	Ali on će to morati da kaže.
I'm tired now.	Sada sam umoran.
Who said so good so far, but now you are alone.	Ko je rekao do sada tako dobro, ali sada ste sami.
He was with me.	Bio je sa mnom.
I would never do anything to you	Nikad ti ništa ne bih uradio
I can't do anything more than that	Ne mogu ništa više od toga
I didn't have that much time	Nisam imao toliko vremena
I want to go with you	Želim da idem sa tobom
I couldn't do that to him.	Nisam mogao to da mu uradim.
I haven't heard much about it.	Nisam čuo puno o tome.
But it seems to me that this is not the right path.	Ali čini mi se da to nije pravi put.
I thought it was you	Mislio sam da si to ti
I want to be as far away as possible.	Želim da budem što dalje.
I hope it will be good	Nadam se da će biti dobro
Besides, he saw.	Osim toga, vidio je.
I want to say something	Želim nešto reći
I didn't want this for you	Nisam želeo ovo za tebe
I really can't tell you why	Zaista vam ne mogu reći zašto
I love you very much	Volim te jako puno
That is actually true.	To je zapravo istina.
I can't say what it is	Ne mogu reći šta je to
You must be too.	Mora da si i ti.
I could be yours, if you want	Mogao bih biti tvoj, ako želiš
If anyone can help me.	Ako mi neko može pomoći.
Now he got it.	Sada je dobio.
I wanted to help a little	Htio sam malo pomoći
It will never get in my way.	Nikad mi neće doći na put.
I wondered now what would happen to me	Pitao sam se sada šta će biti sa mnom
Nice to see you too.	I tebe je drago vidjeti.
I've had enough	Bilo mi je dosta toga
I hope this is helpful.	Nadam se da je ovo od pomoći.
People won't believe me.	Ljudi mi neće vjerovati.
I was to see her.	Bio sam da je vidim.
But she knew she had to tell him.	Ali znala je da mu mora reći.
I want to tell you even more	Želim vam reći još više
He had never done that before.	Nikada ranije to nije radio.
Maybe she doesn't know how.	Možda ona ne zna kako.
I have to see him today	Moram ga vidjeti danas
We are happy to help!.	Drago nam je što možemo pomoći!.
If you do, we will quickly.	Ako to uradite, brzo ćemo.
I knew what he was going to do	Znao sam šta će uraditi
I think we should go and see him	Mislim da bi trebali otići i vidjeti ga
I think he's better	Mislim da mu je bolje
He really didn't know what to do.	Zaista nije znao šta da radi.
But it doesn't work.	Ali ne radi.
Us, to sa, often.	Nas, do sa, često.
I can almost see her	Skoro da je vidim
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
And it could.	I to bi moglo.
And I knew all about it	I ja sam znao sve o tome
I can be there.	Mogu biti tamo.
He was the one.	On je bio taj.
We know how it goes.	Znamo kako ide.
We have to do this together.	Moramo ovo da uradimo zajedno.
I almost got it, I almost got it	Skoro sam dobio, skoro sam dobio
I'm glad you're better now.	Drago mi je da ti je sada bolje.
Maybe he'll do his job now.	Možda će sada raditi svoj posao.
I see everything about us	Vidim sve o nama
That way we are not doing anything at the moment.	Na taj način trenutno ništa ne radimo.
I really like her as a person	Zaista mi se sviđa kao osoba
And I really meant it	I ja sam to zaista mislio
Do it the way you want.	Uradite to na način na koji želite.
I don't think you may have ever loved me.	Mislim da me možda nikad nisi volio.
She didn't want to.	Nije htela.
I knew this was not going to be easy	Znao sam da ovo neće biti lako
I knew what he wanted.	Znao sam šta želi.
But no, nothing.	Ali ne, ništa.
And she said it.	I ona je to rekla.
I'll probably do it tomorrow	Verovatno ću to uraditi sutra
I don't know yet how	Ne znam još kako
And you can't just do that.	I ne možeš samo tako.
No problem.	Nije problem.
Everything must be fine.	Sve mora biti u redu.
This is what I have so far.	Ovo je ono što imam do sada.
I didn't see him there either	Nisam ga ni tamo vidio
And you know you've arrived.	I znaš da si stigao.
Not my problem.	Nije moj problem.
The problem still exists.	Problem i dalje postoji.
I want to know who they are.	Želim da znam ko su oni.
He couldn't do something like that.	On nije mogao da uradi tako nešto.
I thought he might have been surprised	Mislio sam da je možda bio iznenađen
Nobody wants to talk.	Niko ne želi da priča.
I was surprised at how easy it was	Bio sam iznenađen koliko je to bilo lako
I think that was a good idea	Mislim da je to bila dobra ideja
When it was.	Kada je to bilo.
That could be as early as next month.	To može biti već sljedećeg mjeseca.
It seems to be difficult for him.	Čini se da mu je to teško.
I never had it	Nikada ga nisam imao
Can it be .	Može li biti .
And here and there.	I tu i tamo.
It's like my father is here.	Kao da je moj otac ovdje.
I know you're mine	Znam da si moj
He saw it.	On je to video.
I wish it was earlier	Voleo bih da je to bilo ranije
I know what we're going to do tomorrow	Znam šta ćemo raditi sutra
You must return immediately.	Moraš se odmah vratiti.
Maybe it'll be better.	Možda će biti bolje.
I haven't seen you here	Nisam te vidio ovdje
He always does this.	Uvek radi ovo.
And that was it.	I to je bilo to.
I don't want to have anything to do with it.	Ne želim da imam ništa s tim.
Many times before.	Mnogo puta ranije.
I'm still working.	I dalje radim.
I knew why, too much had happened	Znao sam zašto, previše toga se dogodilo
I just wasn’t happy.	Jednostavno nisam bio sretan.
I'm fine with that.	U redu sam sa tim.
There has never been a problem until today.	Do danas nikada nije bilo problema.
I wonder who lives there now	Pitam se ko sada tamo živi
We had no idea they were there.	Nismo imali pojma da su tamo.
But we shouldn't.	Ali ne bismo trebali.
You're not her.	Ti nisi ona.
Maybe.	Možda.
I can't do that	Ne mogu s tim
He couldn't do that.	On to nije mogao da uradi.
I have to come home from time to time	Moram s vremena na vrijeme doći kući
I'm sorry about you too.	Žao mi je i tebe.
You don't even have to talk to me.	Ne moraš čak ni razgovarati sa mnom.
That made me feel better	Tako mi je bilo bolje
And he would get it.	I on bi to dobio.
I'm all for it too.	I ja sam za to.
Oh no.	O ne.
In fact, I didn't ask anyone	Zapravo, nisam nikoga pitao
On that day.	Na taj dan.
I have no doubt at all	Uopšte ne sumnjam
I know we can win this year	Znam da možemo pobijediti ove godine
I shouldn't have done that	Nisam to trebao učiniti
We did it.	Uradili smo to.
I didn’t want to do anything more with it	Nisam htio ništa više da radim s tim
I didn't want to say anything.	Nisam htela ništa da kažem.
I was too surprised	Bio sam previše iznenađen
I only know what you know.	Ja znam samo ono što ti znaš.
How can she help me? 	Kako mi ona može pomoći?
Do something bad.	Uradi nešto loše.
I guess that speaks for itself.	Pretpostavljam da to govori samo za sebe.
I can't do all this alone	Ne mogu sve ovo sam
And he was absolutely right.	I bio je potpuno u pravu.
But I just want it done	Ali samo želim da se to uradi
There are so many of them.	Toliko ih je.
We knew we had to go there.	Znali smo da moramo ići tamo.
You don't even know this.	Ti ni ne znaš ovo.
I'm the only one she says where she is.	Ja sam jedini koji ona govori gdje je.
I didn't even see it	Nisam ni vidio
So it can happen.	Tako da se to može dogoditi.
I would always ask for that	Uvijek bih to tražio
I hope not.	Nadam se da nećemo.
He gave him everything he had.	Dao mu je sve što je imao.
I haven't been there before	Nisam ranije bio tamo
He said you knew.	Rekao je da znaš.
I have to, you know that	Moram, znaš to
She said no.	Rekla je ne.
He himself wasn't sure.	On sam nije bio siguran.
He would say yes.	On bi rekao da.
I better do it now.	Bolje da to uradim sada.
I could tell him everything	Mogao sam mu sve reći
I was the reason for that	Ja sam bio razlog za to
She didn't want to eat.	Nije htela da jede.
It can't be that bad.	Ne može biti tako loše.
I just think all this is small	Samo mislim da je sve ovo malo
I was thinking about you.	Mislio sam na tebe.
I can’t really be with him and work a lot	Ne mogu stvarno biti s njim i puno raditi
That was helpful.	To je bilo od pomoći.
I was pretty sure no one saw me	Bio sam prilično siguran da me niko nije video
I didn't ask for him	Nisam ga tražio
I am all this alone	Ja sam sve ovo sam
No, you can't.	Ne, ne možeš.
I couldn't believe what just happened	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta se upravo dogodilo
I was still here alone	Još uvijek sam bio ovdje i sam
I have to see everything	Moram da vidim sve
I did everything myself.	Sve sam radio sam.
You didn't see it.	Nisi video.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
He is a good person.	On je dobra osoba.
I guess he's right	Pretpostavljam da je u pravu
I was ready to talk to him again	Bio sam spreman ponovo razgovarati s njim
It can't be.	Ne može se.
The truth is that no one can be sure yet.	Istina je da niko još ne može biti siguran.
It was really easy for me to do that.	Za mene je to bilo zaista lako učiniti.
He really was in it.	Zaista je bio u tome.
I wasn't sure what he wanted	Nisam bio siguran šta želi
There was nothing to say.	Nije bilo šta da se kaže.
I mean, we didn't do anything.	Mislim, nismo ništa uradili.
I don't know the reason.	Ne znam razlog.
I know when something is wrong	Znam kada nešto nije u redu
I don't know how it's done	Ne znam kako se to radi
But I can here.	Ali mogu ovde.
What! 	Šta!
How is it.	Kako je.
I know what's going on	Znam šta se dešava
And she knew he meant well.	I znala je da je mislio dobro.
But for too many people it is.	Ali za previše ljudi jeste.
I love being here	Volim biti ovdje
I would do that.	Ja bih to.
In fact, it happens quite often.	U stvari, to se dešava prilično često.
We can say that.	Možemo to reći.
You know they never had that.	Znate da to nikada nisu imali.
I didn't know what it was at the time	U to vrijeme nisam znao šta je to
Good thing there.	Dobra stvar tamo.
And that's exactly what happened.	I upravo se to dogodilo.
I couldn’t believe it was true	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je to istina
You can trust us all.	Svima nam možete vjerovati.
But you didn't.	Ali nisi.
I hope it looks better.	Nadam se da izgleda bolje.
I'm not a bad man.	Nisam loš čovjek.
Why? 	Zašto?
I didn't want him to leave	Nisam htela da ode
I guess it looks bad.	Pretpostavljam da izgleda loše.
I think it will be something simple.	Mislim da će to biti nešto jednostavno.
I wish I had one	Voleo bih da imam jedan
He didn't have to be here.	Nije morao biti ovdje.
That was not the case.	To nije bilo tako.
He knew where he was.	Znao je gdje je.
We are what we do.	Mi smo ono što radimo.
I know what's happening now	Znam šta se sada dešava
I just want you home soon.	Samo te želim brzo kući.
And last night it was.	I sinoć jeste.
I see a video there	Vidim video tamo
I know you weren't there.	Znam da nisi bio tamo.
I mean, maybe you could help	Mislim, možda bi mogao pomoći
You just have to.	Samo moraš.
About anything, she would say.	O bilo čemu, rekla bi.
Nobody told me.	Niko mi nije rekao.
I want to say you.	Želim ti reći.
She knows better than anyone.	Ona zna bolje od bilo koga.
I didn't even know why.	Nisam ni znao zašto.
She is the only one.	Ona je jedina.
I didn’t know until that happened	Nisam znao sve dok se to nije dogodilo
I had to give it to him	Morao sam mu to dati
That is not the reason.	To nije razlog.
But it was hard not to.	Ali bilo je teško ne.
Or if so, what he thinks.	Ili ako jeste, šta misli.
I certainly didn't expect that	To sigurno nisam očekivao
And no, there's no money yet.	I ne, još uvek nema novca.
I can't say much more now	Ne mogu sada reći mnogo više
I wish I was here.	Voleo bih da sam ovde.
Only this year.	Samo ove godine.
But he had to know more.	Ali morao je znati više.
You knew he was there.	Znali ste da je tamo.
I didn't even have to work much	Nisam čak ni morao puno da radim
Neither is she.	Nije ni ona.
I have to be there tonight.	Moram biti tamo večeras.
Not exactly what you think.	Nije baš ono što mislite.
You know that, but it's not.	Znate to, ali nije.
I'm afraid not for long at all	Bojim se da uopšte ne dugo
I know how hard it is for you	Znam koliko ti je teško
Very, very bad.	Veoma, veoma loše.
I just have to ask him something	Samo moram nešto da ga pitam
And there is much more.	I ima još mnogo toga.
I need this today	Treba mi ovo danas
I’d decide I had a little time before, like.	Odlučio bih da imam malo vremena prije, kao.
Maybe it doesn't exist.	Možda i ne postoji.
I have a little to tell you	Imam malo da ti kažem
I want to be old to tell you	Želim da imam godine da ti kažem
But I’m so sure it doesn’t exist.	Ali tako sam siguran da ne postoji.
I'm not going to school	Ne idem u školu
I want to know what he's doing there	Želim da znam šta on radi tamo
We have  .	Imamo .
He is doing what needs to be done.	On radi ono što treba da se uradi.
Not until he got there.	Ne dok nije stigao tamo.
But she was no more.	Ali više nije bila.
I would be there for everyone	Bio bih tu za sve
I didn't expect him to say that	Nisam očekivao da će to reći
As you say.	Kako kažeš.
If we can do it, so can you.	Ako mi to možemo, možete i vi.
I wonder if there are any more.	Pitam se da li ih još ima.
It didn't take me long.	Nije mi trebalo dugo.
I know this very well	Znam ovo jako dobro
I think that's what she said	Mislim da je to ona rekla
He tried three times.	Pokušao je tri puta.
I have to go on a trip	Moram da idem na put
I want it to be all me	Želim da to budem sve ja
And for us.	I za nas.
There must be a good reason.	Mora da ima dobar razlog.
She wants to be her.	Ona želi da bude ona.
And that's why.	I to je razlog zašto.
I'm better than that	Ja sam bolji od toga
I think that's the thing	Mislim u tome je stvar
Is that really what you want?	Je li to stvarno ono što želiš?
I said yes.	Rekao sam da jeste.
This is not your money.	Ovo nije tvoj novac.
It is still not easy.	To još uvijek nije lako.
In fact, there is no money.	Zapravo, novca nema.
I already knew the problem existed	Već sam znao da problem postoji
I could tell he wanted to tell me something	Mogao sam reći da mi želi nešto reći
I just wanted to be sure	Samo sam htio biti siguran
That's my problem, not yours.	To je moj problem, ne tvoj.
He can't help himself.	Ne može si pomoći.
I still want to do a few things with you	Još uvijek želim učiniti nekoliko stvari s tobom
Who would say something like that.	Ko bi rekao tako nešto.
I'm not saying there is.	Ne kažem da ima.
It's not about that.	Ne radi se o tome.
I guess he can't say anything	Pretpostavljam da ne može ništa reći
I hope you are all well	Nadam se da ste svi dobro
All right, she was right.	U redu, bila je u pravu.
That's a lot.	To je mnogo.
I didn't want any of that	Nisam htela ništa od toga
Not now, not anymore.	Ne sada, ne više.
That was many years ago.	Bilo je to prije mnogo godina.
She's still here.	Ona je još uvijek ovdje.
I'm going with you	Idem s tobom
Yes, it's true.	Da, istina je.
I'll find you.	Naći ću te.
I have so many.	Imam ih toliko.
I want to be your life alone	Želim da budem sam tvoj život
I know who they are.	Znam ko su oni.
I didn't expect everyone to be here	Nisam očekivao da će svi biti ovdje
I'm pretty good.	Ja sam prilično dobro.
You're never here.	Nikad nisi tu.
I hope she doesn't see it	Nadam se da ona to ne vidi
But if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.	Ali ako ne radi, ne radi.
No one needs to know.	Niko ne mora da zna.
I couldn't do this alone	Ne bih mogao ovo sam
Not always, but often.	Ne uvijek, ali često.
I wasn't sure if it was or not	Nisam bio siguran da li jeste ili ne
He really was here.	On je zaista bio ovde.
I don't have to go any further.	Ne moram dalje.
They are not real life.	Oni nisu pravi život.
To be what she thinks.	Da bude ono što ona misli.
She said yes.	Rekla je da.
I guess, if that's what you want	Pretpostavljam, ako je to ono što želiš
I very much doubt it.	Veoma sumnjam u to.
Not so today.	Danas nije tako.
I mean, we really could	Mislim, zaista bismo mogli
I needed to do something	Trebao sam nešto učiniti
I did what you want.	Uradio sam šta želiš.
I didn't expect it to really exist	Nisam očekivao da zaista postoji
That's not much.	To nije puno.
I never thought we'd find him.	Nikad nisam mislio da ćemo ga naći.
Something may or may not be happening here tonight.	Nešto se možda dešava ovde večeras, a možda i ne.
But nothing was a problem.	Ali ništa nije bilo problem.
This was fine.	Ovo je bilo u redu.
Please, he said.	Molim te, rekao je.
I think it's better for that	Mislim da je bolji za to
He is like a father.	On je kao otac.
I realized that he saw me too.	Shvatio sam da je i on mene video.
I think that happened	Mislim da se to dogodilo
I just want him to live again.	Samo želim da ponovo živi.
He wants to go.	On želi da ide.
You need to know.	Morate znati.
And you can stay as long as you want.	I možeš ostati koliko želiš.
And he was easy to talk to.	I s njim je bilo lako razgovarati.
I wondered, but no one seems to know.	Pitao sam se, ali izgleda da niko ne zna.
That's right.	Tako je.
Obviously, this is real.	Očigledno, ovo je stvarno.
Yes, sure.	Da, sigurno.
He knows nothing.	On ne zna ništa.
I really love her	Zaista je volim
He wanted more.	Želio je više.
I know something bad happened there	Znam da se tamo nešto loše dogodilo
I can see her.	Mogu da je vidim.
In fact, this was a good thing.	U stvari, ovo je bila dobra stvar.
I shouldn't do this	Ne bih trebao ovo da radim
I knew exactly what he was doing	Tačno sam znao šta radi
You are the one who makes them.	Ti si taj koji ih pravi.
And please.	I molim te.
Not like them.	Ne kao oni.
I've heard it three times	Čuo sam to tri puta
I can see so much this way.	Toliko toga mogu vidjeti na ovaj način.
I was happy.	Bio sam sretan.
I've seen this too many times before	Video sam ovo previše puta ranije
He thought the idea was good.	Mislio je da je ideja dobra.
I wonder what you're doing now	Pitam se šta sada radiš
And it probably is, but you are the reason why.	I vjerovatno jeste, ali ti si razlog zašto.
I still have so many friends there	Još uvek imam toliko prijatelja tamo
I hope this was helpful.	Nadam se da je ovo bilo od pomoći.
They said we were sorry.	Rekli su da nam je žao.
You do not know.	Ne znaš.
Maybe they are right.	Možda su u pravu.
I better not know	Bilo mi je bolje da ne znaju
You are in the house.	U kući ste.
I didn't always have it	Nisam ga uvek imao
I still can't.	I dalje ne mogu.
He was a man.	Bio je to čovjek.
I haven't seen him in a while	Nisam ga vidio neko vrijeme
I should work a little there	Trebao bih malo raditi tamo
I was ready to go home	Bio sam spreman da idem kući
He didn't look well.	Nije izgledao dobro.
He told me that.	On mi je to rekao.
I thought it looked bad	Mislio sam da izgleda loše
I just want to know what you think	Samo želim da znam šta misliš
She has no idea, really.	Ona nema pojma, zaista.
I need money today.	Treba mi novac danas.
I can't do anything to you.	Ne mogu ti ništa.
I could be.	Mogao sam biti.
I didn't do it	Nisam to radio
I know enough to do that	Znam dovoljno da to uradim
I didn't know what it was about	Nisam znao o čemu se radi
If there is.	Ako postoji.
I know what it is	Znam šta je to
I did this too	I ja sam ovo uradio
He knew what his job was.	Znao je šta mu je posao.
I have no idea where he lives	Nemam pojma gdje živi
We never said that.	Nikad to nismo rekli.
Tell me.	Reci mi.
I knew what would happen next	Znao sam šta će se sljedeće dogoditi
But that’s what you have to do.	Ali to je ono što morate učiniti.
I can't believe this happened	Ne mogu vjerovati da se ovo dogodilo
She knows that.	Ona to zna.
Nobody works here.	Ovde niko ne radi.
I'm so sorry they did that to you	Jako mi je žao što su ti to uradili
I have no idea where he is	Nemam pojma gdje je
I guess he's heard that before.	Pretpostavljam da je to već čuo.
I’ve seen him probably probably many times	Vidio sam ga malo vjerovatno mnogo puta
We need something that people can get back to, and fast.	Treba nam nešto na šta bi se ljudi mogli vratiti, i to brzo.
We needed more time.	Trebalo nam je više vremena.
But it happens.	Ali to se dešava.
He said you could go home.	Rekao je da možeš ići kući.
I already knew what you told me	Već sam znao šta si mi rekao
I know it was for me.	Znam da je bilo za mene.
They are just people, just like you.	Oni su samo ljudi, kao i ti.
I couldn't see him.	Nisam ga mogao vidjeti.
But it could really get to you.	Ali stvarno bi mogao doći do tebe.
I was ready for anything	Bio sam spreman za sve
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
But I know this	Ali znam ovo
I love you all very much	Sve vas mnogo volim
I wonder if that's true	Pitam se da li je to istina
I had no idea what to tell him	Nisam imao pojma šta da mu kažem
It's not that hard.	Nije tako teško.
I get what you're doing	Shvatio sam šta radiš
It can't be true.	Ne može biti istina.
I must have done something right	Mora da sam uradio nešto kako treba
I heard that there.	Čuo sam to tamo.
Many days are hard.	Mnogo dana je teško.
You can find everything you want to do.	Sve što želite da uradite možete naći.
I have no idea if you can or not	Nemam pojma možeš li ili ne
That's right.	Tako je.
I was a little surprised they weren’t already	Bio sam malo iznenađen da već nisu
He's trying to help me.	Pokušava mi pomoći.
That doesn't like them.	To ih ne voli.
I asked him why he wanted to know	Pitao sam ga zašto želi da zna
And there are only a few of them.	A ima ih samo nekoliko.
I could only say.	Mogao bi i samo reći.
Even something bad.	Čak i nešto loše.
I didn't have to see him again.	Nisam morao ponovo da ga vidim.
I could even say yes	Mogao sam i da kažem da
She was here today.	Bila je ovdje danas.
I have something better to do.	Imam nešto bolje da uradim.
You have to do something for me	Moraš da uradiš nešto za mene
I want to do this as much as she does	Želim ovo da uradim koliko i ona
We really were in it.	Zaista smo bili u tome.
There was a lot of that.	Bilo je dosta toga.
I still wanted to know more.	I dalje sam želeo da znam više.
He obviously didn't get what he wanted.	Očigledno nije dobio ono što je želio.
And she knew it.	I ona je to znala.
He can be busy.	Može biti zauzet.
I think he just needs time	Mislim da mu samo treba vremena
I said it wouldn't be.	Rekao sam da neće biti.
I'm still doing this.	I dalje ovo radim.
But he knew it.	Ali on je to znao.
It is for us and about us.	To je za nas i o nama.
Even when you are.	Čak i kada jesi.
So you never know how it happened.	Tako da nikad ne znaš kako se to dogodilo.
There is truth.	Postoji istina.
I have no idea how long he's been there	Nemam pojma koliko dugo je tamo
I am one and you are	Ja sam jedan i ti si
I love you, but now you have to go	Volim te, ali sada moraš ići
I did this to myself	Uradio sam ovo sebi
But surely everyone knows that.	Ali to sigurno svi znaju.
I mean, it wasn't a meeting	Mislim, to nije bio sastanak
That was it.	To je bilo to.
That's what she said.	To je ona rekla.
I just won't let that happen	Jednostavno to neću dozvoliti
That shouldn't work.	To ne bi trebalo da radi.
It was very good for us.	Bilo je jako dobro za nas.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
Which is exactly what happened.	Što se upravo i dogodilo.
That was not good.	To nije bilo dobro.
Do it now.	Uradio to sada.
That's the idea.	To je ideja.
While we are here.	Dok smo mi ovde.
I mean, nice to see you again and you know it	Mislim, drago mi je da te ponovo vidim i znaš
He really was.	Zaista je bio.
And she said yes.	I ona je rekla da.
It doesn't work here.	Ovdje ne radi.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
She will be there.	Ona će biti tamo.
I've been here many times	Bio sam ovdje mnogo puta
She didn't know.	Nije znala.
Everything.	Sve.
I didn't even know what was going to happen	Nisam ni znao šta će se dogoditi
Or maybe it’s something you do yourself.	Ili je to možda nešto što radite sami.
I mean, we're fine together	Mislim, dobro nam je zajedno
He saw things he shouldn't have seen.	Video je stvari koje nije trebalo da vidi.
It's just a job.	To je samo posao.
I've been for a while	Ja sam već neko vrijeme
This is a difficult time.	Ovo je teško vrijeme.
There is nothing more that can help you know.	Ne postoji ništa više što bi vam moglo pomoći da znate.
He can't tell us.	Ne može nam reći.
Everything is too simple.	Sve je previše jednostavno.
But he's wrong.	Ali nije u pravu.
I don't see anything wrong with doing what you want.	Ne vidim ništa loše u tome da radiš ono što želiš.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
I knew something was going to happen	Znao sam da će se nešto dogoditi
We can go to dinner or something.	Možemo otići na večeru ili tako nešto.
But tell me more about it.	Ali reci mi više o tome.
I had no idea what was going on	Nisam imao pojma šta se dešava
To do that.	Da bi to uradio.
I've been gone for three days	Nema me tri dana
This, right here.	Ovo, upravo ovdje.
I want it to be very fast	Želim da bude jako brzo
He's not here.	Nije ovde.
I'm done with him.	Završio sam s njim.
I want to talk about it	Želim razgovarati o tome
He said nothing.	Nije rekao ništa.
There will probably be more stories.	Vjerovatno će biti još priča.
I just want him to say what he knows	Samo želim da kaže šta zna
He was not here.	Ovdje ga nije bilo.
I want to be ready for anything	Želim biti spreman na sve
But it was not easy.	Ali nije bilo lako.
Only this can't be real.	Samo što ovo ne može biti stvarno.
All right, we're fine.	U redu, dobro smo.
I should tell him.	Trebao bih mu reći.
This time he would do everything right.	Ovaj put bi sve uradio kako treba.
I was really good at it	Bio sam stvarno dobar u tome
I can't even think of you	Ne mogu ni ja da mislim na tebe
I said it's not bad	Rekao sam da nije loš
I didn't know anything about it	Nisam znao ništa o tome
That was simple.	To je bilo jednostavno.
Everyone but me.	Svi osim mene.
I can't say much without seeing it.	Ne mogu reći mnogo a da to ne vidim.
You can go home.	Možeš se vratiti kući.
I didn't know what to think or do	Nisam znao šta da mislim ili da radim
I want to be with you	Želim da budem sa tobom
But it couldn't.	Ali nije moglo.
I think she's afraid to do it alone	Mislim da se boji da to uradi sama
She was here last year.	Bila je ovdje prošle godine.
Something bad would happen.	Nešto loše bi se dogodilo.
I would have done this earlier	Uradio bih ovo ranije
No one has done that before.	Niko to ranije nije uradio.
He asked for help.	Zamolio je za pomoć.
It all happened three times.	Sve se to dogodilo tri puta.
No they didn't.	Ne nisu.
There was one.	Bio je jedan.
But it seems to work.	Ali izgleda da radi.
Maybe they never are.	Možda ih nikad nema.
Something was wrong, he knew that.	Nešto nije bilo u redu, znao je to.
I want it back.	Želim to vratiti.
Not this time either.	Ne ni ovaj put.
I said everything and he left	Rekao sam sve i on je otišao
But that's it.	Ali to je to.
I decided to stay home	Odlučio sam ostati kod kuće
I'm glad it helped you.	Drago mi je da vam je bilo od pomoći.
I couldn't talk to him anymore	Nisam mogao više razgovarati s njim
I didn't want to go without you	Nisam htela da idem bez tebe
I would see things you couldn't	Vidio bih stvari koje ti ne bi mogao
I have no idea when he'll be back	Nemam pojma kada će se vratiti
I always do, you know	Uvek to radim, znaš
I should have asked you if that was what you wanted	Trebao sam da te pitam da li je to ono što želiš
And we do.	I mi to radimo.
And no one did that either.	A ni to niko nije uradio.
I still love them today.	I danas ih volim.
I didn't expect to see him again	Nisam očekivao da ću ga ponovo vidjeti
But we don't do that.	Ali mi to ne radimo.
I was just doing my job.	Samo sam radio svoj posao.
What would he do anyway.	Šta bi on uopšte uradio.
He wouldn't have that at all.	On to uopšte ne bi imao.
It just happened.	To se jednostavno dogodilo.
I was very busy	Bio sam veoma zauzet
He may or may not leave.	Možda će otići, a možda i ne.
There is only more of that.	Ima toga samo više.
I wonder what else he knows	Pitam se šta još zna
I hope everything is fine	Nadam se da je sve u redu
But she doesn't.	Ali ona to ne čini.
I had no problem with that.	Nisam imao problema sa tim.
I don't see them.	Ne vidim ih.
I always have time for you	Uvek imam vremena za tebe
It often happens that way.	Često se to dešava na taj način.
Did he know? 	Da li je znao?
Maybe even from me.	Možda čak i od mene.
About what really happened.	O tome šta se zaista dogodilo.
Apparently, he often does.	Očigledno, često to čini.
I always had it	Uvek sam ga imao
He didn't ask her what it was for.	Nije je pitao za šta je to.
I came back last month.	Vratio sam se prošlog mjeseca.
And so we should.	I tako bismo trebali.
I would never do that	Nikada to ne bih uradio
I have to go to work.	Moram na posao.
See also this question.	Vidi i ovo pitanje.
It may not even be likely to be one.	Možda čak nije ni vjerovatno da je to jedan.
I didn't want to do that.	Nisam htela to da uradim.
All good and good.	Sve dobro i dobro.
I knew you would be here	Znao sam da ćeš biti ovdje
All he knew was that she loved him.	Znao je samo da ga ona voli.
I do not know what to say.	Ne znam šta da kažem.
And I had to see where he lived.	I morao sam vidjeti gdje živi.
I love her more than myself	Volim je više od sebe
Or maybe not.	Ili možda i nije.
I was no longer happy	Više mi nije bilo drago
I am everything it has ever been	Ja sam sve što je ikada bilo
He does what he says.	On radi šta kaže.
I didn't want to tell him	Nisam htela da mu kažem
What do you want to see next?	Šta želite vidjeti sljedeće?
He would go alone.	Sam bi otišao.
About what.	O čemu.
What to do?	Šta da radim?
I didn't even know what it was	Nisam ni znao šta je to
She can't love me.	Ona ne može da me voli.
I don't want them anymore	Ne želim ih više
No one really is.	Niko zaista nije.
I know what they really are	Znam šta su oni zaista
I really like it a lot.	Zaista mi se jako sviđa.
No one is ever right or wrong.	Niko nikada nije u pravu ili nije u pravu.
When that.	Kada to.
I would really like to come back here.	Zaista bih se volio vratiti ovdje.
I needed it.	Trebalo mi je.
Not much.	Nije puno.
He knew his job.	Znao je svoj posao.
I love this job.	Volim ovaj posao.
But no, it's not.	Ali ne, nije.
I tried to talk to him.	Pokušao sam razgovarati s njim.
She didn't want to wait for him.	Nije htela da ga čeka.
I can't say how anyone could know	Ne mogu reći kako bi neko mogao znati
But he was no longer the man who left.	Ali on više nije bio čovjek koji je otišao.
This would simply not be allowed here.	Ovo ovdje jednostavno ne bi bilo dozvoljeno.
And that is very true.	I to je veoma tačno.
I love him.	Volim ga.
I had too much for life	Imao sam previše za život
I'm sure yours isn't.	Siguran sam da tvoj nije.
Nobody came home.	Niko nije došao kući.
I want to be your friend too	I ja želim da ti budem prijatelj
I'm fine.	Dobro sam.
It should be like me.	Trebalo bi da bude kao ja.
I couldn't let that happen	Nisam to mogao dozvoliti
Or something like that.	Ili tako nešto.
Not for the money.	Ne zbog novca.
I've never done that before	Nikad to ranije nisam radio
Yes, she is there.	Da, ona je tamo.
I told you yesterday you have to trust me	Rekao sam ti juče da mi moraš vjerovati
And we can't do that.	A to ne možemo.
I said it was hard for me	Rekao sam da mi je teško
I will never give it to you	Nikad ti ga neću dati
It was simple, really.	Bilo je jednostavno, zaista.
She wants .	Ona želi .
I saw you come back	Video sam kad si se vratio
I wanted both	Želeo sam oboje
I know you're there	Znam da si tamo
I never did that again	Nikad to više nisam uradio
If they weren't, they would be today.	Da nisu bili, bili bi danas.
Yes, that will come too.	Da, doći će i to.
I expected him to tell me the truth	Očekivao sam da će mi reći istinu
I knew exactly how he felt	Tačno sam znao kako se osjeća
Have you had it before?	Jeste li ga imali ranije?
And very quickly.	I to vrlo brzo.
He wants us badly.	On nas želi loše.
I knew he wasn't telling me everything	Znao sam da mi ne govori sve
That was more than enough for you.	To je bilo više nego dovoljno za tebe.
I don't know what happened.	Ne znam šta se dogodilo.
It is very simple and you can do it here.	Vrlo je jednostavno i to možete učiniti ovdje.
What sees you.	Šta te vidi.
I want to do it this way	Želim to učiniti na ovaj način
Maybe there were more.	Možda ih je bilo više.
I'm surprised to see you	Iznenađen sam što te vidim
Yes, he said, they were here.	Da, rekao je, bili su ovdje.
I have a job for you.	Imam posao za tebe.
He is your father.	On je tvoj otac.
Or no, no, no.	Ili ne, ne, ne.
She said something before that.	Rekla je nešto prije toga.
Something has to stay.	Nešto mora ostati.
Few have done so.	Malo ko je to uradio.
I can't be sure exactly what happened	Ne mogu biti tačno siguran šta se tačno dogodilo
But you're right.	Ali, u pravu si.
I just need something	Samo mi treba nešto
And that must be me.	A to sam sigurno ja.
I won't do it again	Neću to više raditi
Now they both knew.	Sada su oboje znali.
I thought he was safe.	Mislio sam da je siguran.
It just isn't.	To jednostavno nije.
We've had enough.	Dosta nam je toga.
You can stay.	Možete ostati.
I love working for you	Volim raditi za tebe
I did my best on it	Dao sam sve od sebe na tome
He's just telling the truth.	On samo govori istinu.
You have to see it.	Morate to vidjeti.
Or they should be a good team.	Ili bi trebali biti dobar tim.
But she never said.	Ali nikad nije rekla.
Now I know everything.	Sada znam sve.
I wish it wasn't	Voleo sam da nije
She would never say something like that.	Nikada ne bi rekla tako nešto.
The question was how to get it.	Pitanje je bilo kako to dobiti.
But we are not there yet.	Ali još nismo tamo.
That was supposed to be my life.	To je trebao biti moj život.
I think that makes him feel better	Mislim da se zbog toga osjeća bolje
There are so few of us there now.	Tako malo nas je tamo sada.
I just figured something out	Upravo sam nešto shvatio
I got it.	Shvatio sam to.
We had a very good time.	Bilo nam je jako dobro.
Maybe it was hope.	Možda je to bila nada.
But we can.	Ali možemo.
There are many more than us.	Ima mnogo više od nas.
Nobody had much money.	Niko nije imao mnogo novca.
She doesn't do it too much.	Ona to ne radi previše.
We don't know if he'll ever come back.	Ne znamo da li će se ikada vratiti.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikome nije rekao.
I never see you.	Nikad te ne vidim.
I'll tell the truth	Reći ću istinu
If only he could be found good.	Kad bi se mogao naći dobar.
I won't talk to him anymore	Neću više razgovarati s njim
You should go get some.	Trebao bi otići po malo.
I didn't know what he was going to do	Nisam znao šta će da uradi
She wasn't there.	Ona nije bila tamo.
I never knew it worked.	Nikad nisam znao da radi.
We knew he did it.	Znali smo da je to uradio.
I have to go home actually	Moram ići kući zapravo
That may have been true.	To je možda bila istina.
I really like it	Zaista mi se jako sviđa
And anyone does.	I bilo ko to radi.
I don't see how we can help with that	Ne vidim kako možemo pomoći u tome
As she knew it always was.	Kao što je znala da je to uvek bilo.
That simply cannot be true	To jednostavno ne može biti istina
I really didn't want to know	Zaista nisam htela da znam
I heard everything	Čuo sam sve
I wouldn't even today	Ne bih ni danas
I'm really sorry about that, you know	Zaista mi je jako žao zbog toga, znaš
I have to go for a while.	Moram ići za malo.
I couldn't help myself much either	Ni ja sebi ne bih mogao puno pomoći
I'm still working on it.	I dalje radim na tome.
We have to go with him.	Moramo ići s njim.
They are the only ones who can do it.	Oni su jedini koji to mogu.
I like the idea.	Sviđa mi se ideja.
I know what he means	Znam na šta misli
He must have felt better.	Sigurno se činilo da se osjeća bolje.
But it could be done.	Ali to bi se moglo uraditi.
By itself, it's okay.	Samo po sebi, u redu je.
I had problems with a	Imao sam problema sa a
I really want to do this	Zaista želim ovo da uradim
He didn't know what to say.	Nije znao šta da kaže.
I knew right away where we were	Odmah sam znao gdje smo
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
More than bad.	Više nego loše.
I don't know, that's a very good question.	Ne znam, to je jako dobro pitanje.
I need to know what's happening to me	Moram da znam šta mi se dešava
I got a good job.	Dobio sam dobar posao.
And it really isn't.	A zapravo nije.
It will be .	Biti će .
She will be right back.	Ona će se odmah vratiti.
Yes, it is.	Da, da jeste.
You shouldn't be here alone.	Ne bi trebao biti ovdje sam.
He will believe anything.	On će vjerovati bilo čemu.
I wish we had something like that here.	Voleo bih da imamo tako nešto ovde.
She is a.	Ona je a.
I like	Sviđa mi se
He makes the game look so easy.	On čini da igra izgleda tako lako.
I can not believe	Ne mogu vjerovati
Not true.	Nije istina.
We need to do more.	Moramo učiniti više.
I asked her how she was feeling	Pitao sam je kako se osjeća
I didn't expect this	Nisam ovo očekivao
I hope you can be here	Nadam se da možeš biti ovdje
It's so bad.	Toliko je loše.
I loved her so much.	Toliko sam je volio.
It was never easy for me.	Nikad mi nije bilo lako.
There must be more.	Mora biti još.
I gave up my job and left	Dao sam posao i otišao
And this is a lot.	A ovo je mnogo.
I know how much you want this	Znam koliko ovo želiš
I would never do that to you	Nikad ti to ne bih uradio
I never wanted anyone else	Nikada nisam želeo nekoga više
Now that she's gone, I have a lot to do.	Sada kada je nema, imam mnogo toga da uradim.
I asked her what happened	Pitao sam je šta se dogodilo
He could tell everyone.	Mogao bi reći svima.
I like being here with you	Sviđa mi se ovdje sa tobom
Yes, tell him.	Da, reci mu.
I have to do something.	Moram nešto da uradim.
That everything is true.	Da je sve istina.
I didn't expect this	Nisam ovo očekivao
I don't know if it still works or not	Ne znam da li i dalje radi ili ne
And so we knew.	I tako smo znali.
I know exactly who you are both	Znam tačno ko ste oboje
I've heard all about it	Čuo sam sve o tome
Which they may have had.	Što su možda i imali.
You can't trust yourself.	Ne možeš vjerovati sebi.
I can not anymore	Ne mogu više
I never heard from him again	Nikad se više nisam čuo s njim
I hope he comes back soon	Nadam se da će se uskoro vratiti
I had to.	Morao sam.
And they won't now.	I neće sada.
I'm not coming back.	Neću se vratiti.
I ask how old he is	Pitam koliko ima godina
She wasn't now.	Sada nije bila.
I can't do without him	Ne mogu bez njega
I think you'll be fine.	Mislim da ćeš biti dobro.
Yes, I think so.	Da to mislim.
You know very well that this is not the case.	Znate dobro i dobro da to nije tako.
I did everything for you	Sve sam uradio za tebe
I thought maybe everything could be fine	Mislio sam da bi možda sve moglo biti u redu
I wonder what she thinks	Pitam se šta ona misli
Obviously not now.	Očigledno ne sada.
I expected him to do that.	Očekivao sam da će to učiniti.
You know these things.	Znaš ove stvari.
I do not know.	Ne znam.
It's just a meeting.	To je samo sastanak.
I wonder if we can do it	Pitam se da li to možemo
I never thought that would happen.	Nikad nisam mislio da će se to dogoditi.
Something would happen.	Nešto bi se dogodilo.
And for nothing.	I ni za šta.
From time to time.	S vremena na vrijeme.
It wouldn't even be that hard.	Ne bi ni bilo tako teško.
Everyone said yes.	Svi su rekli da.
Yes he is.	Da on je.
That doesn't look good to me.	To mi ne izgleda dobro.
I asked what was going on	Pitao sam šta se dešava
As far as he knew, he was the only one.	Koliko je znao, on je jedini.
I want to do what he wants	Želim da radim ono što on želi
Hard even that.	Teško čak i to.
They knew who we were.	Znali su ko smo mi.
Anything, anything, could well happen now.	Bilo šta, sve, dobro bi se moglo dogoditi sada.
It used to be one.	Nekada je to bio jedan.
I can not believe	Ne mogu vjerovati
I had no problem with that	Nisam imao problema s tim
That's what it was supposed to be.	To je ono što je trebalo biti.
We have enough problems already.	Već imamo dovoljno problema.
I couldn't say how much.	Nisam mogao reći koliko.
I didn't think it could be you	Nisam mislio da bi to mogao biti ti
And we would.	I mi bismo.
I did this.	Ja sam ovo radio.
I worked too hard.	Radio sam previše.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
He has a good reason to do so.	On ima dobar razlog da to uradi.
I have no time.	Nemam vremena.
Good job.	Dobar posao.
It's better without it.	Bolje je bez toga.
I'm sure now.	Sada sam siguran.
Why? 	Zašto?
I didn't know what to think	Nisam znao šta da mislim
I think it will be good	Mislim da će biti dobro
I like talking to him	Volim razgovarati s njim
We need a reason.	Treba nam razlog.
Everyone knew who it was.	Svi su znali ko je to.
He seemed to have done both good and good.	Činilo se da je uradio i dobro i dobro.
He knows everything about us.	On zna sve o nama.
But I don't think so.	Ali mislim da nije.
I mean, this is really it	Mislim, ovo je zaista to
I have no idea how to do that.	Nemam pojma kako to da uradim.
I would be surprised if it wasn't.	Bio bih iznenađen da nije.
I can't believe he's here	Ne mogu vjerovati da je ovdje
From this morning.	Od jutros.
It's just like that here.	To je jednostavno tako ovdje.
It works a little fast.	Radi malo brzo.
That was it.	To je bilo.
I couldn't go back now	Sada se nisam mogao vratiti
Only he was there.	Samo je on bio tamo.
I can bring them back	Mogu ih vratiti
I will always be there	Uvek ću biti tu
And it looks like that.	I izgleda tako.
I have something else to ask you	Imam još nešto da te pitam
And we were.	I mi smo bili.
I can't stay with you.	Ne mogu ostati s tobom.
And that they may be right.	I da su možda u pravu.
I know it was hard for both of you.	Znam da vam je oboje bilo teško.
I went back to school.	Vratio sam se u školu.
I know you must be very busy.	Znam da si sigurno veoma zauzet.
I wasn't ready for that	Nisam bio spreman za to
It's just me.	Ja sam samo ja.
Not so fast.	Ne tako brzo.
I have it here.	Imam ga ovde.
I think it's good.	Mislim da je dobro.
We are so sorry.	Tako nam je žao.
I didn't know how hard it was	Nisam znao koliko je bilo teško
About that right.	O tom pravu.
I have to do something.	Moram nešto da uradim.
That time is now and it is here.	To vrijeme je sada i tu je.
Do not do that to me.	Ne radi mi to.
And for the better.	I na bolje.
And I did.	I to sam napravio.
They are given here.	Oni su ovde dati.
I'm really happy for you	Zaista sam sretan zbog tebe
I've seen it many times.	Vidio sam to mnogo puta.
I tried.	Pokušao sam.
I told you that this morning	Rekao sam ti to jutros
I should have been with him, as a friend	Trebao sam biti s njim, kao prijatelj
I'll pick you up.	Doći ću po tebe.
I still didn't even have a car	Još uvijek nisam imao ni auto
But he could do it.	Ali on je to mogao.
You brought my life back.	Vratio si mi život.
All these years.	Sve ove godine.
I didn't need her to need me	Nije mi trebalo da ona treba mene
It wasn't that bad.	Nije bilo tako loše.
I told you it was okay	Rekao sam ti da je u redu
Tell me quickly.	Reci mi brzo.
I don't even know where he is.	Ne znam ni gdje je.
I can say things without saying them	Mogu reći stvari a da ih ne kažem
I asked her if she was feeling well	Pitao sam je da li se osjeća dobro
But I didn't have one	Ali nisam ni imao
I've never seen that.	Nikada to nisam video.
We did that.	To smo uradili.
I knew you weren't ready for all this	Znao sam da nisi spreman za sve ovo
I need to know.	Moram da znam.
Three, actually.	Tri, u stvari.
I decided not to say anything	Odlučio sam da ništa ne kažem
I lost a friend	Izgubio sam prijatelja
I'm not even sure about myself.	Nisam ni siguran za sebe.
And he would start.	I on bi počeo.
Mine! 	Moj!
They will be able to help you.	Oni će vam moći pomoći.
I had no idea how to do it	Nisam imao pojma kako da to uradim
I like the way he talks	Sviđa mi se način na koji priča
I didn't arrive on time	Nisam stigao na vrijeme
There you are.	Tu ste.
No one knew he was here.	Niko nije znao da je ovde.
Maybe it will help.	Možda će pomoći.
And he does.	I on to radi.
I'm glad you like it.	Drago mi je da ti se sviđa.
I didn't know what exactly	Nisam znao šta tačno
I need more time.	Treba mi više vremena.
She loves me, not you.	Ona voli mene, ne tebe.
I can't do anything anymore	Ne mogu više ništa
All this exists.	Sve ovo postoji.
Not very good, but good enough.	Ne baš dobro, ali dovoljno dobro.
It still won't work.	I dalje neće raditi.
Only you can know that.	Samo ti to možeš znati.
You have to see for yourself.	Morate to sami vidjeti.
These.	Ove.
I only thought of myself	Mislio sam samo na sebe
It was okay.	Bilo je u redu.
I want to see that.	Želim to vidjeti.
It really is, he said.	Zaista jeste, rekao je.
I will not stay here for more days	Neću ostati ovdje više dana
You can say it will.	Možete reći da hoće.
Not anymore.	Ne više.
You said it yourself.	Vi ste to sami rekli.
Those people did something to me.	Ti ljudi su mi nešto uradili.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
They know we're here.	Oni znaju da smo ovde.
I could tell he hadn't seen it	Mogao sam reći da to nije vidio
He will do the right thing.	On će učiniti kako treba.
It never works out that way.	To nikad ne ide tako.
Time is nothing.	Vrijeme je ništa.
I wouldn't get it.	Ne bi ga dobio.
I was there last night.	Bio sam tamo sinoć.
I hope your day is going well.	Nadam se da ti dan ide dobro.
I am asking you.	Pitam te.
I hope you like it	Nadam se da ti se sviđa
Don't do that yet.	Nemoj to još raditi.
I know you already knew that	Znam da si to već znao
He would lose his job.	Izgubio bi posao.
I was looking for a door.	Tražio sam vrata.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
I wondered how he was feeling today	Pitao sam se kako se danas osjeća
That is too much.	To je previše.
And never more than now.	I nikad više nego sada.
Which is not bad.	Što nije loše.
I know you're right	Znam da si u pravu
I admitted that to you before.	To sam ti i ranije priznao.
But not that.	Ali ne to.
This should not be the case.	Ovo ne bi trebalo biti tako.
You can give us yourself.	Možete nam dati sebe.
I don't think so anymore.	Više ne mislim tako.
If anyone can do it, we can do it.	Ako neko to može, mi to možemo.
To me, he was just a friend.	Za mene je on bio samo prijatelj.
It's still there.	Još je tu.
I guess they're pretty good	Pretpostavljam da su prilično dobro
You never knew when it would come.	Nikad nisi znao kada će doći.
No one will help me.	Niko mi neće pomoći.
But not now.	Ali ne sada.
.	.
I didn't know what to do	Nisam znao šta da radim
I didn't want all this	Nisam htela sve ovo
I had no idea what to say to that	Nisam imao pojma šta da kažem na to
He didn't have much to say.	Nije imao mnogo toga da kaže.
I didn't say anything	Nisam ništa rekao
He eats and plays as if nothing has happened.	On jede i igra se kao da se ništa nije dogodilo.
I would very much like to know what is here	Jako bih volio da znam šta je ovdje
You're doing it tonight.	Radiš to večeras.
Please tell me what's going on.	Molim te reci mi šta se dešava.
And he told me that, but not now.	I to mi je rekao, ali ne sada.
I had to tell him.	Morao sam mu reći.
I can be anything, go anywhere.	Mogu biti bilo šta, ići bilo gdje.
I wondered who they were and how many were here	Pitao sam se ko su oni i koliko ih je ovdje
You could go to school if you wanted.	Mogao si ići u školu ako želiš.
I have something to tell you.	Imam nešto da ti kažem.
I never know when that will come	Nikad ne znam kada će to doći
I would be.	Bio bih.
I didn't tell him that	Nisam mu to rekao
I didn't know we could do it	Nisam znao da to možemo
I was sorry for him	Bilo mi je žao zbog njega
I'm not asking you for life	Ne molim te život
He was the first, but he was not the only one.	Bio je prvi, ali nije bio jedini.
I want to be with him	Želim da budem sa njim
There's still something here.	Još uvek ima nešto ovde.
She likes to play.	Ona voli da se igra.
This works better.	Ovo radi bolje.
We were supposed to be there for three days.	Trebali smo tamo biti tri dana.
I'm not good.	Nisam dobro.
He could only go home.	Mogao je samo otići kući.
I was happy at the time	Bio sam sretan u to vrijeme
I wondered what could have happened	Pitao sam se šta se moglo dogoditi
No, no, there is something.	Ne, ne, postoji nešto.
There was never enough time.	Nikada nije bilo dovoljno vremena.
As much as they could.	Koliko su mogli.
I have no idea what to do with it	Nemam pojma šta da radim s tim
He said maybe he would.	Rekao je da možda hoće.
I couldn't tell.	Ne bih mogao reći.
I mean real fun	Mislim na pravu zabavu
We all know that by now.	Svi to znamo do sada.
The reason is life.	Razlog je život.
But something that works.	Ali nešto što radi.
We just need a little more time.	Samo nam treba malo više vremena.
I do it.	Ja to radim.
I'll find my way.	Naći ću svoj put.
There is both or.	Ima i ili.
He couldn't do this anymore.	Nije mogao ovo više.
I had to go for help	Morao sam da idem po pomoć
I feel sorry for them.	Žao mi ih je.
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
But no one could be sure.	Ali niko nije mogao biti siguran.
It sure is.	Sigurno je tako.
Maybe we should go.	Možda bi trebali otići.
You have to believe in yourself and what you do.	Morate vjerovati u sebe i ono što radite.
He saw him do it.	Video ga je kako to radi.
We'll find you.	Naći ćemo te.
No problem this time.	Ovaj put nema problema.
He was good.	Bio je dobar.
It wasn't necessary.	Nije trebalo.
We had problems.	Imali smo problema.
I don't know why he won't tell me.	Ne znam zašto mi neće reći.
I'm always working, I'm busy	Uvijek radim, zauzet sam
You know it's nothing.	Znaš da nije ništa.
It's better for me.	Za mene je to bolje.
I want him to be safe.	Želim da bude siguran.
I know you want that	Znam da to želiš
I wouldn't have a problem with that	Ne bih imao problema sa tim
So very difficult.	Tako jako teško.
That may not be what you want.	To možda nije ono što želite.
I hope no one ever finds them	Nadam se da ih niko nikada neće naći
I want something better.	Želim nešto bolje.
He would say yes, and that would be it.	Rekao bi da, i to bi bilo to.
I want to do it.	Želim da uradim.
I hope that really happens	Nadam se da će se to zaista dogoditi
But he couldn't see it.	Ali on to nije mogao da vidi.
No one could live like that.	Tako niko nije mogao da živi.
I didn't think so at all	Nisam uopšte tako mislio
There are people who have done it and people who have not.	Ima ljudi koji su to uradili i ljudi koji nisu.
We have a team.	Imamo tim.
Time is time.	Vrijeme je vrijeme.
And better for that.	I bolje za to.
And so it will continue to be	I tako će biti i dalje
He's already done it.	Već je to radio.
I was the only one who could see it	Bio sam jedini koji je to mogao vidjeti
I can't do this alone	Ne mogu ovo sama
I'm not sure which one.	Nisam siguran koji.
Both.	Oboje.
He must.	On mora.
I need to know.	Moram da znam.
She tells you what she thinks	Ona ti kaže šta misli
I couldn't tell anyone about it.	Nisam mogao nikome o tome.
It was still day.	Još je bio dan.
I'd tell you something's going on	Rekao bih ti da se nešto dešava
Really very little.	Zaista vrlo malo.
He was fine.	Bio je dobro.
But I didn't ask	Ali nisam pitao
All we have is today.	Sve što imamo je danas.
Looks pretty good.	Izgleda prilično dobro.
I think you're right	Mislim da si u pravu
So it is with.	Tako je i sa.
I didn't have to do that	Nisam morao to da radim
I knew you would be right back	Znao sam da ćeš se odmah vratiti
And there is no time.	I nema vremena.
It really works.	Zaista radi.
I should know these things	Trebao bih znati ove stvari
Speak for me.	Govori za mene.
I have no idea what that could be	Nemam pojma šta bi to moglo biti
Where is.	Gdje je.
I want to be here too	I ja želim biti ovdje
I have my job	Imam svoj posao
That was the problem.	To je bio problem.
I can't, you would do that	Ne mogu, ti bi to uradio
I can't say anything more.	Ne mogu reći ništa više.
He was alone.	Bio je sam.
So much is happening	Toliko toga se dešava
And I did that often.	I ja sam to često radio.
I won't say anything.	Neću ništa reći.
I know how you work	Znam kako vi radite
Maybe you like it.	Možda vam se sviđa.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
I can say that it happened	Mogu reći da se to dogodilo
And he is the new father.	I on je novi otac.
I arrived this afternoon.	Stigao sam danas popodne.
He couldn't believe there were so many.	Nije mogao vjerovati da ih ima toliko.
No one was surprised.	Niko nije bio iznenađen.
But I have to go	Ali moram da idem
I could go now.	Mogao bih sada da idem.
I wonder what they did to you	Pitam se šta su ti uradili
I could still tell he wasn’t here	Još uvijek sam mogao reći da nije bio ovdje
But he seemed to feel he had done it.	Ali činilo se da osjeća da je to učinio.
They are not for it.	Oni nisu za to.
I tried.	Pokušao sam.
I mean keep doing better things.	Mislim i dalje raditi bolje stvari.
He has to come.	Mora doći.
I would finish it quickly	Brzo bih to završio
Or does it exist?	Ili postoji?
It felt good to say that.	Bilo je dobro reći to.
But we certainly could have been.	Ali sigurno smo mogli biti.
I know it's not right.	Znam da nije u redu.
I asked him what was wrong	Pitao sam ga šta nije u redu
It's good.	To je dobro.
I think of you too	I ja mislim na tebe
I know what happened	Znam šta se dogodilo
I pray not	Molim se da nije
I would think so.	Ja bih to mislio.
That's all he knows.	To je sve što on zna.
I didn't know why he asked at all	Nisam znao zašto je uopšte pitao
I can't believe what happened	Ne mogu vjerovati šta se dogodilo
In the House.	U kući.
They had no idea why they were here.	Nisu imali pojma zašto su ovdje.
He left.	On je otišao.
It should.	Treba.
I wish him well.	Želim mu dobro.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to učiniti.
I know you probably can't tell me	Znam da mi verovatno ne možeš reći
Do them.	Uradite ih.
I really like it	Stvarno mi se sviđa
I needed more time with him	Trebalo mi je više vremena sa njim
I was there, and it didn’t happen	Bio sam tamo, a to se nije dogodilo
He was surprised to see me.	Bio je iznenađen kad me je vidio.
Like it could still be better or something.	Kao da još može biti bolji ili tako nešto.
For now, it's obvious.	Za sada je očigledno.
I didn't know he was home	Nisam znao da je kod kuće
I wonder.	Pitam se.
But it is.	Ali jeste.
I just want to see you	samo te želim vidjeti
I would never do something like that	Nikad ne bih uradio tako nešto
I see no reason why not	Ne vidim razlog zašto ne bi
You know what they are.	Znaš šta su oni.
But it really happened.	Ali, to se zaista dogodilo.
I totally see why	Potpuno vidim zašto
I wonder if he will come back or it happens often.	Pitam se hoće li se vratiti ili se to često dešava.
I know what she's talking about.	Znam o čemu ona priča.
I haven't told anyone yet what happened	Još nikome nisam rekao šta se dogodilo
I like the way you look	Sviđa mi se kako izgledaš
I only thought of myself.	Mislio sam samo na sebe.
I would ask for nothing more than that	Ne bih tražio ništa više od toga
Not just something right now.	Ne samo nešto trenutno.
Several times.	Nekoliko puta.
I wish you had told me about this	Voleo bih da si mi rekao za ovo
I love seeing this.	Volim vidjeti ovo.
I love these.	Volim ove.
Too many things.	Previše stvari.
You can get it.	Možeš to dobiti.
I think we have enough stuff now	Mislim da sada imamo dovoljno stvari
I just couldn’t believe he did all those things	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati da je uradio sve te stvari
I didn't expect you to come back so soon	Nisam očekivao da ćeš se vratiti tako brzo
He has to do something right.	Mora da radi nešto kako treba.
I knew it was wrong to talk to him	Znao sam da nije u redu razgovarati s njim
I've never done anything like this before.	Nikada ranije nisam radio tako nešto.
I had to know this	Morao sam da znam ovo
I want him there	Želim da bude tamo
There was nothing more we could do	Ništa više nismo mogli učiniti
And neither can you.	A ne možeš ni ti.
Maybe he didn't do it fast enough.	Možda to nije uradio dovoljno brzo.
I guess she knew	Pretpostavljam da je znala
I want to be busy	Želim da budem zauzet
We are better than that.	Mi smo bolji od toga.
I like what he does	Sviđa mi se to što radi
This is you.	Ovo si ti.
I just didn't know that	Samo nisam znao da je tako
I asked him what was going on	Pitao sam ga šta se dešava
I want to go home.	Želim ići kući.
I didn't want that to be true.	Nisam želeo da to bude istina.
It's safe there.	Tamo je sigurno.
I guess we should have seen that	Pretpostavljam da smo trebali to vidjeti
He couldn't at the moment.	Trenutno nije mogao.
We know enough.	Znamo dovoljno.
Too much to say.	Previše za reći.
And no.	I ne.
Apparently, that's what happened.	Očigledno, to se i dogodilo.
I hope you can help me.	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći.
I've already started	Već sam počeo
I already said too much	Već sam rekao previše
You can talk to me.	Možeš razgovarati sa mnom.
I asked her what was wrong	Pitao sam je šta nije u redu
And I thought.	I mislio sam.
Don't you want it to be.	Zar ne želiš da bude.
I was very, very happy that she was with me	Bio sam veoma, veoma sretan što je bila sa mnom
But he wondered.	Ali on se pitao.
He just told me.	Upravo mi je rekao.
But your father was bad.	Ali tvoj otac je bio loš.
But I can't do that.	Ali ja to ne mogu.
And it is.	I jeste.
And you can really tell.	I zaista možete reći.
I couldn't trust anyone	Nisam mogao nikome vjerovati
And there is nothing wrong with that.	I u tome nema ništa loše.
I wasn't sure what to do	Nisam bio siguran šta bi uradio
I haven't had it in so long	Nisam to imao tako dugo
I needed money.	Trebao mi je novac.
Or not.	Ili ne.
I don't see a problem with that.	Ne vidim problem u tome.
I should have known something was really wrong	Trebao sam znati da nešto zaista nije u redu
I'm really not sure why.	Zaista nisam siguran zašto.
I think he's right.	Mislim da je u pravu.
I mean, you can stay	Mislim, možeš ostati
I'm really glad you came	Zaista mi je drago što si došao
I realized what had just happened.	Shvatio sam šta se upravo dogodilo.
I don't think you should	Mislim da ne bi trebao
What did he do with.	Šta je uradio sa.
That is hard.	To je teško.
I think you'll see why	Mislim da ćeš vidjeti zašto
But he went and looked for a job.	Ali on je otišao i tražio posao.
I wanted to help everyone	Htio sam pomoći svima
I wouldn't do this to anyone	Ne bih ovo radio ni sa kim
There must be more to it than that.	Mora da ima više od toga.
I’m sure they wouldn’t be, but they shouldn’t be.	Siguran sam da ne bi bili, ali ne bi trebali biti.
I already admitted it	Već sam priznao
And it happened.	I dogodilo se.
I guess not	Pretpostavljam da ne mora
I had one at home	Imao sam jedan kod kuće
What he wants.	Što hoće.
I think you can do it	Mislim da ti to možeš
He should have.	Trebao je.
And that's the problem.	I to je problem.
I could have come or something	Mogao sam doći ili tako nešto
So we've done a lot.	Tako da smo uradili dosta toga.
You should have seen that.	Trebao si to vidjeti.
Maybe it was just him.	Možda je to bio samo on.
It's here.	Ovdje je.
He has my job.	On ima moj posao.
But not now, not now.	Ali ne sada, ne sada.
We needed you.	Trebali ste nam.
They did it.	Oni su to uradili.
I never know.	Nikad ne znam.
We are safe.	Sigurni smo.
I shouldn't have talked to you like that	Nisam trebao tako razgovarati s tobom
I see this one isn't.	Vidim da ovaj nije.
He doesn't think so.	On ne misli tako.
I know you're not.	Znam da nisi.
She said she would come.	Rekla je da će doći.
And there it is.	I tu je.
But this is not a new problem.	Ali to nije novi problem.
I quite like it	Prilično mi se sviđa
I wouldn't buy them	Ne bih ih kupio
He will come home tomorrow.	Doći će kući sutra.
I said something like that.	Rekao sam tako nešto.
I think so, but not only that	Mislim da, ali ne samo to
I had nothing to ask him	Nisam imao šta da ga pitam
I still like it there, simply or not	I dalje mi se sviđa tamo, jednostavno ili ne
I will never work again	Nikad više neću raditi
He seems to know his job.	Izgleda da zna svoj posao.
He was still with me.	Još je bio sa mnom.
It's just not for me.	To jednostavno nije za mene.
I often thought so.	Često sam tako mislio.
No problem with that.	Nema problema sa tim.
I can be here for you.	Mogu biti ovdje za tebe.
It looks good, really good.	Izgleda dobro, stvarno dobro.
There was no way at all.	Puta uopšte nije bilo.
Not like it was.	Ne kao što je bilo.
But it certainly doesn’t seem that way.	Ali to se sigurno ne čini tako.
They did a really good job	Uradili su zaista dobar posao
I almost did it myself.	Skoro sam to uradio sam.
I couldn't tell what it was	Nisam mogao reći šta je to
I knew immediately who it was	Odmah sam znao ko je to
I know you want this.	Znam da želiš ovo.
I was ready to help.	Bio sam spreman pomoći.
I'm not sure why it doesn't work.	Nisam siguran zašto ne radi.
It's pretty simple.	Prilično je jednostavno.
This should be done immediately, please	Ovo treba da se uradi odmah, molim
I just wasn't sure why.	Samo nisam bio siguran zašto.
He will definitely be back.	Sigurno će se vratiti.
It used to be safe.	Nekada je bilo sigurno.
He thought it was so good.	Mislio je da je tako dobro.
She likes to do it from time to time.	Ona to voli da radi s vremena na vrijeme.
My job was to want things.	Moj posao je bio da želim stvari.
I wasn't the only one	Nisam bio jedini
For me, it was just an idea.	Za mene je to bila samo ideja.
I have no time to be afraid	Nemam koga da se bojim
And if not, why not?	A ako ne, zašto ne?
I can't stay here without you	Ne mogu ostati ovdje bez tebe
I wouldn't expect you to ever see them	Ne bih očekivao da ćeš ih ikada vidjeti
Something small for you	Nešto malo za tebe
He knew he could do it.	Znao je da to može.
I thought fast.	Mislio sam brzo.
He is back.	Vratio se.
As a person.	Kao osoba.
There they are and we.	Tu su oni i mi.
I am very, very good at it	Ja sam jako, jako dobar u tome
I like the way you look	Sviđa mi se kako izgledaš
But I don't know how to do it.	Ali ne znam kako da to uradim.
This is not.	Ovo nije.
I really didn't know what to do.	Zaista nisam znao šta da radim.
But maybe you have something.	Ali možda imaš nešto.
I want to know what's going on.	Želim da znam šta se ovo dešava.
I had to know what was going on.	Morao sam da znam šta se dešava.
But she's not.	Ali ona nije.
I did a lot today.	Danas sam mnogo uradio.
More than you think.	Više nego što mislite.
I was sorry for him	Bilo mi je žao zbog njega
He said he did.	Rekao je da jeste.
I wouldn't do that.	Ne bih to uradio.
I don't like it here or there	Ne sviđa mi se ni ovdje ni tamo
Maybe it still isn't.	Možda i dalje nije.
I won't allow it.	Neću to dozvoliti.
They are given.	Oni su dati.
I didn't see anything	Nisam video ništa
I didn't know why.	Nisam znao zašto.
That's what we do.	To je ono što mi radimo.
It's okay to be there.	U redu je da bude tamo.
Or not enough people.	Ili nema dovoljno ljudi.
I wish it was that simple	Voleo bih da je tako jednostavno
She knew she wanted more from him.	Znala je da želi više od njega.
I would bring him back.	Vratio bih ga.
That's right.	Tako je.
You did it yourself.	Sam si to uradio.
Everything is working properly.	Sve radi kako treba.
I would never be good enough for him	Nikad ne bih bila dovoljno dobra za njega
I was sure he had heard all about it by now	Bio sam siguran da je do sada čuo sve o tome
He could give them.	Mogao bi ih dati.
I knew my life couldn’t go well for long	Znao sam da moj život ne može dugo ići dobro
I doubt.	Sumnjam.
As you probably will.	Kao što ćete vjerovatno i vi.
Maybe we shouldn't trust him.	Možda mu ne bismo trebali vjerovati.
But it doesn't work.	Ali ne radi.
Nobody knows that.	Niko to ne zna.
I didn’t expect him to do that.	Nisam očekivao da će to učiniti.
I'm not done with you.	Nisam završio s tobom.
They didn't do the right thing.	Nisu uradili pravu stvar.
I'm already doing something	Nešto već radim
It was afternoon again.	Ponovo je bilo popodne.
I asked for a lot	Mnogo sam tražio
If you really want to.	Ako zaista želiš.
You know, and this is the first time.	Znate i ovo je prvi put.
Not good enough.	Nije dovoljno dobro.
I'm bad.	Loš sam.
Not like now.	Ne kao što je sada.
She said more.	Rekla je više.
This may or may not have been true.	Ovo je možda bila istina, a možda i nije.
It's not just this morning.	Nije samo jutros.
I knew he was it for me	Znala sam da je on to za mene
It did not happen easily.	Nije se to lako dogodilo.
You are mine.	Ti si moj.
I'm not going any further	Ne idem dalje
I love all these things	Volim sve ove stvari
You, me, everyone.	Ti, ja, svi.
I'm fine.	Imam dobro.
I'm ready to work now	Spreman sam da radim odmah
I have nothing but time	Nemam ništa osim vremena
I never expected you to do anything	Nikad nisam očekivao da ćeš nešto uraditi
Not for me.	Nije za mene.
I mean, it just can’t be done.	Mislim, to se jednostavno ne može uraditi.
I know where you are	znam gdje si
I'm fine.	Dobro sam.
I think you could have done better.	Mislim da si mogao bolje.
No one seems to be home right now.	Čini se da trenutno niko nije kod kuće.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
I promised to help in any way	Obećao sam da ću pomoći na bilo koji način
Do this and that.	Uradi ovo i to.
I had to be ready, to be sure	Morao sam biti spreman, da budem siguran
I'll give it to you.	Ja ću to dati.
It's like anything.	To je kao bilo šta.
I'm glad you said that.	Drago mi je da si to rekao.
I hope he comes back	Nadam se da će se vratiti
They were always there for me.	Uvek su bili tu za mene.
Sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga.
She said she knew.	Rekla je da zna.
Nothing seemed to work.	Činilo se da ništa ne radi.
A friend, who looked more than a friend	Prijatelj, koji je izgledao više od prijatelja
Probably because of the money.	Verovatno zbog novca.
All I want is to be with you again.	Sve što želim je da ponovo budem sa tobom.
But that was the problem.	Ali to je bio problem.
This is the truth.	Ovo je istina.
I can not anymore	Ne mogu više
You are not a father.	Ti nisi otac.
You don't want to know either.	Ni ti ne želiš da znaš.
It really happens.	To se zaista dešava.
I can't do that now	Ne mogu to sada
Not too much.	Ne previše.
I just want to ask.	Samo želim da pitam.
I could go alone.	Mogao bih ići sam.
Indeed, it already is.	Zaista, već jeste.
Something was wrong.	Nešto je bilo u redu.
I didn't say anything.	Nisam rekao ništa.
In fact, we would already be there.	Zapravo, već bismo bili tamo.
He can't go home.	Ne može kući.
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
I wonder if she would be here	Pitam se da li bi bila ovde
I guess he wasn't happy	Pretpostavljam da nije bio sretan
I just wish there were more	Samo bih volio da je bilo više
I didn't even have to ask	Nisam ni morao da pitam
I'm sure of you	Ja sam siguran u tebe
I love having them there	Volim da ih imam tamo
It just doesn’t seem right to me.	Jednostavno mi se ne čini u redu.
You have to do it yourself.	Morate to sami.
I was even sure	Čak sam bio siguran
Not enough money.	Nema dovoljno novca.
They can leave.	Oni mogu otići.
I think she may have been right	Mislim da je možda bila u pravu
I've done that before	I ja sam to već uradio
I really like this guy	Zaista mi se sviđa ovaj momak
I still shouldn't be here	I dalje ne bih trebao biti ovdje
I have a lot	Imam mnogo toga
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
I'm totally fine	Ja sam potpuno dobro
Really, I didn’t have much more to do.	Zaista, nisam imao mnogo više da radim.
I could leave at any time	Mogao sam otići u bilo koje vrijeme
That has to be done.	To se mora uraditi.
I wasn't ready for that yet	Nisam još bio spreman za to
I don't know anymore.	Ne znam više.
I want to do something	Želim nešto da uradim
I began to wonder	Počeo sam da se pitam
I love you all and I love you all very much.	Volim vas sve i volim vas sve jako puno.
Or the way.	Ili način.
No one wanted her to see it.	Niko nije želeo da ona to vidi.
I worked.	Radio sam.
I never thought it would be me.	Nikad nisam mislio da ću to biti ja.
It was simple.	Bilo je jednostavno.
I think you should buy us something	Mislim da bi nam trebao nešto kupiti
It's good to bring them back.	Dobro je vratiti ih.
I never saw, I didn't hear anything	Nikoga nisam video, ništa nisam čuo
I heard more than I saw	Više sam čuo nego vidio
Really, it's not.	Zaista, nije.
I can't be with you	Ne mogu s tobom
But that would take time.	Ali za to bi trebalo vremena.
She wasn't really.	Nije baš bila.
And life is not for that.	A život nije za to.
He has to say everything.	On mora reći sve.
That's what they said.	To su oni rekli.
I lost my life.	Izgubio sam život.
I couldn't say anything	Nisam mogao ništa reći
I didn't say those things	Nisam rekao te stvari
I think he knew.	Mislim da je znao.
I can't come to dinner.	Ne mogu doći na večeru.
I didn't know you'd be here	Nisam znao da ćeš biti ovde
I can only do so much	Mogu samo toliko
I was a little surprised	Bio sam malo iznenađen
I didn't want to love anyone.	Nisam htela nikoga da volim.
Too many times.	Previše puta.
The story is nothing	Priča nije ništa
I would never do something like that	Nikad ne bih uradio tako nešto
And yes, they would know about it.	I da, znali bi za to.
Which was fine with us.	Što je nama bilo u redu.
Too much of both.	Previše oboje.
I want you with me	Želim te sa mnom
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
But I can't say that	Ali ne mogu to reći
I'm glad you saw that.	Drago mi je da si to vidio.
I'm not even done	Nisam ni završio
I came back last year.	Vratio sam se prošle godine.
Just do something.	Samo uradi nešto.
He was home again.	Ponovo je bio kod kuće.
Can you beat him.	Možete li ga pobijediti.
I thought you knew this.	Mislio sam da znate ovo.
I really had it.	Zaista sam ga imao.
Now I am afraid of both of them	Sada ih se bojim oboje
Maybe that's where the problem started.	Možda je tu počeo problem.
I actually like this guy	Zapravo mi se sviđa ovaj momak
I mean really like it.	Mislim stvarno se sviđa.
I have someone right now	Imam nekoga odmah
He just said he did it.	Samo je rekao da je to uradio.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
He always loves me like that.	Uvek me voli tako.
I could see them, but they could not see me	Mogao sam ih vidjeti, ali oni nisu mogli vidjeti mene
I love you all very much	Volim vas sve puno
And there is something else.	A ima još nešto.
I've worked before.	Radio sam i prije.
We have plenty of time.	Imamo dosta vremena.
In fact, maybe more.	U stvari, možda i više.
And they didn't do anything for us.	I ništa nisu uradili za nas.
He couldn't have come at a better time.	Nije mogao doći u bolje vrijeme.
It's not easy to find you.	Nije te lako naći.
I wonder how it will be	Pitam se kako će to biti
I haven't told him yet	Nisam mu još rekla
I'm doing well.	Dobro mi ide.
I didn't hear anything	Nisam čuo ništa
I should have told you a long time ago	Trebao sam ti reći mnogo prije sada
And he is.	I on je.
I know what he wants.	Znam šta hoće.
I don't know what's wrong with me	Ne znam šta je sa mnom
You and I.	Ti i ja.
What you saw was what you got.	Ono što si vidio je ono što si i dobio.
But the game has a lot more than you think.	Ali igra ima mnogo više nego što mislite.
Easy to make, easy to eat.	Lako se pravi, lako se jede.
Maybe you have them.	Možda ih imaš.
I was like that.	Bio sam tako.
I'll even let him help you	Čak ću mu dozvoliti da ti pomogne
I know enough not to do that.	Znam dovoljno da to ne radim.
It was hard for me at times, but it was good	S vremena na vrijeme mi je bilo teško, ali je bilo dobro
I see that no one is	Vidim da niko nije
Maybe you're right.	Možda si u pravu.
I don't think so	Mislim da ništa
It would be difficult.	Bilo bi teško.
I wouldn't want that	Ne bih to želio
But that's not for me.	Ali to nije za mene.
I guess not	Pretpostavljam da nije
But it really works.	Ali stvarno radi.
I hope he doesn't play with me	Nadam se da se ne igra sa mnom
I always thought.	Uvek sam mislio.
He is the one he wants.	On je ona koju on želi.
I have to go.	Moram otići.
I don't think it's bad.	Mislim da nije loše.
I really want you too	I ja tebe zaista želim
Glad to see that you are all well	Drago mi je da vidim da ste svi dobro
I didn't know how to ask	Nisam znao kako da pitam
I've never seen that before.	Nikad to ranije nisam video.
We did our job.	Uradili smo svoj posao.
He knew something he would.	Znao je nešto što bi.
Surely he would have known earlier.	Sigurno bi znao ranije.
This is a job.	Ovo je posao.
Only.	Samo.
I need to know exactly who he is	Moram tačno da znam ko je on
I almost felt sorry for him	Skoro mi ga je bilo žao
I can't say for tomorrow	Ne mogu reći za sutra
You can go back to that as well.	Možete se i vratiti na to.
I had to get back quickly.	Morao sam se brzo vratiti.
It will probably be fine.	Vjerovatno će biti dobro.
I would love to do that	Voleo bih to da uradim
I know you tried here	Znam da si pokušao ovde
We will definitely be back.	Sigurno ćemo se vratiti.
I couldn't do this alone	Ne bih mogao ovo sam
I told him what my father had just said	Rekao sam mu ono što je moj otac upravo rekao
We have to do it.	Moramo to učiniti.
And that is obviously true.	I to je očigledno tačno.
And she will be there.	I ona će biti tamo.
Yes, we have.	Da imamo.
She was mine.	Bila je moja.
In fact, like you.	U stvari, kao ti.
I can not believe.	Ne mogu vjerovati.
Why anyone would come to that, I don't know.	Zašto bi neko do toga došao, ne znam.
I expected everything but this	Očekivao sam sve samo ne ovo
I could be there when he is.	Mogao bih i ja biti tamo kada bude.
I said what I thought.	Ja sam rekao šta mislim.
You can be better there.	Tamo možeš biti bolji.
Which he does.	Što i radi.
He has money.	On ima novca.
I am all you are	Ja sam sve što si ti
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
I know exactly what you are	Znam tačno šta si ti
Everyone we know was there.	Svi koje znamo bili su tamo.
She said no, and he left.	Ona je rekla ne, a on je otišao.
Worked more, made more.	Radio više, napravio više.
It is no longer played	Više se ne igra
I know it and he knows it	Ja to znam i on to zna
I couldn't see well.	Nisam mogao dobro vidjeti.
I should have said something earlier	Trebao sam nešto ranije reći
He even looked good.	Čak je i dobro izgledao.
I'll be right there.	Ja ću odmah.
I had to do this	Morao sam da uradim ovo
That may once have been true, but it is no longer.	To je možda nekada bila istina, ali više nije.
That is what will happen.	To je ono što će se dogoditi.
Nothing bad is happening.	Ništa loše se ne dešava.
I know very well what he will say.	Znam dobro šta će reći.
I didn't do that either	Nisam ni to uradio
She knew who she was and what she was.	Znala je ko je i šta je.
I knew it would be good	Znao sam da će biti dobro
I was ready for it	Bio sam spreman za to
They won't find you here.	Neće te naći ovdje.
I'm just a little.	Ja sam samo malo.
She is not at home.	Ona nije kod kuće.
From him.	Od njega.
I knew there was one for me	Znao sam da ima za mene
And she didn't want to go.	I nije htela da ide.
Really very long	Zaista jako dugo
Certainly not me	Sigurno nisam
As it is.	Kao što jeste.
I seemed to do this often.	Činilo se da ovo često radim.
I didn't see anyone	Nisam nikoga vidio
I will be good for nothing	Ja ću biti dobar ni za šta
I wasn't ready for this	Nisam bio spreman za ovo
It would be.	Bilo bi.
That would be something.	To bi bilo nešto.
But there was no one.	Ali nije bilo nikoga.
I hope we are fine	Nadam se da ćemo biti dobro
And it works.	I radi.
I need him to help me	Treba mi da mi pomogne
I didn’t have time to wonder about it	Nisam imao vremena da se pitam o tome
I just didn't know what was wrong	Samo nisam znao šta nije u redu
I don't know today	Ne znam ni danas
The guy could only do so much	Momak je mogao samo toliko
I can see so much this way	Toliko toga mogu vidjeti na ovaj način
I'm glad you like it	Drago mi je da ti se sviđa
I said what he thought	Rekao sam šta on misli
He never returned.	Nikad se nije vratio.
New life, together	Novi život, zajedno
And you can even say a lot.	I čak možete reći mnogo.
This is real.	Ovo je stvarno.
I had nothing better to do.	Nisam imao ništa bolje da radim.
Maybe things will be fine now.	Možda će stvari sada biti u redu.
Work harder and do better.	Radite više i radite bolje.
No one could find him.	Niko ga nije mogao naći.
I have something.	Imam nešto.
This is obvious.	Ovo je očigledno.
It's just us.	Jednostavno smo mi.
What needed to be done was simple.	Ono što je trebalo uraditi je bilo jednostavno.
I am everything my father could never be	Ja sam sve što otac nikada nije mogao biti
I should be happy about that	Trebao bih biti sretan zbog toga
You don't say no.	Ne kažeš ne.
I just didn't expect it	Jednostavno nisam očekivao
It happened again.	Ponovo se dogodilo.
I guess none of you are right.	Pretpostavljam da niko od vas nije u pravu.
Good story and all	Dobra priča i sve
I thought this was a good idea	Mislio sam da je ovo dobra ideja
I really don't know what to do now	Zaista ne znam šta da radim sada
I had to be busy	Morao sam biti zauzet
I was always tired	Uvek sam bio umoran
I'll tell you something.	Reći ću ti nešto.
No one knew that better than he did.	Niko to nije znao bolje od njega.
I haven't seen him in a long time	Nisam ga dugo video
I want to know how well he's doing.	Želim da znam koliko mu dobro ide.
Just like us.	Baš kao i mi.
Maybe a lot.	Možda mnogo.
I have one problem while doing this	Imam jedan problem dok to radim
I asked her again what was wrong	Ponovo sam je pitao šta nije u redu
You're right, she said.	U pravu si, rekla je.
I only have a little time	Imam samo malo vremena
That's what's there.	To je ono što je tamo.
No, I wouldn't say.	Ne, ne bi rekla.
I'm sorry, but he can't.	Žao mi je, ali ne može.
I had no idea it could be done	Nisam imao pojma da se to može uraditi
Will this work for you.	Hoće li ovo raditi za vas.
That's us.	To smo mi.
Tell me something.	Reci mi nešto.
I think it should be very soon	Mislim da bi to trebalo biti vrlo brzo
I didn't want to see you	Nisam htela da te vidim
I have to tell you.	Moram da ti kažem.
I knew what he was doing.	Znao sam šta radi.
I know he's telling the truth	Znam da govori istinu
They won't get it.	Oni to neće dobiti.
That's a good question.	To je dobro pitanje.
I can give them to you.	Mogu ti ih dati.
I don't like it now.	Ne sviđa mi se sada.
This was good.	Ovo je bilo dobro.
I want him to know that	Želim da on to zna
I shouldn't see this	Ne bi trebalo da vidim ovo
I mean, I'm not sorry you have a date	Mislim, nije mi žao što imaš sastanak
That was it for him.	To je bilo to za njega.
This is you.	Ovo si ti.
I didn't want that	Nisam to htio
That is not the issue being addressed here.	To nije pitanje koje se ovdje radi.
I just want him to know how true that is	Samo želim da zna koliko je to istina
I wouldn't know what to tell him	Ne bih znao šta da mu kažem
And who could it be.	I ko bi to mogao biti.
So many years and years.	Toliko godina i godina.
He's working on it.	On radi na tome.
I lost my job.	Izgubio sam posao.
Maybe a little more.	Možda malo više.
I just wasn’t sure it was a good idea	Samo nisam bio siguran da je to dobra ideja
There is little if both, while nothing.	Ima malo ako oboje, dok nije ništa.
He had a job.	Imao je posao.
He works at home.	Radi kod kuće.
I still do.	I dalje to radim.
Just think of me.	Samo misli na mene.
There is nothing to see here.	Ovde nema šta da se vidi.
I only knew what he told me, that's it	Znao sam samo ono što mi je rekao, to je to
I know that, and you know it.	Ja to znam, i ti to znaš.
I have this code.	Imam ovaj kod.
He went there.	Tamo je otišao.
I probably won't either	Vjerovatno neću ni ja
I have to say something soon	Moram nešto reći uskoro
And you are.	A ti si.
But they will work.	Ali oni će raditi.
He saw a few things when he was there.	Video je nekoliko stvari kada je bio tamo.
I'm not sure why.	Nisam siguran zašto.
There are more.	Ima ih više.
I began to doubt myself	Počeo sam da sumnjam u sebe
I would look for you myself	I sam bih te tražio
You have to tell me what happened.	Moraš mi reći šta se dogodilo.
He saw nothing.	On ništa nije video.
But this is real.	Ali ovo je stvarno.
I thought we might know maybe	Mislio sam da bismo mogli znati možda
I'm afraid that might come.	Bojim se kako bi to moglo doći.
She was a little more.	Bila je malo više.
I'm just happy to be back.	Samo sam sretan što se vratio.
I thought you'd be better off	Mislio sam da bi ti bilo bolje
She didn't want to know that herself.	Ona to sama nije htela da zna.
I said, maybe tomorrow	Rekao sam, možda sutra
I didn't want you to know.	Nisam želeo da znaš.
That's what he wants to do.	To je ono što on želi da uradi.
They said it was nothing.	Rekli su da nije ništa.
He wants to help us.	On želi da nam pomogne.
That's a very good thing.	To je jako dobra stvar.
That's exactly how long we'll be here.	Tačno toliko ćemo biti ovdje.
He really wanted it.	Zaista je to želio.
It's all true.	Sve je to istina.
Maybe he has a problem.	Možda ima problem.
I have to do something	Moram nešto da uradim
Now tell me what you want.	Sada mi reci šta želiš.
I haven't been there in a while	Nisam bio tamo neko vrijeme
I wish we had known about you before	Voleo bih da smo ranije znali za tebe
I said we need to talk.	Rekao sam da moramo razgovarati.
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
So is your car.	Kao i tvoj auto.
It never would be.	Nikada ne bi bilo.
And so she told me.	I tako mi je rekla.
This was not difficult.	Ovo nije bilo teško.
What happened is bad.	Ono što se dogodilo je loše.
That's my only reason.	To je moj jedini razlog.
I didn't know what to do with it.	Nisam znao šta da radim s tim.
I love how easy it is	Volim kako je lako
I should have talked to you	Trebao sam razgovarati s tobom
I know he won't give me anything	Znam da mi neće dati ništa
I just wasn't ready yet	Samo još nisam bio spreman
I have to tell you we need more time	Moram vam reći da nam treba više vremena
I'm not done.	Nisam završio.
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
But the problem is that it is not.	Ali problem je što nije.
I had it here	Imao sam ga ovde
A lot of that.	Puno toga.
I can only hope that is true	Mogu samo da se nadam da je to istina
He obviously said yes	Očigledno je rekao da
This actually happened to me.	Ovo mi se zaista dogodilo.
Not a good idea.	Nije dobra ideja.
He's here.	On je ovdje.
And there was something else.	A bilo je još nešto.
I guess he's not home	Pretpostavljam da nije kod kuće
He said something.	Rekao je nešto.
Not like that anymore.	Ne više tako.
I know that, too	Znam i to treba reći
This can't be good, she told herself.	Ovo ne može biti dobro, rekla je sebi.
I needed a job and I’m still working.	Trebao mi je posao i još uvijek radim.
I wasn't there for him	Nisam bila tu za njega
I know you have a busy life	Znam da imaš zauzet život
And now it's like.	A sada je kao.
I want to be there.	Želim biti tamo.
No problem for now.	Za sada nema problema.
I didn't even understand	Nisam ni shvatio
I decided to play with me	Odlučio sam da se igra sa mnom
That was fine.	To je bilo u redu.
And the radio.	I radio.
I wondered where he was	Pitao sam se gdje je bio
I just couldn’t believe it.	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati.
I never told anyone about that meeting	Nikad nikome nisam rekao za taj sastanak
Probably nothing.	Vjerovatno ništa.
This is.	Ovo je.
I'm a real friend of yours	Ja sam ti pravi prijatelj
I didn't know why at the time.	U to vrijeme nisam znao zašto.
That was the thing.	To je bila stvar.
See what you think.	Vidi šta misliš.
And he would, but he didn't, leave.	I bi, ali nije, otišao.
I just need to know	Samo moram da znam
I know you'll get it	Znam da ćeš dobiti
I know you are.	Znam da jesi.
It wasn't that good.	Nije bilo tako dobro.
That's really it.	To je zaista to.
We are sure of that.	Sigurni smo u to.
We don't know it is.	Ne znamo da jeste.
I knew he would come back	Znao sam da će se vratiti
I don't know how to proceed. 	Ne znam kako dalje.
Nothing works.	Ništa ne radi.
I know everything here	Znam sve ovde
I really don't want to know.	Zaista ne želim da znam.
We can do this.	Možemo ovo.
So that's hard to say.	Tako da je to teško reći.
But it's not fast enough.	Ali to nije dovoljno brzo.
And he loved it.	I to je voleo.
I still didn't know anything	I dalje nisam znao ništa
I've never been so happy.	Nikad nisam bio tako sretan.
I knew she was going to say it and she was right	Znao sam da će to reći i bila je u pravu
I haven't been there in a while	Nisam bio tamo neko vrijeme
I know what you mean.	Znam šta misliš.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.	Možda jeste, možda i nije.
No one knows from whom.	Niko ne zna od koga.
She didn't know, she didn't want to know.	Nije znala, nije htela da zna.
I was when someone loved me	Bio sam koga je neko voleo
This is still difficult.	Ovo je i dalje teško.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I think he can help me	Mislim da mi može pomoći
No one can trust you now.	Niko ti sada ne može vjerovati.
I just don't know who.	Samo ne znam ko.
He was there.	Bio je tamo.
I have no idea why he's there	Nemam pojma zašto je tamo
Many of them are still there.	Mnogo ih je još uvijek tu.
Good and bad.	Dobro i loše.
Tomorrow is a new day.	Sutra je novi dan.
I just wanted to see you	Samo sam te htio vidjeti
He must be gone.	Mora da je otišao.
You don't have to know.	Ne morate znati.
I knew only one of us could go	Znao sam da samo jedan od nas može ići
I do not know.	Ne znam.
But there seems to be no way to do it.	Ali čini se da ne postoji način da se to uradi.
But now tell me something else.	Ali sada mi reci još nešto.
I am working on that.	Radim na tome.
I will go to work and do my job	Otići ću na posao i raditi svoj posao
I was sorry.	Bilo mi je žao.
I can do it at home	Mogu to uraditi kod kuće
I wish it wasn't true, but it is	Voleo bih da nije istina, ali jeste
I didn't know how long	Nisam znao koliko dugo
It doesn't take long.	Ne treba dugo.
But that's just the thing.	Ali to je samo stvar.
I was three years old.	Imao sam tri godine.
I should never do that	Nikada to ne bih trebao raditi
I thought you were coming to me	Mislio sam da ćeš doći kod mene
Something seemed to be waiting.	Činilo se da nešto čeka.
I do everything hard	Sve radim teško
I haven't seen her in years	Nisam je vidio nekoliko godina
Please be okay.	Molim te da bude u redu.
He knew he was wrong.	Znao je da nije u pravu.
I love you too.	Volim i ja tebe.
All right, she knew it wasn't her.	U redu, znala je da to nije ona.
I saw a lot of things	Vidio sam puno stvari
I just couldn't help it.	Jednostavno nisam mogao pomoći.
Really very difficult.	Zaista jako teško.
It never exists.	Nikada ne postoji.
And now this is happening.	I sada se ovo dešava.
A lot could have happened at the time	Mnogo toga se moglo dogoditi u to vrijeme
I love her very much	Volim je mnogo
It's about us.	Radi se o nama.
We know who did it.	Znamo ko je to uradio.
I guess you should, but it's not	Pretpostavljam da bi trebalo, ali nije
I know it's not that simple.	Znam da nije tako jednostavno.
You are here, it is there.	Vi ste ovdje, to je tamo.
I'd like to go with you	Voleo bih da idem sa tobom
I mean nothing to anyone	Mislim nikome ništa
It just can't be you.	To jednostavno ne možeš biti ti.
I didn't know anyone else was here	Nisam znao da je još neko bio ovdje
I think we could this year	Mislim da bismo ove godine mogli
A really good friend.	Zaista dobar prijatelj.
If that was anything at all.	Ako je to uopšte bilo nešto.
I know them.	Znam ih.
That's what I want to be for you	To želim biti za tebe
We won't.	Nećemo .
I want to go alone	Želim da idem sam
I wasn't sure what to do with it	Nisam bio siguran šta da radim s tim
But he didn't want money for himself either.	Ali ni on nije želio novac na sebe.
And you did.	I jesi.
No.	Neću.
But that day may never come.	Ali taj dan možda nikada neće doći.
Nobody wants you here.	Niko te ne želi ovdje.
I think he's playing with us	Mislim da se igra sa nama
But there's a lot going on.	Ali mnogo toga se dešava.
She was there today.	Bila je tamo danas.
I didn't really have it	Nisam ga stvarno imao
I still didn't know what he did, what he did	Još uvijek nisam znao šta je uradio, šta je napravio
That just happened to me.	To mi se upravo dogodilo.
I didn't want money	Nisam želeo novac
I need money, and a lot of it	Treba mi novac, i to dosta
Maybe that could help you.	Možda bi ti to moglo pomoći.
She knew what she was doing.	Znala je šta radi.
And it will be fast.	I to će biti brzo.
I don't want to know what you did	Ne želim da znam šta si uradio
I make them myself, everything	Radim ih sam, sve
I'll help him	Ja ću mu pomoći
I knew what you meant	Znao sam na šta misliš
The reason for that.	Razlog za to.
I can't tell you how	Ne mogu ti reći kako
I didn't know she would do it	Nisam znao da će ona to uraditi
He said he didn't know too much about it.	Rekao je da ne zna previše o tome.
I'm glad it's not just me.	drago mi je da nisam samo ja.
It really works.	Zaista radi.
A friend was with me	Prijatelj je bio sa mnom
So we will definitely be there.	Tako da ćemo sigurno biti tu.
I guess so	Pretpostavljam i sam
He couldn't do anything to us.	Nije nam mogao ništa.
I just have a few things to say	Imam samo nekoliko stvari za reći
It wasn't real! 	Nije bilo stvarno!
he told himself.	rekao je sebi.
But you didn't know.	Ali nisi znao.
He needed me to see the truth and tell it to me.	Trebao mi je da vidi istinu i da mi je kaže.
I couldn't get you	Nisam te mogao dobiti
I must have thought that would never happen	Sigurno sam mislio da se to nikada neće dogoditi
I'm almost done	Skoro sam završio
Like, really, really good.	Kao, stvarno, stvarno dobro.
I really wanted to help you	Zaista sam ti htio pomoći
I ask, but I don't ask	Pitam, ali ne pitam
There are three.	Ima tri.
I will always do all that	Uvek ću sve to raditi
It never works.	Nikad to ne radi.
I know what's going on here	Znam šta se dešava ovde
I wish it had never happened	Voleo sam da se to nikada nije dogodilo
I'll stay here.	Ja ću ostati ovdje.
I didn't come home this morning	Nisam se vratio kući jutros
I didn't think he would really do that	Nisam mislio da će to zaista učiniti
I love you so much	Volim te tako, puno
I hope you can help me.	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći.
I know it wasn't that hard for you	Znam da ti nije bilo tako teško
I didn't do it for you	Nisam to napravio za tebe
I didn't know there was any of that	Nisam znao da ima bilo šta od toga
But he can't.	Ali ne može.
I don't think this was a good idea.	Mislim da ovo nije bila dobra ideja.
I didn't know you were today	Nisam znala da si danas
I already said what happened	Već sam rekao šta se dogodilo
He wasn't here when it happened.	Nije bio ovdje kada se to dogodilo.
I'm not going home tonight	Neću ići kući večeras
He didn't know much.	Nije znao mnogo.
I didn't even know if it was a good thing	Nisam ni znao da li je to dobra stvar
And he would be right.	I bio bi u pravu.
He didn't know he loved.	Nije znao da voli.
I have no idea about that.	Nemam pojma o tome.
Or, not what he wanted for his life.	Ili, ne ono što je želio za svoj život.
Apparently there was very little that this man did not know.	Očigledno je bilo vrlo malo toga što ovaj čovjek nije znao.
So it's okay.	Tako da je u redu.
Not so with us.	Kod nas nije tako.
But not just by saying that.	Ali ne samo tako što to kažeš.
There is someone who wants something.	Postoji ti koji nešto želi.
I don't know, but he can.	Ne znam, ali može.
I'm just doing my job.	Ja samo radim svoj posao.
But he was over thirty.	Ali imao je više od trideset godina.
Maybe there is a better way.	Možda postoji bolji način.
I still am.	I dalje sam.
And life goes on !.	I život ide dalje!.
The money would come.	Novac bi došao.
I know who she is.	Znam ko je ona.
That didn't happen here.	To se ovdje nije dogodilo.
But not now.	Ali ne sada.
I knew you wanted me to be good	Znao sam da želiš da budem dobar
I've never heard of it before.	Nikada ranije nisam čuo za to.
He has to give something.	Nešto mora dati.
I knew you would come to us	Znao sam da ćeš doći do nas
I have no doubt about that.	Ne sumnjam u to.
But that could not be found.	Ali to se nije moglo naći.
Few people can do that.	Malo ljudi to može učiniti.
I would never say anything.	Nikada ne bih ništa rekao.
I went to him and said	Otišao sam do njega i rekao
I'm not afraid of you	Ne bojim te se
You should be here.	Ti bi trebao biti ovdje.
He said he didn't want him.	Rekao je da ga ne želi.
I had to stay home and work	Morao sam ostati kod kuće i raditi
But I didn't know.	Ali nisam znao.
He will say what he wants.	Reći će šta hoće.
I'm going hard right now	Odmah idem teško
I don't know we could see that.	Ne znam da bismo to mogli vidjeti.
It wasn't like that.	Nije bilo tako.
I thought it would always be that way	Mislio sam da će uvijek biti tako
I asked why.	Pitao sam zašto.
I can’t say good enough about it.	Ne mogu reći dovoljno dobro o tome.
Probably would.	Verovatno bi.
I knew what it was like	Znao sam kako je to
They didn't have time.	Nisu imali vremena.
There's nothing we can do tonight.	Ne možemo ništa večeras.
I think it will be good	Mislim da će biti dobro
I wondered too	I ja sam se pitao
We're glad you're here.	Drago nam je da ste ovdje.
I got the job.	Dobio sam posao.
I have no idea where we are	Nemam pojma gdje smo
Not that he would.	Ne da bi.
I have to go now	Moram da idem odmah
I have to tell him the real truth	Moram mu reći pravu istinu
Not all, no.	Ne sve, ne.
Not good, not bad.	Nije dobro, nije loše.
He needed that.	To mu je trebalo.
He never wants to talk to me again.	Nikada više ne želi razgovarati sa mnom.
I just need time	Samo mi treba vremena
Except for him.	Osim njega.
I don't even know the reason	Ne znam ni razlog
This time you will.	Ovaj put hoćeš.
I'll say it again.	Reći ću to ponovo.
But he doesn't work anymore.	Ali on više ne radi.
I couldn't know	Nisam mogao znati
I wouldn't say.	Ne bi rekla.
I love her very much.	Volim je mnogo.
I wondered if I could see me	Pitao sam se mogu li me vidjeti
I'm usually here alone	Obično sam ovde sam
This was not a good thing.	Ovo nije bila dobra stvar.
He had done it before.	Radio je to i ranije.
Maybe that's it.	Možda je to to.
I didn't even ask him	Nisam ga ni zamolio
That's your way.	To je tvoj put.
It is not enough to just say.	Nije dovoljno samo reći.
I want to be there right now	Želim biti tamo upravo sada
I can not anymore	Ne mogu više
That was the problem.	To je bio problem.
It was just too much.	Bilo je to jednostavno previše.
I think he likes it	Mislim da mu se sviđa
Must be.	Mora biti.
That's the only way.	To je jedini način.
I can't have dinner	Ne mogu na večeru
I can't do this alone	Ne mogu ovo sam
I think it will always stay with me	Mislim da će to uvijek ostati sa mnom
Not with him.	Ne sa njim.
It wasn't easy for me, you know.	Nije mi bilo lako, znaš.
I know he can do more	Znam da može više
If.	Ako.
I would tell you that it is	Rekao bih vam o tome da jeste
She was only there for me.	Bila je tu samo za mene.
Anyone would do that.	To bi bilo ko uradio.
Years if you need that much.	Godine ako vam treba toliko.
I wondered what he really thought	Pitao sam se šta on zaista misli
I couldn't be with anyone	Nisam mogao biti ni sa kim
And that was not a problem.	I to nije bio problem.
Do what you have to do with me.	Uradi šta moraš sa mnom.
We are simply human.	Mi smo jednostavno ljudi.
I'm very sorry.	Jako mi je žao.
We're not sure which ones.	Nismo sigurni koje.
Nobody knows anything.	Niko ništa ne zna.
I know him well.	Znam ga dobro.
I heard about you.	Čuo sam za tebe.
My life was here.	Moj život je bio ovdje.
And this was not the first time.	I ovo nije bilo prvi put.
This was life as usual.	Ovo je bio život kao i obično.
I saw no one and nothing	Nisam vidio nikoga i ništa
Not until today.	Ne do danas.
Obviously you are.	Očigledno jesi.
He told me what he needed.	Rekao mi je šta mu treba.
I love seeing it.	Volim to vidjeti.
It wasn't meant to be.	Nije trebalo da bude tako.
But you never know what will happen.	Ali nikad ne znaš šta će se dogoditi.
I still have time	Još imam vremena
He can't find her.	Ne može je naći.
I can't say more about it	Ne mogu reći više o tome
That's what happened.	To je ono što se dogodilo.
Or how he will ever be okay.	Ili kako će on ikada biti u redu.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
Even without me.	Čak i bez mene.
We still have time.	Još imamo vremena.
I won't be a problem	Neću biti problem
I'm glad to be back at work.	Drago mi je što sam se vratio na posao.
I just didn't know how to tell you	Samo nisam znao kako da ti kažem
It sure is.	Sigurno jeste.
I had to find you again	Morao sam te ponovo naći
That could be what you want.	To bi moglo biti ono što želiš.
If it works.	Ako radi.
I was not allowed to see him	Nije mi bilo dozvoljeno da ga vidim
I would never know what he wants	Nikad ne bih znao šta želi
I knew what was going on.	Znao sam šta se dešava.
That's how he lives for three years.	Tako i živi i to tri godine.
So it seems to be fine.	Tako da izgleda da je u redu.
And he says no.	I on kaže ne.
I need to talk to you	Moram razgovarati s tobom
That's it and more.	To je to i više.
The question was what to do with it.	Pitanje je bilo šta učiniti s tim.
I wish I could trust you	Želim da ti mogu vjerovati
I'm not even sure that's true.	Nisam ni siguran da je to tačno.
Must be.	Mora biti.
They know who they are.	Oni znaju ko su.
I know what she thinks.	Znam šta ona misli.
That's very good of you.	To je jako dobro od tebe.
We can.	Možemo.
You're like me.	Ti si kao ja.
Currently the code is not working properly.	Trenutno kod ne radi kako treba.
He said.	On je rekao.
It just couldn't.	Jednostavno nije moglo.
It wasn't right.	Nije bilo u redu.
You can go.	Možete ići.
I think you just have to talk to him	Mislim da samo moraš razgovarati s njim
He will be there.	On će biti tamo.
I wasn't the only one	Nisam bio jedini
He didn't try.	Nije pokušao.
I think that's pretty good	Mislim da je to prilično dobro
In fact, you can.	Zapravo možeš.
I can almost see that one	Skoro da vidim taj
That was the problem.	Tu je bio problem.
I hope not too much	Nadam se da nije previše
Yes, he knew that.	Da, znao je to.
She would know what to do.	Znala bi šta da radi.
I can't tell you here	Ne mogu ti reći ovdje
I still need something from you	Još mi treba nešto od tebe
We were in it.	Bili smo u tome.
I can easily do that for you	Lako to mogu uraditi za tebe
I really think he meant what he said	Zaista mislim da je mislio ono što je rekao
There is a lot in that.	Ima mnogo toga u tome.
So are we.	I mi smo.
And maybe happy to see her.	I možda sretan što je vidi.
It seems to have happened here.	Čini se da se to dogodilo ovdje.
We probably do that.	To radimo vjerovatno.
I know what she can do	Znam šta ona može
I don't love myself.	Ne volim sebe.
I mean, it is.	Mislim, jeste.
I haven't seen them in years	Nisam ih vidio nekoliko godina
I really thought she would stay	Stvarno sam mislio da će ona ostati
It never works.	Nikad ne radi.
No one worked like him.	Niko nije radio kao on.
Maybe not.	Možda i ne bi.
You lost your job.	Izgubio si posao.
But that's the way it is.	Ali to je tako.
I'm just happy to hear from you.	Samo sam sretan što sam se čuo s tobom.
I know what's good for me	Znam šta je dobro za mene
It seems so obvious now.	Sada izgleda tako očigledno.
We had it last week.	Imali smo ga prošle sedmice.
It's not what you think it is.	Nije ono što mislite da jeste.
To everyone? 	Svima?
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
I heard about him, he heard about me.	Čuo sam za njega, on je čuo za mene.
Or maybe it was more than that.	Ili je možda bilo više od toga.
What he could and could not do.	Šta je mogao, a šta nije mogao.
And she will help you.	I ona će ti pomoći.
That actually works better for me.	To mi zapravo bolje ide.
Just to say it like it's nothing.	Samo da to kažem kao da nije ništa.
He didn't work often.	Nije često radio.
Something more.	Nešto više.
I think this is the right path.	Mislim da je ovo pravi put.
You arrived on time.	Stigao si na vrijeme.
He said he just couldn't.	Rekao je da jednostavno ne može.
It still doesn't work.	I dalje ne ide.
This is not him.	Ovo nije on.
I didn't do anything this morning	Jutros nisam ništa uradio
I wouldn't hear of it.	Ne bi čuo za to.
It can help.	Može pomoći.
Now I know he would want that for me	Sada znam da bi on to želio za mene
I think he did it for me.	Mislim da je to uradio za mene.
I knew that must have been the reason	Znao sam da je to morao biti razlog
That was true.	To je bila istina.
I knew you wouldn't be here long	Znao sam da nećeš dugo biti ovdje
I wonder why she knows those things	Pitam se zašto ona zna te stvari
I know she knows what's going on	Znam da ona zna šta se dešava
It was necessary to see everything.	Trebalo je vidjeti sve.
He certainly would never give me a reason.	On mi sigurno nikad ne bi dao razlog.
I wish more people were doing this.	Voleo bih da više ljudi ovo radi.
It's true.	To je istina.
He would have to do so much.	Toliko bi morao da uradi.
Nobody likes that.	To niko ne voli.
I really like it here	Stvarno mi se sviđa ovdje
You have a way with him.	Imaš način sa njim.
I think we should stay here	Mislim da bi trebali ostati ovdje
I've never seen that either	Ni ja to nikad nisam vidio
I'd like to know what you're doing.	Voleo bih da znam šta radiš.
I was the first.	Ja sam bio prvi.
I always thought so	Uvek sam mislio da je tako
No one had anything to say about color.	Niko nije imao šta da kaže o boji.
I know exactly what happened	Znam tačno šta se dogodilo
I always did the right thing	Uvek sam radio pravu stvar
I need to find someone	Moram naći nekoga
There was something small.	Nešto malo nije bilo.
Being, he's here.	Biti, on je ovdje.
I know you know how it is	Znam da znaš kako je
I wish it wasn't so	Voleo bih da nije tako
But he had it in him.	Ali imao je to u sebi.
But as it was, it was good.	Ali kako je bilo, bilo je dobro.
It wasn't necessary.	Nije trebalo.
Really, really.	Stvarno, stvarno.
I don't think so	Mislim da nije
I hadn’t thought of anything about it before.	Ranije nisam mislio ništa o tome.
He had never seen it that way.	Nikada to nije tako vidio.
I thought you were.	Mislio sam da jesi.
I couldn’t find much about it.	Nisam mogao naći mnogo o tome.
Obviously I would like to know why.	Očigledno bih volio da znam zašto.
I wondered who he might be	Pitao sam se ko bi on mogao biti
It's been years, hasn't it.	Prošle su godine, zar ne.
I don't know, maybe it takes more time.	Ne znam, možda treba više vremena.
No problem so far.	Nema problema do sada.
I knew what he could do	Znao sam šta može da uradi
I guess you were in it at the time	Pretpostavljam da ste bili u tome u to vrijeme
I don't need money.	Ne treba mi novac.
I didn't mean to do that	Nisam mislio to učiniti
I'm sorry to do that.	Žao mi je što to radim.
I did the job myself	Sam sam uradio posao
We have to hurry.	Moramo brzo.
And you are not.	A ti nisi.
I do not know what to do	ne znam šta da radim
He knows that.	On to zna.
He did it very, very well.	Uradio je to veoma, veoma dobro.
But there was little they could do.	Ali malo su toga mogli učiniti.
And that's what we're going to do today.	I to je ono što ćemo učiniti danas.
The only way to do that is to work.	Jedini način da to uradite je da radite.
I was just wondering, that's all	Samo sam se pitao, to je sve
And it is.	I to je.
You want to.	Želite.
And maybe she was.	A možda je i bila.
I couldn't even go to school	Nisam mogao ni u školu
That's my problem.	To je moj problem.
He should go.	Trebao bi da ide.
I won't do it again	Neću to više raditi
But not like me.	Ali ne kao ja.
And now it was all over.	A sada je sve bilo.
Everything will be fine.	Sve će biti u redu.
I hope it works for you!	Nadam se da radi za vas!
He has to go home now.	Mora da ide kući sada.
'Yes !.	'Ja!.
It can be said.	Može se reći.
We really don't know for sure.	Zaista ne znamo sigurno.
I still didn't have a job	I dalje nisam imao posao
Man, that was for sure	Čovjek, to je bilo sigurno
I see it, everyone can	Ja to vidim, svi mogu
I guess it happened now.	Pretpostavljam da se to sada dogodilo.
I don't want any more.	Ne želim više.
And this is actually true.	I ovo je zapravo istina.
Or maybe we won't.	Ili možda nećemo.
I could stay or come back	Mogao bih ostati ili se vratiti
This is obvious.	Ovo je očigledno.
I wonder what he can get	Pitam se šta on može dobiti
He had such a good day too.	I on je imao tako dobar dan.
We can do it.	Mi to možemo uraditi.
I didn’t know something like that was going to happen	Nisam znao da će se tako nešto dogoditi
It happens.	To se dešava.
You won't get it.	Nećeš to dobiti.
I guess he knows what he's doing	Pretpostavljam da zna šta radi
I couldn't believe it	Nisam mogao vjerovati u to
I'm going here.	Ja idem ovde.
And yes, I got them! 	I da, dobio sam ih!
And she wasn't the only one.	I nije bila jedina.
in fact, I am completely happy now !!.	u stvari, sada sam potpuno sretan!!.
It's really that simple.	Zaista je tako jednostavno.
Someone is doing it.	Neko to radi.
We have time.	Imamo vremena.
I knew she wouldn't give him anything	Znao sam da mu neće dati ništa
I didn't even know the truth	Nisam ni znao istinu
None of us are.	Niko od nas nije.
I can help you do that if you want	Mogu ti pomoći da to uradiš ako želiš
This time he didn't come.	Ovaj put nije došao.
He says nothing happened.	Kaže da se ništa nije dogodilo.
Better.	Bolje.
She wants it.	Ona to želi.
I can do better than that	Mogu bolje od toga
I shouldn't have done that	Nisam to trebao učiniti
I wonder why he was here	Pitam se zašto je bio ovdje
He was absolutely right.	Bio je potpuno u pravu.
I have to stay here a little longer	Moram ostati ovdje još malo
I don't know what is true.	Ne znam šta je tačno.
I knew what it was all about	Znao sam o čemu se zapravo radi
But you have to know the truth.	Ali morate znati istinu.
Or maybe he's in the house.	Ili je možda u kući.
And that's not a bad job.	I to nije loš posao.
It can still happen to me.	Još uvijek mi se može dogoditi.
You have to go back to school with us.	Morate se vratiti u školu s nama.
I really didn't want to go	Zaista nisam htio ići
I hope my team is good this year	Nadam se da je moj tim dobar ove godine
Maybe I just want you for myself	Možda te želim samo za sebe
I heard you.	Čuo sam te.
I had to do it just to see	Morao sam to da uradim samo da vidim
I shouldn't be here at all, really	Uopšte ne bih trebao biti ovdje, zaista
I didn't even know what was wrong with him	Nisam ni znao šta mu je
There's something more to it.	Ima tu nešto više.
I didn't have to do anything	Nisam trebao ništa da uradim
That was all for him.	Za njega je to bilo sve.
Again.	Ponovo.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Nisam siguran šta se dešava.
Who would say such a thing.	Ko bi rekao tako nešto.
I didn't see you there	Nisam te vidio tamo
They wouldn't be the first.	Ne bi bili prvi.
More than likely both.	Više nego vjerovatno oboje.
It's hard to find him anymore.	Teško ga je više naći.
He made one.	Napravio je jedan.
He was actually a fine guy.	On je zapravo bio u redu momak.
You will find that too.	Naći ćete i to.
I mean, it has it all.	Mislim, ima sve.
You can't tell if it's a meeting.	Ne možete reći da li je to sastanak.
You're right.	Ti si u pravu.
And some of it was.	I nešto od toga je bilo.
I was pretty good there	Bio sam prilično dobar tamo
He started again.	Počeo je ponovo.
That's a bad job, you know.	To je loš posao, znaš.
Maybe that was it.	Možda je to bilo to.
I knew you were fine	Znao sam da si dobro
Tell him that about me.	Reci mu to za mene.
I didn't even have a job	Nisam ni imao posao
And that's exactly it.	I to je upravo to.
You have to come and see.	Morate doći i vidjeti.
Maybe, maybe not.	Možda, možda ne.
And for sure.	I to sigurno.
Nobody had to know.	Niko nije morao da zna.
I didn't mean that or anything	Nisam mislio to ili ništa
He had never done that before.	Nikad to ranije nije uradio.
You can't see anything.	Ne možete vidjeti ništa.
It could be, he said.	Moglo bi biti, rekao je.
He said nothing.	Ništa nije rekao.
I didn't think it would be, but it really is	Nisam mislio da će biti, ali zaista jeste
I wondered who to be	Pitao sam se ko da budem
I have more to tell you	Imam više da ti kažem
He just got lost.	Samo se izgubio.
In fact, it wasn't bad.	Zapravo, to nije bilo loše.
He's gone tonight.	Večeras ga nema.
I knew exactly what was going to happen	Tačno sam znao šta će se dogoditi
How good it is that I did this.	Kako je dobro što sam ovo uradio.
I really need to know	Zaista moram da znam
I had no idea he could do something like that.	Nisam imao pojma da bi mogao da uradi tako nešto.
I figured out what he was doing	Shvatio sam šta radi
She's still there.	Ona je još tamo.
I want you, you want me	Želim te, ti želiš mene
We work with everyone.	Radimo sa svima.
I do not have time for that.	Nemam vremena za to.
I don't think there's anything wrong with me.	Mislim da sa mnom ništa nije u redu.
Something very small.	Nešto vrlo malo.
I can't believe they know there	Ne mogu vjerovati da tamo znaju
You loved school.	Voleo si školu.
That's a good story.	To je dobra priča.
I would, if I were	Ja bih, da sam ja
I don't have to tell you that	Ne moram vam to reći
I see it.	Vidim to.
I can do better for you	Mogu ti bolje
Good, he said.	Dobro, rekao je.
But that was none of my business.	Ali to nije bila moja stvar.
I know exactly what she would say	Znam tačno šta bi rekla
I know you have to do this alone	Znam da ovo treba da uradiš sam
Now we're going to do something you want.	Sada ćemo uraditi nešto što želite.
You're never home.	Nikad nisi kod kuće.
They didn't.	Nisu.
But everything is fine.	Ali sve je u redu.
Don't tell me if you don't want to.	Nemoj mi reći ako ne želiš.
I really like that about you	To mi se stvarno sviđa kod tebe
I knew something had happened	Znao sam da se nešto dogodilo
And he should have.	I trebao je.
Obviously, that was not true.	Očigledno, to nije bila istina.
I heard about it this morning	Čuo sam za to jutros
Why .	Zašto .
What did you say.	Šta si rekao.
Maybe the only thing.	Možda jedina stvar.
So I don't really like it.	Tako da mi to baš i ne ide.
I can't trust you anymore	Ne mogu ti više vjerovati
It can be done good or bad.	Može se uraditi dobro ili loše.
It's pretty simple.	Prilično je jednostavno.
We have to do it now.	Moramo to uraditi sada.
Or it should have been.	Ili je trebalo da bude.
Good is not good enough.	Dobro nije dovoljno dobro.
I saw it happen	Video sam da se to dešava
In a few years.	Za nekoliko godina.
I had to work on myself and be someone	Morao sam da radim na sebi i da budem neko
There is a time.	Postoji neko vrijeme.
Now I never would.	Sada nikada ne bi.
I just didn't say anything.	Samo nisam ništa rekao.
I have a lot more	Imam još puno toga
There he said more than he asked.	Tamo je rekao više nego što je tražio.
He must be scared.	Sigurno se boji.
I understood the question.	Shvatio sam pitanje.
Too much time.	Previše vremena.
But very, very fast.	Ali veoma, veoma brzo.
I wish I knew more.	Voleo bih da znam više.
I hope it's not because of me	Nadam se da nije zbog mene
I thought you were my friend too	I ja sam mislio da si mi prijatelj
It was you.	To si bio ti.
It still won't be long enough.	Još uvijek neće biti dovoljno dugo.
I would love to, but.	Voleo bih, ali.
I know what you mean	Znam šta misliš
It's all true.	Sve je to istina.
That's what he said.	To je i on rekao.
I couldn't believe what I just saw	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta sam upravo vidio
I realized he was right	Shvatio sam da je u pravu
A little here, a little there.	Malo ovde, malo tamo.
I guess you could.	Pretpostavljam da bi mogao.
I think there is someone else	Mislim da postoji još neko
I had no idea how long	Nisam imao pojma koliko dugo
We're leaving now.	Sada ćemo otići.
Or maybe it would.	Ili možda bi.
I know it's hard.	Znam da je teško.
I hope nothing happened	Nadam se da se ništa nije dogodilo
I am yours and you are mine	Ja sam tvoj, a ti si moj
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
I couldn't do this again	Nisam mogao ovo ponovo
He is absolutely right.	On je potpuno u pravu.
It should be easy.	Trebalo bi biti lako.
I was happy okay.	Bio sam sretan u redu.
Everyone is in it.	Svi su u tome.
If anyone needs to have it, they should.	Ako neko treba da ga ima, trebalo bi.
Maybe a little better.	Možda malo bolje.
I wish you had told me	Voleo bih da si mi rekao
This is the problem.	Ovo je problem.
But it's none of my business.	Ali nije moja stvar.
He did it.	On je to uradio.
And he loves his job	I voli svoj posao
I guess that's a good thing	Pretpostavljam da je to dobra stvar
No, it wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
I don't know what it was	Ne znam šta je to bilo
Not on me, I think.	Ne na mene, mislim.
We were the first.	Bili smo prvi.
I really have no idea how	Zaista nemam pojma kako
He didn't hear anything.	Nije čuo ništa.
I couldn't before.	Nisam mogao ranije.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
It may be enough for both.	Možda će biti dovoljno za oboje.
It has to me.	Mora me.
I love her as always	Volim je kao i uvek
She said she wouldn't allow it.	Rekla je da to neće dozvoliti.
And I seem to have done well	I ja sam izgleda dobro uradio
I'm not afraid of you	Ne bojim te se
He's not that bad.	On nije tako loš.
But this does not seem to be easy.	Ali ovo ne izgleda kao da će biti lako.
It works very well.	Radi jako dobro.
He said he couldn't.	Rekao je da ne može.
I could see how he was feeling	Mogao sam vidjeti kako se osjeća
I knew that well.	Znao sam to dobro.
You know it's me.	Znaš da sam ja.
Everyone is there.	Svi su tamo.
Maybe they should have stayed together.	Možda su trebali ostati zajedno.
I knew there were many.	Znao sam da ima mnogo.
She didn't want to.	Nije htela.
This does not happen often, but enough to be a problem.	Ovo se ne dešava često, ali dovoljno da bude problem.
I wanted to be busy	Htio sam biti zauzet
You can believe it by having to.	Možete vjerovati tako što ćete morati.
I was just wondering	Samo sam se pitao
It wouldn't take long.	Ne bi trebalo dugo.
You shouldn't do this.	Ne bi trebao ovo da radiš.
I think it works well.	Mislim da dobro radi.
There was no question of saying no.	Nije bilo pitanje reći ne.
I couldn't stay there	Nisam mogao ostati tamo
But they shouldn't.	Ali ne bi trebali.
What can I do about this? 	Šta mogu učiniti za ovo?
I couldn't reach him	Nisam mogao doći do njega
It still exists for me.	Za mene i dalje postoji.
I just want to know how it is	Samo želim da znam kako je
So it was here.	Tako je bilo i ovdje.
He had a lot of time.	Imao je puno vremena.
Nothing has ever been so simple.	Nikada ništa nije bilo tako jednostavno.
It happens to me.	Dešava mi se.
Or maybe so.	Ili možda tako.
I can give you everything here	Mogu ti dati sve ovdje
I mean besides me	Mislim osim mene
I'm afraid.	Bojim se.
I'm so sorry, people	Jako mi je žao, ljudi
He knew for a long time.	Znao je dugo vremena.
It is allowed to exist.	Dozvoljeno je da postoji.
I had no idea things were so bad	Nisam imao pojma da su stvari tako loše
He doesn't know how good he is.	Ne zna koliko je dobar.
I have time	Imam vremena
But this morning he was safe, if never before.	Ali jutros je bio siguran, ako nikad prije.
I was pretty sure it would be okay	Bio sam prilično siguran da će to biti u redu
I have a lot of them too	I ja ih imam dosta
I love my life right now	Trenutno volim svoj život
No one had more.	Niko nije imao više.
I think you did it here	Mislim da si to uradio ovde
I thought maybe it was yours	Mislio sam da je možda tvoj
I expected a lot and got a lot more.	Očekivao sam mnogo i dobio mnogo više.
There are too many.	Ima ih previše.
I think that says a lot	Mislim da to mnogo govori
Maybe nothing.	Možda ne ništa.
And you shouldn't.	I ne bi trebalo.
I like it just for myself	Sviđa mi se samo zbog sebe
I was a father	Bio sam otac
I have no idea who it is	Nemam pojma ko je to
I don't go often.	Ne idem često.
Everything he said is true.	Sve što je rekao je istina.
He had a job for me.	Imao je posao za mene.
It's like .	To je kao da .
I didn't see what it was	Nisam video šta je to
That wouldn’t happen right away.	To se ne bi dogodilo odmah.
Now I know.	Sada znam.
In fact, he loved them.	U stvari, volio ih je.
This time he had done it before.	Ovaj put je to već ranije radio.
I couldn't see who it was	Nisam mogao da vidim ko je to
I'm not that bad at that either.	Ni ja nisam tako loš u tome.
He will never return.	Nikad se neće vratiti.
You really like it.	Stvarno ti se sviđa.
Very bad.	Baš loše.
Now let me tell you something.	Sada da ti kažem nešto.
And you do it very well.	I radiš to veoma dobro.
I was never good at it either	Ni ja nikad nisam bio dobar u tome
That's what it's for.	To je ono za šta je.
I didn't even know he had it	Nisam ni znao da ga ima
It was just.	Bilo je samo.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda neće.
Can you believe it?	Možeš li vjerovati.
I think this is a good idea.	Mislim da je ovo dobra ideja.
Maybe no one knew who he was.	Možda niko nije znao ko je on.
It can't be helped.	Ne može se pomoći.
If that's what you want.	Ako je to ono što želiš.
I didn’t have time to be happy they were alive	Nisam imao vremena da budem sretan što su živi
You can do it yourself.	Možete to učiniti sami.
I asked where he was	Pitao sam gdje je
I lost so many things.	Izgubio sam toliko stvari.
But no one knows.	Ali niko to ne zna.
Don't do it now.	Ne radi to sada.
I knew you would leave	Znao sam da ćeš otići
I couldn't tell which one	Nisam mogao reći koji
I couldn't be sure.	Nisam mogao biti siguran.
But who is sure that it should not be.	Ali ko je siguran da ne bi trebalo.
The radio worked.	Radio je radio.
I hope it will be easy for you today	Nadam se da će vam danas biti lako
She knew immediately that she was right.	Odmah je znala da je u pravu.
He knew it so well.	Znao je to tako dobro.
Good, good, good.	Dobro, dobro, dobro.
This is happening.	Ovo se dešava.
I should say that more than usual is better	Trebao bih reći da je više nego obično bolje
I didn’t expect to go home so soon.	Nisam očekivao da ću tako brzo otići kući.
I told him to do it for me	Rekao sam mu da to uradi za mene
It was supposed to be.	Trebalo je da bude.
But it is.	Ali jeste.
I hope he's not gone yet	Nadam se da nije već otišao
And they knew it.	I oni su to znali.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
I was already pretty sure, but I wasn't sure who	Već sam bio prilično siguran, ali nisam bio siguran ko
And we still have that today.	I to imamo i danas.
You should see someone.	Trebao bi vidjeti nekoga.
And she does.	I ona to radi.
I was never good enough	Nikad nisam bio dovoljno dobar
I'm not done.	Nisam završio.
Nobody told me.	Niko mi nije rekao.
It is very difficult to see.	Vrlo je teško vidjeti.
But that's not right.	Ali to nije u redu.
I could never have done it without him	Nikada to ne bih mogao bez njega
That was easy.	To je bilo lako.
I was here a few years ago, but I had to leave	Bio sam ovdje prije nekoliko godina, ali sam morao otići
It was a car.	Bio je to auto.
And yes, on time.	I da, na vrijeme.
And you would be right.	I bili biste u pravu.
I can't believe you did this to me	Ne mogu vjerovati da si mi to uradio
Now tell me what you know.	Sada mi reci šta znaš.
They are still wrong.	Još uvijek nisu u pravu.
I think we'll be fine	Mislim da ćemo biti u redu
I just need to know who will do what.	Samo treba da znam ko će šta raditi.
That is very obvious.	To je vrlo očigledno.
No, he saw it.	Ne, video je.
I'll tell you what he had.	Reći ću ti šta je imao.
This is the truth.	Ovo je istina.
I can't tell you more	Ne mogu vam reći više
Maybe you can make him like it more	Možda možete učiniti da mu se to više sviđa
I was really surprised	Bio sam zaista iznenađen
I wouldn't ask for help or stuff	Ne bih tražio pomoć ili stvari
That's not enough for me.	To mi nije dovoljno.
My car worked really, really well.	Moj auto je radio jako, jako dobro.
I've heard enough.	Čuo sam dovoljno.
It will continue to be so.	Tako će i dalje biti.
I love having them here with me	Volim da ih imam ovde sa mnom
But I see that happening.	Ali vidim da se to dešava.
He does them well.	On ih dobro radi.
I couldn't see him.	Nisam mogao da ga vidim.
I wasn't ready to know	Nisam bio spreman da znam
We can not.	Ne možemo.
A lot of people love this.	Mnogo ljudi voli ovo.
I don't know if there is more.	Ne znam da li još ima.
I just thought he would always be here	Samo sam mislio da će uvijek biti ovdje
I began to wonder why this was so	Počeo sam da se pitam zašto je to tako
I guess it would be you	Pretpostavljam da bi to bio ti
I told him exactly what happened	Rekao sam mu šta se tačno dogodilo
I probably always will be	Verovatno ću uvek biti
A lot more	Mnogo više
First time for that, for him.	Prvi put za to, za njega.
They would do what he asked.	Oni bi uradili šta je tražio.
I decided to come home	Odlučio sam doći kući
You don't want to do that.	Vi ne želite to da radite.
I see you're back	Vidim da si se vratio
Maybe not.	Možda i nisu.
I'm the only one who can do this.	Ja sam jedini koji ovo može.
I asked what you mean, that's all	Pitao sam na šta misliš, to je sve
I don't want to do these things	Ne želim da radim ove stvari
They are a good team.	Oni su dobar tim.
He didn't need it.	Nije mu trebalo.
I didn't know what was going to happen to me	Nisam znao šta će mi se dogoditi
I took it as a yes	Ja sam to shvatio kao da
You never knew what would happen to him next.	Nikada niste znali šta će se dalje dogoditi s njim.
So he does what he said.	Tako da radi ono što je rekao.
And he saw it.	I video je.
It won't be.	Neće biti.
But how, we said.	Ali kako, rekli smo.
I've never heard of one before	Nikada ranije nisam čuo za jedan
I'll be fine again soon.	Uskoro ću ponovo biti dobro.
I really didn't know what to think at the moment	Zaista trenutno nisam znao šta da mislim
It could have been anyone.	Mogao je biti bilo ko.
Or it happens so fast.	Ili se dešava tako brzo.
I didn't do it for the money	Nisam to uradio zbog novca
He's not very good at it.	Nije baš dobar u tome.
I think he is too.	Mislim da je i on.
Just don't say anything.	Samo nemoj ništa reći.
It only took me a few more days	Trebalo mi je još samo nekoliko dana
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
Maybe not much, but.	Možda ne mnogo, ali.
The weather was bad.	Vrijeme je bilo loše.
I'm sure it's something obvious.	Siguran sam da je to nešto očigledno.
I don't know exactly what she's doing.	Ne znam tačno šta ona radi.
It's not about that.	Ne radi se o tome.
I'm going there	Idem tamo
He did it often.	Često je to radio.
I decided to go with it	Odlučio sam da idem s tim
He knows so much.	Toliko zna.
I don't know what he said	Ne znam šta je rekao
I would love to go home too	I ja bih volio ići kući
It's so good to see.	Tako je dobro vidjeti.
He thought he knew the way.	Mislio je da zna put.
I was a little sorry for him	Bilo mi ga je malo žao
But we know.	Ali znamo.
I think that's for sure	Mislim da je to sigurno
She makes it look so easy.	Ona čini da izgleda tako lako.
But we can't go back now.	Ali sada se ne možemo vratiti.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Nije prvi put da se to dogodilo.
Maybe in years.	Možda za godine.
It's all together.	Sve je zajedno.
Where to go.	Gdje ići.
I wasn't sure why that was true	Nisam bio siguran zašto je to tačno
I just wanted you to know a few things about it.	Samo sam želio da znaš nekoliko stvari o tome.
I didn't have time for this tonight	Nisam imao vremena za ovo večeras
They can be anyone.	Oni mogu biti bilo ko.
I told him he had to come get me now	Rekao sam mu da sada mora doći po mene
I thought everything would be fine	Mislio sam da će sve biti u redu
A lot of people were here tonight.	Mnogo ljudi je bilo ovdje večeras.
I thought, nothing real	Mislio sam, ništa stvarno
But there is no one to help me.	Ali nema ko da mi pomogne.
And maybe it was, just a little.	A možda je i bilo, samo malo.
I really have no idea.	Zaista nemam pojma.
I knew you were the one, you were the one	Znao sam da si ti taj, ti si taj
I think you should do just that	Mislim da bi trebalo da uradiš upravo to
I wonder why he does that	Pitam se zašto to radi
Maybe this will be fine.	Možda će ovo biti u redu.
But she will not return.	Ali ona se neće vratiti.
We did it right there and there.	Uradili smo to odmah i tamo.
I didn't know you were going to do it now	Nisam znao da ćeš to sada uraditi
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
No, don't.	Ne, nemoj.
That would be something.	To bi bilo nešto.
But I had to do it	Ali morao sam to da uradim
It's all just not.	To je sve samo ne.
'to'.	'do'.
I got it	Shvatio sam to
You were right I wasn't feeling well.	Bio si u pravu što mi nije baš dobro.
I'm glad to see you	Drago mi je da te vidim
We will say more about that soon.	Uskoro ćemo reći nešto više o tome.
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
She said no one was home.	Rekla je da nema nikoga kod kuće.
He didn't look well.	Nije izgledao dobro.
I just can't let that happen	Jednostavno ne mogu to dozvoliti
I wonder if she was someone who worked here	Pitam se da li je ona bila neko ko je radio ovde
I guess so	Pretpostavljam da jeste
You were there.	Bio si tamo.
He won't say that.	On to neće reći.
It wasn't hard.	Nije bilo teško.
She said okay.	Rekla je u redu.
I know what you did last year	Znam šta si radio prošle godine
I have no idea how long it is	Nemam pojma koliko je dugo
I'll tell you everything	Reći ću ti sve
I don't know anything about that	Ne znam ništa o tome
I didn't think he would come back	Nisam mislio da će se vratiti
I didn't get it this time.	Ovaj put nisam shvatio.
I'll tell you why he couldn't	Reći ću ti zašto nije mogao
I hope he finds them	Nadam se da će ih naći
That alone is not enough.	Samo po sebi to nije dovoljno.
In fact, I like not having it	U stvari, volim da ga nemam
I love you too.	Volim i ja tebe.
And no one left.	I niko nije otišao.
I wondered what had happened	Pitao sam se šta se dogodilo
We'll find someone for you.	Naći ćemo nekoga za tebe.
I mean, obviously.	Mislim, očigledno.
I mean, it was.	Mislim, bilo je.
I guess no one wants to	Pretpostavljam da niko ne želi
This could be you.	Ovo bi mogao biti ti.
You should be happy about that.	Trebao bi biti sretan zbog toga.
Nothing will happen.	Ništa se neće dogoditi.
You have done a very good job.	Uradili ste veoma dobar posao.
He told us that.	On nam je to rekao.
I wanted him to be with me	Htela sam da bude sa mnom
I mean, everything so far is true.	Mislim, sve do sada je istina.
I couldn't believe myself	Nisam mogao vjerovati sebi
I just need a little more time	Samo mi treba još malo vremena
But you never really know.	Ali nikad se zapravo ne zna.
I'm just not sure what it will be.	Samo nisam siguran šta će to biti.
I know who they are	Znam koji su
I wondered if he would like to	Pitao sam se da li bi voleo
I heard what happened	Čuo sam šta se dogodilo
I can find him, you can't	Ja ga mogu naći, ti ne
And you don't want to do that.	A ti to ne želiš da uradiš.
You have to do something for me.	Moraš nešto učiniti za mene.
For a bad day.	Za loš dan.
No problem.	Nema problema.
You, if need be.	Ti, ako treba.
I thought it was him	Mislio sam da je on
All this can be so.	Sve ovo može biti tako.
And they had a good reason.	I imali su dobar razlog.
But nothing happens.	Ali ništa se ne dešava.
That can be a problem for him.	To može biti problem za njega.
I'm sure it's nothing	Siguran sam da nije ništa
But no one saw her.	Ali niko je nije video.
I just want to be.	Ja samo želim da budem.
I worked too hard	Radio sam previše
I have something to tell you.	Imam nešto da ti kažem.
That will be true.	To će biti istina.
In fact, I would go beyond that.	U stvari, otišao bih dalje od toga.
I didn't need anyone	Niko mi nije trebao
I know how it happened	Znam kako se to dogodilo
Yes, we are fine.	Da, dobro smo.
I spoke to him yesterday	Čuo sam se s njim juče
And she will be.	I ona će biti.
Those are the things we need to do.	To su stvari koje treba da uradimo.
I'm sorry, but it's happening.	Žao mi je, ali to se dešava.
I have a job too	I ja imam posao
I would know that	Ja bih to znao
But that's not all, there is more.	Ali to nije sve, ima još.
I was completely alone	Bio sam potpuno sam
Who knew how long.	Ko je znao koliko dugo.
I tried to reach him	Pokušao sam doći do njega
I want to see you so much	Toliko te želim vidjeti
I would see her	Video bih je
At the moment I can't tell you why	Trenutno vam ne mogu reći zašto
They didn't do it.	Oni to nisu uradili.
It's still better than nothing.	I dalje je bolje nego ništa.
She really didn't want to do that.	Ona to zaista nije htela da uradi.
I didn't think it would be that long	Nisam mislio da će biti tako dugo
It was hard for him to be alone.	Bilo mu je teško biti sam.
I really saw you that way	Zaista sam te tako vidio
I didn't mean to do anything wrong.	Nisam mislio da uradim ništa loše.
he said.	on je rekao.
This is unlikely to happen.	Ovo se vjerovatno neće dogoditi.
This needs to be done.	Ovo treba uraditi.
They should be there.	Trebali bi biti tamo.
So she goes to work.	Tako da ona ide na posao.
I was expecting you	Očekivao sam te
Don't say anything.	Ne govori ništa.
I think there were three	Mislim da je bilo tri
There really is nothing more than that.	Zaista nema ništa više od toga.
I know that pretty well	Prilično znam to
But very likely not.	Ali vrlo vjerovatno neće.
I told you day after day	Rekao sam ti dan po dan
You are there.	Vi ste tamo.
I don't know how it was	Ne znam kako je bilo
I did my job.	Uradio sam svoj posao.
I'm afraid that won't be enough either	Bojim se da ni to neće biti dovoljno
I don't know if it's true or not.	Ne znam da li je tačno ili ne.
It's really simple now.	Sada je stvarno jednostavno.
I just loved working with him	Jednostavno sam volio raditi s njim
And that is true.	I to je tačno.
It seemed to be him.	Činilo se da je to on sam.
That's a lot of people.	To je puno ljudi.
Maybe he was just surprised.	Možda je jednostavno bio iznenađen.
I'm just saying.	Samo kažem.
I haven't even asked him yet	Nisam ga još ni pitao
I'm sorry I ever did this.	Žao mi je što sam ovo ikada uradio.
I have to do this alone	Moram da uradim ovo sam
I really can't say much more than that	Zaista ne mogu reći mnogo više od toga
And there he was.	I tamo je bio.
I really wonder how true that is.	Zaista se pitam koliko je to istina.
I want to be a little alone	Želim da budem malo sama
But we all know she will too.	Ali svi znamo da će i ona.
But we know they can't.	Ali znamo da ne mogu.
I really hope and pray that he gets better.	Zaista se nadam i molim se da mu bude bolje.
I had everything for myself.	Imao sam sve za sebe.
No, it's not true.	Ne, nije istina.
I never go there	Nikad ne idem tamo
I know a lot of things	Znam mnogo stvari
Bad for us.	Loše za nas.
I had to know how he was	Morao sam znati kako mu je
I will leave.	Ja ću otići.
I know exactly what he's doing	Znam tačno šta radi
That was the idea.	To je bila ideja.
But he couldn't be sure.	Ali nije mogao biti siguran.
But that's not really the case.	Ali to zapravo nije tako.
I told him what was going on	Rekao sam mu šta se dešava
Good for you.	Dobro za tebe.
It is not easy to find a job.	Nije lako naći posao.
We did the job.	Uradili smo posao.
A few here and a few there	Nekoliko ovdje i nekoliko tamo
I did something today	Uradio sam nešto danas
In fact, we can do better than that.	Zapravo, možemo i bolje od toga.
I didn't think she could do it	Nisam mislio da će ona to moći
I want to know what she wants	Želim da znam šta ona želi
I really loved her, and she knew it	Zaista sam je voleo, i ona je to znala
I would have no idea what to say to him	Ne bih imao pojma šta da mu kažem
Together or not.	Zajedno ili ne.
I didn't expect him to say that	Nisam očekivao da će to reći
She was just that.	Ona je upravo to bila.
Not so fast.	Ne tako brzo.
Maybe there's more to it than that.	Možda ima nešto više od toga.
I almost wanted that	Skoro da sam to želeo
This was not enough.	Ovo nije bilo dovoljno.
We have to be.	Moramo biti.
He likes to talk.	Voli da priča.
She always does, she tells him.	Uvijek to radi, kaže mu ona.
I mean, you're right.	Mislim, u pravu si.
Even if it's just a little.	Čak i ako je to samo malo.
I'm sorry about him	Žao mi ga je
I can not believe	Ne mogu vjerovati
No one will come back to him.	Niko mu se neće vratiti.
I was glad I finished	Bilo mi je drago što sam završio
I've seen enough.	Video sam dovoljno.
I can't say what she thinks	Ne mogu reći šta ona misli
I was a little surprised	Bio sam malo iznenađen
She wanted to do it.	Htela je to da uradi.
We only have one life.	Imamo samo jedan život.
No one ever had.	Niko nikada nije imao.
I didn't say anything	Nisam ništa rekao
I know them both.	Znam ih oboje.
Not for us.	Ne za nas.
Or you are for.	Ili ste za.
Next year, maybe.	Sljedeće godine, možda.
I thought you were my friend	Mislio sam da si mi prijatelj
It's just easy for us.	Samo nam je to lako.
But it had to be him.	Ali to je morao biti on.
I didn't expect him to give me anything	Nisam očekivao da će mi nešto dati
We won't stay here anymore.	Nećemo više ostati ovdje.
I have no doubt it will be good	Ne sumnjam da će biti dobro
He is something more.	On je nešto više.
She is what she is, and he is what he is.	Ona je ono što jeste, a on je ono što jeste.
It was not easy for me.	Nije mi bilo lako.
But that never happened.	Ali to se nikada nije dogodilo.
I could never do that	Nikad to ne bih mogao
I have a few thoughts.	Imam nekoliko misli.
Not from me, you won't.	Ne od mene, nećeš.
That's what's happening to me, right now.	To mi se dešava, upravo sada.
I think he could come back	Mislim da bi se moglo vratiti
I thought something was wrong.	Mislio sam da nešto nije u redu.
Where he will surely find himself.	Gdje će se sigurno naći.
He could not.	Nije mogao.
And I saw and heard things	I vidio sam i čuo stvari
I still have this problem	Još uvijek imam ovaj problem
I would like him to say something, anything	Voleo bih da kaže nešto, bilo šta
Everything is very quick and easy.	Sve je vrlo brzo i jednostavno.
I need to know you're okay	Moram da znam da si dobro
I can do anything here	Ovdje mogu sve
I've been.	Bio sam.
I should have trusted him	Trebao sam mu vjerovati
I really should have seen that	Zaista sam trebao to vidjeti
Now she knew it wasn't going to happen.	Sada je znala da se to neće dogoditi.
It's just.	To je samo.
I had no idea what he said	Nisam imao pojma šta je rekao
Unless he knew something.	Osim ako nešto nije znao.
But you're back to it.	Ali ti si se vratio na to.
I saw them and there are three	Video sam ih i tri su
And yes, you are right.	I da, u pravu ste.
He is very happy about that.	Veoma je sretan zbog toga.
I just didn't expect it	Jednostavno nisam očekivao
I mean, you can be, if you want	Mislim, možeš biti, ako želiš
I have a good job	Imam dobar posao
Good, obviously	Dobar, očigledno
But not in a good way.	Ali ne na dobar način.
It's them.	To su oni.
He's been here a long time.	Ovdje je već dugo vremena.
You did this to us.	Uradio si nam ovo.
But you are the first.	Ali ti si prvi.
I'm glad to have you.	Drago mi je da te imam.
He said he couldn't believe it.	Rekao je da ne može vjerovati.
We had little money.	Imali smo malo novca.
To do the right thing.	Da uradim pravu stvar.
I know, there are many.	Znam, ima ih mnogo.
That's better than nothing.	To je bolje nego ništa.
It's a job, it's just a job.	To je posao, to je samo posao.
You obviously don't know this.	Ti očigledno ne znaš ovo.
I bought my new car last year	Prošle godine sam kupio svoj novi auto
That would be fine.	To bi bilo u redu.
That's how the story goes.	Tako priča ide.
I have no idea even where she lives now	Nemam pojma čak ni gdje ona sada živi
Maybe it has to be that way.	Možda to tako mora biti.
I wish it never would	Voleo bih da nikada neće
I didn't want to see that	Nisam htela da to vidim
I could do it alone	Mogao bih to sam
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
You are the person who is always and never there.	Vi ste osoba koja je uvijek i nikad tu.
My life was now mine, and mine alone.	Moj život je sada bio moj, i samo moj.
Why? 	Zašto?
And maybe they still are.	A možda su i dalje.
I've never seen him before	Nikad ga prije nisam vidio
Mine never worked.	Moj nikad nije radio.
You do it.	Vi to radite.
I didn't know if they were alive	Nisam znao da li su živi
I just knew you had to come back	Samo sam znao da se moraš vratiti
We just aren't.	Mi jednostavno nismo.
I see no reason why not.	Ne vidim razlog zašto ne bi.
That alone will give you more power.	Samo to će vam dati više moći.
Everything would be fine.	Sve bi bilo dobro.
I won't do it here.	Neću to raditi ovdje.
I haven't done it a single day	Nisam to uradio ni jedan jedini dan
It's here.	To je ovdje.
I really like it	Zaista mi se sviđa
I'm not even sure how.	Nisam ni siguran kako.
Everyone knows things are bad.	Svi znaju da su stvari loše.
I can't believe it's been three years	Ne mogu vjerovati da su prošle tri godine
Yes, he could see the houses.	Da, mogao je vidjeti kuće.
I think we can help you	Mislim da ti možemo pomoći
I can't give you everything	Ne mogu ti dati sve
I have nothing for myself.	Nemam ništa za sebe.
On.	Na.
I want to see what that looks like	Želim vidjeti kako to izgleda
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
He will know what to do.	On će znati šta da radi.
I have a few.	Imam nekoliko.
Just for one day.	Samo na jedan dan.
I haven't for a long time	Nisam dugo vremena
I think we'll be safe enough	Mislim da ćemo biti dovoljno sigurni
I knew about it.	Znao sam za to.
I just wouldn't.	Jednostavno ne bi.
That nothing will happen.	Da se ništa neće dogoditi.
Really, we can.	Zaista, možemo.
But you will return.	Ali ti ćeš se vratiti.
I didn’t have to be happy about it	Nisam morao biti sretan zbog toga
Which is probably very true.	Što je vjerovatno vrlo tačno.
That's not a problem.	To nije problem.
I like that about you	Sviđa mi se to kod tebe
I don't want money	Ne želim novac
I was very happy	Bio sam veoma sretan
That's not anyone.	To nije bilo ko.
Maybe I don't have much time	Možda nemam puno vremena
I think they are wrong.	Mislim da nisu u pravu.
More than you know.	Više nego što znaš.
I knew immediately what the problem was	Odmah sam znao u čemu je problem
You need time.	Treba ti vremena.
I told him no this time	Rekao sam mu ne ovaj put
I just knew she would be there	Samo sam znao da će ona biti tamo
He did what he could.	Uradio je šta je mogao.
She wants to work.	Ona želi da radi.
Not like him.	Ne kao on.
I guess he knows what he's doing	Pretpostavljam da zna šta radi
I wasn’t surprised he was already gone	Nisam bio iznenađen što je već otišao
I had to see him again	Morao sam ponovo da ga vidim
He saw it happening.	Video je da se to dešava.
Not everyone, no.	Ne svi, ne.
I always thought you'd come back	Uvek sam mislio da ćeš se vratiti
But you know.	Ali znaš.
I don't think it will be easy	Mislim da to neće biti lako
I wasn't so sure anymore	Nisam više bio tako siguran
But she was not well.	Ali ona nije bila dobro.
I wasn't so surprised	Nisam bio toliko iznenađen
I didn't have a lot of them	Nisam ih imao puno
We couldn’t have done such a good job.	Nismo mogli da uradimo tako dobar posao.
That was real.	To je bilo stvarno.
Not much.	Nema puno toga.
I may not be able to bring you back	Možda te neću moći vratiti
I can do this	Mogu ovo da uradim
What did he do?	Šta je uradio.
He said that was fine.	Rekao je da je to u redu.
But we will leave.	Ali mi ćemo otići.
Many times it has	Mnogo puta jeste
And he saw it.	I on je to video.
I’ve been there before and I’ve seen it so many times.	Bio sam tamo ranije i vidio sam to toliko puta.
I see what he means.	Vidim šta misli.
And soon everyone will know.	I uskoro će svi znati.
He knew she would come.	Znao je da će ona doći.
He certainly doesn't know.	On sigurno ne zna.
Besides, she's right.	Osim toga, ona je u pravu.
More than okay.	Više nego u redu.
I know what he knows	Znam šta on zna
Nothing is good.	Ništa nije dobro.
I never knew what it was.	Nikad nisam znao šta je to.
I knew all about it	Znao sam sve o tome
It was not like that for us.	Nama nije bilo tako.
I would go.	Otišao bih.
If it's true.	Ako je istina.
I couldn't believe what was happening	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta se dešava
It wasn't much more than that.	Nije bilo mnogo više od toga.
We can still see that.	Još uvijek to možemo vidjeti.
I brought him back.	Vratio sam ga.
She was him.	Ona je bio on.
Today he was no longer sure of anything.	Danas više nije bio siguran ni u šta.
I don't see a problem	Ne vidim da postoji problem
I should be there by now	Trebao bih biti tamo do sada
I think he went there	Mislim da je tamo otišao
He could see nothing or nothing.	Nije mogao vidjeti ništa ili ništa.
I know you as you know me	Znam te kao što znaš mene
I decided	Odlučio sam se
I didn't have to go back	Nisam se morao vratiti
I really shouldn't say that	Zaista to ne bih trebao reći
I didn't know what was happening to me	Nisam znao šta mi se dešava
What exactly we do not know.	Šta tačno ne znamo.
It's not just me.	Nije samo od mene.
This is very easy to do.	Ovo je vrlo lako uraditi.
Or maybe it still is.	Ili možda još uvijek jeste.
Maybe not all.	Možda ne sve.
I was pretty happy.	Bio sam prilično sretan.
I knew what was there	Znao sam šta je tamo
Someone loved.	Neko volio.
I need to know if he's still here	Moram da znam da li je još uvek ovde
Really a little.	Zaista pomalo.
I haven't seen you in a long time	Nisam te dugo video
If true, he didn't have a car.	Ako je istina, nije imao auto.
I wonder how much he heard.	Pitam se koliko je čuo.
I just needed to see	Samo sam trebao vidjeti
We have to go home.	Moramo ići kući.
This was really really good.	Ovo je bilo stvarno jako dobro.
When you're not in it, you're gone.	Kad nisi u tome, nema tebe.
I don't like to pray	Ne volim da se molim
And there were people here.	I ovdje je bilo ljudi.
I know you will be good	Znam da ćeš biti dobar
I wouldn't want to tell you	Ne bih a da ti ne kažem
I think it should be me	Mislim da bih to trebao biti ja
That's what she wanted.	To je ona htela.
I told him he had to help me	Rekao sam mu da mi mora pomoći
To work maybe.	Na posao možda.
Apparently, pretty quickly.	Očigledno, prilično brzo.
Not like that anymore.	Ne više tako.
And this is difficult.	A ovo je teško.
Long time.	Dugo vremena.
I didn't know what was wrong	Nisam znao šta nije u redu
I knew he was right	Znao sam da je u pravu
No, that wouldn't be right.	Ne, to ne bi bilo u redu.
Maybe it already is.	Možda je već.
It used to be.	Prije je bilo.
Probably tonight or tomorrow.	Verovatno večeras ili sutra.
I'm so glad you're here.	Tako mi je drago što si ovdje.
Went to the door.	Otišao do vrata.
I think you can go now	Mislim da sada možeš ići
And it seems to work.	I izgleda da radi.
That was true.	To je bila istina.
I can't talk about it now	Ne mogu sada o tome
But it is much more than that.	Ali to je mnogo više od toga.
But there was nothing.	Ali nije bilo ništa.
You often are.	Često jesi.
This is living.	Ovo živi.
I never saw a time when it wasn’t	Nikada nisam vidio vrijeme kada nije bilo
I did everything myself	Sve sam radio sam
These are my three.	Ovo su moja tri.
I know what you mean	znam šta misliš
I like that, he says.	Sviđa mi se to, kaže.
I don't know how.	Ja ne znam kako.
I had to work fast, let me tell you	Morao sam da radim brzo, da vam kažem
And he's still at home.	A kod kuće je još.
I don't do that anymore	Ja to više ne radim
I thought you could.	Mislio sam da bi mogao.
He can't do anything.	Ništa ne može.
No one ever told me, but it was pretty obvious.	Niko mi nikada nije rekao, ali bilo je prilično očigledno.
I couldn't tell how old he was	Nisam mogao reći koliko je godina imao
It doesn't work that way.	To ne radi tako.
It was a good day.	Bio je to dobar dan.
Lots of friends.	Puno prijatelja.
I just expected to be alone again	Samo sam očekivao da ću ponovo biti sam
You know, you know.	Znaš, znaš.
I thought he knew what you did.	Mislio sam da zna šta si uradio.
I may not know tomorrow	Možda neću znati sutra
And you should go.	I trebao bi ići.
This can be so easy.	Ovo može biti tako lako.
I could see what was going on	Mogao sam vidjeti šta se dešava
I couldn't see well	Nisam mogao dobro vidjeti
I really think he's the one	Zaista mislim da je on taj
Now I see it well	Sada to dobro vidim
One on one, you said.	Jedan na jedan, rekli ste.
It was one-thirty in the afternoon.	Bilo je jedan i trideset popodne.
I want to give you what you want	Želim ti dati ono što želiš
Coming soon.	Uskoro.
And you there with him.	I ti tamo sa njim.
That would be.	To bi.
I did what he did.	Uradio sam ono što je on uradio.
I never said any of that	Nikad nisam rekao ništa od toga
I wanted to help right away	Htio sam pomoći odmah
If you dont wan't.	Ako ne želiš.
I didn't ask for it, but it was	Nisam ga tražio, ali bilo je
I didn't want to ask	Nisam htela da pitam
We would be fine.	Bili bismo dobro.
In fact, there is not much to say.	Zapravo, nema se puno toga za reći.
I guess that's true	Pretpostavljam da je to istina
But he did not come for help.	Ali on nije došao po pomoć.
I wonder if you can help me	Pitam se možete li mi pomoći
I hope he was good	Nadam se da je bio dobar
But he knew that could not happen.	Ali znao je da se to ne može dogoditi.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Možda, možda, možda.
This time he did it.	Ovaj put je to uradio.
That's how it will be.	Tako će biti.
I want someone to know	Želim da neko zna
I just have to be ready	Samo moram biti spreman
The first and only.	Prvi i jedini.
You.	Vi.
I really need it.	Stvarno mi treba.
I finished everything he gave me	Završio sam sve što mi je dao
You're right.	U pravu si.
That time is not now.	To vrijeme nije sada.
They themselves have never been.	Oni sami nikada nisu bili.
I'll tell you something.	Reći ću ti nešto.
I can't help you much	Ne mogu ti puno pomoći
Really, it's okay.	Zaista, u redu je.
I wanted what they had	Želeo sam ono što su oni imali
It is true that there are many of them.	Istina je da ih ima mnogo.
I do not know what to say.	Ne znam šta da kažem.
We have a lot of things to do.	Imamo mnogo stvari za uraditi.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I knew he needed help	Znao sam da mu treba pomoć
I have nothing to do today	Nemam šta da radim danas
No, she said.	Ne, rekla je.
I just have to tell you	Samo ti moram reći
I couldn't tell who it was	Nisam mogao reći ko je to bio
More than a little.	Više nego malo.
The problem is to say when it is safe to do so.	Problem je reći kada je to sigurno učiniti.
But a good story.	Ali dobra priča.
I haven't decided yet	Još nisam odlučio
You know it's not.	Znaš da nije.
I want the truth	Želim istinu
According to what now, they do not know.	Prema čemu sada, oni ne znaju.
I was pretty good at it	Bio sam prilično dobar u tome
I didn't need anything	Ništa mi nije trebalo
If they only knew.	Kad bi samo znali.
Nobody wants to play with him.	Niko ne želi da se igra sa njim.
Lots of time for that.	Dosta vremena za to.
I arrived first	Ja sam prvi stigao
That's my business.	To je moja stvar.
I'm no one.	Ja sam niko.
He would know what to do.	Znao bi šta da radiš.
I've already told everyone this	Ovo sam već svima rekao
He understood who he was.	Shvatio je ko je on.
He's not mine either.	Ni on nije moj.
I also realized the things he had to do	Shvatio sam i stvari koje je morao da uradi
Or her.	Ili ona.
I got her back.	Vratio sam je.
Three years ago.	Prije tri godine.
That's probably enough for now.	To je vjerovatno dovoljno za sada.
More power for him.	Više moći za njega.
I doubt it would	Sumnjam da bi
He couldn't be here.	Nije mogao biti ovdje.
Now you are.	Sada jesi.
And maybe not.	A možda i ne.
I couldn't find them	Nisam ih mogao naći
I see that.	Vidim da.
If you did, you wouldn't be here.	Da jesi, ne bi bio ovde.
I've never seen them	Nikad ih nisam vidio
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije.
There are a lot of things together.	Mnogo je stvari zajedno.
You shouldn't either.	Ni ti ne bi trebao.
Maybe all of those things.	Možda sve te stvari.
She knew who the man was.	Znala je ko je taj čovjek.
He started telling me who he was, what he had done.	Počeo je da mi priča ko je on, šta je uradio.
I wasn't sure about anything	Nisam bio siguran ni u šta
Not since last week.	Ne od prošle sedmice.
I didn't expect it.	Nisam očekivao.
I didn't expect this	Nisam ovo očekivao
But today they are gone.	Ali danas ih nema.
We've been together for a long time.	Zajedno smo dugo vremena.
I knew that and I was ready to help	Znao sam to i bio sam spreman pomoći
I really wouldn't know	Zaista ne bih znao
I could have told you that	Mogao sam ti to reći
She knew.	Ona je znala.
I want this done already	Želim da se ovo već uradi
I really like this.	Ovo mi se stvarno sviđa.
I'm afraid.	Bojim se.
Nothing more than that.	Ništa više od toga.
She was everything.	Ona je bila sve.
He was right.	Bio je u pravu.
He is afraid of you.	On te se boji.
I mean never.	Mislim nikad.
I can't, she said.	Ne mogu, rekla je.
No, we wouldn't.	Ne, ne bismo.
But not this week.	Ali ne ove sedmice.
That little bit.	To malo.
What's happening?.	Šta se dešava?.
I don't want to stay here	Ne želim ostati ovdje
This is still my game.	Ovo je i dalje moja igra.
He couldn't see.	Nije mogao da vidi.
I really, really wanted to	Stvarno, stvarno sam htela
I didn't mean that.	Nisam to mislio.
I just wanted to tell you	Samo sam ti htio reći
I only know the things he tells me	Znam samo stvari koje mi on govori
it works with me.	to radi sa mnom.
We were just people	Bili smo samo ljudi
I didn't do anything wrong last night	Nisam uradio ništa loše sinoć
I wasn't ready for anything	Nisam bio spreman ni za šta
That makes them right.	To ih čini u pravu.
I didn't expect anything more, I didn't even get it.	Ništa više nisam očekivao, nisam ni dobio.
It should be easy enough.	Trebalo bi biti dovoljno lako.
You probably know a few.	Vjerovatno znate nekoliko.
I just don’t see myself doing it	Jednostavno ne vidim sebe kako to radim
I'm as bad as any of you	Loš sam kao i bilo ko od vas
I saw the truth	Video sam istinu
I had nothing to do	Nisam imao šta da radim
He has a lot of money.	Ima dosta novca.
I saw it right away	Odmah sam to vidio
They didn't.	Nisu.
I saw that one.	Video sam taj.
Or who, if you must.	Ili koga, ako morate.
It was hard to say why.	Bilo je teško reći zašto.
I can do almost anything here	Ovdje mogu skoro sve
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
She can do whatever she wants.	Ona može da radi šta hoće.
The idea is to be simple.	Ideja je da bude jednostavno.
Maybe it was a trip.	Možda je to bio put.
I didn't know what to do either.	Ni ja nisam znao šta da radim.
And he knew it would be soon.	I on je znao da će to biti uskoro.
I can come back alone	Mogu se vratiti sam
No one has done that before.	Niko to ranije nije uradio.
I doubt he'll be back	Sumnjam da će se vratiti
He didn't ask for help.	Nije tražio pomoć.
I know a lot of people	Znam puno ljudi
You never knew what might happen.	Nikad nisi znao šta bi se moglo dogoditi.
I still could, you know	Još uvek bih mogao, znaš
I have no idea what this could be	Nemam pojma šta bi ovo moglo biti
I hope it will be of help to you.	Nadam se da će vam biti od pomoći.
I knew that better than anyone	Znao sam to bolje od bilo koga
I just have to do something	Samo moram nešto da uradim
I don't want to be alone again	Ne želim ponovo biti sam
I know that's true	Znam da je to istina
I don't know anything.	Ne znam ni šta.
I didn't have time for this	Nisam imao vremena za ovo
I wonder what it looks like	Pitam se kako to izgleda
That's what the team does	To radi tim
You and me.	Ja i ti.
It was hard to say.	Bilo je teško reći.
I think people are people.	Mislim da su ljudi ljudi.
That has to happen.	To se mora dogoditi.
Everything must be fine.	Sve mora biti u redu.
She will be fine.	Ona će biti dobro.
I could have told you at any time	Mogao sam ti reći u bilo koje vrijeme
No one worked anymore.	Niko nije radio više.
I wasn't sure what it was at the time	Nisam bio siguran šta je to u to vrijeme
I shouldn't have been there	Nisam trebao biti tamo
You're welcome.	Nema na čemu.
What you don't know is why.	Ono što ne znaš je zašto.
I had to know for sure	Morao sam da znam sigurno
I'm your friend.	Ja sam tvoj prijatelj.
He was surprised.	Bio je iznenađen.
I still can't.	I dalje ne mogu.
We can and must do better.	Možemo i moramo bolje.
I have a better way.	Imam bolji način.
I'm here with you	Ovde sam sa tobom
I didn't know I could	Nisam znao da mogu
That happened.	To se dogodilo.
We can't take it anymore.	Ne možemo više.
There seemed to be no problem.	Činilo se da nema problema.
Just like us, 'she said.	Baš kao i mi', rekla je.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
We'll be home soon.	Uskoro ćemo biti kući.
Think, think, think.	Misli, misli, misli.
It was easy enough.	Bilo je dovoljno lako.
I ask for myself	Pitam za sebe
I have to.	Moram.
It didn't take long.	Nije ni trebalo dugo.
I know they are here	Znam da su ovde
I'll be leaving soon.	Otići ću uskoro.
I almost lost it.	Skoro sam ga izgubio.
I thought he might not have heard me	Mislio sam da me možda nije čuo
I love you too much to do that.	Previše te volim da bih to uradio.
We have to go together and we have to stay together.	Moramo ići zajedno i moramo ostati zajedno.
Yes he did.	Da uradio je.
But it can happen.	Ali to se može dogoditi.
I know there would be a lot of people	Znam da bi bilo puno ljudi
Why, he couldn't say.	Zašto, nije mogao reći.
But I have no idea why.	Ali nemam pojma zašto.
All right, yes.	U redu, da.
But with us you never know.	Ali kod nas se nikad ne zna.
I can't do this again	Ne mogu ovo ponovo
I think maybe he's right	Mislim da je možda u pravu
It's not like he needs money.	Nije kao da mu treba novac.
It is now.	Sada jeste.
We need to work on that.	Treba raditi na tome.
I had no idea what it was	Nisam imao pojma šta je to
He is.	On je.
We just can't.	Jednostavno ne možemo.
He says he doesn't know.	Kaže da ne zna.
They just aren't there yet.	Samo još nisu tamo.
I thought everyone knew by now	Mislio sam da su do sada svi znali
I should have seen it earlier	Trebao sam to ranije vidjeti
That was none of my business.	To nije bila moja stvar.
I wonder how old he really is	Pitam se koliko ima godina, zaista
They will do it.	Oni će to učiniti.
And there is more.	I ima još toga.
In fact, almost everything.	U stvari, skoro sve.
This has happened several times.	To se dogodilo nekoliko puta.
I've always loved it.	Uvek sam to voleo.
I know what you mean	Znam na šta si mislio
I wasn't sure it would be anything	Nisam bio siguran da bi bilo šta
I hope he never comes	Nadam se da nikada neće doći
Not that he had anything better to do.	Nije da je imao nešto bolje da radi.
I know she knows.	Znam da ona zna.
We have what we are in now.	Imamo ono u čemu smo sada.
In fact, we can go further.	U stvari, možemo ići i dalje.
But he did not come.	Ali on nije došao.
I knew you would see it my way	Znao sam da ćeš to vidjeti na moj način
I loved going there, as did all of us	Volio sam ići tamo, kao i svi mi
I didn't even know	Nisam ni znao
There was no problem.	Nije bilo problema.
I just wanted you to know that.	Samo sam htela da to znaš.
I just don't know.	Ja jednostavno ne znam.
We have plenty of time now.	Sada imamo dosta vremena.
I would be ready for him	Bio bih spreman za njega
And we all do it.	I svi to radimo.
I started to know things	Počeo sam da znam stvari
There is more to it than that.	Ima više od toga.
I can give you anything you want, you know	Mogu ti dati sve što želiš, znaš
I would never want to do that	Nikada to ne bih želeo da uradim
But it is.	Ali jeste.
I never did that	Nikad to nisam uradio
He really said that.	On je to zaista rekao.
But it's not quite like that.	Ali nije baš tako.
Or that it should be.	Ili da bi trebalo da bude.
And the things it does well.	I stvari koje dobro radi.
I didn't have that one	Nisam imao taj
Say it, you know, by yourself.	Reci to, znaš, od sebe.
I think there is more	Mislim da ima još toga
That seems pretty hard now.	To sada izgleda prilično teško.
I beg you for this	Ja te molim za ovo
I just have a question	Imam samo pitanje
I can talk to him and everything	Mogu razgovarati s njim i sve
The problem is not as much as it seems.	Problema nije toliko koliko izgleda.
I just know that's not true	Znam samo da to nije istina
I couldn't see them	Nisam mogao da ih vidim
This should not be too difficult.	Ovo ne bi trebalo biti previše teško.
I hope it's good	Nadam se da je dobro
No one would look for her here.	Niko je ne bi tražio ovde.
I can't stay here	Ne mogu ostati ovdje
I couldn't go on	Nisam mogao dalje
I didn't even ask for these things	Nisam ni tražio ove stvari
It could be safe.	Moglo bi se sigurno.
Tell me what to do.	Reci mi šta da uradim.
Nice to see him	Bilo mi je drago da ga vidim
I shouldn't even talk to you	Ne bih trebao ni razgovarati s tobom
I just wasn’t sure if it was safe here	Samo nisam bio siguran da li je ovdje sigurno
I see what he's doing.	Vidim šta radi.
And it's good.	I dobro je.
I'm not sure what happened there.	Nisam siguran šta se tamo dogodilo.
But it happened.	Ali dogodilo se.
And that's almost all.	I to su skoro svi.
I really want to do what is good	Zaista želim da radim ono što je dobro
He couldn't see them.	Nije ih mogao vidjeti.
It just has to.	Samo mora.
I wouldn't anymore	Ne bih više
I already know what he's going to tell me	Već znam šta će mi reći
I still think this is better	I dalje mislim da je ovo bolje
I just love her so much	Samo je toliko volim
I thought it was in it	Mislio sam da je u tome
I was surprised by that	Bio sam iznenađen tome
You're already gone.	Već si otišao.
I just wanted to be sure.	Samo sam htio biti siguran.
We can go or you can see him.	Možemo otići ili ga možete vidjeti.
I lost three days	Izgubio sam tri dana
I would like to do something	Voleo bih da uradim nešto
She is never without it.	Ona nikad nije bez toga.
This will help you.	Ovo će vam pomoći.
Say it now.	Reci to sada.
I can't see this.	Ne mogu ovo da vidim.
I know you better than you know yourself	Znam te bolje nego ti sebe
They were safe for a while.	Neko vrijeme su bili sigurni.
I said it was bad.	Rekao sam da je to loše.
I had no idea it existed	Nisam imao pojma da postoji
I already felt sorry for him	Već mi ga je bilo žao
So are we.	I mi smo.
I'm fine with him.	U redu sam s njim.
Everything is there.	Sve je tu.
There are a lot.	Ima ih puno.
You don't know what you want.	Ne znaš šta želiš.
Not even here.	Čak ni ovde.
I really should stay here tonight	Zaista bih trebao ostati ovdje večeras
I think he did	Mislim da je to radio
I just won't go there.	Jednostavno neću ići tamo.
It's been a while.	Već neko vrijeme.
I never want to do that.	Nikad mi se to ne da da radim.
I was very happy at home	Bio sam veoma sretan kod kuće
It works well.	To radi dobro.
Nothing could be further from my thoughts.	Ništa mi nije moglo biti dalje od misli.
More than thirty years.	Više od trideset godina.
No no no.	Ne ne ne.
Never.	Nikada.
And only for money.	I to samo za novac.
I need something good before that	Treba mi nešto dobro prije toga
I have enough.	Imam dovoljno.
It works today.	Danas radi.
We know how to do it.	Znamo kako to da uradimo.
I'm still working on it.	Još uvijek radim na tome.
There was nothing for him there.	Tamo nije bilo ništa za njega.
If you want to help, you can say it there.	Ako želite pomoći, možete to reći tamo.
Not much, but something.	Ne puno, ali nešto.
I didn't know it was so bad	Nisam znao da je tako loše
I can't do everything.	Ne mogu sve.
I never wanted to be good	Nikad nisam želeo da budem dobar
It has to be me.	Moram biti ja.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I want everything myself	Želim sve sam
None of us is better than ever.	Niko od nas nije bolji od bilo koga.
I know how hard this is for you	Znam koliko ti je ovo teško
He will not come.	On neće doći.
I said so.	Rekao sam tako.
Does not work.	Ne radi.
No one ever knows what he is doing.	Niko nikad ne zna šta radi.
I understood that better now	Sada sam to bolje shvatio
For a while.	Na neko vrijeme.
And so it goes.	I tako to ide.
I couldn't tell anyone	Nisam mogao nikome reći
I always need help	Uvijek mi treba pomoć
I didn't want to know who he was	Nisam htela da znam ko je on
She is on .	Ona je na .
I think he likes the idea	Mislim da mu se sviđa ideja
I never knew why that was.	Nikad nisam znao zašto je to tako.
I have to tell you something about myself	Moram da ti kažem nešto o sebi
You gave it to us.	Dao si nam to.
It was very good.	Bilo je veoma dobro.
I'm not sure what's wrong.	Nisam siguran šta nije u redu.
That so few people could do so much.	Da je tako malo ljudi moglo učiniti toliko.
And indeed, it could have been any of us.	I zaista, to je mogao biti bilo ko od nas.
I know what will happen to him	Znam šta će biti s njim
I didn't do it.	Nisam to uradio.
Why? 	Zašto?
I have no idea.	Nemam pojma.
I'm already starting to love it	Već sam to počeo da volim
But for now it's good.	Ali za sada je dobro.
You look safe.	Izgledaš sigurno.
I love them both very much	Oboje ih jako volim
I didn't want to do that	Nisam htela da to uradim
And we actually know about it for a very long time.	I zapravo znamo za to jako dugo.
I guess it was always a problem	Pretpostavljam da je uvijek bio problem
So many people don't know.	Toliko ljudi ne znaju.
That's what it looks like.	Tako izgleda.
You know that's not true.	Znaš da to nije istina.
I wonder how many he saw	Pitam se koliko ih je vidio
I can't believe this happened	Ne mogu vjerovati da se to dogodilo
Not true.	Nije istina.
I really loved her.	Zaista sam je voleo.
I came to see the party.	Došao sam da vidim zabavu.
I wasn't my own	Nisam bio svoj
I couldn't do it without you	Ne bih to mogao bez tebe
You're here now.	Sada si tu.
He saw something else there.	Vidio je tu još nešto.
That was really the case.	To je zaista bilo tako.
We can do what we do now.	Možemo to što radimo sada.
But I'm not sure	Ali nisam siguran
I can almost see them, just like you say	Skoro da ih vidim, baš kao što kažeš
You never know what will happen.	Nikad ne znaš šta će se dogoditi.
None of that.	Ni o čemu od toga.
I don't even know what.	Ne znam ni šta.
If only it were true.	Samo da je to istina.
It wasn't real.	Nije bilo stvarno.
She doesn't eat.	Ona ne jede.
He was there for a long time.	Bio je tamo dugo vremena.
Yes, you may know.	Da možda znate.
I'm sorry he left.	Žao mi je što je otišao.
I hope you are fine.	Nadam se da ste dobro.
What they don’t know is how he got there.	Ono što ne znaju je kako je došao do toga.
Or you can do both.	Ili možete oboje.
I had to do it for myself	Morao sam to da uradim za sebe
I told you that yesterday	Rekao sam ti to juče
I would start it tomorrow	Počeo bih je sutra
I do my job, he does his	Ja radim svoj posao, on radi svoj
I see that would be a problem	Vidim kako bi to bio problem
Tom couldn't see anything.	Tom nije mogao ništa vidjeti.
Not too much.	Ne puno.
I have a question here	Imam pitanje ovdje
I'll go get him myself	Sam ću otići po njega
I shouldn't have known that	Nisam to trebao znati
I didn't think you'd be here.	Nisam mislio da ćeš biti ovde.
Not to him, but to my life, myself.	Ne na njega, nego na moj život, sebe.
I know what she would like	Znam šta bi ona htela
He didn't see me.	Nije me vidio.
I knew there was more to it	Znao sam da ima više toga
You said no.	Rekao si ne.
I couldn’t tell if she was still here or not	Nisam mogao reći da li je još uvijek ovdje ili ne
He didn't want you to know you could do this.	Nije želio da znaš da možeš ovo da uradiš.
I do a lot of things.	Radim puno toga.
You may have to.	Možda ćeš morati.
I knew it was something	Znao sam da je to nešto
Not everyone is in it.	Nisu svi u tome.
You just knew he wanted you	Znao si samo da te želi
I would come back.	Vratio bih se.
I knew we would find you	Znao sam da ćemo te naći
But I'm not sure.	Ali nisam siguran.
I hope this helps you	Nadam se da će vam ovo biti od pomoći
Indeed, there may never be time.	Zaista, možda nikada neće biti vremena.
He didn't want them there.	Nije ih želio tamo.
I figured it out pretty quickly	Prilično sam brzo shvatio
Not anymore.	Ne više.
He could come back to him.	Mogao bi mu se vratiti.
It has to be there.	To mora biti tamo.
I will never return	Nikad se neću vratiti
I wondered if something had happened	Pitao sam se da li se nešto dogodilo
I still wasn’t sure what just happened.	Još uvijek nisam bio siguran šta se upravo dogodilo.
That's what we have.	To je ono što imamo.
I never told him about myself, nothing really	Nikada mu nisam rekao za sebe, ništa zapravo
I have to tell you now	Moram ti sada reći
I haven't been here in a while	Nisam bio ovdje neko vrijeme
This is real work.	Ovo je pravi posao.
I like him as a friend	Sviđa mi se kao prijatelj
I like it, actually.	Sviđa mi se, u stvari.
That money was nothing.	Taj novac nije bio ništa.
I couldn't help it.	Nisam mogao pomoći.
I knew where he would be	Znao sam gdje će biti
You should come back.	Trebao bi se vratiti.
I think he knows what's up	Mislim da zna šta ima
I should be gone by now	Trebao bih već otići
She knows nothing.	Ona ne zna ništa.
He came to him.	Došao je do njega.
He just came home today.	Upravo je došao kući danas.
He could never do that.	On to nikada nije mogao uraditi.
I had to say something.	Morao sam nešto reći.
I really like it.	Baš mi se sviđa.
I'm glad you're here with me	Drago mi je da si ovdje sa mnom
And he wanted to help.	I želio je pomoći.
We can work together.	Možemo raditi zajedno.
And so it should be.	I tako bi trebalo.
I didn't really mean that.	Nisam to stvarno mislio.
I know what you just said	Znam šta si upravo rekao
And we only know what they said when they did it.	A mi samo znamo šta su rekli kada su to uradili.
I want to.	Želim.
I should never have gone back to work.	Nikad se nisam trebao vratiti na posao.
I could tell this was hard for him	Mogao sam reći da mu je ovo teško
I saw them myself	I sam sam ih vidio
He said it could have happened, and it did.	Rekao je da se to moglo dogoditi, i dogodilo se.
I hope you like it.	Nadam se da vam se sviđa.
I can't even say what you look like.	Ne mogu ni reći kako izgledaš.
I know you will too.	Znam da ćete i vi.
He must love her.	Sigurno je voli.
You have to say what's going on.	Moraš da kažeš šta se dešava.
But that is not happening.	Ali to se ne dešava.
I want a better life	Želim bolji život
But he won't help you.	Ali on ti neće biti od pomoći.
I think that's what life is	Mislim da je to ono što je život
And even that would not be enough.	A ni to ne bi bilo dovoljno.
It's true.	To je istina.
But so far nothing has come of it.	Ali od toga do sada nije bilo ništa.
I still couldn't see him well	I dalje ga nisam mogao dobro vidjeti
We are there.	Mi smo tamo.
I would be surprised if it was	Bio bih iznenađen da jeste
He shouldn't have said anything.	Nije trebao ništa reći.
I still wanted too much	I dalje sam želeo previše
I can't tell you all this	Ne mogu ti sve ovo reći
I know why she didn't tell me	Znam zašto mi nije rekla
He should be doing his job.	Trebao bi da radi svoj posao.
I really had no idea	Zaista nisam imao pojma
Do you know.	Znaš li.
I had no idea he was coming back	Nisam imao pojma da će se vratiti
But he never would.	Ali nikada ne bi.
We know they are a good team.	Znamo da su dobar tim.
I want better for you	Želim bolje za tebe
I never knew what he did	Nikad nisam znao šta je uradio
But not so much.	Ali ne toliko.
But not much.	Ali ne mnogo.
I know what she would say.	Znam šta bi rekla.
I like what you said	Sviđa mi se to što si rekao
I was the one who left	Ja sam bio taj koji je otišao
We did it that way.	Uradili smo to na taj način.
Like a lot.	Kao puno.
Everything was just like that.	Sve je bilo samo tako.
This was not the first time either.	Ni ovo nije bilo prvi put.
I could do so much for you	Mogao sam toliko da uradim za tebe
That must have been it.	Sigurno je to bilo to.
I know you loved her very much	Znam da si je mnogo voleo
He's like.	On je kao.
I was very, very good, very, very fast	Bio sam vrlo, vrlo dobar, vrlo, vrlo brzo
Everything works well.	Sve radi dobro.
We still can't.	Još uvek ne možemo.
I didn't know who she was	Nisam znao ko je ona
I'm not sure about that.	Nisam baš siguran u to.
Maybe you never did.	Možda nikad nisi.
No, it's just you.	Ne, samo si ti.
Today actually.	Danas zapravo.
Please don't do this to yourself.	Molim te, ne radi to sebi.
I'll go with him	Otići ću s njim
Yes, he was right.	Da, bio je u pravu.
I hope it will.	Nadam se da hoće.
I know how you work	Znam kako radiš
I loved them both, you know.	Voleo sam ih oboje, znaš.
I want to know for sure.	Želim da znam sigurno.
I wondered how old he was	Pitao sam se koliko ima godina
I want to know how to do it.	Želim da znam kako to da uradim.
This was his first time.	Ovo mu je bio prvi put.
A true friend.	Jedan pravi prijatelj.
You are so good.	Ti si tako dobar.
But it was.	Ali bilo je.
Neither of us said anything.	Niko od nas nije ništa rekao.
I think you could have done something	Mislim da si mogao nešto da uradiš
That was probably it.	To je vjerovatno bilo to.
I don't want to go without you.	Ne želim ići bez tebe.
Still no one came.	I dalje niko nije došao.
I was wondering about you	Pitao sam se za tebe
I have nothing.	Nemam ništa.
Nothing much.	Ni o čemu puno.
I have no problem with that	Nemam problema sa tim
That's not a problem.	To nije problem.
He says nothing.	On ništa ne govori.
I have too much to do for that	Imam previše toga da uradim za to
I've never heard of it.	Nikad nisam čuo za to.
I didn't think it would be like that	Nisam mislio da će biti tako
I know there is.	Znam da ima.
You know what you did.	Znaš šta si uradio.
It's nothing, really.	Nije to ništa, zaista.
I hope it will stay this way.	Nadam se da će tako i ostati.
.	.
Not so much today.	Danas ne toliko.
He didn't want to know, but he did.	Nije želio da zna, ali jeste.
I think fast.	Mislim brzo.
And that's what he wanted to do.	I to je ono što je želio da uradi.
I brought everything back and went home	Vratio sam sve i otišao kući
Maybe I didn't say it very well.	Možda nisam baš dobro rekao.
And so it was.	I tako je i bilo.
There is something wrong there.	Nešto nije u redu tamo.
I have so much to do tomorrow	Imam toliko toga da uradim sutra
I love you so much	volim te puno
I love things.	Volim stvari.
And that's good enough.	I to je dovoljno dobro.
We know it's good now.	Znamo da je sada dobro.
Let me ask her.	Da je pitam.
They were.	Oni su bili.
I actually came to ask you something	Zapravo sam došao da te pitam nešto
This was not good enough.	Ovo nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
He must give me more money.	Mora da mi da još novca.
In fact, he does none of that.	Zapravo, on ne radi ništa od toga.
I still didn't say anything	I dalje nisam ništa rekao
She said it was mine.	Rekla je da je moj.
I know how it is	Znam kako je
I saw that the man was a little better now	Vidio sam da je čovjek sada malo bolji
Everything was here.	Sve je bilo ovdje.
But it's hard for us.	Ali nama je teško.
I couldn't tell you exactly why	Nisam mogao da ti kažem tačno zašto
I thought he could play	Mislio sam da može da igra
I'm not sure about that.	Nisam siguran u to.
I could do it alone	Mogao bih to sam
Not just now.	Ne samo sada.
That's a good friend.	To je dobar prijatelj.
But he has it.	Ali on to ima.
I didn't even know it existed until this morning	Nisam ni znao da postoji do jutros
You don't have to be sorry.	Ne moraš biti žao.
Not that.	Ni to.
That's all we have to do.	Samo to moramo da uradimo.
You are a true friend.	Ti si pravi prijatelj.
I think you've asked enough	Mislim da si dovoljno pitao
Everything is exactly as it is.	Sve je tačno kako jeste.
I already know what your job is	Ja već znam šta je tvoj posao
But another and .	Ali još jedan i .
So far it has.	Do sada jeste.
I had to see if you were okay,	Morao sam da vidim da li si dobro,
I'm not sure you knew that.	Nisam siguran da li ste to znali.
I just didn't say	Samo nisam rekao
I've never heard of you	Nikad nisam čuo za tebe
But it's not.	Ali nije.
So I want to see them again	Tako želim da ih ponovo vidim
No more of that.	Nema više toga.
I was pretty happy to see her	Bio sam prilično sretan što sam je vidio
How can he not see that.	Kako to da ne vidi.
He promised me that.	Obećao mi je to.
He looked good tonight.	Večeras je izgledao dobro.
But enough about that.	Ali dosta o tome.
Which is bad.	Što je loše.
I really have nothing to say about that	Zaista nemam šta da kažem u tome
I won't be long	Neću dugo
That's what you need to do.	To je ono što treba da uradite.
I guess you know what she looks like	Pretpostavljam da znaš kako ona izgleda
I still need help here	Treba mi još pomoći ovdje
Yes, it was true.	Da, bila je istina.
What is it.	Šta je to.
I did exactly what he said	Uradio sam tačno ono što je rekao
How could we.	Kako bi mogli.
I love doing things the right way	Volim raditi stvari na pravi način
No one has ever seen him.	Niko ga nikada nije video.
I don't think anyone should live like that.	Mislim da niko ne bi trebao tako da živi.
I am not and I cannot be	Nisam i ne mogu biti
I guess it's not real	Pretpostavljam da nije stvarno
That was what was so difficult.	To je bilo ono što je bilo tako teško.
I did what was needed.	Uradio sam šta je trebalo.
Would anyone tell me what to do.	Da li bi mi neko rekao šta da radim.
I was ready to do it	Bio sam spreman to učiniti
It's really a job.	To je zaista posao.
I know how much you want this	Znam koliko jako želiš ovo
I asked her what was wrong with me	Pitao sam je šta mi je
I just haven't seen her in a long time	Jednostavno je nisam vidio dugo vremena
But she doesn't work anymore.	Ali ona više ne radi.
I already told you too much	Već sam ti rekao previše
I have so much to tell you	Imam toliko toga da ti kažem
This was difficult.	Ovo je bilo teško.
I've never, you know, until today	Nikad nisam, znaš, do danas
I always knew this day would come	Uvek sam znao da će ovaj dan doći
I always wanted to be first	Uvek sam želeo da budem prvi
I love when it works	Volim kad to radi
I would even ask him myself	Čak bih ga i sam pitao
Indeed, he said.	Zaista, rekao je.
Just do everything that works for you.	Samo radi sve što radi za tebe.
That's how I wanted her right now	Tako sam je želio upravo sada
I was one.	Bio sam jedan.
This is now.	Ovo je odmah.
You will never find them.	Nikada ih nećeš naći.
I know the real reason	Znam pravi razlog
I only know what she told me.	Znam samo ono što mi je rekla.
It's been a long time.	To je dugo vremena.
It makes her feel better.	Zbog toga se osjeća bolje.
I want the truth to be told.	Želim da se kaže istina.
He could buy what he needed.	Mogao je kupiti šta mu treba.
The truth is.	Istina je.
I know them, all right	Znam ih, u redu
He, I'm not so sure.	On, nisam tako siguran.
I have no problem with that.	Nemam problema sa tim.
I hope he does his job properly	Nadam se da radi svoj posao kako treba
I knew something was wrong	Znao sam da nešto nije u redu
I didn't expect that much	Nisam očekivao toliko
I had no idea what to do tonight	Nisam imao pojma šta da radim večeras
They will come.	Oni će doći.
I know where he lives	Znam gdje živi
I always wondered why he did it	Uvek sam se pitao zašto je to uradio
If he's that good.	Ako je tako dobar.
I'm glad you're okay.	Drago mi je da si dobro.
I hope they are alive	Nadam se da su živi
No, nothing is good enough.	Ne, ništa nije dovoljno dobro.
We are together now.	Sada smo zajedno.
That was better.	Tako je bilo bolje.
I couldn't be with anyone	Nisam mogao biti ni sa kim
I want it to be simple	Želim da bude jednostavno
We've been here long enough.	Ovde smo dovoljno dugo.
I never knew about this.	Nikad nisam znao za ovo.
Don't tell yourself anything.	Ne govori sebi ništa.
You and I.	Ti i ja.
He heard nothing.	Nije čuo ništa.
I have plenty of time	Imam dosta vremena
And it's okay to win.	I u redu je pobijediti.
But he was busy.	Ali bio je zauzet.
I know enough things to say	Znam dovoljno stvari da kažem
I wonder what she thinks	Pitam se šta ona misli
I guess that's a good thing.	Pretpostavljam da je to dobra stvar.
I didn't come back just for the money.	Nisam se vratio samo zbog novca.
I couldn’t believe he really wasn’t there	Nisam mogao vjerovati da ga zaista nema
You certainly don't want to.	Sigurno ne želiš.
He didn't do it.	On to nije uradio.
And it really is.	I zaista jeste.
From.	Od.
You and I.	Ti i ja.
I don't think they know who he is either	Mislim da ni oni ne znaju ko je on
That can happen.	To se može dogoditi.
I wasn’t sure if it worked or not.	Nisam bio siguran da li radi ili ne.
I'm not so sure about this	Nisam tako siguran u ovo
But not a bit of that.	Ali ni malo toga.
That's exactly what I was looking for.	Upravo sam to tražio.
I had a lot of time	Imao sam dosta vremena
Like last night.	Kao i sinoć.
It's all me.	Sve sam ja.
He really was at home.	Zaista je bio kod kuće.
I may have to do it again	Možda ću morati ponovo
I never could do that	Nikada to nisam mogao
I should never have said no	Nikad nisam trebao reći ne
I'm not sure what to say.	Nisam siguran šta da kažem.
And you know we need it.	I znaš da nam treba.
I'm so glad to see you here	Tako mi je drago vidjeti ovdje
I could never say which one	Nikad nisam mogao reći koji
You came for more.	Došao si po još.
He wanted to know why again.	Ponovo je želeo da zna zašto.
I think that's true	Mislim da je to istina
But good, good.	Ali dobro, dobro.
I beg him to be safe	Molim ga da bude siguran
I wouldn't.	Ne bi.
I should tell you this	Trebao bih ti ovo reći
Everyone was fine.	Svi su bili dobro.
I did it for us	Radio sam to za nas
Someone was here.	Neko je bio ovde.
I hope you can help me.	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći.
You have to tell me what you want.	Moraš mi reći šta želiš.
I don't.	Ja ne.
The game is one on one.	Igra je jedan na jedan.
We won't be able to get everything back.	Nećemo moći sve vratiti.
That is the reason for itself.	To je razlog za sebe.
I don't know what it is or would be.	Ne znam šta je to ili bi bilo.
I'll just say it.	Samo ću to reći.
A lot needed to be done.	Mnogo toga je trebalo uraditi.
I do not see anything wrong with it	Ne vidim ništa loše u tome
I mean, it is, but it's not	Mislim, jeste, ali nije
It was just an idea.	To je bila samo ideja.
I could never pay you back	Nikada ti ne bih mogao vratiti
But do it right.	Ali uradi to kako treba.
I can't be better	Ne mogu biti bolji
Really.	Zaista.
But I don't know how to do it.	Ali ne znam kako to učiniti.
I wonder if something can be done	Pitam se može li se nešto učiniti
I already have it together.	Već ga imam zajedno.
He could leave tonight.	Mogao bi otići večeras.
I want you to say that	Želim da to kažeš
I see it as it is.	Ja to vidim kako jeste.
I said it would happen	Rekao sam da će se to dogoditi
I should have seen her.	Trebao sam da je vidim.
I know you did your best	Znam da si dao sve od sebe
But we have a lot of them.	Ali imamo ih puno.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
I'm not sure where he is here	Nisam siguran gdje je ovdje
I'm not sure.	Nisam baš siguran.
I didn't know you came	Nisam znao da si došao
I didn't expect him to do that	Nisam očekivao da će to učiniti
I wondered what was wrong with me	Pitao sam se šta nije u redu sa mnom
How could it be.	Kako bi mogao biti.
Can it be.	Može li biti.
I'm there with you.	Tamo sam sa tobom.
I hope everything is fine.	Nadam se da je sve u redu.
The only problem is who.	Jedini problem je ko.
I want to come and see you soon	Želim doći i vidjeti te uskoro
I know how much you want me	Znam koliko me jako želiš
I'm not sure here.	Nisam siguran ovdje.
And that from.	I to od.
I didn't know what was going to happen	Nisam znao šta će se dogoditi
And he eats much better.	I jede mnogo bolje.
As if he could see.	Kao da može vidjeti.
I need to know why my team was	Moram da znam zašto je moj tim bio
Here today, no tomorrow.	Danas ovdje, sutra nema.
She knew exactly what she meant.	Tačno je znala na šta misli.
I had to do something	Morao sam nešto da uradim
He got lost at home.	Izgubio se kod kuće.
I knew he couldn't do much	Znao sam da ne može mnogo da uradi
She will do her best.	Ona će ti dati sve od sebe.
It's pretty easy.	Prilično je lako.
I knew why, but I couldn't say anything	Znao sam zašto, ali nisam mogao ništa reći
Really happy for him.	Zaista sretan zbog njega.
It never will be.	Nikada neće biti.
I didn't love myself	Nisam volio sebe
Bad day.	Loš dan.
I would do more to you than he does	Učinio bih ti više nego on
He could never be a real father.	Nikada nije mogao biti pravi otac.
He had never said anything like that before.	Nikada ranije nije rekao tako nešto.
I just couldn't	Jednostavno nisam mogao
I didn't think he wanted me	Nisam mislio da me želi
I couldn’t go as fast as them.	Nisam mogao ići tako brzo kao oni.
A lot is happening.	Dešava se mnogo.
She said she had to talk to me.	Rekla je da mora razgovarati sa mnom.
I just thought you were	Samo sam mislio da jesi
I hope you had a good day	Nadam se da ste imali dobar dan
It just doesn't happen.	To se jednostavno ne dešava.
I won't do anything else unless you want to	Neću učiniti ništa više osim ako ti to želiš
I think it will be good	Mislim da će biti dobro
I just didn't know why	Samo nisam znao zašto
You're not sure.	Nisi siguran.
I didn't even want her here tonight	Nisam je čak ni želio ovdje večeras
It's much better.	Mnogo je bolje.
I know a few friends who would do that.	Znam nekoliko prijatelja koji bi to uradili.
I should never have done anything to you	Nisam trebao nikad ništa učiniti s tobom
She knew that.	Ona je to znala.
They didn't have much time together.	Nisu imali mnogo vremena zajedno.
I love you, all of you	Volim vas, sve vas
It has never been easy.	Nikad nije bilo lako.
I mean, yes, for that.	Mislim, da, za to.
So it was fast.	Tako da je bilo brzo.
They were all here.	Svi su bili ovdje.
I'm not even sure what it is.	Nisam ni siguran šta je to.
He just lost everything.	Upravo je izgubio sve.
I knew right away what to do	Odmah sam znao šta da radim
But he doesn't.	Ali on to ne čini.
I always wondered that	Uvijek sam se to pitao
And there is a question.	I postoji pitanje.
She said as if she did.	Rekla je kao da jeste.
I'm glad for that.	Drago mi je zbog toga.
Here and here.	Ovdje i ovdje.
Just a little is enough now.	Dovoljno je sada samo malo.
I wish you'd seen him	Voleo bih da si ga video
We're still here.	Još smo tu.
That could be good.	To bi moglo biti dobro.
Usually it's just one by one.	Obično je to samo jedan po jedan.
Money, money, money.	Novac, novac, novac.
He never did that.	On to nikada nije uradio.
I really need help	Stvarno mi treba pomoć
It was just you.	Bio si samo ti.
asked.	pitao.
Nobody knows what he looked like.	Niko ne zna kako je izgledao.
And when you do it this way, it's just not that hard.	A kada to radite na ovaj način, jednostavno nije tako teško.
Just the truth, exactly what you think.	Samo istina, tačno ono što mislite.
I think you were right	Mislim da si bio u pravu
I've been here a while.	Bio sam ovdje neko vrijeme.
He didn’t start out as a bad guy.	Nije počeo kao loš momak.
He really didn't know.	On zaista nije znao.
And that was enough.	I to je bilo dovoljno.
I didn’t even go to work today	Nisam čak ni otišao na posao danas
I was not well	Nije mi bilo dobro
He said he would do it.	Rekao je da će to učiniti.
Until next time !.	Do sljedećeg puta!.
I really went a long way.	Stvarno sam dosta otišao.
We still don't know what will happen.	Još ne znamo ni šta će se dogoditi.
But this is hard to see.	Ali ovo je teško vidjeti.
You know that.	To znaš.
This was true.	Ovo je bila istina.
I love her, you know	Volim je, znaš
That's for sure.	To je sigurno.
I want to help with that	Želim pomoći u tome
I know it, she knows it.	Ja to znam, ona to zna.
I almost couldn't	Skoro da nisam mogao
But more can be said.	Ali može se reći više.
I'm sure you know too.	Siguran sam da i ti znaš.
But that was wrong.	Ali to nije bilo u redu.
I didn't think they knew about it	Nisam mislio da znaju za to
I think no.	Mislim da ne.
I have no idea why that is	Nemam pojma zašto je to tako
Which can be.	Što može biti.

He thinks of work.	On misli na posao.
And it really was.	I zaista je bilo.
So much money.	Toliko novca.
Maybe you did, but you didn't tell me.	Možda jesi, ali mi nisi rekao.
I'm not alone anymore	Nisam više sama
I have no idea where he is	Nemam pojma gdje je
I had a lot of problems.	Imao sam dosta problema.
He said nothing was wrong with me.	Rekao je da mi ništa nije u redu.
I loved you	Voleo sam te
I wasn't tired either	Ni ja nisam bio umoran
It will help me.	Pomoći će mi.
I can do it fast.	Mogu to brzo.
That could be it.	To bi moglo biti to.
It's not good that you're so alone.	Nije dobro što si tako sam.
I'm not as busy as any of you	Nisam zauzet kao bilo ko od vas
Someone loves you.	Neko te voli.
I thought it was very good.	Mislio sam da je jako dobro.
I know what you did to me	Znam šta si mi uradio
I was happy about that	Bio sam sretan zbog toga
I think he was right.	Mislim da je bio u pravu.
And three days before that.	I to tri dana prije toga.
I haven't heard anything in a while	Nisam čuo ništa već neko vrijeme
And they are here.	I oni su ovde.
I'm sorry, but it has to be that way.	Žao mi je, ali tako mora biti.
But he had to know for sure.	Ali morao je znati sigurno.
I see them first.	Ja ih prvi vidim.
But this is not the only way.	Ali ovo nije jedini način.
I could tell he needed it	Mogao sam reći da mu je to trebalo
I should have come home earlier, that's all	Trebao sam ranije doći kući, to je sve
But the thing is, this is hard.	Ali stvar je u tome da je ovo teško.
I wish it was.	Voleo bih da jeste.
I really want to talk to you	Zaista želim razgovarati s tobom
You can do it.	Možeš ti to.
You were there last night.	Bio si tamo sinoć.
You've been before.	Bio si ranije.
I don't think so.	Ne mislim tako.
I will help you.	Ja ću ti pomoći.
I guess it wasn't that bad	Pretpostavljam da nije bilo tako loše
But only he speaks.	Ali samo on govori.
I had to do it yesterday	Morao sam to da uradim juče
I have to go to work	Moram ići na posao
Not too much.	Ne previše.
I know something he doesn't know	Znam nešto što on ne zna
I'm sure.	siguran sam.
I've seen all this before	Sve sam ovo već vidio
That happened here.	To se ovdje dogodilo.
I think it could be even better	Mislim da bi još moglo biti bolje
He doesn't know how.	Ne zna kako.
I had no idea what was waiting for me	Nisam imao pojma šta me čeka
I will win again tonight	Večeras ću ponovo pobijediti
Is that.	Je li to.
They were not human.	Nisu bili ljudi.
He knew that without being able to say how.	Znao je to, a da nije mogao reći kako.
Everything will help.	Sve će pomoći.
But no one has seen him yet.	Ali niko ga još nije video.
I was glad to see him.	Bilo mi je drago što sam ga vidio.
I saw that he still wanted me	Vidio sam da me i dalje želi
That was true.	To je bila istina.
I wondered what that would be like	Pitao sam se kako bi to bilo
I'm not saying that.	Ja ne kažem da je tako.
I think you should talk about it	Mislim da bi trebao razgovarati o tome
I don't know which day	Ne znam koji dan
I want to know more than that	Želim da znam više od toga
I want him so much.	Toliko ga želim.
That would be a really good story	To bi bila zaista dobra priča
I would love that.	Voleo bih to.
He just makes them.	On ih samo pravi.
As if he knew.	Kao da je znao.
I wouldn't say much.	Ne bih puno rekao.
It was easy to find.	Bilo je lako naći.
I did that yesterday and today	To sam uradio juče i danas
I've never seen her	Nikad je nisam video
That would be true.	To bi bila istina.
He had never seen her before and he had never seen her again.	Nikada je ranije nije video i nikada je više nije video.
Something was wrong.	Nešto nije bilo kako treba.
But it couldn't be.	Ali to nije moglo biti.
I have already said that	To sam već rekao
Okay, he should go.	Dobro, morao bi da ode.
I don't know why that is.	Ne znam zašto je to tako.
To be ready.	Da budem spreman.
I do a very good job.	Radim veoma dobar posao.
We know, we know.	Znamo, znamo.
I had no idea what day it was	Nisam imao pojma ni koji je dan
As this business would be.	Kao što bi ovaj posao bio.
But it was never easy.	Ali nikad nije bilo lako.
I see why you like it so much	Vidim zašto ti se toliko sviđa
I know you've made up your mind	Znam da si se odlučio
I want him to have what he really wants	Želim da ima ono što zaista želi
I thought, maybe.	Mislio sam, možda.
I don't think you can.	Mislim da ne možeš.
I should have known better	Trebao sam znati bolje
She does it for me too.	Ona to radi i za mene.
I have no idea what he's talking about.	Nemam pojma o čemu priča.
That is who you are and what you are.	To je ko ste i šta ste.
I think it can be done.	Mislim da se to može uraditi.
I never have been and probably never will be.	Nikada nisam bio i vjerovatno nikad neću biti.
But he is not the only one.	Ali nije jedini.
I just got home	Upravo sam došao kući
He needed something.	Trebalo mu je nešto.
I would never do that to you	Nikad ti to ne bih uradio
But we just.	Ali mi samo.
I only had one problem.	Imao sam samo jedan problem.
Now, not so much.	Sada, ne toliko.
Money is the truth.	Novac je istina.
I'm still working on it	Još uvijek radim na tome
I've never been so alone	Nikad nisam bila tako sama
It was very difficult.	Bilo je jako teško.
A little but not much	Malo ali ne puno
I meant that.	Mislio sam to.
I was just doing my job	Samo sam radio svoj posao
You have to tell us the code.	Morate nam reći kod.
They know they may not come back.	Znaju da se možda neće vratiti.
I didn't know he had it in him	Nisam znao da ima to u sebi
He has no one.	On nema nikoga.
Nobody really wants to say that, something so difficult.	Niko to zaista ne želi da kaže, nešto tako teško.
Are you for it?	Jeste li za to?
I often have a hard time with that	Često mi je teško s tim
I can only say so much.	Mogu samo da kažem toliko.
I can see.	Mogu da vidim.
This is what she does.	Ovo ona radi.
You had to know when enough was enough.	Morao si znati kada je dovoljno.
I couldn't have done better	Nisam mogao bolje
And they could be right.	I mogli bi biti u pravu.
Because of you.	Zbog tebe.
But you can't do that.	Ali ne možete to učiniti.
It can work very fast.	Može da radi veoma brzo.
That was good enough for me.	To je bilo dovoljno dobro za mene.
Nobody tells you how it will be.	Niko ti ne govori kako će biti.
It was good, really good.	Bilo je dobro, stvarno dobro.
She wants to know who he is.	Ona želi da zna ko je on.
I didn't know what it was	Nisam znao šta je to
Maybe they even were.	Možda su čak i bili.
I want to work with you	Želim da radim sa tobom
I know you're happy	Znam da si sretan
We have to believe in ourselves.	Moramo vjerovati u sebe.
I didn't know what, but something	Nisam znao šta, ali nešto
I asked for help, but we were alone	Tražio sam pomoć, ali bili smo sami
Either you want it or you don't.	Ili hoćeš ili ne.
Hardly that happened today.	Teško da se to danas dogodilo.
I knew he would leave if he came	Znao sam da će on otići ako dođe
Nobody did.	Niko nije.
I've been doing this for a long time	Radio sam to dugo vremena
I want you to do something	Želim da uradiš nešto
But so is he.	Ali i on je.
I have to tell you something	Moram ti nešto reći
And it's nothing.	I ništa nije.
I think that's all we can do	Mislim da je to sve što možemo
Nothing that would be good for us here.	Ništa što bi nam ovde bilo dobro.
I could see that.	Mogao sam to vidjeti.
But there was nothing for it.	Ali nije bilo ništa za to.
I was right there.	Tačno sam bio tamo.
How difficult this is.	Kako je ovo teško.
I am completely happy.	Potpuno sam sretan.
He'll probably be here soon.	Verovatno će uskoro doći.
And it's really pretty simple.	I zaista je prilično jednostavno.
They will find them here and there.	Naći će ih tu i tamo.
Don't.	Nemoj.
He was good.	Bio je dobar.
I had a lot of problems	Imao sam mnogo problema
The good times they once had.	Dobra vremena koja su nekada imali.
Yours is the real one.	Tvoj je pravi.
I heard you this time	Čuo sam te ovaj put
He didn't see her.	Nije je vidio.
You know what's going to happen.	Znaš šta će se dogoditi.
You know, you shouldn't do that.	Znaš, ne bi trebalo to da radiš.
It was very difficult.	Bilo je veoma teško.
She is with me now.	Ona je sada sa mnom.
He even told himself.	Čak i sam sebi rekao.
But it's not there.	Ali nije tamo.
Yes there it is.	Da tu je.
I wouldn't want to do that	Ne bih to želio da uradim
She knew before us.	Znala je prije nas.
There is so much to say, and so little time.	Ima toliko toga za reći, a tako malo vremena.
They couldn't, they wouldn't.	Nisu mogli, ne bi.
He was bad.	Bio je loš.
I haven't seen him before this house	Nisam ga vidio prije ove kuće
There was another.	Bio je još jedan.
We could be anything.	Mogli smo biti bilo šta.
I had no idea you were going to be here last night	Nisam imao pojma da ćeš biti ovdje sinoć
I want to tell you no	Želim da ti kažem ne
He didn't ask.	Nije pitao.
I couldn't do it alone	Ne bih to mogao sam
That might help.	To bi moglo pomoći.
There are only a few things to do here.	Ovdje treba uraditi samo nekoliko stvari.
I need to know everything that's going on	Moram da znam sve što se dešava
I know you know more than you told me	Znam da znaš više nego što si mi rekao
He went home.	Otišao je kući.
It just has.	Jednostavno ima.
I shouldn't have been yours	Nisam trebao biti tvoj
A person needs a job	Osoba treba posao
I have done this several times.	Uradio sam ovo više puta.
This is so hard.	Ovo je tako teško.
I was sorry for him.	Bilo mi je žao zbog njega.
If the time comes.	Ako dođe vrijeme.
It's just for fun.	Radi se samo o zabavi.
But it's only a matter of time.	Ali to je samo pitanje vremena.
It should never work.	Nikada ne bi trebao raditi.
He is his own again	On je ponovo svoj
I loved those things.	Voleo sam te stvari.
It's not a good idea to do this.	Nije dobra ideja ovo raditi.
He didn't say.	Nije rekao.
I can't get him there	Ne mogu ga dobiti tamo
This can be good or bad.	Ovo može biti dobro ili loše.
I really like the game.	Mnogo mi se sviđa igra.
I hope it will be good today	Nadam se da će danas biti dobro
And further.	I dalje.
I know you still have it.	Znam da ga još uvek imaš.
I think he's already gone	Mislim da je već otišao
If not now, soon.	Ako ne sada, uskoro.
Nothing can be seen beyond that.	Ništa se ne vidi dalje od toga.
Maybe with that?	Možda s tim?
I didn't know much about it	Nisam znao puno o tome
That would certainly happen.	To bi se sigurno dogodilo.
That's all we are not.	To je sve što nismo.
I don't have one.	Ja nemam.
I didn't know who they were.	Nisam znao ko su oni.
I didn't want to go any further.	Nisam želio dalje.
He did it.	Uradio to.
Maybe they are right and we are wrong.	Možda su oni u pravu, a mi nismo u pravu.
I didn't want them to know that	Nisam želeo da to znaju
It's good now.	Sada je dobro.
I couldn't help myself	Nisam si mogao pomoći
I want to talk about us	Želim razgovarati o nama
You don't know that for sure.	Ne znaš to sigurno.
I've never heard anyone talk about it before.	Nikada ranije nisam čuo da neko priča o tome.
I really love them together	Zaista ih volim zajedno
I just can't be happy	Jednostavno ne mogu biti sretan
He is here to help me.	On je tu da mi pomogne.
I think he's lost now	Mislim da je sada izgubio
He came, but he probably won't stay.	Došao je, ali vjerovatno neće ostati.
She said tomorrow is fine.	Rekla je da je sutra dobro.
I didn't want to hope	Nisam želeo da se nadam
In a few years.	Za nekoliko godina.
I think that was good	Mislim da je to bilo dobro
I never thought it was that bad.	Nikad nisam mislio da je tako loše.
I don't want to be here at all	Ja uopšte ne želim da budem ovde
Except he wasn't there, he's not anymore.	Osim što ga nije bilo, više nije.
No yes.	Ne da.
I want him to say more.	Želim da kaže više.
You always can.	Uvijek možeš.
You didn't do anything.	Ništa nisi uradio.
You can't see it first.	Ne možeš to prvi vidjeti.
You know that.	Ti znaš to.
for that.	za to.
In fact, I worked for him	U stvari, radio sam za njega
Nobody knew why.	Niko nije znao zašto.
I mean, do you know where	Mislim, znaš li gdje
She is very good at it.	Ona je jako dobra u tome.
I know how he feels too	Znam kako se i on osjeća
It's not him.	Nije on.
The first one works fine.	Prvi radi kako treba.
They just didn't know where he was.	Jednostavno nisu znali gdje je.
I could tell almost immediately	Mogao sam reći skoro odmah
It's true.	To je tačno.
I can't believe he just said that	Ne mogu vjerovati da je to upravo rekao
I need you here with me.	Treba mi ovde sa mnom.
That's a lot for you.	To je puno za tebe.
The only thing we can do.	Jedina stvar koju možemo učiniti.
I never realized that.	Nikad to nisam shvatio.
I didn't see where he went	Nisam vidio gdje je otišao
I mean, it's obvious what it is.	Mislim, očigledno je šta je to.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
They were the only ones here.	Ovdje su bili samo oni.
But please don't do anything.	Ali molim te, nemoj ništa da radiš.
I thought as you want to know	Mislio sam kao što želiš da znaš
It wasn't much.	Nije bilo puno.
I don't know why, but he's no better.	Ne znam zašto, ali mu nije bolje.
Which was certainly not often.	Što sigurno nije bilo često.
Just like you.	Baš kao i ti.
I certainly have never heard of it	Sigurno nikad nisam čuo ništa o tome
He would pick things up so quickly.	Tako brzo bi shvatio stvari.
She told me she couldn't stay long.	Rekla mi je da ne može dugo ostati.
You know.	Vi znate.
He never had and never will.	Nikada nije imao i nikada neće.
I wish he was with us today.	Voleo bih da je danas sa nama.
Can anyone help.	Može li neko pomoći.
I wonder why he didn't give it.	Pitam se zašto ga nije dao.
Yes, it would be difficult.	Da, bilo bi teško.
I've never been before.	Nikada ranije nisam.
It was just an idea	To je bila samo ideja
But something tells me.	Ali nešto mi govori.
I hope he knows that	Nadam se da on to zna
She doesn't even know how scared she is.	Ona ni sama ne zna koliko se boji.
I would never do something like that again	Nikada više ne bih uradio tako nešto
He told me so much about it.	Toliko mi je rekao o tome.
She wanted, she wanted.	Htela je, htela je.
I see you didn't mean anything wrong with that	Vidim da nisi mislio ništa loše u tome
But it is not so.	Ali nije tako.
I just know something is going to happen	Samo znam da će se nešto dogoditi
It was better.	Bilo je bolje.
I wanted to tell you myself	Htio sam ti sam reći
I'm leaving now.	Idem odmah.
I mean, you can see what she looks like	Mislim, možete vidjeti kako ona izgleda
He doesn't even know about it.	On čak i ne zna za to.
You can't do anything for me.	Ne možeš ništa za mene.
And that was probably true.	I to je vjerovatno bila istina.
I have something else to do	Imam još nešto da radim
More needs to be done.	Treba učiniti više od toga.
Not just us, but everyone.	Ne samo mi, nego svi.
I just love you so much	Samo te toliko volim
I'm that stuff.	Ja sam te stvari.
I knew it was	Znao sam da je to
And do nothing.	A ne raditi ništa.
I have no idea where he is.	Nemam pojma gdje je.
But it's not that hard.	Ali to nije tako teško.
That's hard enough.	To je dovoljno teško.
I hope so.	Nadam se da jeste.
I'm very sorry about that.	Jako mi je žao zbog toga.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim da je to dobra stvar.
But he can't do that.	Ali on to ne može.
I never could.	Nikada nisam mogao.
I knew it would be so	Znao sam da će tako biti
It's too hard.	Previše je teško.
I'm afraid that's true	Bojim se da je to istina
he thought.	mislio je.
I see you're almost done	Vidim da si to skoro završio
Another problem.	Još jedan problem.
But there may be more.	Ali možda ih ima više.
You have to be able to see it.	Morate to moći vidjeti.
There was no one in the house but me.	U kući nije bilo nikoga osim mene.
I can't do without you.	Ne mogu bez tebe.
I didn't expect to see him	Nisam očekivao da ću ga vidjeti
I can tell you so much.	Mogu ti reći toliko.
But we didn't.	Ali nismo.
I like it here.	Sviđa mi se ovdje.
He was happy for him.	Bio je sretan zbog njega.
I love it so much.	Toliko volim.
I hope all goes well	Nadam se da će sve biti dobro
I had so much more to do	Imao sam još toliko toga da uradim
I wish you never came here	Voleo bih da nikada nisi došao ovde
It happens by itself.	To se dešava samo od sebe.
I don't want that to happen here	Ne želim da se to dešava ovdje
I shouldn't have been so surprised	Nisam trebao biti toliko iznenađen
I was tired and wanted to stay home	Bio sam umoran i htio sam ostati kod kuće
I got lost a few times	Izgubio sam se nekoliko puta
I have nothing bad to say about it.	Nemam ništa loše da kažem o tome.
I couldn't help it	Nisam mogao pomoći
That's not a problem.	To nije problem.
I knew what he was planning	Znao sam šta planira
It just works badly.	Samo loše radi.
It won't be.	Neće biti.
I do not want.	Ne želim.
And that will be a problem.	I to će biti problem.
I can't say how right you are	Ne mogu reći koliko ste u pravu
They did very well.	Uradili su veoma dobro.
I have to go for a while	Moram ići na neko vrijeme
I didn't know, but I was fine	Nisam znao, ali bilo mi je dobro
I have nothing to do with it	Nemam ništa s tim
This is not something that can be done this way.	Ovo nije nešto što se može uraditi na ovaj način.
I told him not to do that.	Rekao sam mu da to ne radi.
We are here for you.	Tu smo za vas.
People should know more.	Ljudi bi ih trebali znati više.
I didn't mean to say that	Nisam to mislio reći
He should have brought me back here, which he did.	Trebao me je vratiti ovdje, što je i učinio.
He is them, not him.	On su oni, a ne on.
And she's there.	I ona je tamo.
I think.	Mislim, da.
There was a lot to live for.	Bilo je puno toga za život.
Tell me who did it.	Reci mi ko je to uradio.
I do all these things and more	Radim sve ove stvari i više od toga
You were right.	Bili ste u pravu.
There's nothing I can do	Ne mogu ništa da uradim
He'll be home soon.	Uskoro će biti kući.
I said yes, everything is fine with me	Rekao sam da, sve je u redu sa mnom
I've done it before	Radio sam to ranije
He said no.	Rekao je da nije.
I didn't even know it existed until tonight	Nisam ni znao da postoji do večeras
I can't stay here.	Ne mogu ostati ovdje.
There are few people.	Malo je ljudi.
He asked what he said.	Pitao je šta je rekao.
That would never happen.	To se nikada ne bi dogodilo.
I wouldn't know what it's like to do that	Ne bih znao kako je to, da to radim
That is our only hope.	To nam je jedina nada.
I need to know it's good	Moram da znam da je dobro
He didn't ask about you.	Nije pitao za tebe.
I hope he's not gone yet	Nadam se da već nije otišao
It just looks bad.	Jednostavno izgleda loše.
I didn't get anything	Nisam dobio ništa
I wish she knew.	Voleo bih da je znala.
I got it.	Imam ga.
I knew it wasn't like that.	Znao sam da nije tako.
I can't help myself anymore	Ne mogu si više pomoći
It's simple.	To je jednostavno.
I am ready for this job	Spreman sam za ovaj posao
I didn't want to be like him	Nisam htela da budem kao on
We just don't know exactly why.	Samo ne znamo tačno zašto.
My friend is gone.	Moj prijatelj je otišao.
You too.	I ti.
I thought everyone knew	Mislio sam da svi znaju
It will be.	Biti će.
I had no idea what to do next	Nisam imao pojma šta dalje
I asked, but she didn't say	Pitao sam, ali nije rekla
It's fast, it's easy and it works.	Brzo je, lako je i radi.
I was surprised	Bio sam iznenađen
You were just.	Bio si samo.
I didn't have to say anything	Nisam trebao ništa reći
He didn't have one.	Nije ga imao.
That's it.	To je to.
You didn't ask things right away.	Nisi pitao stvari odmah.
He left.	Otišao je.
I just love her.	Ja je jednostavno volim.
I didn't hear anything	Nisam čuo ništa
She doesn't say much.	Ona ne govori puno.
Or okay, fine.	Ili u redu, dobro.
Something happened.	Nešto se dogodilo.
I know this is very true for me.	Znam da je ovo veoma tačno za mene.
But now that path no longer exists.	Ali sada taj put više ne postoji.
What he says is true.	Ono što on kaže je tačno.
I have so much to say.	Imam toliko toga za reći.
In fact, many years ago.	U stvari, prije mnogo godina.
She was there to work.	Bila je tu da radi.
Now, it works.	Sada, radi.
And I almost got home	I ja sam skoro stigao kući
He even said.	Čak je i rekao.
I don't know what happened to me.	Ne znam šta mi se dogodilo.
I know what it's like to be alone	Znam kako je biti sam
I couldn't believe what just happened	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta se upravo dogodilo
I got it.	Shvatio sam to.
There is work.	Postoji posao.
But a little.	Ali malo.
Lots of money together	Mnogo novca zajedno
Or he ever would be.	Ili bi ikada bio.
I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for him.	Ne bih bio ovdje danas da nije bilo njega.
Unless you like it.	Osim ako ti se to sviđa.
He says this is not his first time.	Kaže da mu ovo nije prvi put.
I had to do this	Morao sam ovo da uradim
You better be there when she's.	Bolje da si tamo kad ona bude.
But where.	Ali gdje .
She really doesn't like it.	Ona to zaista ne voli.
And she was good to me.	I bila je dobra za mene.
And it’s really easy to do anywhere.	A to je zaista lako učiniti bilo gdje.
I wasn't ready to be alone	Nisam bio spreman da budem sam
You don't say.	Ne kažeš.
I never meant that	Nikad to nisam mislio
But that is not enough, he said.	Ali to nije dovoljno, rekao je.
He said he would.	Rekao je da hoće.
This is enough.	Ovo je dovoljno.
I could do it myself at home.	Mogao bih i sam to raditi kod kuće.
I had no idea who they were	Nisam imao pojma ko su oni
Now I really have to go	Sada stvarno moram da idem
I can't do this.	Ne mogu ovo.
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
I need a little of that	Treba mi malo toga
I wondered if it was okay	Pitao sam se da li je dobro
This is going to happen.	Ovo će se dogoditi.
We have to go and see.	Moramo otići i vidjeti.
He didn't see how one man could do that.	Nije vidio kako to može učiniti jedan čovjek.
He didn't have to.	Nije morao.
He brought them back.	Vratio ih je.
Or he says he thought so.	Ili kaže da je tako mislio.
But that is simply not true.	Ali to jednostavno nije istina.
More things are happening.	Više stvari se dešava.
We felt sorry for him.	Bilo nam ga je žao.
I think you're good for him	Mislim da si dobra za njega
That's how it was.	Tako je to bilo.
I think you know right away	Mislim da odmah znaš
I think it speaks for itself !.	Mislim da to govori samo za sebe!.
But there he was, just what he needed.	Ali tu je bilo, upravo ono što mu je trebalo.
I have to do it right.	Moram to uraditi kako treba.
I shouldn't have said that	Nisam to trebao reći
Nothing happened, which was good.	Ništa se nije dogodilo, što je bilo dobro.
One for you, one for me.	Jedan za tebe, jedan za mene.
I was with that.	Bio sam sa tim.
I'm surprised when she says yes	Iznenađen sam kada ona kaže da
That's not right, he told himself.	To nije u redu, rekao je sebi.
But it doesn't seem to work.	Ali izgleda da ne radi.
Nobody knew he was going.	Niko nije znao da ide.
I already asked there, last night	Već sam tamo pitao, sinoć
And they did a lot.	I uradili su mnogo.
He didn't want her to do it.	Nije želio da ona to radi.
It's not us.	Nismo mi.
This was this one.	Ovo je bio ovaj.
But maybe they shouldn't be.	Ali možda i ne bi trebali biti.
And we like it that way.	I sviđa nam se tako.
I would like to see you.	Voleo bih da te vidim.
He was with me.	Bio je sa mnom.
Like this one.	Kao što je ovaj.
I still think of him today	I dan danas mislim na njega
I need some time.	Treba mi vremena.
I can meet tomorrow.	Mogu se naći sutra.
I was very happy	Bio sam veoma sretan
He couldn't help it.	Nije mogao pomoći.
He's at a friend's house tonight.	Večeras je kod prijatelja.
I don't know what he's trying to tell me.	Ne znam šta pokušava da mi kaže.
I really need money	Zaista mi treba novac
He left.	Otišao je.
I didn't expect it	Nisam očekivao
Just three days.	Samo tri dana.
There are several problems here.	Tu postoji nekoliko problema.
Today was not the day for that.	Danas nije bio dan za to.
Really bad, actually.	Zaista loše, zapravo.
I couldn't know in any way	Ne bih mogao ni na koji način da znam
I think he means it this time.	Mislim da ovaj put to misli.
If you do, this is for you.	Ako to uradite, ovo je za vas.
The more you know.	Što više znaš.
I didn't want to ever have it	Nisam htela da ga ikada imam
I wasn’t there when it happened.	Nisam bio tamo kada se to dogodilo.
They could have been anything.	Mogli su biti bilo šta.
But it was the only way they had.	Ali to je bio jedini put koji su imali.
I've never seen him before	Nikada ga ranije nisam vidio
This takes time.	Za ovo treba vremena.
It's not right.	Nije u redu.
I probably would too.	Verovatno bih i ja.
She knows better.	Ona zna bolje.
Let's see how it is.	Da vidim kako je.
I already know that.	Znam to već.
It was hard for us to leave.	Bilo nam je teško otići.
I shouldn't stay	Ne bih trebao ostati
He knows exactly what he did to me.	On tačno zna šta mi je uradio.
I couldn't tell who they were.	Nisam mogao reći ko su oni.
It is what it is.	To je ono što je.
I didn't have it for myself	Nisam imao za sebe
I heard it all from a friend	Sve sam to čuo od prijatelja
We just don't know who they are.	Samo ne znamo ko su oni.
I couldn't find him.	Nisam ga mogao naći.
I hope you are too.	Nadam se da si i ti.
We know we have a good team.	Znamo da imamo i dobar tim.
I have to tell everyone.	Moram svima reći.
It will do.	To će učiniti.
They are together.	Zajedno su on.
I don't see it.	Ja to ne vidim.
This does not happen often.	Ovo se ne dešava često.
I say, for now it is.	Kažem, za sada jeste.
I don't know how it works.	Ne znam kako to radi.
Everything is OK.	Sve je u redu.
I asked what she was doing.	Pitao sam šta ona radi.
Neither did I.	Nisam ni ja.
I knew exactly what he was talking about	Tačno sam znao o čemu priča
I don't know what, but it works.	Ne znam šta, ali radi.
For a long time.	Za dugo vremena.
She will be fine.	Ona će biti dobro.
This was a good thing.	Ovo je bila dobra stvar.
I mean it this time.	Mislim to ovaj put.
And another one.	I još jedan.
I would say it is	Rekao bih da jeste
Is that right?	Je li tako?
I thought it was going to be hard	Mislio sam da će biti teško
I couldn't see them	Nisam ih mogao vidjeti
I was supposed to go tonight	Trebalo je da idem večeras
I haven't been back here very long	Nisam se vratio ovde jako dugo
Often more than that.	Često i više od toga.
Now it works without problems.	Sada radi bez problema.
I knew you had it in you	Znao sam da imaš to u sebi
So very.	Tako veoma.
But he must be told.	Ali mu se mora reći.
I want to say something.	Želim nešto reći.
It won't be like that.	Neće biti tako.
I only had it to myself	Imao sam ga samo za sebe
I began to wonder if he was okay	Počeo sam da se pitam da li je dobro
And he or she is right.	I on ili ona su u pravu.
I asked him why, but he couldn't tell me	Pitao sam ga zašto, ali mi nije znao reći
He decided he had to.	Odlučio je da mora.
I probably should have	Verovatno sam trebao
I can't stay there anymore	Ne mogu više ostati tamo
I just can't do it.	Jednostavno ne mogu na to.
I tried to pray, but I couldn't	Pokušao sam da se molim, ali nisam mogao
No, he said.	Nisam, rekao je.
I knew you would be the one	Znao sam da ćeš ti biti taj
I knew this was going to be really bad.	Znao sam da će ovo biti jako loše.
I didn't mind not telling him	Nije mi bilo loše što mu nisam rekla
I shouldn't have seen them again	Nisam trebao da ih ponovo vidim
But that was not certain enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno sigurno.
It's true.	To je istina.
But that is exactly what happened.	Ali upravo se to dogodilo.
We have to be here.	Moramo biti ovdje.
I had to go back.	Morao sam se vratiti.
Except for.	Osim za .
I have to be busy.	Moram biti zauzet.
I think she loves you too	Mislim da i ona tebe voli
I didn't expect it.	Nisam očekivao.
I don't know what the exact reason is.	Ne znam šta je tačno razlog.
You never really know, it seems to me.	Nikad se zapravo ne zna, čini mi se.
I want to go to work.	Želim na posao.
I never saw her.	Nikad je nisam video.
And he left.	I otišao je.
I know you didn't.	Znam da nisi.
You have to too.	Morate i vi.
There are very few people here.	Ovdje je vrlo malo ljudi.
I didn't know how this could be	Nisam znao kako je ovo moglo biti
She said it had happened before.	Rekla je da se to dogodilo i prije.
I heard about it yesterday	Čuo sam za to juče
I didn't know you were still together	Nisam znao da ste još zajedno
This time I was alone	Ovaj put sam bio sam
And it happened here.	I to se dogodilo ovdje.
I want to help, he said	Želim pomoći, rekao je
I was actually with him.	Ja sam zapravo bio sa njim.
But that's not all.	Ali to nije sve.
Who knows what might happen next?	Ko zna šta bi moglo biti sljedeće?
Obviously that was once true, it is no longer.	Očigledno je to nekada bila istina, više nije.
I asked for help, but there was none.	Tražio sam pomoć, ali je nije bilo.
I didn't mean to tell you this	Nisam htela da ti ovo kažem
I love you all very much	Ja vas sve jako volim
And he loves it.	I to ga voli.
This time there were several.	Ovaj put ih je bilo nekoliko.
What sees you.	Šta te vidi.
I wish it was fast.	Voleo bih da bude brzo.
It's in us.	To je u nama.
That's it .	To je to .
Many times, actually.	Mnogo puta, zapravo.
According to.	Prema.
I can do it.	Ja to mogu.
I left home, made a living for myself	Otišao sam od kuće, napravio sebi život
He knew what to do.	Znao je šta treba da uradi.
He had no one to tell him how to live.	Nije imao ko da mu kaže kako da živi.
It was pretty bad for a few years.	Bilo je prilično loše nekoliko godina.
But it was there.	Ali to je bilo tamo.
I know you mean well	Znam da misliš dobro
I thought tonight would be better for me	Mislio sam da će večeras biti bolje za mene
I love both.	Oboje volim.
She does it often.	Ona to radi često.
This is not a problem.	Ovo nije problem.
I said that she would say no, but she didn't.	Rekao sam to da bi ona rekla ne, ali nije.
But it couldn't do everything.	Ali nije moglo sve.
Maybe too much.	Možda i previše.
I really wanted to see everything	Zaista sam htio vidjeti sve
I need to know what's going on	Moram da znam šta se dešava
That's real.	To je stvarno.
I would like him to help me	Voleo bih da mi pomogne
There are several things.	Postoji nekoliko stvari.
The idea of ​​it was too much.	Ideja o tome je bila previše.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
I came to be alone	Došao sam da budem sam
Can you go back there, please.	Možete se vratiti tamo, molim vas.
Perhaps too obvious.	Možda previše očigledno.
If you want, you can say nothing.	Ako želite, ne možete ništa reći.
It was still with him, perhaps always would be.	Još uvijek je bilo s njim, možda će uvijek biti.
I didn't know what it was.	Nisam znao šta je to.
I shouldn't have said that	Nisam to trebao reći
I'm not sure why or how.	Nisam baš siguran zašto i kako.
But there is one problem with it.	Ali postoji jedan problem sa njim.
I want those things for myself	Želim te stvari za sebe
Either you are or you aren't.	Ili jesi ili nisi.
I just wondered why that was	Samo sam se pitao zašto je to tako
I can't be with you anymore	Ne mogu više biti s tobom
I couldn’t believe how fast it happened	Nisam mogao vjerovati koliko se brzo to dogodilo
He will come after me.	Doći će za mnom.
I love it so, so, so much	Volim to tako, tako, toliko
I can leave immediately	Mogu odmah otići
I just need to know what to do next	Samo moram da znam šta dalje da radim
I have to be a little alone	Moram da budem malo sama
You seem to know a lot.	Čini se da znate mnogo toga.
I won't stay long.	Neću dugo ostati.
I'd rather be without.	Prije bih bio bez.
I have done that.	Uradio sam to.
You can't help yourself.	Ne možete si pomoći.
He did this to me.	Uradio mi je ovo.
There was no one.	Nikoga nije bilo.
I told myself that was enough	Rekao sam sebi da je dosta
Is that it.	Je li to ono.
Absolutely.	Potpuno.
I would never do that	Nikada to ne bih uradio
I think they are a better team.	Mislim da su oni bolji tim.
I know he loves you	Znam da te voli
And it happens.	I to se dešava.
It was strong.	Bilo je jako.
You can help us.	Možete nam pomoći.
I mean, very few people	Mislim, vrlo malo ljudi
I was not happy.	Nije mi bilo drago.
Much more than it should be	Mnogo više nego što bi trebalo biti
He has it.	Ima ga.
He thought she could do it.	Mislio je da ona to može.
I know how hard it is	Znam koliko je teško
For that better way.	Za taj bolji način.
But that alone is not enough.	Ali samo to nije dovoljno.
At the moment, I don't really like anyone	Trenutno mi se baš niko ne sviđa
Here is all or nothing.	Ovdje je sve ili ništa.
What would she do.	Što bi ona.
I can say he doesn't want to	Mogu reći da ne želi
We should go, 'he said.	Trebali bismo ići', rekao je.
She says nothing.	Ona ne govori ništa.
I need more time.	Treba mi još vremena.
I couldn't let you do that	Nisam ti to mogao dozvoliti
I guess some of that is still working	Pretpostavljam da nešto od toga još uvijek radi
I could talk	Mogao bih razgovarati
I want to be the one to do it	Želim da budem taj koji to radi
I love them much more than myself	Volim ih mnogo više od sebe
But that was tomorrow.	Ali to je bilo sutra.
I just told him who they were, that's all	Samo sam mu rekao ko su, to je sve
I really have to go home	Stvarno moram da idem kući
I have a few.	Imam ih nekoliko.
I had to do this alone	Morao sam ovo da uradim sam
Someone tell you who you are.	Neko da ti kaže ko si.
I mean, I really like it	Mislim, stvarno volim
I could help him with that.	Mogao bih mu pomoći u tome.
I bought everything, I didn't even have to see it.	Sve sam kupio, nisam ni morao vidjeti.
No one was home at the time.	U to vrijeme niko nije bio kod kuće.
I need to know what's going on next.	Moram da znam šta se dalje dešava.
He loved that thing.	Voleo je tu stvar.
I mean, just everyone, everyone.	Mislim, baš svi, svi.
This was true.	Ovo je bila istina.
I did not know what to say.	Nisam znao šta da kažem.
I just had a bad day	Samo sam imao loš dan
I want to help.	Želim pomoći.
I hope there will be more	Nadam se da će biti još toga
No, that's not it.	Ne, nije to.
Except there is one problem.	Osim što postoji jedan problem.
I'm not saying you can't	Ne kažem da ne možete
I didn't have that either	Nisam ni to imao
I mean, this is going for both of us	Mislim, ovo ide za nas oboje
I think that can help us	Mislim da nam to može pomoći
You have to do better than that.	Moraš bolje od toga.
I won't tell him anything.	Neću mu ništa reći.
When he comes to school.	Kad dođe u školu.
I just never did.	Samo nikad nisam.
I didn't say that.	Nisam to rekao.
What did you say?	O čemu si rekao.
But it was all me.	Ali sve sam to bio ja.
I love everything you do	Volim sve što radiš
I love you completely.	Ja te potpuno volim.
They are people like us.	Oni su ljudi kao i mi.
It's not about what you can't do.	Ne radi se o tome šta ne možete da uradite.
There is no help for anyone.	Nema nikome pomoći.
We have home.	Kući imamo.
I think everyone knows who they are.	Mislim da svi znaju ko su oni.
And maybe that's a good thing.	A možda je to i dobro.
But yours too.	Ali i tvoj.
That was not true.	To nije bila istina.
I had to be ready	Morao sam biti spreman
He's still not here.	Još uvijek nije tu.
I never tried again.	Nikada više nisam pokušao.
I should have seen it was you	Trebao sam da vidim da si to ti
Now we have done it.	Sada smo to uradili.
I never asked her how she felt about it	Nikad je nisam pitao kako se osjeća zbog toga
I knew exactly what awaited us there	Tačno sam znao šta nas tamo čeka
Just a little, he told himself.	Samo malo, rekao je sebi.
Soon, he would say.	Uskoro, rekao bi.
Maybe it's not obvious.	Možda nije očigledno.
But it wasn't just you and him.	Ali niste bili samo ti i on.
I want to do it myself.	Želim to učiniti sam.
It's just working now.	Sada se samo radi.
It's never been before.	Nikada prije nije bilo.
I immediately said the obvious	Odmah sam rekao očigledno
He could see it now.	Sada je to mogao vidjeti.
I want to go do everything with you	Želim da idem da uradim sve sa tobom
I have to be here for you	Moram biti ovdje za tebe
But that was none of my business.	Ali to nije bila moja stvar.
But we really don't know what it looked like.	Ali kako je izgledao, zaista ne znamo.
That is what is happening.	To je ono što se dešava.
I've been here a few times	Bio sam ovdje nekoliko puta
I couldn't be that man	Nisam mogao biti taj čovjek
I think he needs a friend.	Mislim da mu treba prijatelj.
A little.	Malo.
I even tell you what to say	Čak ti kažem šta da kažeš
It's not hard to do.	To nije teško uraditi.
We can work on several things	Možemo raditi na nekoliko stvari
I already know enough	Već znam dovoljno
I think you know what to do	Mislim da znaš šta da radiš
And you don't have to go much further than that.	I ne morate ići mnogo dalje od toga.
Everything looks fine.	Sve izgleda u redu.
I really thought they were better than that	Zaista sam mislio da su bolji od toga
We know where they are.	Znamo gdje su.
Now let me tell you something.	Sada da ti kažem nešto.
I just want to go home	Samo želim da idem kući
I think he's telling the truth	Mislim da govori istinu
I didn't even want to see it.	Nisam to htela ni da vidim.
It was just the truth.	To je bila samo istina.
I'm not sure why this is happening.	Nisam siguran zašto se to dešava.
I'll tell you why.	Reći ću ti zašto.
It's totally fine.	Potpuno je u redu.
But there was something else.	Ali bilo je još nešto.
I can't, I just can't.	Ne mogu, jednostavno ne mogu.
I know he's with you	Znam da je sa tobom
I told you not to do that anymore	Rekao sam ti da to više ne radiš
If he wanted me to know, he would tell me soon.	Da je želio da znam, uskoro bi mi rekao.
I guess it just wasn’t enough	Pretpostavljam da jednostavno nije bilo dovoljno
I like this.	Sviđa mi se ovo.
We need to talk.	Moramo razgovarati.
I started to like it	Počeo sam da mi se sviđa
I didn't expect to find anything.	Nisam očekivao da ću ništa naći.
She knew what she had to do.	Znala je šta treba da uradi.
I think it's hard	Mislim da je to teško
I was wondering when one of you would come	Pitao sam se kada će neko od vas doći
I thought this would be easy	Mislio sam da će ovo biti lako
I loved that it was so simple	Voleo sam da je tako jednostavno
They did nothing.	Nisu uradili ništa.
Something like that happened last week.	Tako nešto se dogodilo prošle sedmice.
I guess you had a good reason	Pretpostavljam da si imao dobar razlog
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
And she really wants it.	I ona to zaista želi.
I'll pick you up again	Doći ću po tebe ponovo
You should never have stayed home.	Nikada nisi trebao ostati kod kuće.
I wonder what it's about	Pitam se o čemu se radi
he wondered.	pitao se on.
I didn't expect it to be mine	Nisam očekivao da će biti moja
People are here.	Ljudi su ovdje.
I wish he was here now.	Voleo bih da je sada ovde.
It looks simple enough.	Izgleda dovoljno jednostavno.
I didn't hear anything	Nisam čuo ništa
It might not be right, but it's true.	Možda nije u redu, ali tako je.
She said it happened so fast.	Rekla je da se to dogodilo tako brzo.
This may or may not work for you.	Ovo vam može, ali i ne mora raditi.
But that is not the case.	Ali to nije tako.
Tired but good.	Umoran, ali dobar.
This was more than enough.	Ovo je bilo više nego dovoljno.
What do you think.	Šta ti misliš.
Maybe there's another one.	Možda postoji još jedan.
I just needed to say yes	Trebao sam samo da kažem da
So far you are right.	Za sada ste u pravu.
I can't be with you	Ne mogu biti s tobom
I really hope you can	Zaista se nadam da ćeš moći
He knows we are not doing anything wrong.	On zna da ne radimo ništa loše.
He said he did.	Rekao je da jeste.
I think that's what it's about	Mislim da je to ono o čemu se radi
And only her.	I samo ona.
Just tell me what you need.	Samo mi reci šta ti treba.
I didn't know where he lived	Nisam znao gdje živi
I have to go back to school next year	Moram se vratiti u školu sljedeće godine
I almost didn't go to work this morning	Jutros skoro nisam otišao na posao
I can not tell you.	Ne mogu ti reći.
This is almost always obvious.	Ovo je skoro uvek očigledno.
So much.	Tako mnogo.
I can't believe this	Ne mogu vjerovati u ovo
That's really bad.	To je stvarno loše.
I was glad he was with us	Bilo mi je drago što je sa nama
I want to go home now, please	Želim sada kući, molim te
You have to work with us.	Morate raditi sa nama.
I didn't see her do that.	Nisam je vidio da to radi.
And it happened.	I to se dogodilo.
Probably not much.	Verovatno ne mnogo.
And he saw that he looked much better.	I vidio je da izgleda mnogo bolje.
You probably are.	Verovatno jesi.
And it's okay.	I u redu je.
I knew it was probably nothing	Znao sam da vjerovatno nije ništa
I never knew that.	Nikad to nisam znao.
And he was right.	I bio je u pravu.
It's not real.	Nije stvarno.
I have a lot to do	Imam puno toga za raditi
They were not alive.	Nisu bili živi.
You want money.	Želiš novac.
I don't like it here anymore	Više mi se ne sviđa ovdje
I’m not sure that’s the right way to do it.	Nisam siguran da je to pravi način da se to uradi.
I asked if we could see them today or tomorrow.	Pitao sam da li ih možemo vidjeti danas ili sutra.
You can get the money anywhere.	Novac možete dobiti bilo gdje.
I knew exactly what he meant	Tačno sam znao šta je mislio
I can't work.	Ne mogu da radim.
I hope and pray for you too	Nadam se i molim se tome i za vas
I know you have to do it	Znam da to moraš da uradiš
Or maybe not anymore.	Ili možda više nije.
I mean from there	Mislim od tamo
I hope you are.	Nadam se da jesi.
I wonder who did it	Pitam se ko je to uradio
And it works.	I radi.
I don't need anything	Ne treba mi ništa
I was wondering this too	I ja sam se ovo pitao
Which happened to him this year.	Što mu se i dogodilo ove godine.
I have to pray for this	Moram da se molim za ovo
I need to know if this is true	Moram da znam da li je ovo istina
I think you need something	Mislim da ti treba nešto
He didn't hear her.	Nije je čuo.
He knew that.	On je to znao.
I want to see what else is there	Želim da vidim šta je još tamo
That in itself speaks for itself.	To samo po sebi govori.
It's not enough.	Nije dovoljno.
It can't get any better than that.	Ne može biti bolje od toga.
And you're pretty right.	I prilično ste u pravu.
When that was the case, he started again.	Kada je to bilo, počeo je ponovo.
I wanted to talk to you before that	Htio sam razgovarati s tobom prije toga
I just know what he thinks	Samo znam šta on misli
He knew what had to happen now.	Znao je šta se sada mora dogoditi.
You can be sure of that.	U to možete biti sigurni.
I think everyone knows the truth	Mislim da svi znaju istinu
Now tell me more.	Sada mi reci više.
I don't want him to live alone anymore	Ne želim da više živi sam
And he's not here.	A on nije ovdje.
That was a few years ago.	To je bilo prije nekoliko godina.
He never knew who he was.	Nikad nije znao ko je on.
I would love for him to come	Voleo bih da dođe
She didn't want that.	Ona to nije htela.
But only for one day.	Ali samo na jedan dan.
I really want to see him	Zaista ga želim vidjeti
She's not there.	Ona nije tamo.
The next question to the next question he even wanted.	Sljedeće pitanje na sljedeće pitanje je čak htio.
I have to ask him something is everything	Moram da ga pitam nešto je sve
I've never seen that	Nikad to nisam vidio
I have to go see him	Moram ići da ga vidim
None of you.	Niko od vas.
I know a lot of people who wouldn’t do that	Znam puno ljudi koji to ne bi uradili
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
I wish you could.	Voleo bih da možeš.
That will never happen.	To se nikada neće dogoditi.
I was thinking about him.	Mislio sam na njega.
Very difficult for us.	Veoma teško za nas.
People are not.	Ljudi nisu.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu ide.
I didn't want to go	Nisam htela da idem
He won't be back.	Neće se vratiti.
Tell me now.	Reci mi sada.
I don't think that's true	Mislim da to nije istina
I knew it would be hard for him	Znao sam da će mu biti teško
If there was time.	Kad bi bilo vremena.
I hope this could help you.	Nadam se da bi vam ovo moglo pomoći.
But you know how it is.	Ali znaš kako je.
That’s one good reason not to do it.	To je jedan dobar razlog da to ne radite.
Maybe he was right.	Možda je bio u pravu.
I didn't want to be alone anymore	Nisam više htela da budem sama
So we'll do it ourselves.	Tako da ćemo to sami uraditi.
Now he has done it.	Sada je to uradio.
But I can't.	Ali ne mogu.
I can't really.	Ne mogu stvarno.
It was never you.	Nikad nisi bio ti.
I never thought it would happen so fast	Nikad nisam mislio da će se to dogoditi tako brzo
I already knew that.	To sam već znao.
I just finished mine	Upravo sam završio svoj
I'm so sorry he doesn't see	Toliko mi je žao da ne vidi
Which is a good thing.	Što je dobra stvar.
You don't have to do this alone.	Ne morate ovo da radite sami.
But it shouldn't.	Ali ne bi trebalo.
This is hard to do.	Ovo je teško uraditi.
It could be someone.	Mogao bi biti neko.
We couldn't reach you.	Nismo mogli doći do tebe.
I was ready for more.	Bio sam spreman za više.
I've figured that out for a while	Shvatio sam to već neko vrijeme
It does not exist.	Ne postoji.
I won't say anything	Neću ništa reći
I didn't even realize it	Nisam to ni shvatio
I didn't think he would do it	Nisam mislio da će to učiniti
I was the first to be ready for dinner	Bio sam prvi spreman za večeru
I hope they couldn't say	Nadam se da nisu mogli reći
Life for life, he says	Život za život, kaže on
I wouldn't say no.	Ne bi rekao ne.
I hope this was helpful !.	Nadam se da je ovo bilo od pomoći!.
It exists with or without you.	Postoji sa ili bez tebe.
She says he's gone.	Ona kaže da je otišao.
They are still together.	Još su zajedno.
I know it will be difficult	Znam da će biti teško
We always are.	Uvek smo.
It didn't take long.	Nije dugo trebalo.
I don’t know if he loves me or not.	Ne znam da li me voli ili ne.
I didn't know anyone was here	Nisam znala da je neko ovde
He knew what to do.	Znao je šta da radi.
Maybe it will be earlier.	Možda će to biti ranije.
I didn't really admit it either	Ni ja to nisam baš priznao
I was just thinking about you earlier tonight	Samo sam mislio na tebe ranije večeras
I asked him what was waiting	Pitao sam ga šta čeka
We don't know who they are	Ne znamo ko su oni
I do not know what it is.	Ne znam šta je to.
We won't say.	Nećemo reći.
I wonder what they did to him	Pitam se šta su mu uradili
And it was good.	I bilo je dobro.
I think they would already be here	Mislim da bi već bili ovde
He says it's in a bad way.	Kaže da je na loš način.
I say we have something for us too	Kažem da imamo nešto i za nas
I've heard enough of them.	Čuo sam ih dovoljno.
But that was never enough.	Ali to nikada nije bilo dovoljno.
Maybe I'm not the one talking.	Možda nisam taj koji govori.
I still can't believe it.	Još uvijek ne mogu vjerovati.
Much much much more.	Mnogo mnogo mnogo više.
You can go home.	Možeš se vratiti kući.
There were so many of them.	Toliko ih je bilo.
And so life goes on.	I tako život ide dalje.
He says it is.	Kaže kako jeste.
We don't know anything about that.	Ne znamo ništa o tome.
I think you've had enough.	Mislim da ti je dosta toga.
I'm here before you	Ovdje sam prije tebe
What do you think?.	Šta ti misliš?.
I guess I do it myself	Pretpostavljam da to uradim sam
I wouldn't do that.	Ne bih to uradio.
I mean if you want	Mislim ako želiš
It's not easy being me.	Nije lako biti ja.
He couldn't do much here.	Nije mogao mnogo da uradi ovde.
He will not be the one to do this.	On neće biti taj koji će ovo uraditi.
Don't do that to me anymore.	Ne radi mi to više.
I couldn't see him	Nisam mogao da ga vidim
I already knew where he lived	Već sam znao gdje živi
We haven't been together long.	Nismo dugo zajedno.
The problem itself.	Sam problem.
Question for you this morning.	Pitanje za tebe jutros.
I couldn't trust anyone here	Nisam mogao nikome vjerovati ovdje
I knew what needed to be done	Znao sam šta je trebalo učiniti
The more you know, the more you can.	Što više znaš, više možeš.
I think very hard work	Mislim jako teško raditi
I've never done that.	Nikada to nisam radio.
I like to be told what to do	Volim da mi se kaže šta da radim
I wonder if anyone really could	Pitam se da li bi neko zaista mogao
There really isn't much more to say.	Zaista nema mnogo više da se kaže.
You are good person.	Ti si dobra osoba.
I do not have to.	Ne moram.
I know you meant well	Znam da si mislio dobro
But it is.	Ali jeste.
I'm not sure about that	Nisam siguran u to
I don't want that anymore.	Ne želim to više.
But the question is how much.	Ali pitanje je koliko.
If needed.	Ako treba.
He didn't do it often.	Nije to često radio.
You know this is true.	Znaš da je ovo istina.
It's hard to say.	Teško je reći.
He probably wouldn't get home.	Vjerovatno ne bi stigao kući.
But I have a question for you	Ali imam pitanje za tebe
I thought so too.	I ja sam tako mislio.
Just like them.	Baš kao i oni.
I would start with that.	Počeo bih s tim.
Things will get better, they always will.	Stvari će ići na bolje, uvijek će biti.
As much as it was before.	Koliko je to bilo prije.
I have to do this for myself	Moram ovo da uradim za sebe
This can't be good !.	Ovo ne može biti dobro!.
The job he obviously wanted	Posao koji je očigledno želeo
Whether they knew it or not.	Znali oni to ili ne.
I'm not doing anything.	Ne radim ništa.
I don't know the time without it	Ne znam vrijeme bez toga
No one is sure.	Niko nije siguran.
Was.	Bilo je.
But now there is not even a road.	Ali sada nema čak ni puta.
a.	a.
I want to be a good person	Želim da budem dobra osoba
But there were also problems.	Ali bilo je i problema.
Only he heard it.	Samo je on to čuo.
I know what to say.	Znam šta bi rekao.
I didn't even know what to say to that right away	Nisam ni znao šta da odmah kažem na to
He wasn't.	Nije bio.
I don't think that would be bad	Ne mislim da bi to bilo loše
I knew something was going on here	Znao sam da se ovdje nešto dešava
But only one problem.	Ali samo jedan problem.
I have no doubt he will	Ne sumnjam da hoće
I already know that.	Znam to već.
It never really is.	Nikada zapravo nije.
Do you like it?' 	Da li ti se sviđa?'
And there is no tomorrow.	I ne postoji sutra.
I always thought it would be	Uvek sam mislio da će biti
But that was it.	Ali, to je bilo to.
That we need help.	Da nam treba pomoć.
I really didn't have a friend	Zaista nisam imao prijatelja
Much better in yourself	Mnogo bolje u sebi
We knew that.	To smo znali.
It's just.	To je samo.
I've had enough for now	Dosta mi je za sada
I'm not ready for that.	Nisam spreman za to.
He didn't want to talk about it either.	Ni o tome nije želio da govori.
I am so happy to have so many.	Tako sam sretan što ih imam toliko.
Everything should go to him, and he will talk to me.	Sve treba da ide kod njega, a on će razgovarati sa mnom.
This makes me happy.	Ovo mi je drago.
He would come back.	Vratio bi se.
This just doesn't work.	Ovo jednostavno ne radi.
But not all.	Ali ne sve.
I hope you can help me with that.	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći u tome.
No more, tonight.	Nema više, večeras.
It's like he's happy.	Kao da je sretan.
I tried to see it as he did	Pokušao sam to vidjeti kao on
I would have to do what my father tells me	Morao bih da radim ono što mi otac kaže
I'm not saying we should know	Ne kažem da treba da znamo
That was the only way, you know.	To je bio jedini način, znaš.
Either this or that, he says.	Ili ovaj ili ovaj, kaže on.
She knew now.	Sada je znala.
I just thought.	Samo sam mislio.
That's what I thought at the time	To sam mislio u to vrijeme
He should never have come back.	Nikada se nije trebao vratiti.
But someone will do it.	Ali neko će to uraditi.
You should leave.	Trebalo bi otići.
We don't like it.	Ne sviđa nam se.
Long time.	Dugo vremena.
But it is not so.	Ali nije tako.
For a while I wondered if something was wrong	Neko vrijeme sam se pitao da li nešto nije u redu
He's not my first.	Nije mi prvi.
I've never seen that	Nikad to nisam vidio
Yes, very much.	Da, veoma.
I didn't get it	Nisam to shvatio
That did not happen today.	To se danas nije dogodilo.
I doubt he'll see her	Sumnjam da će je i vidjeti
He did it, and that's enough.	On je to uradio, i to je dovoljno.
It really does exist.	Zaista postoji.
I doubt it happened	Sumnjam da se to dogodilo
More is even better.	Više je još bolje.
It can be done.	To se može uraditi.
I think what you expected from me	Mislim šta si očekivao od mene
This was very good.	Ovo je bilo jako dobro.
I wish it could be mine	Voleo bih da može biti moja
It's not.	Nije.
I want you to say that	Želim da to kažeš
Nobody really thinks that.	Niko to zaista ne misli.
You can do it.	Možeš ti to.
Yeah, not so much.	Ja, ne toliko.
That was fine with me.	To mi je bilo u redu.
He can tell something is going on.	Može reći da se nešto dešava.
I want more from you	Želim više od tebe
I'm so glad he works for you.	Tako mi je drago što radi za tebe.
Yes, there is such a thing.	Da, tako nešto postoji.
I never saw you again	Nikad te više nisam video
I was not ready for something like that	Nisam bio spreman na tako nešto
I was looking for him, but he wasn't there	Tražio sam ga, ali ga nije bilo
It could just be me.	Mogao bih biti samo ja.
I knew what was going on.	Znao sam šta se dešava.
I know it's not that easy	Znam da nije tako lako
.	.
Not much	Malo toga
I will always be there for you.	Uvek ću biti tu za tebe.
Both.	Oboje.
But please don't.	Ali molim te nemoj.
But now it's really easy.	Ali sada je stvarno lako.
They were just there.	Oni su upravo bili tamo.
I couldn't tell anyone	Nisam mogao nikome reći
This obviously doesn't look good.	Ovo očigledno ne izgleda dobro.
I know something is wrong	Znam da nešto nije u redu
I didn't think he could do anything	Nisam mislio da bilo šta može
I have none of that.	Nemam ništa od toga.
I just realized how right you are.	Upravo sam shvatio koliko si u pravu.
I do it myself.	Sam to radim.
I didn't know you were here	Nisam znao da si ovde
Shouldn't it be?	Zar ne bi trebalo?
I didn't really expect it	Nisam baš očekivao
That's right, and it really is.	Tako je i zaista je tako.
I don't have that.	Ja to nemam.
I guess he did that for a while	Pretpostavljam da je to radio neko vrijeme
That is not true today.	To danas nije tačno.
I just can't be alone anymore	Jednostavno ne mogu više sama
That must be enough.	To mora biti dovoljno.
I would never have expected	Nikad ne bih očekivao
And he wouldn't either.	A ni on ne bi.
It is good.	Dobro je.
Now I know it's true	Sada znam da je to istina
I decided that was enough	Odlučio sam da je dosta
I have a simple question for you	Imam jednostavno pitanje za vas
We really don't know how much.	Zaista ne znamo koliko.
He was busy.	Bio je zauzet.
Not for long.	Ne dugo.
I was quite surprised to see you here today	Bio sam prilično iznenađen što sam te danas vidio ovdje
It's pretty good.	Prilično je dobro.
I know he would never leave	Znam da nikad ne bi otišao
Say it again.	Reci to ponovo.
I said that.	Rekao sam to.
I wonder what's for dinner	Pitam se šta ima za večeru
He's a good guy.	On je dobar momak.
I shouldn't have gone.	Nisam trebao ići.
Your father knows that.	Tvoj otac to zna.
I work much better at home	Mnogo bolje radim kod kuće
Yes, you could.	Da, mogao bi.
I would be glad.	Bilo bi mi drago.
If it was easy, everyone would do it.	Da je lako, svi bi to uradili.
I didn't want to know the truth.	Nisam htela da znam istinu.
I came to see how it was.	Došao sam da vidim kako je.
I wouldn't be here without you	Ne bih bio ovdje da nije bilo tebe
And not just work.	I ne samo posao.
I didn't think he knew what to tell me	Nisam mislio da zna šta da mi kaže
Today it works as well as always.	Danas radi dobro kao i uvijek.
I asked him who told him that	Pitao sam ga ko mu je to rekao
I think we'll come back to that.	Mislim da ćemo se vratiti na to.
I think it will help	Mislim da će pomoći
I love doing things for him.	Volim da radim stvari za njega.
We wouldn't have a problem.	Ne bismo imali problema.
I knew how he felt.	Znao sam kako se osjeća.
I had to be there for him	Morao sam biti tu za njega
I could do anything.	Mogao sam sve.
That's what he would do.	To bi on uradio.
This was very good.	Ovo je bilo jako dobro.
This is a good idea, but it is not true.	Ovo je dobra ideja, ali nije istina.
No money at all.	Nema novca uopšte.
The thing is, they won't.	Stvar je u tome da neće.
I've been doing this for a very long time	To sam radio jako dugo
It never was.	Nikada nije bilo.
I can't tonight	Ne mogu večeras
That's how it was.	Tako je i bilo.
If anyone had told him anything but please.	Da mu je bilo ko rekao bilo šta osim molim.
Nothing seems to work for it.	Čini se da ništa ne radi za to.
And they know it.	I oni to znaju.
I already said too much	Već sam rekao previše
That is a good idea.	To je dobra ideja.
But there were more.	Ali bilo ih je više.
Never was, never will be.	Nikada nije bilo, nikada neće biti.
He was on it.	Bio je na tome.
Not a bad life here.	Nije loš život ovdje.
I guess she was good	Pretpostavljam da je bila dobra
Few people even know what they are doing.	Malo ljudi uopšte zna šta radi.
The thing is.	Stvar je u tome.
Very well, in fact.	Vrlo dobro, u stvari.
I doubt they didn't	Sumnjam da nisu
She's there.	Ona je tamo.
I was sure of this	Bio sam siguran u ovo
I tried to talk to you	Pokušao sam razgovarati s tobom
He had a car.	Imao je auto.
I have no doubt that he would be here.	Ne sumnjam da bi ovdje.
I didn’t ask how he got it	Nisam pitao kako je to dobio
No, this time.	Ne, ovaj put.
I want to know what happens to him next	Želim da znam šta se dalje dešava s njim
I think he said that.	Mislim da je to rekao.
This is much better.	Ovo je mnogo bolje.
I should never need it again	Nikad mi više ne bi trebao
I thought it would help you	Mislio sam da će ti pomoći
I would love that.	Voleo bih to.
I don't think she ever knows what to say	Mislim da ona nikad ne zna šta da kaže
Pretty much.	Prilično.
I've never felt sorry for her before	Nikad mi je ranije nije bilo žao
You can do anything.	Možeš sve.
I just like to think it is	Samo volim da mislim da jeste
That's what I decided.	O tome sam se odlučio.
I didn't.	Nisam.
I was with him.	Bio sam sa njim.
You should have seen her.	Trebao si je vidjeti.
There was something in it.	Bilo je nešto u tome.
But she was.	Ali bila je.
I love them so much.	Toliko ih volim.
I shouldn't be here with him	Ne bih trebao biti ovdje s njim
That's what it is.	To je što je.
He plays hard	On igra teško
This even without things.	Ovo čak i bez stvari.
Not very good.	Ne vrlo dobar.
I didn't think anything about it	Nisam mislio ništa o tome
It works and it should.	Radi i treba.
I was expecting a little	Očekivao sam malo
I mean, you didn't really have to	Mislim, nisi stvarno morao
Yes, that was the year.	Da, to je bila godina.
Just tell me things.	Samo mi reci stvari.
She is not a person.	Ona nije osoba.
I knew it well	Znao sam dobro
How to do ?.	Kako uraditi?.
It was really that simple.	Zaista je bilo tako jednostavno.
This could be it.	Ovo bi moglo biti to.
They can do anything.	Oni mogu sve.
We are still not sure when this will happen.	Još uvijek nismo sigurni kada će se to dogoditi.
In fact, he can't, or he says he can't.	Zapravo, ne može, ili kaže da ne može.
You just don't know everything.	Ti jednostavno ne znaš sve.
I didn't know anything until today	Nisam znao ništa do danas
Yes, you can do that.	Da, možete to učiniti.
I have a problem here	Imam problem ovdje
I know he loves me so much.	Znam da me toliko voli.
I like what you did with it	Sviđa mi se šta si uradio sa tim
I had to do something.	Morao sam nešto da uradim.
I didn't tell anyone	Nisam nikome rekao
I wondered if anyone here could help	Pitao sam se može li neko ovdje pomoći
I have no time.	Nemam vremena.
I could see much better now	Sada sam mogao mnogo bolje da vidim
Do as you wish.	Radite kako želite.
So that's not a problem.	Tako da to nije problem.
I didn't even realize he was here	Nisam ni shvatio da je ovdje
You are better today than yesterday.	Danas si bolji nego juče.
It took time.	Trebalo je vremena.
That's how this was for me.	Tako je ovo bilo za mene.
I just want to make sure you do.	Samo želim da budem siguran da to radiš.
it was really, really good.	bilo je stvarno, stvarno dobro.
And that is not always easy.	A to nije uvijek lako.
I mean, just the door	Mislim, samo vrata
I do it myself.	Ja to radim sam.
she said.	ona je rekla.
He likes to play hard to win.	Voli da se igra teško dobiti.
You can't go back.	Ne možete se vratiti.
I didn't want to be good either.	Ni ja nisam htela da budem dobra.
I hope you like it.	Nadam se da vam se sviđa.
I thought it would be me.	Mislio sam da ću to biti ja.
I'll be sure soon, he told me	Uskoro ću biti siguran, rekao mi je
I decided that was not good enough	Odlučio sam da to nije dovoljno dobro
He never asked for anything.	Nikad ništa nije tražio.
I was completely surprised	Bio sam potpuno iznenađen
It wasn't there.	Nije bilo tamo.
Yes, this is another one.	Da, ovo je još jedan.
I was pretty sure you would	Bio sam prilično siguran da hoćeš
I asked her several times if she was okay	Pitao sam je nekoliko puta da li je dobro
Obviously so.	Očigledno je tako.
He wanted to say so much.	Toliko je toga želio reći.
I've never been better	Nikada mi nije bilo bolje
It is.	To je.
I need you to say something	Treba mi nešto da kažeš
And it wants something.	I ono želi nešto.
I saw it as a job	Vidio sam to kao posao
It's just bad.	Samo je loše.
And you did.	I to si uradio.
But that is not happening.	Ali to se ne dešava.
There's more money in it.	Ima više novca u tome.
To be completely sure.	Da budem potpuno siguran.
And only on time.	I to samo na vrijeme.
It works as before.	Radi kao i do sada.
Several people were fine	Nekoliko ljudi je bilo u redu
I haven't had it in a while	Nisam ga imao neko vrijeme
Things are fine, he said.	Stvari su u redu, rekao je.
That’s a good enough reason for me.	To je za mene dovoljno dobar razlog.
She didn't want to do that.	Nije htela to da uradi.
I still love them both	I dalje ih volim oboje
But that really wasn't the case.	Ali to zaista nije bilo tako.
But that was not enough for me.	Ali to mi nije bilo dovoljno.
And much more.	I još mnogo toga.
I had a lot for myself	Imao sam mnogo toga za sebe
Not very good, but really very bad.	Nije baš dobro, ali zaista jako loše.
I knew this time would come	Znao sam da će ovo vrijeme doći
I think he's really gone.	Mislim da je stvarno otišao.
We did it.	Uradili smo to.
For what, really.	Za šta, zaista.
I've certainly never done that before	To sigurno nikada ranije nisam radio
I didn't even expect him to come	Nisam ni očekivao da će doći
I had no idea what you were going to say	Nisam imao pojma šta ćeš reći
I know how it was before	Znam kako je bilo prije
I could be here for three years.	Mogao bih biti ovdje tri godine.
Even without money.	Čak i bez novca.
She said no.	Rekla je da nije.
That may help, maybe not.	To može pomoći, možda ne.
I could never get it.	Nikada ga nisam mogao dobiti.
He had none of that.	Nije imao ništa od toga.
I love money.	Volim novac.
I'm not even sure why.	Nisam siguran ni zašto.
I think that’s what you think about it.	Mislim da je to ono što mislite o tome.
And we have to find him.	I moramo ga naći.
I don't think that happened	Mislim da se to nije dogodilo
We know that.	To znamo.
Now we have to get to work.	Sada moramo na posao.
There was no problem.	Nije bilo problema.
I like it so far.	Sviđa mi se do sada.
But there is nothing.	Ali nema ništa.
The video is enough.	Video je dovoljno.
I will not tell you	Neću ti reći
I've been expecting her so far	Očekivao sam je do sada
And that was really enough.	I to je zaista bilo dovoljno.
You always wanted to do that.	Uvek si to želeo da uradiš.
And he had.	I imao je.
Nobody does it alone.	Niko to ne pravi sam.
That's you.	To ti.
Even he could tell.	Čak je i on mogao reći.
I can't do it again.	Ne mogu ponovo.
I always heard you.	Uvek sam te čuo.
So it is with us now.	Tako je i sada sa nama.
I just couldn’t believe it was me	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati da sam to ja
He is your father.	On je tvoj otac.
It was more than enough.	Bilo je više nego dovoljno.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
Like it's a problem.	Kao da je to problem.
I should have known	Trebao sam da znaju
She will find a way.	Ona će naći način.
There is nothing more to do.	Nema više šta da se radi.
You're not with me.	Nisi sa mnom.
They were.	Bili su.
You are as safe as home.	Sigurni ste kao kuće.
I guess it's not that bad	Pretpostavljam da to nije tako loše
I know he's planning	Znam da planira
It's never been here.	Nikada nije bilo ovdje.
It was so fast.	Bilo je tako brzo.
They now know what we have.	Oni sada znaju šta imamo.
I don't know if he really loves me.	Ne znam da li me zaista voli.
He didn't tell me about it.	Nije mi rekao za to.
Or you won't.	Ili nećeš.
That was all anyone knew.	To je bilo sve što je neko znao.
I always loved you	Uvek sam te voleo
I've never done anything like that	Nikad nisam radio tako nešto
It could go even further.	Moglo bi ići i više.
I don't know if it's good or bad.	Ne znam da li je to dobro ili loše.
But that's not it at all.	Ali to uopšte nije to.
He got it a few days ago.	Dobio ga je prije nekoliko dana.
That was a good thing.	To je bila dobra stvar.
I'll stay here with you	Ja ću ostati ovdje s tobom
I've done that many times.	To sam radio više puta.
It can be difficult.	Može biti teško.
I can be very sure that did not happen	Mogu biti vrlo siguran da se to nije dogodilo
I was right.	Bio sam u pravu.
It still doesn't work.	To i dalje ne radi.
But maybe he didn't mean it.	Ali možda nije na to mislio.
I hope there is a better way to do this	Nadam se da postoji bolji način da se ovo uradi
I know something is wrong	Znam da nešto loše nije u redu
And it's time, he would say.	I vrijeme je, rekao bi.
I haven't seen them before	Nisam ih ranije vidio
I have a few problems here.	Imam nekoliko problema ovdje.
It all seems to be there.	Čini se da je sve tu.
And he certainly wasn't.	A on to sigurno nije bio.
It looks like a.	To izgleda kao a.
It doesn't work much.	Ne radi mnogo.
Who likes to live life.	Ko voli da živi život.
I'm sure you really know this.	Siguran sam da ovo stvarno znaš.
It has to be, really.	Mora biti, zaista.
I have things to tell him	Imam stvari da mu kažem
I knew what she was thinking	Znao sam šta ona misli
I knew it was going to happen, but	Znao sam da će se to dogoditi, ali
He's home.	On je kod kuće.
Someone is working on it right now	Neko trenutno radi na tome
I wanted this to be what you want for yourself	Želio sam da ovo bude ono što želiš za sebe
But that's the problem.	Ali to je problem.
I didn't really have a life	Nisam stvarno imao život
My lucky day.	Moj sretan dan.
I don't want to see you.	Ne želim da te vidim.
I just can't talk about it	Jednostavno ne mogu o tome
It was something more.	Bilo je to nešto više.
But I do.	Ali to radim.
I mean, this is really good	Mislim, ovo je stvarno dobro
I want a lot of things	Želim puno stvari
I guess it's safe.	Pretpostavljam da je sigurno.
It's hard is hard.	Teško je teško.
Yes, that's right.	Da, tačno.
But not me.	Ali ne ja.
It must be happening now.	Sigurno se to sada dešava.
I will not tell you what and why	Neću vam reći šta i zašto
I never wanted any of that	Nikad nisam želeo ništa od toga
How will you get it?	Kako ćeš to dobiti?
Anytime anywhere.	Bilo kad bilo gdje.
I wondered what it was	Pitao sam se šta je to
I'm still on it.	Još uvijek sam na tome.
I knew it would be.	Znao sam da će biti.
I wasn't really ready to see them	Nisam baš bio spreman da ih vidim
I think we'll be safe here for a while	Mislim da ćemo biti sigurni ovdje neko vrijeme
I'm glad for that	Drago mi je zbog toga
I would never do that	Nikada to ne bih uradio
It wasn't her.	To nije bila ona.
I didn't love them, they didn't love me either	Nisam ih volio, ni oni mene
There seems to be something here.	Čini se da ovdje mora biti nešto.
You heard them too.	I ti si ih čuo.
I'm here now.	Sada sam ovdje.
You did it for yourself.	Uradio si to za sebe.
Maybe he's gone.	Možda ga nema.
But they could easily have been.	Ali lako su mogli biti.
He did what he had to.	Uradio je ono što je morao.
I tell you everything.	sve ti kažem.
The day has come.	Došao je dan.
Maybe for the first time.	Možda prvi put.
And this is not what we usually need.	A ovo nije ono što nam obično treba.
I knew he was there	Znao sam da je tamo
And let me tell you something.	I da ti kažem nešto.
I couldn't	Ne bih mogao
I actually still work.	Zapravo i dalje radim.
It's not that.	Nije to.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda nije.
That's what really happened.	To se u stvari i dogodilo.
It was a good day.	Bio je to dobar dan.
I'm better because of him.	Ja sam bolji zbog njega.
But no one said anything.	Ali niko ništa nije rekao.
I won't be a problem	Neću biti problema
I still wasn't sure what she was exactly	Još nisam bio siguran šta je ona tačno
She is telling the truth.	Ona govori istinu.
Do it fast.	Uradi to brzo.
They won't find me.	Neće me naći.
I already have three good ones	Već imam tri dobra
I would be very glad.	Bilo bi mi veoma drago.
I want to know about tonight	Želim da znam za večeras
You don't have to do this.	Ne morate ovo da radite.
That's true.	Tako je istina.
I couldn't tell if she was still there	Nisam mogao reći da li je još uvijek tamo
I was alone.	Bio sam sam.
I never see you again	Nikad te više ne vidim
I'm so sorry this happened	Jako mi je žao što se to dogodilo
I would like to do that now.	Sada bih to htio učiniti.
Everyone was for it.	Svi su bili za to.
I'll get all things back	Ponovo ću vratiti sve stvari
I wasn't ready for that	Nisam bio spreman za to
I didn't try.	Nisam pokušao.
He can't help himself.	Ne može si pomoći.
I should have known all along	Trebao sam sve vrijeme znati
And so fast.	I tako brzo.
That was many years ago.	Bilo je to prije mnogo godina.
I'm there doing something.	Ja sam tamo i radim nešto.
I didn't ask to go here	Nisam tražio da idem ovde
I couldn't stay here	Nisam mogao ostati ovdje
He couldn't believe this was happening.	Nije mogao vjerovati da se ovo dešava.
I realized something about myself	Shvatio sam nešto o sebi
I just wanted to make sure it was there	Samo sam htio biti siguran da je to tamo
That's your thing.	To je stvar kod tebe.
And you know what you know.	I znaš šta znaš.
Nothing was a problem.	Ništa nije bio problem.
That is simply not true.	To jednostavno nije istina.
Or it used to be, very obviously.	Ili je nekada bio, vrlo očigledno.
This could be the right path.	Ovo bi mogao biti pravi put.
I've never seen it.	Nikad nisam video.
I felt sorry for them	Bilo mi ih je žao
Neither are you.	Ni ti nisi.
This is really happening.	Ovo se zaista dešava.
They weren't really sure.	Oni zapravo nisu bili sigurni.
He used to know that too.	Nekada je i on to znao.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
And everything is fine.	I sve je u redu.
I knew it was someone who would help me	Znao sam da je to neko ko će mi pomoći
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam uradio ništa loše
I'm sure of that	U to sam siguran
I was happy to be there	Bio sam sretan što sam bio tamo
He really knows the job.	On zaista zna posao.
And I would have very few days	I ja bih imao vrlo malo dana
I understood them easily	Lako sam ih shvatio
That is not really true.	To zapravo nije istina.
How fast is it.	Koliko je brzo.
I don't know if there's anything there.	Ne znam da li postoji nešto tamo.
I didn't know where we were	Nisam znao gdje smo
Nobody knows what's going on.	Niko ne zna šta se dešava.
I wish we had more time	Voleo bih da imamo više vremena
That was a good reason	To je bio dobar razlog
I don't know which is better.	Ne znam koji je bolji.
A game he had never heard of	Igra za koju nikada nije čuo
I'm glad they didn't.	Drago mi je da nisu.
She didn't say anything right away.	Odmah nije rekla ništa.
I have no idea what that would be.	Nemam pojma šta bi to bilo.
Maybe it's not you.	Možda nisi ti.
None of us understood well.	Niko od nas nije dobro shvatio.
I have what you might want	Imam ono što ti možda želiš
I haven't heard of it	Nisam čuo za to
I knew better than that	Znao sam bolje od toga
I didn't know you were doing well	Nisam znao da ti to dobro ide
I did that too.	I ja sam to uradio.
I knew he wanted to be better	Znao sam da želi da bude bolji
I wasn't ready to do that before	Nisam bio spreman da to uradimo ranije
Just for fun.	Samo za zabavu.
Not much, but enough.	Ne mnogo, ali dovoljno.
That could be a problem.	To bi mogao biti problem.
What works and what doesn't.	Šta radi, a šta ne.
Can be.	Može biti.
I do it until it looks good.	Radim to dok ne izgleda dobro.
I will be more than helpful here.	Ovdje ću biti više od pomoći.
I know it can be done	Znam da se to može
This is my first car.	Ovo je moj prvi auto.
It was very good for me	Bilo mi je jako dobro
I prefer it that way	Više volim da je tako
I decided to go for it.	Odlučio sam ići na to.
People have said that.	Ljudi su to rekli.
I went there too.	I ja sam otišao tamo.
We can help with that.	Možemo pomoći u tome.
There are none.	Nema ih.
No one had done that to him before.	Niko mu to ranije nije uradio.
I can't believe they didn't tell us	Ne mogu vjerovati da nam nisu rekli
I was ready to be a father	Bio sam spreman da budem otac
I like the idea of ​​it	Sviđa mi se ideja o tome
she said.	ona je rekla.
This is going pretty well.	Ovo ide prilično dobro.
Like, really bad.	Kao, jako loše.
You never work.	Nikad ne radiš.
He can't even do that.	Ne može ni to da uradi.
I didn’t want it to go any further.	Nisam želio da to ide dalje.
I've had enough of asking	Dosta mi je bilo da pitam
I just can't believe he's gone	Jednostavno ne mogu vjerovati da ga nema
I went too far.	Previše sam otišao.
I had to see her.	Morao sam da je vidim.
But it wasn't going to happen, she told herself.	Ali to se neće dogoditi, rekla je sebi.
Right away and in myself not even right away.	Odmah i u sebi čak ni odmah.
But that will not happen.	Ali to se neće dogoditi.
Rain.	Kiša.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
I didn't want to know this	Nisam htela ovo da znam
I have to be with you	Moram biti s tobom
I thought that was good.	Mislio sam da je to dobro.
She was.	Ona je bila.
That was it really.	To je bilo to zaista.
I really wanted to help	Zaista sam htio pomoći
I'm better this time	Bolje mi je ovaj put
I can't get the money	Ne mogu doći do novca
I can't give you anything more than that	Ne mogu vam dati ništa više od toga
It all happened so fast.	Sve se dogodilo tako brzo.
What was of it was here.	Ono što je bilo od toga bilo je ovdje.
I mean it in a good way	Mislim to na dobar način
Do it better.	Uradi to bolje.
I didn't want to see	Nisam htela da vidim
Maybe we're right.	Možda smo u pravu.
I hope he'll be there this morning	Nadam se da će biti tamo jutros
He didn't do something like that.	On nije uradio tako nešto.
Maybe not much.	Možda ne mnogo.
Like you said, you can't tell anyone.	Kao što ste rekli, ne možete nikome reći.
I see what he did to him	Vidim šta mu je uradio
My father had it.	Moj otac ga je imao.
It can't be that hard.	Ne može biti tako teško.
I didn't want to know anymore	Nisam više htela da znam
But something more.	Ali nešto više.
For us it was now or never.	Za nas je to bilo sada ili nikad.
I only saw him here that time	Vidio sam ga ovdje samo taj put
He was a guy.	Bio je momak.
I feel sorry for you	Žao mi je zbog tebe
Yes, he had.	Da, imao je.
She was right.	Bila je u pravu.
Yes very well.	Da veoma dobro.
In time to see them.	Na vrijeme da ih vidim.
Everything is just fine.	Sve je jednostavno dobro.
I have to go	Moram da idem
I didn't take it that way.	Nisam to tako shvatio.
I did not know what to say.	Nisam znao šta da kažem.
Sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga.
I didn't have to.	Nisam morao.
I guess she wasn't the only one	Pretpostavljam da nije bila jedina
If, if, if.	Ako, ako, ako.
I was better	Bilo mi je bolje
I did this just to be good.	Uradio sam ovo samo da bih bio dobar.
I didn't buy you anything either	Ni ja ti nisam ništa kupio
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
I didn't come home	Nisam došao kući
It was here.	Bilo je ovdje.
I never did that.	Nikad to nisam uradio.
And while she's gone, she's still with me.	I dok je nema, ona je i dalje sa mnom.
I still couldn't leave	Još nisam mogao otići
You're safe now.	Sada si siguran.
The question is whether it will be a lot or a little.	Pitanje je da li će to biti puno ili malo.
He wasn't a bad guy.	Nije bio loš momak.
Everything.	Sve.
I didn't even know what just happened	Nisam ni znao šta se upravo dogodilo
But it never is.	Ali nikada nije.
I have a lot more to say	Imam još dosta toga da kažem
This could have happened.	Ovo se moglo dogoditi.
I couldn't see them	Nisam ih mogao vidjeti
Looks like it's going to be fine.	Izgleda da će biti dobro.
I didn't want him to know	Nisam želeo da zna
And it does a good job.	I radi dobar posao.
Much more my thing.	Mnogo više moja stvar.
He did it three times.	Tri puta je to uradio.
And for myself.	I za sebe.
There wasn't much	Mnogo toga nije bilo
But it’s not something he could do for the job.	Ali nije nešto što bi mogao da uradi za posao.
You really can't do that.	Ti to zapravo ne možeš.
There is still a lot to talk about.	Ima još mnogo toga da se priča.
I couldn't tell if he could see me	Nisam mogao reći može li me vidjeti
About anything.	O bilo čemu.
They are still there.	I dalje su tamo.
I realized that he saw me too	Shvatio sam da je i on mene video
She will go here and there.	Ona će ići tu i tamo.
I can't tell you that	Ne mogu vam to reći
I didn't see anything	Nisam ništa video
You did really well.	Zaista si dobro uradio.
It's still there.	Još uvijek je tamo.
She’s just a problem, or she was.	Ona je samo problem, ili je bila.
She certainly wasn't good enough for you.	Ona sigurno nije bila dovoljno dobra za tebe.
You have enough time.	Imaš dovoljno vremena.
I couldn't reach him	Nisam mogao do njega
But certainly not.	Ali sigurno ne.
I want her here now	Želim je ovdje odmah
It was, and it was good.	Bilo je, i dobro.
It's something more.	To je nešto više.
I got the job.	Dobio sam posao.
Again.	Ponovo.
I thought he had some time	Mislio sam da ima neko vrijeme
Don't say anything more about it.	Ne govori ništa više o tome.
There will be no more.	Neće biti više toga.
I was tired, just like that	Bio sam umoran, jednostavno tako
I don't see why you want that.	Ne vidim zašto to želiš.
I love you.	Volim te.
I won't be here.	Neću biti ovdje.
I knew he was with us	Znao sam da je sa nama
I'm very sorry	Jako mi je žao
I've always loved you.	Uvek sam te voleo.
I know what he does for me	Znam šta radi za mene
I wondered if this would ever happen to me	Pitao sam se hoće li mi se to ikada dogoditi
I had to bring him back	Morao sam ga vratiti
He was such a good man.	Bio je tako dobar čovjek.
I didn't hear anything	Nisam ništa čuo
I want to tell you what really happened	Želim da vam kažem šta se zaista dogodilo
We need to talk.	Moramo razgovarati.
All the better for us	Tim bolje za nas
I really don't know.	Zaista ne znam.
He's gone now.	Otišao je sada.
I like it a lot here.	Mnogo mi se sviđa ovdje.
Talk soon.	Priča uskoro.
I didn't know you meant that	Nisam znao da si na to mislio
Maybe we have a few stories.	Možda imamo nekoliko priča.
I still love it.	I dalje volim.
Which is not.	Što nije.
I didn't know you were here	Nisam znao da si ovde
I didn't start well.	Nisam dobro počeo.
None of this is true.	Ništa od toga nije istina.
I heard this might be true.	Čuo sam da je ovo možda istina.
So we know what's going on.	Tako da znamo šta se dešava.
I think he loves her	Mislim da je voli
And maybe so.	I možda je tako.
There was no help.	Nije se moglo pomoći.
I think he saw more than he ever said	Mislim da je video više nego što je ikada rekao
You could say no.	Mogli bi reći ne.
I have us here.	Imam nas ovde.
I know everything you have to say	Znam sve što imaš da kažeš
I wonder if anyone can help	Pitam se može li neko pomoći
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo to.
He was like a father to both of us.	Bio je kao otac za nas oboje.
I'm not ready.	Nisam spreman.
I love having you both	Volim da vas oboje imam
But you didn't say anything.	Ali nisi rekao ništa.
I didn't even have to say anything	Nisam ni trebao ništa reći
I hope to get a car.	Nadam se da ću dobiti auto.
She didn't want to talk about what was happening.	Nije htela da priča o tome šta se dešava.
I think they did it so well	Mislim da su to tako dobro uradili
This is it for me.	Ovo je to za mene.
I couldn't believe it	Nisam mogao vjerovati
Your car, someone said.	Tvoj auto, neko je rekao.
But that was many years ago.	Ali to je bilo prije mnogo godina.
She has so much to say.	Ona ima toliko toga za reći.
He wasn't the only one.	On nije bio jedini.
But because of the sea, there is always hope.	Ali zbog mora uvijek postoji nada.
I almost didn't have time now	Sada skoro da nisam imao vremena
I thought he was better	Mislio sam da mu je bolje
I have something for you	imam nešto za tebe
I wasn't a good friend	Nisam bio dobar prijatelj
I wish you hadn't said yes to this	Voleo bih da nisi rekao da na ovo
Not that anything happened.	Nije da se nešto dogodilo.
Everything was bad.	Sve je bilo loše.
Maybe she can't do it anymore.	Možda ona to više ne može.
At home.	Na kući.
I still didn't want to leave	I dalje nisam htela da ode
They must have been there.	Sigurno su bili tamo.
That was good enough to know.	To je bilo dovoljno dobro da se to zna.
I thought it was someone	Mislio sam da je neko
I can do it.	Ja to mogu.
Do it now.	Uradi to sada.
You should come back.	Trebao bi se vratiti.
But not much.	Ali ne mnogo.
All these things.	Sve ove stvari.
I haven't heard her say that in years	Nisam je čuo da to govori mnogo godina
I've never had a problem before.	Nikad prije nisam imao problema.
It was a good job.	Bio je to dobar posao.
You can stay here.	Možete ostati ovdje.
He never was.	Nikad nije bio.
Just don't tell him anything.	Samo mu nemoj ništa reći.
Why? 	Zašto?
I love them.	Volim ih.
Like you said.	Kao što si rekao.
I don't know what to do with it.	Ne znam šta da radim s tim.
It was there.	Bilo je tu.
But it was nothing.	Ali to nije bilo ništa.
Do not tell me.	Nemoj mi reći.
What did you promise?	Šta si obećao.
This should help in a few days.	Ovo bi trebalo pomoći za nekoliko dana.
I really started to love seeing him do it	Zaista sam počeo da volim da ga vidim kako to radi
In fact they are not.	U stvari nisu.
I want what you have	Želim ono što ti imaš
That was what it used to be.	To je bila ono što je nekada bila.
And she is.	I ona je.
First time.	Prvi put.
He loved me.	Voleo me je.
The friend is right.	Prijatelj je u pravu.
That's what you wanted.	To si htela.
How much is the question.	Koliko je pitanje.
Maybe we can do it here.	Možda to možemo učiniti ovdje.
I have a life too	I ja imam život
You don't want me to be here.	Ne želiš da budem ovdje.
I can never do enough.	Nikada ne mogu učiniti dovoljno.
It was pretty obvious why.	Bilo je prilično očigledno zašto.
I guess it could be, but it seems very unlikely	Pretpostavljam da bi moglo biti, ali izgleda vrlo malo vjerovatno
It's so good.	Tako je dobro.
He wants to talk to us.	Želi razgovarati sa nama.
But what can be done.	Ali šta se može učiniti.
Yes, maybe we should.	Da, možda bi trebali.
And you can't say that often.	A to ne možete reći često.
I don't do this.	Ja ovo ne radim.
You're back.	Vratio si se.
Very few people were.	Vrlo malo ljudi je bilo.
You have to do it.	Moraš to da uradiš.
It just makes you want it more.	To samo čini da to više želiš.
That's what they told me.	To su mi rekli.
I can't tell you now	Ne mogu vam sada reći
I still want to be your friend	Još uvijek želim biti tvoj prijatelj
Not for you, but for me.	Ne za tebe, nego za mene.
I love having them here	Volim da ih imam ovde
I haven't seen them, but they are there	Nisam ih vidio, ali su tu
He did it himself.	On je to sam uradio.
But there is much more.	Ali ima još mnogo toga.
He thought no one had seen him.	Mislio je da ga niko nije vidio.
I never told you that	Nikad ti to nisam rekao
I see it, he has it on.	Vidim to, ima to na sebi.
Yes, it was like.	Da, bilo je kao.
But together, we can do it.	Ali zajedno, mi to možemo.
I've never heard of such a thing	Nikad nisam čuo za tako nešto
I guess he's right.	Pretpostavljam da je u pravu.
I don't think this was good.	Mislim da ovo nije bilo dobro.
How did this happen?	Kako se ovo dogodilo?
But you are the one who can help.	Ali ti si taj koji može pomoći.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
I could believe it as much as he did	Mogao sam vjerovati u to kao i on
I know he means well	Znam da misli dobro
And she is.	I ona je.
And what not.	A šta ne.
We don't know what he did.	Ne znamo šta je uradio.
Yes, it was like.	Da, bilo je kao.
That's the real you.	To si pravi ti.
It could be that it is.	Moglo bi biti da jeste.
I wonder if now is the time to ask	Pitam se da li je sada vrijeme da pitam
My father said that.	Otac je to rekao.
I thought he would come back	Mislio sam da će se vratiti
It is time.	Vrijeme je.
I still work for him	I dalje radim za njega
he said.	on je rekao.
I didn't know right away	Nisam odmah znao
There was nothing that I could do	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim
It's pretty easy.	Prilično je lako.
As before.	Kao nekada.
I can't stay here anymore	Ne mogu više ostati ovdje
He's a good thing for me.	On je dobra stvar za mene.
Everything will come in handy.	Sve će nam dobro doći.
Maybe you're here for that.	Možda ste ovdje zbog toga.
I tried to reach you	Pokušao sam doći do tebe
I didn't have, no.	Nisam imao, ne.
It's bad.	Loše to.
I just didn't get it.	Jednostavno nisam shvatio.
All I know is that it's true	Znam samo da je to istina
There seem to be a lot of them.	Čini se da ih ima mnogo.
Yes, even from you.	Da, čak i od tebe.
The question is quite simple.	Pitanje je prilično jednostavno.
I wish he was here too	Voleo bih da je i on ovde
Something.	Nešto.
As long as you do it right.	Sve dok to radite kako treba.
Not so little.	Ne tako malo.
I probably gave them.	Vjerovatno sam ih dao.
Say what you need to say.	Reci šta treba da kažeš.
Yes, he could certainly see that.	Da, sigurno je to mogao vidjeti.
'u'.	' u '.
I think that's it	Mislim da je to sve
I just want to be sure	Samo želim da budem siguran
I couldn't believe what had happened	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta se dogodilo
You thought.	Mislio si.
I need to know you won't do it again	Moram da znam da to više nećeš uraditi
But if that was the case, it didn't happen.	Ali ako je to bilo tako, nije se dogodilo.
I was at a party tonight	Bila sam na zabavi večeras
He thought it would be good to see her.	Mislio je da bi bilo dobro da je vidi.
I still had no idea what to say to him	Još uvijek nisam imao pojma šta da mu kažem
IT IS.	TO JE.
Nothing is true.	Ništa nije istina.
I really love them.	Zaista ih volim.
I wish he was here to see it	Voleo bih da je ovde da to vidi
Look, look! 	Vidi, vidi!
I'm always glad to see them	Uvek mi je drago da ih vidim
I can do anything.	Mogu sve.
True, there were plenty of them.	Istina, bilo ih je dosta.
The only question is when that will happen.	Pitanje je samo kada će se to dogoditi.
He will always be with us	On će uvek biti sa nama
This is him.	Ovo je on.
I have no idea where they are	Nemam pojma gdje su
He seemed to have done everything right.	Činilo se da je sve uradio kako treba.
It just doesn’t work.	To jednostavno ne radi.
I was pretty alone.	Bio sam prilično sam.
I would like to see you	Voleo bih da te vidim
But here and there, it is.	Ali tu i tamo, jeste.
I knew exactly what he was going to do	Tačno sam znao šta će uraditi
I just did that.	Upravo sam to uradio.
Maybe we'll work with him soon.	Možda ćemo uskoro raditi s njim.
It's hard to go.	Teško je ići.
I didn't tell him anything	Nisam mu ništa rekao
I want to go home now	Želim ići kući sada
Still not fast enough.	Još uvijek nije dovoljno brzo.
But how would he know.	Ali kako bi on znao.
All that stuff.	Sve te stvari.
I saw no reason we should either	Nisam vidio razlog da bismo ni mi trebali
But we have a problem.	Ali imamo problem.
It seems that.	Čini se da .
It never was and never will be	Nikada nije bilo i nikada neće biti
I don't see how that could be	Ne vidim kako bi to moglo biti
You know it is.	Znate da jeste.
I want you to do what you can.	Želeo bi da uradiš šta možeš.
He said he didn't like it anymore.	Rekao je da mu se to više ne sviđa.
I was glad she was with me	Bilo mi je drago što je ona sa mnom
And we needed that time.	I trebalo nam je to vrijeme.
What happened was simple.	Ono što se dogodilo bilo je jednostavno.
Maybe a few.	Možda nekoliko.
I couldn't go home.	Nisam mogao kući.
I won't let him do that	Neću mu dozvoliti da to uradi
I wish this had never happened	Voleo bih da se ovo nikada nije dogodilo
I haven't seen it until today	Nisam to vidio do danas
I never could.	Nikad nisam mogao.
I came back to tell you	Vratio sam se da ti kažem
I needed more than him	Trebalo mi je više od njega
It didn't take long	Nije dugo trebalo
You can do more with it.	Možete učiniti više s njim.
Maybe for good.	Možda za dobro.
I know how much you want this too	Znam koliko i ti ovo želiš
But no, it's not.	Ali ne, nije.
It won't work anymore.	Neće više ići.
And you should know better.	A ti bi trebao znati bolje.
I should have known something was going to happen	Trebao sam znati da će se nešto dogoditi
I want it done right	Želim da se uradi kako treba
I thought today would be a good day	Mislio sam, danas će biti dobar dan
He couldn't be sure.	Nije mogao biti siguran.
He heard nothing.	Nije čuo ništa.
It seems bad.	Čini se da je loše.
I can't believe he told you	Ne mogu vjerovati da ti je rekao
I will never do that again	Nikad to više neću uraditi
And it is.	I jeste.
Everything is simple.	Sve je jednostavno.
As he could.	Kao što bi mogao.
I couldn't do without you	Ne bih mogao bez tebe
That is not the case.	To nije tako.
They are me.	Oni su mi.
He on.	On dalje.
I thought it existed	Mislio sam da postoji
There was no one.	Nije bilo nikoga.
This is really bad.	Ovo je stvarno loše.
I know he won't find anything	Znam da neće naći ništa
I will never tell anyone what you said	Nikada nikome neću reći šta si rekao
I didn't want to know, not really.	Nisam htela da znam, ne baš.
.	.
He had no one.	Nije imao nikoga.
I think something could happen soon	Mislim da bi se nešto uskoro moglo dogoditi
It was never meant to be.	Nikad nije trebalo da bude.
I wasn’t working at the time.	Nisam radio u to vrijeme.
I see you're doing much better	Vidim da ti ide mnogo bolje
He asked how she was.	Pitao je kako je.
I know you still have it.	Znam da ga još uvek imaš.
Not true.	Nije istina.
I wish they had told me earlier	Voleo bih da su mi rekli ranije
Very few people do that.	Vrlo malo ljudi to radi.
He did it all by himself.	Uradio je to potpuno sam.
This is often true.	Često je to istina.
I could tell him	Mogao bih mu reći
I said that three times to myself.	Rekao sam to tri puta u sebi.
We know that.	Znamo to.
Certainly not now.	Sada sigurno ne.
I really didn't want to be that guy.	Zaista nisam želeo da budem taj momak.
I'm asking you, please.	Pitam te, molim te.
Which we were.	Što smo i bili.
I just really want you	Samo te stvarno želim
Like, a lot more.	Kao, puno više.
No money.	Nema novca.
That's hard for me.	To mi je teško.
I promised you everything would be fine	Obećao sam ti da će sve biti u redu
I'm so glad you're back	Tako mi je drago što si se vratio
It's okay to believe in both.	U redu je vjerovati u oboje.
My friend was right.	Moj prijatelj je bio u pravu.
She, she, she.	Ona, ona, ona.
Lots of time.	Puno vremena.
I see why my father didn't want this for me	Vidim zašto moj otac nije želio ovo za mene
I was just working.	Samo sam radio.
I wouldn't want anything more	Ne bih htela ništa više
I see a problem	Vidim problem
I couldn't do it again	Nisam mogao ponovo
I wanted to talk to you about a few things	Htio sam razgovarati s tobom o nekoliko stvari
I know it's all real	Znam da je sve to stvarno
A lot can happen.	Mnogo toga se može dogoditi.
I know what you really wanted	Znam šta si zaista želeo
So far so good.	Za sada je dobro.
I haven't seen her here either	Ni ja je nisam vidio ovdje
It's not.	Nije.
I don't have time anymore.	Nemam više vremena.
But no, you're too good.	Ali ne, previše si dobar.
He won't find anything.	Neće ništa naći.
This time he does	Ovaj put pravi
Neither do you.	Ni ti.
Good and good.	Dobro i dobro.
Yes, maybe you are right.	Da, možda ste u pravu.
We know so much.	Toliko znamo.
I see he likes it	Vidim da mu se sviđa
I need to know she's fine	Moram da znam da je ona dobro
I won't be back yet.	Neću se još vratiti.
I had to do it.	Morao sam to da uradim.
But something is wrong tonight.	Ali večeras nešto nije u redu.
I'll leave if you want	Ja ću otići ako želiš
I never saw her.	Nikad je nisam video.
I said that earlier	To sam ranije rekao
And he liked to eat almost everything.	I volio je da jede skoro sve.
Not that they'd know it was.	Nije da bi znali da jeste.
Do we really need another one?	Da li nam zaista treba još jedan?
I came up with a lot of problems	Došao sam sa puno problema
I did my best.	Dao sam sve od sebe.
That's my life.	To je moj život.
In fact, it was pretty good.	U stvari, bilo je prilično dobro.
I would love to see everything there is	Voleo bih da vidim sve što ima
You look.	Izgledaš.
I wondered if they had done something last night	Pitao sam se da li su nešto uradili sinoć
I could see her.	Mogao sam da je vidim.
I knew he was there for me	Znala sam da je tu za mene
There is nothing wrong with you.	Ništa nije u redu sa tobom.
No, that was obviously not good enough.	Ne, to očigledno nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
I didn't always know that	Nisam to uvijek znao
Everyone did it.	Svi su to uradili.
I mean, everyone knows that	Mislim, svi to znaju
I didn't see it.	Nisam to vidio.
I think you're right	Mislim da si u pravu
Maybe very good.	Možda vrlo dobro.
But it's just not like that.	Ali jednostavno nije tako.
I have a problem with that.	Imam problem sa tim.
And more than that, it was true.	I više od toga, to je bila istina.
You will help me.	Ti ćeš mi pomoći.
He said he was glad.	Rekao je da mu je drago.
You'd never know he was here.	Nikada ne biste znali da je on ovdje.
But that probably won't happen.	Ali to se vjerovatno neće dogoditi.
I had no idea something was going on	Nisam imao pojma da se nešto dešava
And this one is.	A ovaj je.
I just wanted to be alone	Samo sam htela da budem sama
I have one problem.	Imam jedan problem.
I think it will help me	Mislim da će mi pomoći
You never did.	Nikad nisi.
But it shouldn't be.	Ali ne bi trebao biti.
I'll.	Ja ću.
We could be sure.	Mogli bismo biti sigurni.
I didn't want to tell him that.	Nisam htela da mu to kažem.
He should have been here.	Trebao je biti ovdje.
We were sure of you.	Bili smo sigurni u tebe.
I knew he would come	Znao sam da će doći
I think a lot of that is obvious	Mislim da je mnogo toga očigledno
I just want her again	Samo je želim ponovo
That's not likely.	To nije vjerovatno.
I know you won't do that	Znam da to nećeš uraditi
I didn't want to do that	Nisam htela to da uradim
There seems to be something wrong.	Čini se da nešto nije u redu.
I've never been so happy	Nikad nisam bio tako sretan
That's a very good thing.	To je jako dobra stvar.
I don't know if that can be done.	Ne znam da li se to može uraditi.
A little more.	Malo više.
I knew what you did to him	Znao sam šta si mu uradio
These are the things you want.	Ovo su stvari koje želite.
And there was none of that.	I nije bilo ništa od toga.
I'm sick of being a bad guy.	Dosta mi je da sam loš momak.
I didn't think you had that in you	Nisam mislio da to imaš u sebi
But good.	Ali dobro.
I mean, we are all we have	Mislim, mi smo sve što imamo
She would have been if she had known.	Bila bi, da je znala.
But something happened.	Ali nešto se dogodilo.
Nothing more is wanted.	Ništa se više ne želi.
New life.	Novi život.
You were here.	Bio si ovdje.
I can tell you who you are	Mogu ti reći ko si
But not soon.	Ali ne uskoro.
I wondered if that was true	Pitao sam se da li je to istina
We should not and will not do that.	To ne bismo trebali i nećemo raditi.
I need some time.	Treba mi vremena.
I decided to go home	Odlučio sam da idem kući
It was very difficult for me.	Bilo mi je jako teško.
I'm not him.	Ja nisam on.
Not that we were together.	Nije da smo bili zajedno.
But you have to go for it.	Ali morate ići na to.
It should be true.	Trebalo bi da je istina.
It's not okay anymore.	Više nije u redu.
I still am, actually	Ja sam još uvek, zapravo
I didn't really need it.	Nije mi baš trebao.
I'm not sure if that's true	Nisam siguran da li je to istina
I needed something really fast.	Trebalo mi je nešto jako brzo.
I thought that was it	Mislio sam da je to to
He understood properly.	Shvatio je kako treba.
I had no time	Nisam imao vremena
He loved it so much.	Toliko je volio.
Maybe that's the question.	Možda je to pitanje.
I can do it better than you	Ja to mogu bolje od tebe
You did it yourself.	Sam si to uradio.
I thought you wanted to	Mislio sam da želiš
I hope you can help me.	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći.
It works and works well.	Radi i radi dobro.
It wasn't fast.	Nije bilo brzo.
I think he's really scared of you	Mislim da te se stvarno boji
We just know that's what it is.	Samo znamo da je to ono što jeste.
She should see him now.	Trebalo bi da ga vidi sada.
The man came to the door	Čovjek je došao do vrata
As it should be, so it is.	Kako treba, tako i jeste.
They are the problem.	Oni su problem.
But you have to trust me.	Ali moraš mi vjerovati.
I think that will be all	Mislim da će to biti sve
he wondered.	pitao se on.
You're fine now.	Sada si dobro.
Maybe someone here can tell me what's wrong.	Možda mi neko ovde može reći šta nije u redu.
I knew it wasn't him	Znao sam da to nije on
It can happen.	To se može dogoditi.
I'll come see you soon	Doći ću da te vidim uskoro
I thought it was time	Mislio sam, vrijeme je
Let me go for it.	Da idem na to.
But he is more than that.	Ali on je više od toga.
I've done it before, at home	Radio sam to ranije, kod kuće
I never told anyone.	Nikad nikome nisam rekao.
I didn't need it anymore	Nije mi više trebao
He wanted me.	Želio je mene.
Like now.	Kao i sada.
She's still working.	Ona i dalje radi.
I had a pretty good day today	Danas sam imao prilično dobar dan
I am now and I will always be your friend	Ja sam sada i uvek ću biti tvoj prijatelj
I hope no problem	Nadam se da nema problema
No, not that one.	Ne, ne taj.
I'm even sorry.	Čak mi je žao.
I have the money you asked for.	Imam novac koji si tražio.
I was so happy, but they couldn’t see me.	Bio sam tako sretan, ali nisu me mogli vidjeti.
I love you, you know that	Volim te, znaš to
He wasn't there long.	Nije dugo bio tamo.
I had no idea what that could do	Nisam imao pojma šta bi to moglo učiniti
There were so many stories.	Bilo je toliko priča.
They won't go.	Oni neće ići.
But nothing will come.	Ali ništa neće doći.
I could tell right away that he knew.	Mogao sam odmah reći da je znao.
It's pretty good.	Prilično je dobro.
I told myself that everything would be fine	Rekao sam sebi da će sve biti u redu
I needed him.	Trebao sam ga.
He says little else is known	Kaže da se još malo toga zna
I can tell it's her	Mogu reći da je to ona
Last three weeks.	Prošle tri sedmice.
There was so much he didn't know.	Bilo je toliko toga što nije znao.
So I'm not doing this	Tako da ne radim ovo
I've heard it a few times	Čuo sam to nekoliko puta
I can't say who it was.	Ne mogu reći ko je to bio.
I was fine	Bilo mi je dobro
Good for me, but how much.	Dobro za mene, ali koliko.
I've been here since yesterday	Ovdje sam od juče
You have to do it yourself.	Morate to sami.
I was three at the time	Imao sam tri godine u to vrijeme
We don't do that.	Mi to ne radimo.
Not before.	Prije ne još.
I will tell him.	Reći ću mu.
And you did.	I jesi.
I hope nothing happened to you	Nadam se da ti se ništa nije dogodilo
You knew this.	Znao si ovo.
We have to be together.	Moramo biti zajedno.
I told you what we were going to do and why	Rekao sam ti šta ćemo i zašto
I didn't know why you left, just that you left	Nisam znao zašto si otišao, samo da si otišao
He says so.	On tako kaže.
Yes.	Jeste.
I don't know exactly how long.	Ne znam tačno koliko dugo.
I should be able to do this.	Trebalo bi da mogu ovo da uradim.
I hope you can help me.	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći.
It sure wasn't that bad.	Sigurno nije bilo tako loše.
I didn't even have to tell him	Nisam ni trebao da mu kažem
I certainly never did.	Ja sigurno nikad nisam.
I love doing this to you	Volim da ti to radim
It's actually pretty simple.	To je zapravo prilično jednostavno.
I have to go today	Moram da idem danas
If you were there, you know what happened.	Da ste bili tamo, znate šta se dogodilo.
They are you.	Oni su ti.
I need to know what's going on	Moram da znam šta se dešava
I can be ready for tomorrow	Mogu biti spreman za sutra
He did everything for money.	Sve je radio za novac.
I'm glad you're here.	Drago mi je da ste ovdje.
I already knew about that	Već sam znao za to
That was not my way.	To nije bio moj način.
Probably more.	Vjerovatno i više.
There was no time yet.	Još nije bilo vrijeme.
I don't know how to proceed.	Ne znam kako dalje.
No, you can't let him.	Ne, ne možeš mu dozvoliti.
I was ready to do anything	Bio sam spreman da uradim bilo šta
That is, in fact, much more.	To je, u stvari, mnogo više.
I came to see you	Došao sam da te vidim
Good thing no one asked you.	Dobro da te niko nije pitao.
I knew who they were	Znao sam ko su oni
I really think so.	Zaista mislim da jeste.
I should have been safe for three months	Trebao sam biti siguran tri mjeseca
I still couldn’t believe it really happened	Još uvijek nisam mogao vjerovati da se to zaista dogodilo
I just wanted to know if you were okay	Samo sam htela da znam da li si dobro
I always thought there would be time	Uvijek sam mislio da će biti vremena
I'm pretty sure you know that too	Prilično sam siguran da i ti to znaš
I want him to help me	Želim da mi pomogne
He tried to tell him something.	Pokušao je nešto da mu kaže.
We have to get it right the first time.	Moramo to uraditi kako treba prvi put.
A game that is life itself.	Igra koja je sam život.
I decided to do just that.	Odlučio sam da uradim upravo to.
I didn't even see him	Nisam ga ni vidio
I began to doubt that he would not come	Počeo sam da sumnjam da neće doći
I didn't expect us to	Nisam očekivao da ćemo
I know this is hard for you	Znam da ti je ovo teško
I want to trust him.	Želim mu vjerovati.
Or he left without.	Ili je otišao bez.
That journey is over.	Taj put je završio.
I won't say it was easy	Neću reći da je bilo lako
I had to do something fast	Morao sam da uradim nešto brzo
I hope you can get it back soon.	Nadam se da ćeš ga uskoro moći vratiti.
I think he should be back soon	Mislim da bi se trebao vratiti uskoro
I left for three years.	Otišao sam na tri godine.
To look like you know it all.	Da izgleda kao da znaš sve.
It's just me.	Ovdje samo ja.
I just want to be here and now	Samo želim biti ovdje i sada
But this may not be true.	Ali ovo ne može biti tačno.
And there he is today.	I tu je on danas.
I want to be someone	Želim da budem neko
I guess it just takes time	Pretpostavljam da samo treba vremena
But it was not easy.	Ali to nije bilo lako.
I can't believe he didn't tell you	Ne mogu vjerovati da ti nije rekao
This time we were at home.	Ovaj put smo bili kod kuće.
But not this one.	Ali ne ovaj.
I couldn't allow this	Nisam mogao ovo dozvoliti
I know it's a lot of money	Znam da je to mnogo novca
But he didn't start talking.	Ali nije počeo da govori.
Because!	Zbog !.
I can't tell him that	Ne mogu mu to reći
We were one team.	Bili smo jedan tim.
I didn't see your car	Nisam video tvoj auto
No, that wasn't all he wanted to do.	Ne, to nije bilo sve što je želio da uradi.
There is something wrong with me	Nešto nije u redu sa mnom
I couldn’t go back and they knew	Nisam se mogao vratiti i oni su znali
I thought it might be something difficult	Mislio sam da bi moglo biti nešto teško
And more than you know.	I više nego što znaš.
This will help.	Ovo će pomoći.
This should be done soon.	Ovo bi trebalo uskoro da se uradi.
I just couldn’t see	Jednostavno nisam mogao vidjeti
Which is what we are there to do.	Što je ono što smo tamo da radimo.
This is a good thing.	Ovo je dobra stvar.
I wish it was that easy.	Voleo bih da je tako lako.
I didn't know what to say or what to do	Nisam znao šta da kažem ni šta da radim
I pray too.	I ja se molim.
I think you know that	Mislim ti to znaš
And I.	I ja.
I asked who it could be	Pitao sam ko bi to mogao biti
I'm not sure.	Nisam siguran.
Maybe it's better than you think.	Možda je bolje nego što mislite.
I didn't want to say anything	Nisam htela ništa da kažem
I wanted to help.	Htio sam pomoći.
He went alone.	On je sam otišao.
I couldn't see that happening	Nisam mogao da vidim da se to dešava
I just didn't get it	Jednostavno nisam shvatio
I asked how it was going	Pitao sam kako ide
I was wrong about that	Nisam bio u redu s tim
Until it is.	Sve dok nije.
But without it.	Ali bez toga.
I love you very, very much.	Volim te mnogo, mnogo.
I wish it wasn't.	Voleo bih da nije.
I don't think he loves her	Mislim da je ne voli
I have better things to do.	Imam bolje stvari da radim.
He tried to tell me that several times.	Nekoliko puta mi je to pokušao reći.
It was very, very difficult.	Bilo je veoma, veoma teško.
I'm not sure about that.	Nisam siguran u to.
I should be there	Trebao bih biti tamo
And maybe it will stay that way.	I možda će tako i dalje ostati.
That's all he knows.	Toliko on zna.
It was often better not to say anything to him.	Sa njim je često bilo bolje ne reći ništa.
I'll find them for you	Naći ću ih za tebe
Better than me.	Bolje od mene.
And really like you.	I zaista kao ti.
Oh my.	O moj.
New.	Novi.
I was in.	Bio sam u.
And not who.	I ne ko.
I didn't see what would happen to you	Nisam vidio šta će ti se dogoditi
We wouldn't be here if we weren't.	Ne bismo još bili ovdje da nismo.
I love you all very much	Volim vas sve puno
Nice to see you there!	Drago mi je da te vidim tamo!
Now he had something to do.	Sada je imao nešto da radi.
And see if it still works.	I vidi da li to još uvijek radi.
I'm not sure.	Nisam siguran.
No one could tell me what to do.	Niko mi nije mogao reći šta da radim.
I didn’t think this was going to happen yet	Nisam mislio da će se ovo još dogoditi
I'm afraid for the first time.	Bojim se po prvi put.
I have always loved her very much	Uvek sam je mnogo voleo
I knew he knew that too	Znao sam da je i on to znao
I really loved him.	Zaista sam ga volio.
That would be too much.	To bi bilo previše.
And he was.	I on je bio.
I'm.	Ja sam.
I did very little today.	Danas sam uradio jako malo.
I had no real reason to be there	Nisam imao pravi razlog da budem tamo
Do your job.	Radi svoj posao.
New day.	Novi dan.
I still want it, and you still have it	Ja ga i dalje želim, a ti ga još uvijek imaš
I wish that were true	Voleo bih da je to istina
The very idea of ​​it.	Sama ideja o tome.
I know it's with that	Znam da je s tim
He didn't ask her about this.	Nije je pitao za ovo.
I couldn't tell the truth	Nisam mogao reći istinu
I knew you would come back	Znao sam da ćeš se vratiti
There is a better way.	Postoji bolji način.
I wasn't good enough	Nisam bio dovoljno dobar
I never loved you and you never loved me	Nikada te nisam volio i ti nikad nisi volio mene
I will tell you.	Reći ću ti.
You can't know what he is.	Ne možete znati šta je on.
This is happening too much.	Ovo se previše dešava.
I would be there for three days	Bio bih tamo tri dana
I said no, which was true.	Rekao sam ne, što je bila istina.
It is,.	To je,.
I can't go on with it.	Ne mogu dalje s tim.
She didn't tell anyone.	Nikome nije rekla.
He was probably right.	Verovatno je bio u pravu.
Maybe he was both.	Možda je bio oboje.
I can see why.	Vidim zašto.
No one would hear.	Niko ne bi čuo.
But that's not for me.	Ali to nije za mene.
I never expected this	Ovo nikad nisam očekivao
I was sure of it.	Bio sam siguran u to.
We didn't know.	Nismo znali.
But it is life.	Ali, to je život.
That's just too good.	To je jednostavno previše dobro.
I can't seem to.	Čini se da ne mogu.
I still couldn't get it today	Danas ga još nisam mogao dobiti
I need to know he's fine	Moram da znam da je on dobro
I have no idea how and why, but it is	Nemam pojma kako i zašto, ali jeste
I couldn't take it anymore.	Nisam mogao više.
You must be tired.	Mora da si umoran.
I was tired but happy.	Bio sam umoran, ali sretan.
I'm not the only one doing this.	Nisam jedini koji ovo radi.
No one can get me	Niko me ne može dobiti
I didn't mean it that way	Nisam to tako mislio
I need to get to him quickly, she told herself	Moram brzo doći do njega, rekla je sebi
I tried to do that.	Pokušao sam to da uradim.
No, it wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
He is one of us now.	On je sada jedan od nas.
I knew exactly what he was talking about	Tačno sam znao o čemu govori
It had to be me.	Morao sam biti ja.
No one can do it the way he does.	Niko to ne može uraditi na način na koji on radi.
I couldn’t believe he did just that	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je upravo to uradio
That must be a lot of money.	To mora biti puno novca.
That's it for now.	To je to za sada.
It would be really good for me	Zaista bi mi dobro došao
I'm so glad you're here !.	Tako mi je drago što si ovdje!.
I should have said something earlier	Trebao sam nešto ranije reći
I hope it will be of help to you	Nadam se da će vam biti od pomoći
That is very true.	To je veoma tačno.
They couldn't stay here.	Nisu mogli ostati ovdje.
This is bad.	Ovo je loše.
I don't have it with me.	Nemam to kod sebe.
In fact, it is.	U stvari jeste.
He plays too well.	Previše dobro svira.
I could.	Mogao sam.
I'm not much better.	Nisam mnogo bolji.
If he hadn't done it tonight, he would never have done it.	Da to nije uradio večeras, nikada to ne bi uradio.
I've seen and heard enough	Video sam i čuo dovoljno
I was right, that was bad.	Bio sam u pravu, to je bilo loše.
I wish it was like that today	Voleo bih da je tako danas
I am surprised when someone loves me	Iznenađen sam kada me neko voli
Things are bad.	Stvari su loše.
It would be hard not to.	Bilo bi teško ne.
That's not usually the case with me.	Kod mene to obično nije tako.
I'll probably never see them again	Vjerovatno ih više nikad neću vidjeti
He is sure.	On je siguran.
I had no idea he would be here today	Nisam imao pojma da će danas biti ovdje
In fact, that day may never come.	U stvari, taj dan možda nikada neće doći.
And well, there are a lot of you here.	I dobro, ima vas puno ovdje.
Which could have happened without.	Što bi se moglo dogoditi i bez.
It was a good life.	Bio je to dobar život.
You're out of it.	Otišao si od toga.
Looks like no one's home.	Izgleda da niko nije kod kuće.
She didn't know what to do.	Nije znala šta bi trebalo da uradi.
Like, really good.	Kao, stvarno dobro.
That's what he would say.	To bi on rekao.
It wasn't long.	Nije bilo dugo.
She can only stay here.	Ona može samo ostati ovdje.
I can never get back with him.	Nikad se ne mogu vratiti s njim.
I can’t believe they’re both still there	Ne mogu vjerovati da su oboje još uvijek tamo
I have no idea where he is and what happened to him.	Nemam pojma gdje je i šta mu se dogodilo.
I would love to see them.	Volio bih ih vidjeti.
Little time.	Malo vremena.
Many, many years now.	Mnogo, mnogo godina sada.
Better not, he told himself, better not.	Bolje ne, rekao je sebi, bolje ne.
Obviously we can't.	Očigledno ne možemo.
he thought	mislio je
It's not them.	To nisu oni.
I would work.	Ja bih radio.
Maybe they are right.	Možda su u pravu.
She's not good.	Ona nije dobra.
I couldn’t believe she never told me about this	Nisam mogao vjerovati da mi nikad nije rekla za ovo
He got what he wanted again.	Ponovo je dobio šta je želeo.
If not, they won't.	Ako ne, neće.
And he realized that we are at home now and safe.	I on je shvatio da smo sada kod kuće i sigurni.
It's not that, he said.	Nije to, rekao je.
As if that was the only reason.	Kao da je to bio jedini razlog.
I love this time with him	Volim ovo vrijeme s njim
It is easy to see the reason.	Lako je vidjeti razlog.
I didn't know what it was about	Nisam znao o čemu se radi
It's hard to come.	Teško je doći.
They didn't have them now.	Sada ih nisu imali.
Like.	Kao.
I asked him who it was	Pitao sam ga ko je to
I thought it would help	Mislio sam da će pomoći
It was difficult for everyone.	Bilo je teško svima.
I knew what he was doing	Znao sam šta radi
I will come again for all of you	Doći ću ponovo za sve vas
I hope my father returns soon	Nadam se da će se otac uskoro vratiti
But we don't do that.	Ali mi to ne radimo.
Maybe it works, and maybe it doesn’t.	Možda radi, a možda i ne.
I was ready for anything that happened next	Bio sam spreman za sve što se dalje dogodilo
Either way.	Na bilo koji način.
I have all these things	Imam sve te stvari
For several days.	Već nekoliko dana.
He brought it back.	Vratio ga je.
Obviously that could happen.	Očigledno bi se to moglo dogoditi.
But it's not something he could do for work.	Ali nije nešto što bi mogao da uradi za posao.
I couldn't tell anyone	Nisam mogao nikome reći
I don't like them.	Ne volim ih.
That's not for me.	To nije za mene.
That's what makes you.	To je ono što te čini tobom.
I know, but he's fine	Znam, ali on je dobro
I wish you never did.	Voleo bih da nikad nisi.
That should be my path.	To bi morao biti moj put.
This took a long time.	Ovo je trebalo dugo vremena.
And she knew what she had to do.	I znala je šta treba da uradi.
I was happy to see that	Bio sam sretan što sam to vidio
That is what it should be.	To je ono što bi trebalo biti.
But she sees it well.	Ali ona je dobro vidi.
I know you're right	Znam da si u pravu
I think we have a lot of power.	Mislim da imamo mnogo moći.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
But he knew that wasn't true either.	Ali znao je da ni to nije istina.
If you do, you can go back.	Ako to uradite, možete se vratiti.
I just thought you should know about this	Samo sam mislio da bi trebao znati za ovo
I would say it would take a lot	Rekao bih da bi trebalo mnogo
I thought it was good	Mislio sam da je dobro
But it won't be long.	Ali to neće biti dugo.
I have a car.	Imam auto.
It was not at that time.	U to vrijeme nije bilo.
But he knew better.	Ali on je znao bolje.
I wouldn't want that	Ne bih to želio
I was here when it happened	Bio sam ovdje kad se to dogodilo
I probably have nothing to do with him	Vjerovatno nemam ništa s njim
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I want to be there too, and soon	I ja želim tamo, i to uskoro
You're right now.	Sada si u pravu.
You were right about him.	Bio si u pravu za njega.
, any.	, bilo koji.
I just don’t think that’s going to happen	Jednostavno ne mislim da će se to dogoditi
I just hope he sees it.	Samo se nadam da on to vidi.
A lot can happen.	Mnogo toga se može dogoditi.
I always know what he's going to say	Uvek znam šta će reći
It should go further.	Trebalo bi da ide dalje.
I have everything here	Imam sve ovde
I wondered what he was going to do	Pitao sam se šta će da uradi
But he didn't seem to be there.	Ali činilo se da ga nema.
I didn't decide on any of that.	Nisam se odlučio ni za šta od toga.
I'm back.	Vratio sam se.
They never were, never will be.	Nikada bili, nikada neće biti.
It was the first time.	Bio je to prvi put.
He seemed to be alone.	Činilo se da je sam.
I've never said that before	Nikada to ranije nisam rekao
It won't happen.	Neće se dogoditi.
But that's not the way we did it.	Ali to nije način na koji smo to uradili.
That's right.	Tako bi.
He didn't know where they were.	Nije znao gdje su.
But we only had one car.	Ali imali smo samo jedan auto.
I didn't know what to do	Nisam znao šta bi uradio
I was a little sorry for him	Bilo mi ga je malo žao
Now that was no longer a question.	Sada to više nije bilo pitanje.
Besides, there is little to say.	Osim toga, malo je toga za reći.
This was better.	Ovo je bilo bolje.
I can't even.	Ne mogu čak.
You could tell me what you did.	Mogao bi da mi kažeš šta si uradio.
I really love doing it	Zaista volim to raditi
I hope you're better now	Nadam se da si sada bolje
I decided this was my man	Odlučio sam da je ovo moj čovjek
And she was good to us.	I bila je dobra prema nama.
It couldn't be.	Nije moglo biti.
I could come tonight, but not now	Mogao bih doći večeras, ali ne sada
I bought one right away.	Kupio sam jedan odmah.
You have a lot of things.	Imaš puno stvari.
But you can get back on track.	Ali možete se vratiti na pravi put.
I can't work with you anymore	Ne mogu više raditi s tobom
Something needed to be done	Nešto je trebalo učiniti
I heard that.	Čuo sam to.
A lot of people do that	Mnogo ljudi to radi
That's not my job.	To nije moj posao.
I didn't know there was another one	Nisam znao da postoji još jedan
I gave him a job.	Dao sam mu posao.
I can't say exactly when	Ne mogu tačno reći kada
Nothing is here.	Ništa nije ovdje.
But that's the problem.	Ali to je problem.
I have to do more.	Moram da uradim više.
He would.	On bi.
He asked me what he could do for me.	Pitao me je šta može učiniti za mene.
I'm done with it	Završio sam to
I hope this is okay for everyone	Nadam se da je to u redu za sve
As it was.	Kao što je bilo.
Hope is good.	Nada je dobra.
He's done with me.	Završio je sa mnom.
I didn't try to help	Nisam pokušao pomoći
I don't know for sure why.	Ne znam sigurno zašto.
I would never be good again	Nikada više ne bih bio dobro
I got this from us	Dobio sam ovo kod nas
I've done this a few times.	Uradio sam ovo nekoliko puta.
I know what we can be	Znam šta možemo biti
I didn't expect him to say that	Nisam očekivao da će to reći
She doesn't know either.	Ni ona sama ne zna.
He was not happy.	Nije bio sretan.
I just love you so much	Samo te toliko volim
A lot.	Mnogo.
It's quick and easy.	To je brzo i lako.
I would know how and from whom	Znao bih kako i od koga
Something else was wrong.	Još nešto nije bilo u redu.
I should have seen this	Trebao sam da vidim ovo
They know nothing.	Oni ništa ne znaju.
It was supposed to look like that.	Trebao je da izgleda tako.
She's still there, waiting for me.	Ona je još tamo, čeka me.
I needed a new life.	Trebao mi je novi život.
He had time.	Imao je vremena.
It took a while.	Trebalo je malo.
I was glad I had it	Bilo mi je drago što sam ga imao
He could come back now.	Mogao bi se vratiti sada.
I hope that many more people will come tomorrow.	Nadam se da će sutra doći mnogo više ljudi.
I know he still has it	Znam da ga još ima
You can do it.	Možeš ti to.
I lost too much this past year	Izgubio sam previše ove prošle godine
She knew that.	Znala je to.
And it never works.	I nikad ne radi.
I knew you would be alone	Znao sam da ćeš biti sam
I didn't need too much	Nije mi trebalo previše
You did a good job there.	Uradio si dobar posao tamo.
I have no idea what's in there	Nemam pojma šta je tamo
I have something else to tell him	Moram mu još nešto reći
I hope that helps.	Nadam se da će to pomoći.
I knew what was going to happen.	Znao sam šta će se dogoditi.
Na, na, na.	Na, na, na.
I can't get a job.	Ne mogu dobiti posao.
I just wasn't sure where	Samo nisam bio siguran gdje
Maybe there is a reason for that.	Možda za to postoji razlog.
It was not an easy time.	Nije bilo lako vrijeme.
I had no idea he was going to do it	Nisam imao pojma da će to učiniti
It really exists.	Zaista postoji.
I've never done that before.	Nikad to ranije nisam radio.
But that is what it is.	Ali to je ono što jeste.
She was never there.	Ona nikad nije bila tamo.
I'll meet you there.	Naći ćemo se tamo.
I knew what was happening to me	Znao sam šta mi se dešava
But that's me.	Ali to sam ja.
I know something else is coming	Znam da će još nešto doći
I didn't hear about it until this morning.	Nisam čuo za to do jutros.
I want to be in it.	Želim biti u tome.
It's just not safe.	Jednostavno nije sigurno.
I know who he is now	Znam ko je on sada
That's not good in the house.	To nije dobro u kući.
It's not much, you know.	Nije puno, znaš.
He made them.	On ih je napravio.
I wasn't ready.	Nisam bio spreman.
I never saw him.	Nikad ga nisam video.
He is back.	Vratio se.
I wonder how many more people live like that	Pitam se koliko još ljudi tako živi
It was her.	To je bila ona.
This is real now.	Ovo je sada stvarno.
And that's not all.	I nije samo to.
But really, he is.	Ali zaista, on.
No, just a few.	Ne, samo nekoliko.
I'm not sure about that	Nisam siguran u to
I'm not ready for this	Nisam spreman za ovo
I never knew that before	Nikada to ranije nisam znao
I would never get that now.	Nikad to sada ne bih dobio.
No one seemed happy to see us.	Niko nije izgledao sretan što nas vidi.
I haven't been alone for a long time	Nisam dugo bila sama
I couldn't do it without you.	Ne bih to mogao bez tebe.
We didn't know anything.	Ništa nismo znali.
Please don't do that.	Molim te, ne radi to.
I knew who he was.	Znao sam ko je on.
I heard what you were doing	Čuo sam šta radiš
In fact, I probably should	U stvari, vjerovatno bih trebao
I should have just left	Trebao sam samo otići
I just didn't know exactly when	Samo nisam znao tačno kada
And that is it.	I to je to.
I'll give you this one	Ja ću ti dati ovaj
I know why you're here	Znam zašto si ovde
This should help.	Ovo bi trebalo da pomogne.
Not too much.	Ne puno.
I didn't ask for money	Nisam tražio novac
This is simply not true.	Ovo jednostavno nije istina.
And life here is pretty good.	I život ovdje je prilično dobar.
I thought you would be.	Mislio sam da ćeš biti.
Not many ideas.	Nema mnogo ideja.
I can't trust anyone here	Ne mogu nikome vjerovati ovdje
I wondered why that was so.	Pitao sam se zašto je to tako.
Maybe you are right and there is something more.	Možda ste u pravu i postoji nešto više.
But you did.	Ali jesi.
Even if he didn't ask.	Čak i da nije tražio.
I just have it.	Samo ga imam.
It could be true.	Moglo bi biti tačno.
But we didn't.	Ali nismo.
I wanted that money.	Želeo sam taj novac.
He knew it probably wouldn't help.	Znao je da to vjerovatno neće pomoći.
It's so hard to trust him.	Tako mu je teško vjerovati.
I want to go further.	Želim da idem dalje.
Still very difficult.	I dalje jako teško.
I had to know if it was really you	Morao sam znati da li si to stvarno ti
I think she was already there	Mislim da je već bila tamo
I hope he can move on	Nadam se da će moći dalje
But he had something.	Ali imao je nešto.
I shouldn't have come to work today.	Nisam trebao doći na posao danas.
I have what you say you need.	Imam ono što kažeš da ti treba.
I had to see them soon	Morao sam da ih vidim uskoro
I really never have.	Zaista nikad nisam.
Nobody wants to.	Niko ne želi.
I didn't tell him everything.	Nisam mu sve rekao.
No more than that.	Ne više od toga.
I really hope you will	Zaista se nadam da ćeš tako
Which no longer exists.	Koji više ne postoji.
Maybe I could do this	Možda bih mogao ovo da uradim
Today.	Danas.
I couldn’t go much further and he knew it	Nisam mogao ići mnogo dalje i on je to znao
You may get a job, you may not.	Možda ćeš dobiti posao, možda nećeš.
I know for sure what you're doing	Ja sigurno znam šta radiš
That's pretty bad.	To je prilično loše.
I expected that	Očekivao sam to
He's never done this before.	Nikada ranije ovo nije radio.
But there is a problem.	Ali postoji problem.
I'm not sure he even realized he had it.	Nisam siguran da je uopšte shvatio da ga ima.
I haven't heard of it	Nisam čuo za to
I thought something was wrong	Mislio sam da nešto nije u redu
He said he couldn't help but love me.	Rekao je da ne može pomoći, ali da me voli.
There wasn't much time.	Nije bilo puno vremena.
Nobody knew what to say.	Niko nije znao šta da kaže.
I didn't see anyone.	Nisam vidio nikoga.
This is for.	Ovo je za.
She doesn't know.	Ona ne zna.
I loved her very much	Mnogo sam je voleo
I didn't have a car anymore	Nisam više imao auto
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo u redu.
I do not know what to do	ne znam šta da radim
I didn't mean to do this	Nisam mislio ovo da uradim
I don’t know if this is a good idea or not.	Ne znam da li je ovo dobra ideja ili ne.
But that never happened.	Ali to se nikada nije dogodilo.
It's certainly not here.	To sigurno nije ovdje.
I certainly wasn't ready	Ja sigurno nisam bio spreman
It's hard to do well	Teško je to učiniti dobro
Maybe this, maybe that.	Možda ovo, možda ono.
I had better things to do	Imao sam bolje stvari za raditi
And much more.	I još mnogo toga.
I wonder what.	Pitam se šta.
I can still see them	Još uvijek ih mogu vidjeti
I think he should come back.	Mislim da bi se trebao vratiti.
I can't help but talk to him	Ne mogu ne razgovarati s njim
I shouldn't stay here	Ne bih trebao ostati ovdje
No one wondered.	Niko se nije pitao.
That's pretty bad.	To je prilično loše.
I don't even have it for myself.	Nemam ga ni za sebe.
But there was nothing they could do.	Ali ništa nisu mogli učiniti.
I wondered why, but I didn’t ask	Pitao sam se zašto, ali nisam pitao
He had never seen her before.	Nikada je ranije nije video.
I didn't know what it would be like	Nisam znao kako će to biti
It was so good today.	Danas je bilo tako dobro.
I think we do too much of that	Mislim da radimo previše od toga
But it's actually a good thing.	Ali zapravo je to dobra stvar.
Tell me what happened.	Reci mi šta se dogodilo.
Your money, maybe, but not mine.	Tvoj novac, možda, ali ne moj.
He said he would just have to see.	Rekao je da će samo morati vidjeti.
I guess he was tired	Pretpostavljam da je bio umoran
How it seems to go.	Kako izgleda da ide.
I already know it works	Već znam da to radi
I didn't know what was going on.	Nisam znao šta se dešava.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
I thought you wanted to see	Mislio sam da želiš vidjeti
Yes, and alone.	Da, i sama.
I was glad he didn't.	Bilo mi je drago da nije.
You are not.	Ti nisi.
Something she wanted.	Nešto što je htela.
It will be you.	To ćeš biti ti.
You can do it.	Vi to možete učiniti.
It could be said to be a good life.	Moglo bi se reći da je dobar život.
I think we should come get you	Mislim da bi trebali doći po tebe
I had no idea where we were	Nisam imao pojma gdje smo
In order to work, he must live.	Da bi radio mora da živi.
Now I understand that.	Sada sam to shvatio.
I didn't hear everything they said	Nisam čuo sve što su rekli
He was fine.	Bio je dobro.
I have it all and more	Imam sve to i više od toga
I wouldn't have that.	Ne bih to imao.
I didn't know it was you	Nisam znao da si to ti
I just couldn’t believe it	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati
But it was.	Ali bilo je.
Why, no one knows.	Zašto, niko ne zna.
I can't let him do that	Ne mogu mu dozvoliti da to uradi
I just didn't want him to do it.	Jednostavno nisam htela da to uradi.
I have something else to ask you.	Imam još nešto da te pitam.
You will not go.	Nećeš ići.
I wouldn't be too sure	Ne bih bio previše siguran
Maybe I'll never see you again	Možda te više nikada neću vidjeti
I knew you liked it	Znala sam da ti se sviđa
You should leave today.	Trebao bi otići danas.
I've had enough for one day	Dosta mi ga je za jedan dan
I just didn't know anyone else came here	Samo nisam znao da je još neko došao ovde
I even wondered if he might have been right	Čak sam se pitao da li je možda bio u pravu
Or some of it is.	Ili nešto od toga jeste.
He had to leave.	Morao je da ode.
I have so many things to do	Imam toliko stvari da uradim
You're not doing anything wrong.	Ne radiš ništa loše.
And that's exactly what happened to me.	I upravo to mi se dogodilo.
I just can't see.	Samo ne mogu da vidim.
There was so little time.	Bilo je tako malo vremena.
He is afraid of us at the moment.	Trenutno nas se boji.
I knew what it could do.	Znao sam šta to može učiniti.
I would like to.	Volio bih.
I can help you with that	Mogu ti pomoći u tome
He loves what he does.	On voli ono što radi.
I guess she was right	Pretpostavljam da je bila u pravu
I think he was as surprised as we were	Mislim da je bio iznenađen kao i mi
Apparently we're still alive.	Očigledno smo još živi.
I mean, she didn't say that, but yes	Mislim, nije to rekla, ali da
But we are really better than that.	Ali zaista smo bolji od toga.
I couldn't be more surprised	Nisam mogao biti više iznenađen
Yeah, I don't want to do that.	Ja, ne želim to da radim.
If there is anything else.	Ako postoji još nešto.
I wanted him to leave	Želio sam da ode
I just don't need it	Jednostavno mi ne bi trebao
Maybe that's why?	Možda je to razlog zašto?
There were really few of them.	Bilo ih je zaista malo.
I think that's a good thing	Mislim da je to dobra stvar
All this is not so easy.	Sve ovo nije tako lako.
I'm still my own.	I dalje sam svoj.
It has everything you need.	Ima sve što vam treba.
I think one of us should stay there	Mislim da bi jedan od nas trebao ostati tamo
I've never heard of such a thing	Nikad nisam čuo za tako nešto
That's good for all of us.	To je dobro za sve nas.
I just wanted to do it tonight	Samo sam htela da uradim to večeras
But there was more to it than that.	Ali bilo je tu nešto više od toga.
I shouldn't have been here.	Nisam trebao biti ovdje.
I think she knows everything.	Mislim da ona zna sve.
She doesn't want that either.	Ni ona to ne želi.
This was all just not true.	Ovo je bilo sve samo ne istina.
But there was no help for that.	Ali za to nije bilo pomoći.
It’s actually pretty simple.	Zapravo je prilično jednostavno.
Maybe you are.	Možda jesi.
But not in the way you think.	Ali ne na način na koji mislite.
They will leave immediately.	Oni će odmah otići.
I want someone to tell me what to do.	Želim da mi neko kaže šta da radim.
No one will know until the day.	Niko neće znati do dana.
I already loved him so much	Već sam ga toliko volio
I won't be able to help	Neću moći pomoći
He said enough.	Rekao je dovoljno.
This can be difficult.	Ovo može biti teško.
I want you to tell me everything	Želim da mi sve kažeš
Obviously, that was no longer true.	Očigledno, to više nije bila istina.
The thing is.	Stvar je u tome.
There is no help for that.	Nema pomoći za to.
If he only knew.	Kad bi samo znao.
I'm not sure about this.	Nisam siguran za ovo.
Which, in fact, is pretty obvious.	Što je, zapravo, prilično očigledno.
I can't say that to everyone	Ne mogu reći da svima
Not much.	Nije puno.
I have something to say.	Imam nešto da kažem.
I've never had that before.	Nikad to ranije nisam imao.
I can't go on about it now	Ne mogu dalje u to sada
I'm sure of it.	Siguran sam u to.
I didn't want to go to the party	Nisam htela da idem na zabavu
I can do it again.	Mogu to ponovo.
I heard him talk to you	Čuo sam kako ti govori
It can't get any better.	Ne može biti bolje.
I asked them where we could go	Pitao sam ih gdje možemo ići
He looked really good.	Izgledao je stvarno dobro.
I've never seen him	Nikad ga nisam video
He's not in the house.	Nije u kući.
I know something is wrong	Znam da nešto nije u redu
Or maybe too much.	Ili možda previše.
No one came to tell you what to do.	Niko nije došao da vam govori šta da radite.
I know you want her	Znam da je želiš
Really no one saw this.	Zaista niko nije vidio ovo.
But that was not true.	Ali to nije bila istina.
Today is a new day.	Danas je novi dan.
I didn't know when you would be back	Nisam znao kada ćeš se vratiti
That is not even true.	To čak i nije istina.
But she.	Ali ona.
I need to talk to you.	Moram razgovarati s tobom.
I see things you couldn't see like you	Vidim stvari koje ti nisi mogao vidjeti kao ti
I'll leave before you know it.	Otići ću prije nego što znaš.
How he knew that, he could not say.	Kako je to znao, nije mogao reći.
I never thought he might be right, not really	Nikad nisam mislio da bi mogao biti u pravu, ne baš
I wish you were here.	Volio bih da si tu.
He's just not ready.	On jednostavno nije spreman.
I just need some time	Samo mi treba malo vremena
I didn't mean to say that	Nisam to htio reći
If ever, certainly not again.	Ako ikada, sigurno više ne.
I don't think it would.	Mislim da ne bi.
I've seen enough.	Video sam dovoljno.
I haven't heard that in a long time	Nisam to čuo dugo vremena
I was just happy to get something	Samo sam bio sretan što sam dobio nešto
With you here, they will not return.	Sa tobom ovdje, oni se neće vratiti.
I know you know this	Znam da ti ovo znaš
It could happen.	Moglo bi se dogoditi.
I wasn't here for myself	Nisam bio ovdje zbog sebe
They did a very bad job.	Uradili su veoma loš posao.
I love working there	Volim raditi tamo
So good.	Tako dobro.
I've been getting this for a while.	Dobio sam ovo neko vrijeme.
I should probably do that.	Verovatno bih to trebao da uradim.
We can get back to that.	Možemo se vratiti na to.
I can do many things	Mogu mnogo stvari
You say that.	Ti to reci.
I haven't finished my work yet	Još nisam završio svoj posao
This may be my first time.	To mi je možda prvi put.
I want her here until tomorrow	Želim je ovdje do sutra
I have no idea what it is.	Nemam pojma šta je to.
It was either us or them.	Bili smo ili mi ili oni.
I'm here.	Ovdje sam.
I couldn't see what it was	Nisam mogao da vidim šta je to
He was the only person there.	On je bio jedina osoba tamo.
You were everything to me.	Bio si mi sve.
And now we are here.	I sada smo tu.
I heard something like a.	Čuo sam nešto kao a.
This really couldn’t have happened.	Ovo se zapravo nije moglo dogoditi.
I'll go if you can	Ja ću ići ako možeš
I couldn't give him mine	Nisam mu mogao dati svoj
That he will help me.	Da će mi pomoći.
Why this is happening.	Zašto se ovo dešava.
I think he's doing well	Mislim da mu to dobro ide
Life itself.	Sam život.
I just wasn’t ready for it	Jednostavno nisam bio spreman za to
I'm much better now	Sada sam mnogo bolje
You can see the way in things.	Možete vidjeti put u stvari.
I don't like these things.	Ne volim ove stvari.
We do as we say.	Radimo kako smo rekli.
There's not much there.	Nema puno tamo.
I'm the one who has to stay here.	Ja sam taj koji mora ostati ovdje.
It never was.	Nikada nije bilo.
They are me.	Oni su mi.
I didn't want to ask before	Nisam htela da pitam ranije
I did everything.	Sve sam radio.
You're fine together, he told me this afternoon.	Dobro ste zajedno, rekao mi je danas popodne.
I've had this problem before.	Imao sam ovaj problem prije.
It really doesn't look good to me.	Zaista mi ne izgleda dobro.
But I don't know how to say it.	Ali ne znam kako da to kažem.
That may be true today.	To je možda istina danas.
I wouldn't want it back.	Ne bih ga htio vratiti.
You are just someone who wants to know what is going on there.	Vi ste samo neko ko želi da zna šta se tamo dešava.
Just question.	Samo pitanje.
He has to do it his way.	On to mora uraditi na svoj način.
That is exactly what is happening now.	Upravo to se sada dešava.
It doesn't look so bad.	Ne izgleda tako loše.
She didn't want to work.	Nije htela da radi.
There was nothing that I could do about it	Nisam mogao ništa učiniti za njega
It has to do it or it does nothing.	Mora to učiniti ili ne radi ništa.
I told you there were more	Rekao sam ti da ih ima još
He loves you.	On te voli.
We don't even know what he looked like.	Ne znamo ni kako je izgledao.
I didn't look for him anymore	Nisam ga dalje tražio
Yes, everyone is at home.	Da, svi su kod kuće.
Maybe it's us.	Možda smo to mi.
I didn't know what she knew	Nisam znao šta je ona znala
That's better.	To je bolje.
The question is now true.	Pitanje je sada istina.
But now she is.	Ali sada je ona.
I asked her who she was	Pitao sam je ko je ona
It's all about having fun.	Sve se radi o zabavi.
He had nothing to say about it.	Nije imao šta da kaže o tome.
I didn't get much more	Nisam dobio mnogo više
And it exists.	I to postoji.
It's happening right now.	To se dešava upravo sada.
I tried again.	Pokušao sam ponovo.
I won't do that to him	Neću mu to raditi
He's just another bad guy.	On je samo još jedan loš momak.
I have no time	Nemam vremena
It won't be.	Neće biti.
I went there this afternoon	Otišao sam tamo popodne
Obviously a better team.	Očigledno bolji tim.
He said you were.	Rekao je da jesi.
They knew they could never go home.	Znali su da nikada ne mogu ići kući.
In fact, he could see everything.	U stvari, mogao je sve da vidi.
I was ready this time.	Bio sam spreman ovaj put.
We'll be able to go soon.	Moći ćemo uskoro ići.
Maybe he thought I would get better.	Možda je mislio da će mi biti bolje.
I didn't mean it that way	Nisam to tako mislio
Everything is just good.	Sve je jednostavno dobro.
You saw it better.	Ti si to bolje vidio.
I didn't know anyone was there	Nisam znao da je neko tamo
I knew from before that he was not going with anyone	Od ranije sam znao da ne ide ni sa kim
But something was really wrong.	Ali nešto zaista nije bilo u redu.
I'm done with that	Završio sam s tim
I thought you all wanted it	Mislio sam da svi to želite
But that was many years ago.	Ali to je bilo prije mnogo godina.
Before he does, you need to know about him.	Prije nego to učini, morate znati za njega.
I love working with you	Volim raditi s tobom
When I didn't.	Kad nisam.
I should have done it	Trebao sam to učiniti
I could trust him	Mogao sam mu vjerovati
Like it really works.	Kao da to zaista radi.
I just didn’t have the time.	Jednostavno nisam imao vremena.
Always has been, probably always will be.	Uvek je bilo, verovatno će i biti.
The first.	Prvi.
They are not real.	Pravi nisu.
I'm here for you	Ovdje sam zbog tebe
I knew better than to say no	Znao sam bolje nego da kažem ne
I still don't see anyone	Još uvek ne vidim nikoga
I was just trying to know	Samo sam pokušao da znam
It may not look like it, but it is.	Možda ne izgleda tako, ali jeste.
I've done it before.	Radio sam to ranije.
It was anything.	To je bilo šta.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
I said no to everything	Rekao sam ne na sve
I did a good job	Radio sam dobar posao
But that just wasn’t right.	Ali to jednostavno nije bilo u redu.
I'm still working.	I dalje radim.
I would like to be your friend.	Voleo bih da ti budem prijatelj.
I didn't know what to tell him	Nisam znao šta da mu kažem
I am the way, the truth and the life	Ja sam put, istina i život
And we were.	I mi smo bili.
The reason for.	Razlog za.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
I just don't know.	Samo ne znam.
It was a good idea.	Bila je dobra ideja.
But there will be problems soon.	Ali uskoro će doći do problema.
It all happened.	Sve se to dogodilo.
I know you're tired	Znam da si umoran
I think this will help	Mislim da će ovo pomoći
For the road.	Za put.
This was the reason.	Ovo je bio razlog.
I need help, you know that	Treba mi pomoć, znaš to
Now you know what to do.	Sada znate šta da radite.
I want it to work for you.	Želim da radi za tebe.
I would love to see her really well.	Voleo bih da je vidim zaista dobro.
But he got the life.	Ali on je dobio život.
I can't help but love them	Ne mogu a da ih ne volim
No, they weren't real.	Ne, nisu bili pravi.
I would never say something like that	Nikad ne bih rekao tako nešto
That could be a while.	To bi moglo biti neko vrijeme.
You are here now.	Sada ste tu.
He's probably already gone.	Verovatno je već otišao.
It's not real.	Nije stvarno.
I didn't do anything	Nisam ništa radio
And he was right.	I on je bio u pravu.
It just wasn't, it seemed.	Samo što nije, činilo se.
I just didn't want to say you were right	Samo nisam htela da kažem da si u pravu
He never did.	Nikad nije.
I'm willing to believe that	Spreman sam u to vjerovati
But it's not money.	Ali to nije novac.
My only truth.	Moja jedina istina.
Not that one.	Ne taj.
There are too many of us now.	Sada nas je previše.
I've been doing it so far	Ja to radim do sada
I haven't done anything wrong here	Nisam uradio ništa loše ovde
I asked him what he would do.	Pitao sam ga šta bi uradio.
I just want to know what's going on there	Samo želim da znam šta se tamo dešava
I left for the day.	Otišao sam na dan.
I could say much more	Mogao bih reći mnogo više
But that's nothing.	Ali to nije ništa.
She was everything to me.	Ona mi je bila sve.
I asked what he wanted	Pitao sam šta želi
He never said that.	On to nikada nije rekao.
I didn't expect it to be	Nisam očekivao da će biti
I really think there is	Zaista mislim da ima
That's what he did.	To je on uradio.
I've seen a lot and I can help you	Video sam dosta toga i mogu vam pomoći
Nice to see you again.	Drago mi je da te ponovo vidim.
We have a lot of time for that.	Imamo puno vremena za to.
I have something to tell you	Imam nešto da ti kažem
This usually does not happen.	Obično se to ne dešava.
I never wanted anyone again	Nikada više nisam želeo nikoga
It can happen anywhere and anytime.	To se može dogoditi bilo gdje i bilo kada.
I realized that was what he really meant	Shvatio sam da je to zaista i mislio
I'm not really sure if he's right or not.	Nisam baš siguran da li je u pravu ili ne.
I wasn't there anymore	Nisam više bio tamo
I almost got them	Skoro sam ih dobio
And they.	I oni.
That could not have happened.	To se nije moglo dogoditi.
I want to know these things	Želim znati ove stvari
I hope today is a better day for you	Nadam se da je danas bolji dan za vas
She is for me almost everything.	Ona mi je za skoro sve.
I know he will do it	Znam da će to učiniti
I just didn't want to be alone	Samo nisam htela da budem sama
I couldn't believe he said yes	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je rekao da
I'm doing well.	dobro mi ide.
We have to do it.	Moramo to da uradimo.
There is more to it.	Ima toga i više.
I don't know if he loves me or not	Ne znam da li me voli ili ne
I hope not.	Nadam se da neće.
I know he's trying now	Znam da sada pokušava
I think he is a good person.	Mislim da je on dobra osoba.
I couldn't do it alone	Ne bih to mogao sam
I'm so glad they're here.	Tako mi je drago što su ovdje.
I know you haven't seen that	Znam da to nisi vidio
I looked for him, but I couldn't find him	Tražio sam ga, ali ga nisam mogao naći
I loved them.	Voleo sam ih.
I say so.	Ja tako kažem.
We know what works for us.	Znamo šta radi za nas.
I'm tired enough already.	Već sam dovoljno umoran.
We have to.	Mi moramo.
It's good that he did.	Dobro je što je to učinio.
But now you're there.	Ali sada si tamo.
I'm .	ja sam .
I didn't really have anything	Zapravo nisam imao ništa
I will never be without it	Nikada neću biti bez toga
And it is now or never.	I to je sada ili nikad.
She knows exactly what she is doing and why.	Ona tačno zna šta radi i zašto.
The question is how much.	Pitanje je koliko.
I know you know the truth	Znam da znaš istinu
I can’t believe this is happening right now	Ne mogu vjerovati da se ovo dešava upravo sada
I had none of that anymore	Nisam više imao ništa od toga
I don't think so	Mislim da nije
I thought he would be alive by now for sure	Mislio sam da će do sada sigurno biti živi
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
He said this.	Ovo je rekao.
I didn’t think it was going to happen	Nisam mislio da će se to dogoditi
I'm so glad you like it	Veoma mi je drago da ti se sviđa
That was fine.	To je bilo u redu.
Everything feels right here.	Ovdje se sve osjeća kako treba.
You did what you could.	Uradili ste šta ste mogli.
I don't want anything from you	Neću ti ništa
But the question is still good.	Ali pitanje je i dalje dobro.
I just lost a friend.	Upravo sam izgubio prijatelja.
Everything has a reason.	Sve ima razlog.
I did what they told me	Uradio sam ono što su mi rekli
You can do those things.	Ti možeš raditi te stvari.
We were a team that shouldn’t have been so good.	Bili smo tim koji nije trebao biti tako dobar.
I knew it was good	Znao sam da je dobro
That's how I wanted them	Tako sam ih htela
Everything will be fine.	Sve će biti u redu.
I didn't know this was so hard	Nisam znala da je ovo tako teško
But obviously not.	Ali očigledno nije.
I didn't want to do that to him	Nisam htela da mu to uradim
I have nothing to tell you	Nemam šta da ti kažem
You will soon be doing many more things yourself.	Uskoro ćete mnogo više stvari raditi sami.
Or that something happened to him.	Ili da mu se nešto dogodilo.
I didn't know what it looked like	Nisam znao kako izgleda
That's a little.	To je malo.
You obviously want to be here.	Očigledno želiš biti ovdje.
It just has to be me	Samo moram biti ja
I would love to see him again	Voleo bih da ga ponovo vidim
And not for money.	I to ne zbog novca.
I hope this was helpful	Nadam se da je ovo bilo od pomoći
I couldn't see them	Nisam mogao da ih vidim
We are here now.	Sada smo ovdje.
It was day.	Bio je dan.
Nothing has happened for a long time.	Dugo se ništa ne dešava.
But there are many.	Ali ima ih mnogo.
I'm sure of that.	U to sam siguran.
I don't have time this morning.	Nemam vremena jutros.
He is he.	On je on.
He couldn't see anything.	Nije mogao ništa da vidi.
He wants us to do more.	On želi da uradimo više.
We're not sure.	Nismo sigurni.
It is.	Da, jeste.
The people he loved.	Ljudi koje je voleo.
I didn't want to be here, and he knew it	Nisam htela da budem ovde, i on je to znao
Even if they are much, much, much better.	Čak i ako su mnogo, mnogo, mnogo bolje.
But probably not the way you think.	Ali vjerovatno ne na način na koji mislite.
Or enough.	Ili dosta toga.
I really have to go	Zaista moram da idem
Like mine.	Kao i moj.
Not because of that.	Ne zbog toga.
I hope you won't be there.	Nadam se da nećeš biti tamo.
That was really something.	To je zaista bilo nešto.
He doesn't know much about anything.	On ne zna mnogo ni o čemu.
I never wanted to stay here	Nikada nisam htio ostati ovdje
They don't know how it happened.	Ne znaju kako se to dogodilo.
I just had to do it	Jednostavno sam morao tako da uradim
It was enough for me the first time	Bilo mi je dosta toga prvi put
She said no.	Rekla je da nema.
I can be there and do something	Mogu biti tamo i raditi nešto
I just didn't know how	Samo nisam znao kako
And that's exactly what he did.	I upravo je to uradio.
I really love them.	Zaista ih volim.
Yes, I certainly would.	Da, sigurno bi.
I knew she hadn't been here long	Znao sam da nije dugo bila ovdje
I can't tell you what's good and what's bad	Ne mogu vam reći šta je dobro, a šta loše
You did it.	To si uradio.
Everything was difficult.	Sve je bilo teško.
He'll probably be here soon.	Verovatno će uskoro doći.
I don't want this obviously.	Ne želim ovo očigledno.
I was more than happy to do so.	Bio sam više nego sretan što sam to uradio.
I did this last year.	Uradio sam ovo prošle godine.
And he was tired.	I bio je umoran.
And never again.	I nikad više.
I want time.	Želim vremena.
There seems to be no problem.	Izgleda da nema problema.
And he's right.	I u pravu je.
I just want to do everything.	Samo želim da uradim sve.
Someone was here.	Neko je bio ovde.
And there were many of you.	I mnogo vas je bilo.
I can't give you anything	Ne mogu ti ništa dati
I couldn't do that.	Nisam mogao to da uradim.
I should have what you need	Trebalo bi da imam ono što ti treba
He asked for it.	On je to tražio.
He knows about you.	On zna za tebe.
You know you will.	Znaš da hoćeš.
I hadn't been there the day before	Nisam bio tamo dan ranije
There is a way to do it.	Postoji način da se to uradi.
And you can see that.	I to možete vidjeti.
I mean, I can.	Mislim, mogu.
I can do it alone	Mogu sama
That's all for us today.	To je sve za nas danas.
You don't have to do all of this.	Ne morate sve ovo da radite.
He would be fine.	On bi bio u redu.
I just didn't know that yet	Samo to još nisam znao
It's a thing he made himself.	To je stvar koju je sam napravio.
I already knew who it was	Već sam znao ko je to
I have to go now.	Moram da idem sada.
Everyone there had.	Svi su tamo imali.
It took me a while for myself	Trebalo mi je malo vremena za sebe
Actually, you can't.	U stvari, ne možete.
That's what you're going to have to do.	To je ono što ćeš morati da uradiš.
I couldn't be sure what it was.	Nisam mogao biti siguran šta je to.
I left without telling you anything	Otišao sam a da ti ništa nisam rekao
We don't have to.	Ne moramo.
Never, never was.	Nikad, nikad nije bilo.
But the road goes on.	Ali put ide dalje.
I saw a lot today.	Danas sam dosta toga vidio.
This time we can do better.	Ovaj put možemo bolje.
I guess you know.	Pretpostavljam da znaš.
You don't know anything.	Ti ne znaš ništa.
I think they did a really good job.	Mislim da su uradili zaista dobar posao.
I know this was the right guy	Znam da je ovo bio pravi momak
Nobody does that.	Niko to ne radi.
I didn't really know what to think about it	Nisam baš znao šta da mislim o tome
And we can get more.	I možemo dobiti još.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.	Možda jeste, možda i nije.
He lives here.	On živi ovdje.
And it's so hard.	I tako je teško.
I'm not sure what's wrong with me.	Nisam siguran šta nije u redu sa mnom.
I like that you want to do this	Sviđa mi se što želiš ovo da uradiš
Really good.	Zaista dobro.
I hope you find him.	Nadam se da ćeš ga naći.
That's what you said.	Tako si rekao.
I mean, that's fine	Mislim, to je u redu
I'm ready.	Spreman sam.
This could be a few things.	Ovo bi moglo biti nekoliko stvari.
I can't help you.	Ne mogu ti pomoći.
For both of you.	Za vas oboje.
I hope to get her back soon	Nadam se da će je uskoro vratiti
I don't need much.	Ne treba mi puno.
I just didn’t know where that might be	Samo nisam znao gdje bi to moglo biti
He had never done that before.	On to nikada ranije nije radio.
And I'm sure of it	I ja sam u to siguran
I didn't hear everything	Nisam sve čuo
I still had so much to do.	Imao sam još toliko toga da uradim.
I saw it today.	Video sam danas.
I knew something was wrong	Znao sam da nešto nije u redu
I thought he loved me	Mislio sam da me voli
This is not all bad.	Ovo nije sve loše.
I might have gone there.	Možda sam otišao tamo.
They can be anyone.	Oni mogu biti bilo ko.
It seemed to be.	Činilo se da jeste.
I didn't need a meeting	Nije mi trebao sastanak
I can't tell you yet	Ne mogu vam još reći
I'll stay here	Ja ću ostati ovdje
And he was tired.	I on je bio umoran.
She was alone, that much he knew.	Bila je sama, toliko je znao.
So it won't work for you.	Tako da vam to neće raditi.
I didn't know why.	Nisam znao zašto.
I did it like here and there.	Radio sam to kao tu i tamo.
If you could, we'd all have it by now.	Da možete, svi bismo je imali do sada.
I could work on that now	Sada bih mogao raditi s tim
I think this could be the problem.	Mislim da bi ovo mogao biti problem.
And he was the first to do both.	I on je prvi koji je uradio oboje.
Or who actually did what.	Ili ko je šta zapravo uradio.
I came to tell you that your car will be ready this afternoon.	Došao sam da ti kažem da će tvoj auto biti spreman danas popodne.
She said that.	Ona je to rekla.
I think there were a lot of people	Mislim da je mnogo ljudi bilo
And that's what it took.	I to je ono što je trebalo.
I just wanted you to think that	Samo sam htela da to misliš
I want them to know that	Želim da to znaju
Few years ago.	Prije nekoliko godina.
Probably someone will come for us soon.	Verovatno će neko uskoro doći po nas.
There seemed to be no help for that.	Činilo se da tome nema pomoći.
He didn't expect to stay long.	Nije očekivao da će dugo ostati.
That will come.	To će doći.
I'm not ready for this	Nisam spreman za ovo
And there you are.	I tu ste.
I ask him, and he says it's not me	Pitam ga, a on kaže da nisam ja
I hope he was just tired.	Nadam se da je bio samo umoran.
I just really want to talk to you	Samo stvarno želim razgovarati s tobom
I guess you did what you had to do	Pretpostavljam da si uradio ono što si morao
And, there was something else.	I, bilo je još nešto.
I have never been so happy to see her	Nikada nisam bio tako sretan što je vidim
I didn’t even realize it for a while	Nisam čak ni shvatio neko vrijeme
Does not work.	Ne radi.
Another new one.	Još jedan novi.
I didn't mean that	Nisam to mislio
That must be known.	To se mora znati.
I came to see if everything was okay	Došao sam da vidim da li je sve u redu
He doesn't play.	On ne igra.
I know myself and I have seen a lot	I sam znam i vidio sam mnogo toga
I can't say what you think	Ne mogu reći šta mislite
I love it so much	Toliko volim
And there are times.	I ima vremena.
I didn't realize it was you	Nisam shvatio da si to ti
Everyone knew that.	Svi su to znali.
We knew what to do.	Znali smo šta da radimo.
I want to know what's going on	Želim da znam šta se dešava
I didn't even know who he was	Nisam ni znao ko je on
I couldn't tell him what to do	Nisam mu mogao reći šta da radi
I have both and I love them	Imam oboje i volim ih
He promised himself he would.	Obećao je sebi da hoće.
I still can't see anything.	I dalje ništa ne vidim.
We can say.	Možemo reći,.
He can play.	On može da igra.
I couldn't tell anyone the truth	Nisam mogao nikome reći istinu
I tried to tell him what happened	Pokušao sam da mu kažem šta se dogodilo
It's only been three months.	To su samo tri mjeseca.
You wouldn't be here if you were.	Ne biste bili ovdje da jeste.
I just wanted to.	Samo sam htela.
I wondered where he was now.	Pitao sam se gdje je sada.
I didn't really tell him	Nisam mu baš rekao
I'm just going to have to trust you with that.	Samo ću ti morati vjerovati u tome.
I'm not sure about that.	Nisam baš siguran u to.
I didn't.	Nisam.
We don't know for sure.	Ne znamo sigurno.
I can't go there.	Ne mogu tamo.
There should be a few more soon.	Uskoro bi ih trebalo biti još nekoliko.
I haven't heard of you yet	Još uvek nisam čuo za tebe
I guess they're not exactly human	Pretpostavljam da nisu baš ljudi
Not so far.	Ne do sada.
I don't like them anymore	Ne volim ih više
That's what they did.	To su oni uradili.
They could only do so much.	Mogli su samo toliko.
Or you think it is.	Ili mislite da jeste.
Too much.	Previše.
We do it any way.	Mi to radimo na bilo koji način.
But he's fine.	Ali on je dobro.
I didn't know there were so many	Nisam znala da ih ima toliko
I want you to know that	Želim da to znaš
He shouldn't have.	Nije trebao.
I wouldn't be here without it	Bez toga ne bih bio ovdje
He couldn't go today.	Nije mogao ići danas.
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno si u pravu.
Life itself.	Život sam po sebi.
I wish it was just that.	Voleo bih da je samo to.
And you can never see me.	I nikad me ne možeš vidjeti.
I know what he's talking about.	Znam o čemu priča.
It would take some time.	Trebalo bi neko vrijeme.
I should have seen that	Trebao sam to vidjeti
I really want to see him again before he leaves	Zaista ga želim ponovo vidjeti prije nego što ode
I could tell he wanted to trust me	Mogao sam reći da mi želi vjerovati
I had no idea what the question was	Nisam imao pojma šta je pitanje
I never liked this job	Nikada nisam voleo ovaj posao
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
I should definitely leave	Trebao bih sigurno otići
We could go see tonight.	Mogli bismo ići vidjeti večeras.
It is unlikely that this will happen.	Malo je vjerovatno da će se to dogoditi.
And it's fast.	I to je brzo.
I was not so happy anymore	Nisam više bio tako sretan
I know what needs to be done	Znam šta treba da se uradi
It's good to see you.	Dobro je vidjeti te.
I was just wondering if you were okay	Samo sam se pitao da li si dobro
It's hard for us too.	I nama je teško.
I very much doubt that this will happen now	Veoma sumnjam da li će se to sada dogoditi
I know what he meant.	Znam šta je mislio.
I can't tell you how glad I am	Ne mogu vam reći koliko mi je drago
I'm glad to see you're fine	Drago mi je da vidim da si dobro
I'm glad the time he was there	Drago mi je vrijeme kada je bio tamo
I think it's okay to tell you.	Mislim da je u redu da ti kažem.
That would be me.	To bi bili mi.
I'd like him to go home.	Voleo bih da ide kući.
Not these things.	Ne ove stvari.
But the thing is, nobody knew.	Ali stvar je u tome da niko nije znao.
I arrived quickly.	Stigao sam brzo.
Not this way.	Ne na ovaj način.
He says.	On kaže.
I didn't say that.	Nisam rekao s tim.
I need that from you.	To mi treba od tebe.
I know it was her, for sure	Znam da je to bila ona, sigurno
I would do anything for it	Sve bih uradio za to
I just didn't know how	Jednostavno nisam znao kako
But there is something else in the story.	Ali tu je priča još nešto.
I hope you stay here	Nadam se da ćeš ostati ovdje
I didn't know why.	Nisam znao zašto.
It was obvious.	Bilo je očigledno.
That something can be anything.	To nešto može biti bilo šta.
I've got one.	Imam jedan.
I'm just surprised.	Samo sam iznenađen.
I can't go back to how it was	Ne mogu se vratiti kako je bilo
This is difficult for everyone.	Ovo je teško za sve.
I can't give you everything	Ne mogu ti dati sve
I don't want to see you.	Ne želim da te vidim.
I wonder if it really works.	Pitam se da li zaista radi.
I know he didn't mean it that way	Znam da nije tako mislio
But not because of you.	Ali ne zbog tebe.
I love myself.	Volim sebe.
I thought to myself, this can't be true.	Mislio sam u sebi, ovo ne može biti istina.
I did everything you said, but this problem still exists.	Uradio sam sve što ste rekli, ali ovaj problem i dalje postoji.
I wish he was here now	Voleo bih da je sada ovde
We didn't know what to do now.	Nismo znali šta da radimo sada.
I am not a person.	Ja nisam osoba.
I can only hope you will	Mogu samo da se nadam da hoćeš
I didn't have to ask anything	Nisam morao ništa da pitam
You can get almost anything.	Možete dobiti skoro sve.
I was glad to see them there	Bilo mi je drago vidjeti ih tamo
He says	On kaže
No one could tell what happened to him.	Niko nije mogao reći šta se dogodilo s njim.
He said he was not surprised.	Rekao je da nije iznenađen.
I just finished a meeting.	Upravo sam završio sastanak.
I don't know why this is happening.	Ne znam zašto se to dešava.
I suppose.	Pretpostavljam.
I've never even heard of him.	Nikad nisam ni čuo za njega.
That was not a problem.	To nije bio problem.
I guess that was good	Pretpostavljam da je to bilo dobro
No, that's not true.	Ne, nije tačno.
You never were, you never will be.	Nikada nisi bio, nikad više nećeš biti.
And he hadn't been there before.	I nije bio tamo ranije.
I need to know everything	Moram da znam sve
I'm not sure what that is	Nisam siguran šta je to
Nobody knew what it was.	Niko nije znao šta je to.
It's just something that happens.	To je samo nešto što se dešava.
I just bought one.	Upravo sam kupio jedan.
But that would be small.	Ali to bi bilo malo.
It usually was.	Obično je bilo.
All of you.	Svi vi.
Fast enough, but not so fast.	Dovoljno brzo, ali ne tako brzo.
I never tried again	Nikada više nisam pokušao
I’m not sure, it just happened so fast	Nisam siguran, jednostavno se dogodilo tako brzo
I would never want to know this.	Nikada ne bi htela da ja ovo znam.
I had to do it for myself	Morao sam to učiniti za sebe
And one more thing, one more thing.	I još nešto, još nešto.
That I need to do things.	Da treba da uradim stvari.
I know he loves you	Znam da te voli
He knows how to reach me.	On zna kako da dođe do mene.
Still pretty good.	Još uvijek prilično dobro.
I've always had so many things	Uvek sam imao toliko stvari
I couldn't help myself.	Nisam si mogao pomoći.
I guess he wouldn't be human if he wasn't	Pretpostavljam da ne bi bio čovjek da nije
It's more about that.	Više je o tome.
Or maybe you.	Ili možda ti.
Nobody said he looked good.	Niko nije rekao da izgleda dobro.
He doesn’t have to say or do anything.	Ne mora ništa reći ili učiniti.
I was pretty alone.	Bio sam prilično sam.
I could do a little more	Mogao bih malo više
I just wasn’t happy and he knows it	Jednostavno nisam bio sretan i on to zna
She told me she thought it would be bad here.	Rekla mi je da misli da će ovdje biti loše.
What will they do?	Što će oni.
Both very well.	Oboje veoma dobro.
This is good.	Ovo je dobro.
He said no.	Rekao je ne.
But that’s okay from time to time.	Ali to je u redu s vremena na vrijeme.
I'll come alone	Ja ću doći sam
I think everyone should know the truth	Mislim da bi svi trebali znati istinu
Maybe yours.	Možda i tvoj.
No, isn't it.	Ne, zar to nije.
I knew it was.	Znao sam da jeste.
I was never good at it	Nikad nisam bio dobar u tome
I hope he comes	Nadam se da će doći
I wouldn't get any further tonight	Ne bih stigao dalje večeras
I knew he wasn't waiting for me	Znala sam da me ne čeka
I can't say what it really is	Ne mogu reći šta je to zaista
It is now.	Sada jeste.
He has an appointment.	On ima sastanak.
She will be able to help you.	Ona će ti moći pomoći.
I was glad for that	Bilo mi je drago zbog toga
We had a radio.	Imali smo radio.
He has nothing left.	Nema mu ništa više.
I'm not saying more.	Ne kažem više.
','.	', '.
You will find plenty.	Naći ćete dosta.
It was there before.	Bilo je tamo ranije.
I gave it to him.	Dao sam mu ga.
It's hard to work with.	S tim je teško raditi.
We don't know how much it will be.	Ne znamo koliko će to biti.
I didn't know what was happening to me.	Nisam znao šta mi se dešava.
I think you know that	Mislim da to znaš
All right, she said.	U redu, rekla je.
This is easy to do.	Ovo je lako uraditi.
I should have been here for him	Trebao sam biti ovdje zbog njega
It works very well.	Radi vrlo dobro.
She told him she wasn't.	Rekla mu je da nije.
I want to do it all over again	Želim da uradim sve ponovo
I think he would want that.	Mislim da bi on to želio.
I was very confident	Bio sam veoma siguran u sebe
Apparently there weren't any.	Očigledno ih nije bilo.
I only came for you	Došao sam samo zbog tebe
Everyone did things.	Svi su uradili stvari.
The friend is absolutely right.	Prijatelj je potpuno u pravu.
I couldn't let him do that	Nisam mogao dozvoliti da to uradi
I don't want anything to do with you	Ne želim ništa s tobom
I think they were a very good team.	Mislim da su bili jako dobar tim.
I have to do a better job	Moram da uradim bolji posao
I didn't tell anyone either	Ni ja nikome nisam rekao
I would lose him.	Izgubio bih ga.
Nothing is really happening.	Ništa se zapravo ne dešava.
There is no one.	Ne postoji niko.
But not this time.	Ali ne ovaj put.
I can only hope it is	Mogu samo da se nadam da jeste
I realized you had to stay	Shvatio sam da moraš ostati
He knew it was just a bad day.	Znao je da je to samo loš dan.
She wasn't.	Nije bila.
This has never happened to him before.	Ovo mu se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
I would return that money.	Vratio bih taj novac.
I see them.	Vidim ih.
.	.
It's a game.	To je igra.
He says it won't be good.	Kaže da od toga neće biti dobro.
I'm not there yet.	Ja još nisam tamo.
It just wasn't good.	Jednostavno nije bilo dobro.
I'm so happy you're here !.	Tako sam sretan što si ovdje!.
Now you will stay.	Sada ćeš ostati.
I decided not to tell him	Odlučio sam da mu to ne kažem
She will help me.	Ona će mi pomoći.
I want to see them this time	Želim da ih vidim ovaj put
Gone just like that.	Otišao samo tako.
I need to see her for sure	Moram da je vidim na sigurno
I was your first, and you are mine	Ja sam bio tvoj prvi, a ti si moj
We don't do that.	Ne radimo to.
We're sorry, we're not sorry.	Žao nam je, nije nam žao.
So I want him to be here to see this	Tako želim da bude ovdje da vidi ovo
But he was much more than that.	Ali on je bio mnogo više od toga.
I'm afraid of myself.	Bojim se sebe.
I have a lot of money	Imam dosta novca
No problem here.	Ovdje nema problema.
I'm sure that's true	Siguran sam da je to tačno
I really don't know what the problem is.	Zaista ne znam u čemu je problem.
He told me himself.	On mi je sam rekao.
I did as you said	Uradio sam kao što si rekao
And all of us.	I mi svi.
I saw you.	Video sam te.
That's your money.	To je tvoj novac.
I have something for you.	Imam nešto za tebe.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.	Žao mi je što vam ovo moram reći.
I didn't ask him to	Nisam to tražio od njega
I was right	Bio sam u pravu
And he didn't do what he promised to do.	I nije uradio ono što je obećao da će uraditi.
He wondered if there was anything more to it. 	Pitao se ima li nešto više u tome. 
And I wanted all that stuff	I ja sam htela sve te stvari
I wasn’t sure what, but it was real	Nisam bio siguran šta, ali bilo je stvarno
I have.	Imam.
I know you have to go	Znam da moraš otići
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
It looks good.	Izgleda da izgleda dobro.
And it better be good.	I bolje da bude dobro.
She didn't know what it was.	Nije znala šta je.
You want him here.	Želiš da bude ovdje.
She says so.	Ona tako kaže.
He lost.	Izgubio je.
I want it so much, more than you know	Želim to toliko, više nego što znaš
Now we have it more than before.	Sada imamo to više nego ranije.
I guess he didn't have to	Pretpostavljam da nije morao
I know you had a problem	Znam da si imao problema
Maybe we have.	Možda imamo.
I ask him what he needs	Pitam ga šta mu treba
I can come home alone	Mogu sama doći kući
It could be bad for business.	Moglo bi biti loše za posao.
There are a lot of us.	Ima nas puno.
I should have been here	Trebao sam biti ovdje
I know that's not really happening	Znam da se to zaista ne dešava
He loves us.	On nas voli.
He still didn't know exactly how, but he knew it had happened.	Još nije znao tačno kako, ali je znao da se to dogodilo.
Maybe you like it.	Možda ti se sviđa.
No problem, life happens.	Nema problema, život se dešava.
Everything was as it should be.	Sve je bilo kako treba.
I think that would be a good idea	Mislim da bi to bila dobra ideja
I already told you too much	Već sam ti rekao previše
It works very well this way.	Na ovaj način radi veoma dobro.
I can see how he says it	Mogu da vidim kako on to priča
Which was true.	Što je bila istina.
I don't know anymore.	Ne znam više.
But she knew something was wrong.	Ali znala je da nešto nije u redu.
But we couldn't stay.	Ali nismo mogli ostati.
I told you so much	Rekao sam ti toliko toga
I'm going with you.	Idem s tobom.
I wish I knew why	Voleo bih da znam zašto
Just like you said.	Baš kao što si rekao.
I just didn’t know that until last year	Samo nisam to znao do prošle godine
I immediately began to wonder what was going on	Odmah sam počeo da se pitam šta se dešava
And so on.	I tako dalje.
I still wanted to do it	I dalje sam to želio da uradim
And something has to be done.	I nešto se mora učiniti.
I didn't want to go there	Nisam htela da idem tamo
And more and more.	I sve više.
I think he loves me	Mislim da me voli
A lot.	Mnogo.
I have no idea who he is or something	Nemam pojma ko je on ili tako nešto
I had no idea what to do with it.	Nisam imao pojma šta da radim s tim.
I wouldn't do that.	Ne bih to uradio.
It usually works.	Obično radi.
I think it's better now than never	Mislim da je bolje sada nego nikad
I can tell you for sure	Mogu vam sigurno reći
I have to be ready	Moram biti spreman
I know what you mean	Znam na šta misliš
They had it.	Imali su to.
I said you can't do it alone	Rekao sam da ne možete sami
I can do that too.	Mogu i ja to.
I'm here for you	Ja sam tu za tebe
What she can do may help.	Ono što ona može da uradi možda će pomoći.
I never knew it could be so good	Nikad nisam znao da može biti tako dobro
You will do it.	Ti ćeš to uraditi.
He has it.	Ima ga.
I really wanted to be a father	Zaista sam želeo da budem otac
He wanted something else.	Želio je još nešto.
Maybe I have a few ideas	Možda imam nekoliko ideja
But I can't do that.	Ali ne mogu to da uradim.
It could be good !.	Moglo bi biti dobro!.
No one ever came there.	Tamo niko nikada nije došao.
Everything was just a matter of time.	Sve je bilo samo pitanje vremena.
You also know why it took so long.	Znate i zašto je trebalo toliko dugo.
And it should have been.	I trebalo je da bude.
I love you for a long time	Volim te dugo vremena
And I was good at it.	I ja sam bio dobar u tome.
I could only do so much now	Mogao sam samo toliko da uradim sada
This is and is being done.	Ovo je i radi se.
They knew everything about everyone.	Znali su sve o svima.
That's what I wanted	Tako sam htela
I really want to know who it is	Zaista želim da znam ko je to
I think that's long enough	Mislim da je to dovoljno dugo
I know that.	Znam to.
Like everyone.	Kao i svi.
I don't know anything	Ne znam ništa
You can still do it now.	Još uvijek to možete učiniti sada.
I had no idea how to do it	Nisam imao pojma kako da to uradim
She doesn't know what she's doing, she says.	Ona ne zna šta radi, kaže.
It should have been easy enough.	Trebalo je biti dovoljno lako.
She is only three years old.	Ona ima samo tri godine.
Better to be happy than good.	Bolje biti sretan nego dobar.
I said nothing and went home	Nisam ništa rekao i otišao sam kući
I really hope you can help.	Zaista se nadam da možete pomoći.
I can't say how long he has to live	Ne mogu reći koliko dugo mora da živi
She.	Ona.
And he was pretty good.	I on je bio prilično dobar.
That's exactly what he did.	Upravo je to uradio.
They didn't tell me anything.	Ništa mi nisu rekli.
I came to see what happened to you	Došao sam da vidim šta ti se dogodilo
I know that for sure	Znam to sigurno
That could be something.	To bi moglo biti nešto.
I know him.	Znam ga.
I wish there was someone who could help me	Voleo bih da postoji neko ko mi može pomoći
What happened was real.	Ono što se dogodilo bilo je stvarno.
In fact, you're right.	Zapravo, u pravu si.
He asked me to see him.	Zamolio me je da ga vidim.
Unless you can do something.	Osim ako ne možeš nešto da uradiš.
I didn't ask you to	Nisam to tražio od tebe
And there is nothing wrong with that.	I nema ništa loše u tome.
I mean, it's not right.	Mislim, nije u redu.
We can never go back.	Nikada se ne možemo vratiti.
But that will not happen.	Ali to se neće dogoditi.
He'll probably pick you up tomorrow.	Verovatno će doći po tebe sutra.
That's pretty good.	To je prilično dobro.
I guess he's thirty	Pretpostavljam da ima trideset godina
They won't do it.	Oni to neće uraditi.
I doubt it is.	Sumnjam da jeste.
I have to.	Moram.
But there is something you should know.	Ali postoji nešto što biste trebali znati.
This has never happened before.	To se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
And it looks better.	I bolje izgleda.
I want you, and only you	Želim te, i samo tebe
I knew about those things	Znao sam za te stvari
But it's not.	Ali nije.
Really, that's it.	Zaista, to je to.
That's really hard.	To je stvarno teško.
I know better	Znam na bolje
But nothing more than that.	Ali ništa više od toga.
And in fact, some of it was true.	I u stvari, nešto od toga je bilo istina.
I wonder if that's true	Pitam se da li je to istina
He wanted me here.	Želio me je ovdje.
I actually like that more	To mi se, zapravo, više sviđa
I know what it is so far.	Znam šta je to do sada.
Probably true today.	Vjerovatno je i danas istina.
And he totally knows that's true.	I potpuno zna da je to istina.
I didn't get to anyone.	Nisam stigao do nikoga.
It just doesn’t work.	To jednostavno ne radi.
You know how it goes.	Znaš kako to ide.
They weren't sure yet.	Još nisu bili sigurni.
I knew that was not the case	Znao sam da nije tako
Maybe it's not even true.	Možda čak i nije istina.
Today is today, that is life.	Danas je danas, to je život.
Tell us how we're doing.	Reci nam kako nam ide.
It probably won't be much.	Verovatno neće biti mnogo.
I told him it was.	Rekao sam mu da jeste.
I've never seen them before	Nikad ih prije nisam vidio
She knows it's more than that.	Ona zna da je to više od toga.
Which is happening so much.	Što se toliko dešava.
Now there is one.	Sada postoji jedan.
Yes, not so much.	Da, ne toliko.
You can see the problem here.	Problem možete vidjeti ovdje.
I didn't ask him about it.	Nisam ga pitao o tome.
Or it used to be.	Ili je nekada bilo.
I should have told him to go	Trebao sam mu reći da ide
I really love these things	Zaista volim ove stvari
I need someone to tell me what to do	Treba mi neko da mi kaže šta da radim
But he didn't understand what it was.	Ali nije shvatio šta je to.
We are alone here.	Ovdje smo sami.
There weren't many of them.	Nije ih bilo mnogo.
I mean, you had to.	Mislim, morao si.
We were fine.	Bili smo u redu.
I was there when this happened	Bio sam tamo kada se ovo dogodilo
You know if you are.	Znaš da li jesi.
I really want to be his friend	Zaista želim da mu budem prijatelj
I really had to know.	Zaista sam morao znati.
It would be hard for me not to.	Bilo bi mi teško da ne.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
Why are you doing that.	Zašto to radiš.
And we are there.	I mi smo tamo.
That's a really good question.	To je stvarno dobro pitanje.
Easy for me.	Lako za mene.
But he wasn't sure.	Ali nije bio siguran.
I would not.	Ne bih.
Coming soon.	Uskoro.
probably not.	vjerovatno ne.
How is that true today?	Kako je to danas istina?
He expected that.	To je očekivao.
Nothing will help.	Neće ništa pomoći.
I told him what you did yesterday	Rekao sam mu šta si uradio juče
I don't like it at all	Ne sviđa mi se ni malo
I saw her do it.	Video sam je kako to radi.
Maybe never again.	Možda nikad više.
Is there any help?	Ima li pomoći?
It's not that.	Nije to.
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
He will do anything you want.	On će učiniti sve što želiš.
I always want to be with you	Želim uvijek biti s tobom
I didn't hear him.	Nisam ga čuo.
But only there.	Ali samo tamo.
You can too.	Možeš i ti.
They weren't like you.	Oni nisu bili kao ti.
I have to do something.	Moram nešto učiniti.
I wasn't sure what to say or think	Nisam bio siguran šta da kažem ili mislim
There's a way you do these things.	Postoji način na koji radiš ove stvari.
I'll help.	Ja ću pomoći.
We could .	Mogli bismo .
I won't be happy there either.	Neću biti sretan ni tamo.
I don't see him well	Ne vidim ga dobro
I want it for myself	Želim to za sebe
I'm a little busy	Malo sam zauzet
Or he knows who he is.	Ili on zna ko je.
But he was very tired.	Ali bio je veoma umoran.
Not tonight, but soon.	Ne večeras, ali uskoro.
I realized right away	Shvatio sam odmah
But I have to go.	Ali moram da idem.
He is.	On je.
I asked you for help	Zamolio sam te za pomoć
I didn't even see him again.	Nisam ga više ni vidio.
I know you know who he is, what he is.	Znam da znaš ko je on, šta je on.
Not like before.	Ne kao nekada.
I figured this out.	Shvatio sam ovo.
I see me as he is	Vidim me kao on
I was too.	I ja sam bio.
I haven't decided yet	Još se nisam odlučio
I didn't do it.	Nisam to radio.
She doesn't say, but she will.	Ona ne kaže, ali hoće.
But I really want to know	Ali zaista želim da znam
But she was here now.	Ali sada je bila ovdje.
I didn't go alone.	Nisam otišao sam.
I want him to be right	Želim da bude u pravu
And no one knows why.	I niko ne zna zašto.
They can do many things.	Oni mogu mnogo stvari.
I wonder too.	I ja se pitam.
I couldn’t believe it was real	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je to stvarno
I have to do it a few times	Moram to uraditi nekoliko puta
I want it to be good.	Želim da bude dobro.
I've seen him a few times	Video sam ga nekoliko puta
I want to tell you something.	Želim ti nešto reći.
I won't be	Neću biti
I gave it	Dao sam to
What he said is true.	Ono što je rekao je istina.
I really want to help	Zaista želim pomoći
I know what it is.	Znam šta je to.
He should never have left.	Nikada nije trebao otići.
I'm sure you're the man for the job.	Siguran sam da si ti čovjek za taj posao.
I can not see anything	Ne vidim ništa
He was good at it.	Bio je dobar u tome.
I can't do without you	Ne mogu bez tebe
While it is not easy.	Dok to nije lako.
It's been a long time.	Prilično je dugo.
I need to see a few things	Moram da vidim nekoliko stvari
It was too much.	Bilo je previše.
I think we can do it	Mislim da to možemo
I haven't heard from him in a while	Nisam se čuo s njim neko vrijeme
You said it yourself.	Vi ste to sami rekli.
I saw what happened to him.	Video sam šta mu se dogodilo.
I couldn't do that here	Ne bih to mogao ovdje
That's the idea.	To je ideja.
I see you want me	Vidim da me želiš
Obviously, he wasn't there to see me.	Očigledno, nije bio tu da me vidi.
I'm not going because of you.	Ne idem zbog tebe.
He doesn't have them.	On ih nema.
You did your job.	Uradili ste svoj posao.
For us, that's it.	Za nas je to to.
There is nobody.	Nema nikoga.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
Who is she?.	Ko je ona?.
I just know it is	Samo znam da jeste
I told him no, which is true	Rekao sam mu ne, što je istina
And when he got it.	I kada ga je dobio.
I didn't see anyone	Nisam vidio nikoga
I know that well.	Znam to dobro.
I wasn't sure what to do	Nisam bio siguran šta da radim
He looked glad for that.	Izgledao je drago zbog toga.
I made this for you	Napravio sam ovo za vas
I know why you did it	Znam zašto si to uradio
I've heard that a lot	Čuo sam to dosta
He knew who it was.	Znao je ko je to.
I know something happened to him	Znam da mu se nešto dogodilo
That will not happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
That's what she wanted to be.	To je ona htela da bude.
But it was there.	Ali bilo je tamo.
I don't know if there is a way for someone to do that.	Ne znam da li postoji način da neko to uradi.
She would never want that.	Ona to nikada ne bi htela.
I had better things to do	Imao sam bolje stvari za raditi
As we said earlier.	Kao što smo rekli ranije.
He wasn't even tired.	Nije čak bio ni umoran.
Neither are we.	Nismo ni mi.
The question was quite easy.	Pitanje je bilo prilično lako.
And he left.	I on ode.
Is she.	Je li ona.
He knows the truth.	On zna istinu.
I'm telling you it was hard	Kažem ti da je bilo teško
It's a job.	To je posao.
I didn't get anything	Nisam dobio ništa
This cannot be life.	Ovo ne može biti život.
I mean really a lot.	Mislim zaista puno.
It was really something so far.	Bilo je zaista nešto do sada.
I did all those things	Uradio sam sve te stvari
This is not it.	Ovo nije to.
A lot indeed.	Zaista mnogo.
I'm actually sorry.	Zapravo mi je žao.
Not right now.	Ne trenutno.
I didn't know how to do it	Nisam znao kako to da uradim
No one has done this so far.	Ovo niko do sada nije uradio.
I just need some time.	Samo mi treba malo vremena.
Maybe for us.	Možda za nas.
You won't be here long.	Nećeš biti tu još dugo.
I wasn't sure what he was doing here	Nisam bio siguran šta je on ovdje da radi
We all know someone who has done this.	Svi znamo nekoga ko je ovo uradio.
Yes, he said.	Jeste, rekao je.
I'll tell you what he's good at.	Reći ću ti u čemu je dobar.
But we were in it.	Ali mi smo bili u tome.
I just hope you know what to do	Samo se nadam da znaš šta da radiš
I've seen this before	Video sam ovo ranije
It was not what he expected.	To nije bilo ono što je očekivao.
I want to be what you want me to be	Želim da budem ono što ti želiš da budem
He couldn't say how many there were.	Nije mogao reći koliko ih je bilo.
I could and should have done something	Mogao sam i trebao nešto učiniti
I couldn't really believe it	Nisam mogao baš vjerovati
I've never seen them together	Nikad ih nisam vidio zajedno
Tell us about it.	Reci nam o tome.
I hope it will be of help to you	Nadam se da će vam biti od pomoći
It wouldn't be long.	Ne bi bilo dugo.
It's pretty easy.	Prilično je lako.
I tried to tell myself that everything was fine	Pokušao sam sebi reći da je sve u redu
I guess not	Pretpostavljam da ne bi
I wish it didn't have to be that way	Voleo bih da to ne mora biti tako
I really didn't want this.	Zaista nisam htela ovo.
I hope we are fine	Nadam se da ćemo biti dobro
Just nothing.	Samo ništa.
This never happened.	Ovo se nikada nije dogodilo.
I'm ready for this.	Spreman sam za ovo.
I know what she thinks.	Znam šta ona misli.
But he was right.	Ali bio je u pravu.
I knew something had happened	Znao sam da se nešto dogodilo
Do that.	Uradi to.
There just isn’t much there.	Tamo jednostavno nema puno toga.
I didn't want to tell him anything	Nisam mu htio reći ništa
He really isn't his own.	On zaista nije svoj.
That's how I wanted him	Tako sam ga htela
But she is still a man.	Ali ona je još uvijek čovjek.
What he said was so true.	Ono što je rekao bilo je tako tačno.
But this is not what you want.	Ali ovo nije ono što želite.
I knew you would never come back.	Znao sam da se nikad nećeš vratiti.
I knew what it was about	Znao sam o čemu se radi
I think he's better.	Mislim da mu je bolje.
We were.	Bili smo.
I will never be again	Nikada više neću biti
I can't really say.	Ne mogu stvarno reći.
He talks about himself.	On govori o sebi.
I have to do something	Moram nešto da uradim
Maybe I'll come home soon.	Možda ću uskoro doći kući.
He was not and now he never was.	Nije bio i sada nikada nije bio.
I had no idea you were there	Nisam imao pojma da si tamo
Who he is, really.	Ko je on, zaista.
I've never seen him before.	Nikada ga ranije nisam video.
He went home.	Otišao je kući.
We both knew it wasn’t a good idea right now.	Oboje smo znali da to trenutno nije dobra ideja.
No, you won't.	Ne, nećeš.
He said you won't be able to.	Rekao je da nećeš moći.
And he's just not good enough.	A on jednostavno nije dovoljno dobar.
Never fast enough.	Nikad dovoljno brzo.
Enough, for now.	Dosta, za sada.
You knew they were here.	Znao si da su ovde.
It wasn't mine.	Nije bio moj.
I didn't want him to leave	Nisam želeo da ode
I won't be alone for long	Neću dugo biti sama
That was as certain as it was in itself.	To je bilo sigurno koliko i samo po sebi.
I'm telling you, you don't have to trust him	Kažem ti da mu ne treba vjerovati
I guess it was just a time before this was going to happen.	Pretpostavljam da je to bilo samo vrijeme prije nego što će se ovo dogoditi.
But that will be soon.	Ali to će biti uskoro.
It was so real.	Bilo je tako stvarno.
This may not be what you want.	Ovo možda nije ono što želite.
No people.	Ni ljudi.
But he will.	Ali hoće.
I should have known there was more.	Trebao sam znati da ima još toga.
I heard yesterday	Čuo sam juče
I'll.	Ja ću.
I'll tell you what to say	Reći ću ti šta da kažeš
They said nothing.	Nisu ništa rekli.
He said okay.	Rekao je u redu.
He has to do all that tomorrow.	Sve to mora da uradi sutra.
He didn't know how little he knew.	Nije znao koliko malo zna.
It's easy to work with.	Sa njim je lako raditi.
I had to work fast	Morao sam brzo da radim
And there are many.	A ima ih mnogo.
I gave him something	Dao sam mu nešto
He has to go.	On mora da ide.
Be there, do it.	Bio tamo, uradio to.
I could see it happening	Mogao sam da vidim da se to dešava
And it was.	I bilo je.
You never know.	Nikad ne znaš.
I hope to see you soon	Nadam se da ću te uskoro vidjeti
Too much.	Previše.
I was so glad you did	Bilo mi je tako drago što jeste
I'm doing this for you.	Ja ovo radim za tebe.
I wondered if he knew	Pitao sam se da li zna
This is the first time.	To je prvi put.
I know you can do better.	Znam da možeš bolje.
I would start with that first	Ja bih prvi počeo s tim
I had the right thing last year.	Imao sam pravu stvar prošle godine.
I could see how much more he had to do	Mogao sam da vidim koliko još mora da uradi
I do not see anything wrong with it.	Ne vidim ništa loše u tome.
Just that, nothing more.	Samo to, ništa više.
There was nothing that I could do.	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim.
I want us all to work well together	Želim da svi dobro radimo zajedno
It's just like that.	To je jednostavno tako.
I couldn't do that.	Nisam to mogao uraditi.
We know what the problem is.	Znamo u čemu je problem.
He knew he wanted more.	Znao je da želi više.
But that's your problem.	Ali to je tvoj problem.
I hope you get one too	Nadam se da ćeš i ti dobiti jedan
She knows nothing better.	Ona ne zna ništa bolje.
I have one here	Imam jedan ovde
I certainly didn't expect to find him	Sigurno nisam očekivao da ću ga naći
I don't think that might be helpful	Mislim da to možda neće biti od pomoći
I never seem to be able to do anything right	Čini se da nikad ništa ne mogu učiniti kako treba
I won't be able to help you	Neću ti moći pomoći
I needed to do something more	Trebao sam uraditi nešto više
I work fast.	Radim brzo.
But that was it.	Ali to je bilo to.
He wants to help.	On želi pomoći.
This is going to be hard.	Ovo će biti teško.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
That can't be a good thing.	To ne može biti dobra stvar.
I think you already knew that	Mislim da ste to već znali
I'm not done with you	Nisam završio s tobom
I didn't realize it was a problem	Nisam shvatio da je to problem
Where was that, he wondered.	Gdje je to bilo, pitao se.
But now you can't see it.	Ali sada to ne možete vidjeti.
But it doesn't work.	Ali ne radi.
You need to know this	Treba da znaš ovo
I really didn't want to talk to him	Zaista nisam htio razgovarati s njim
I think we can trust him	Mislim da mu možemo vjerovati
he thought.	mislio je.
I was a man.	Ja sam bio čovjek.
I will not do that.	Neću to učiniti.
I was as surprised as everyone.	Bio sam iznenađen kao i svi.
I love everything he does.	Volim sve što radi.
I can't find him.	Ne mogu ga naći.
I couldn't do this anymore	Nisam mogao ovo više
You have us.	Imaš nas.
I know what we need to do	Znam šta treba da radimo
After a lot.	Po mnogo.
For myself.	Za sebe.
I'm not going for that	Ne idem na to
She just wants to go to school	Ona samo želi da ide u školu
And he did just that.	I uradio je upravo to.
I knew there were people there	Znao sam da tamo ima ljudi
I guess not you either	Pretpostavljam da nisi ni ti
I wish we could.	Voleo bih da možemo.
Yes and no.	Da i ne.
I only do this around the house	Ovo radim samo po kući
Like maybe not anymore.	Kao što možda više nije.
I can not.	Ne mogu.
I didn't want to be there.	Nisam htela da budem tamo.
I think we will be fine.	Mislim da ćemo biti dobro.
I couldn't do that.	Nisam to mogao.
And it could be so.	I to bi moglo biti tako.
He never did.	Nikad nije.
I do not love him.	Ne volim ga.
they told me.	rekli su mi.
This is not.	Ovo nije.
I work there.	Ja tamo radim.
You have to come with us.	Moraš i ti sa nama.
It’s not just knowing what happened there.	Nije samo znati šta se tamo dogodilo.
But this morning let me just say this.	Ali jutros da samo ovo kažem.
Good day.	Dobar dan.
But it doesn't work.	Ali, ne radi.
A lot has happened.	Mnogo toga se dogodilo.
He loves his job.	On voli svoj posao.
I can't believe you didn't hear that last night	Ne mogu vjerovati da to nisi čuo sinoć
I lost what to do	Izgubio sam se šta da radim
How did you do that?	Kako si to uradio?
He couldn't be.	Nije mogao biti.
Your job, you did it last night.	Tvoj posao, uradio si ga sinoć.
I wouldn't even want to	Ne bih ni htela
It takes time.	Treba vremena.
I mean, there was a time when he was	Mislim, bilo je vremena kada je bio
I didn't really want to know.	Nisam baš htela da znam.
He didn't have to do that.	Nije morao to da uradi.
We have tomorrow.	Imamo sutra.
I wondered what she had told him	Pitao sam se šta mu je rekla
I thought of everything she said	Mislio sam na sve što je rekla
It's bad there right now.	Trenutno je loše tamo.
I've never had a problem just with us	Nikada nisam imao problema samo sa nama
I didn't know he was with you	Nisam znao da je sa tobom
Maybe that was the problem.	Možda je to bio problem.
I need help.	Treba mi pomoć.
I wouldn't be here without you	Ne bih bio ovdje da nije bilo tebe
I have to do something.	Moram nešto da uradim.
Almost three times.	Skoro tri puta.
No more.	Nema više.
I've seen it for a long time.	Video sam to dosta vremena.
I'm not his friend anymore.	Nisam mu više prijatelj.
Everyone was in it.	Svi su bili u tome.
That's very much.	To je veoma .
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
I want to talk to you right now.	Želim razgovarati s tobom odmah.
I will never return.	Nikad se neću vratiti.
The truth was it wasn't.	Istina je bila da nije.
That just wasn’t enough.	To jednostavno nije bilo dovoljno.
And not only that we had.	I ne samo to smo imali.
He will come back for this.	On će se vratiti po ovo.
I tried not to think about it	Pokušao sam da ne mislim na to
Some of it, maybe.	Nešto od njega, možda.
I know what we need to do	Znam šta treba da radimo
He didn't even know how to say it.	Nije ni znao kako to da kaže.
I'm afraid there's nothing.	Bojim se da nema ništa.
I wouldn't say that for us or for myself.	Ne bih to rekao ni za nas ni za sebe.
But in fact, that is not the case.	Ali u stvari, to nije tako.
We do everything we can.	Radimo sve što možemo.
He's obviously gone.	Očigledno je otišao.
Very often bad.	Vrlo često loše.
I still couldn’t believe it was happening	Još uvijek nisam mogao vjerovati da se to dešava
Maybe I'll get that one	Možda ću dobiti taj
I hope everyone is fine	Nadam se da su svi dobro
She didn't say that.	Ona to nije rekla.
They had a question.	Imali su pitanje.
And it was, and still is.	I bilo je, i još uvijek je.
I had to do this	Morao sam ovo da uradim
You can stay.	Možete ostati.
It wouldn't be so bad to say yes.	Ne bi bilo tako loše da kažem da.
I'm sure of it	Siguran sam u to
It's hard, you know.	Teško je to, znaš.
Now there is.	Sada ima.
It is unlikely to happen.	Malo je vjerovatno da će se to dogoditi.
You could too.	Mogao bi i ti.
I was surprised he even said so much	Bio sam iznenađen da je čak toliko rekao
I didn't know this.	Nisam znao ovo.
He was sick.	Bilo mu je loše.
I don't know what to tell him.	Ne znam šta da mu kažem.
It's simple, really.	Jednostavno je, zaista.
He seemed as happy as he could be.	Činilo se da je sretan koliko je mogao biti.
She doesn't know we're back together.	Ona ne zna da smo ponovo zajedno.
He saw it too many times.	Video ga je previše puta.
I'm sure there's none of that.	Siguran sam da nema ništa od toga.
I hope you did	Nadam se da si to uradio
This time he understood well.	Ovaj put je dobro shvatio.
I said we would do it	Rekao sam da ćemo to uraditi
I mean, there are a lot of them out there.	Mislim, ima ih puno tamo.
I have to see them.	Moram da ih vidim.
To do more.	Da uradim više.
And now this is what he is to us.	A sada je ovo ono što je on za nas.
I thought she told me everything she knew	Mislio sam da mi je rekla sve što zna
I thought it was obvious	Mislio sam da je očigledno
You can't go home.	Ne možeš kući.
I've never seen anything done so fast.	Nikad nisam video da se nešto uradi tako brzo.
I knew exactly what he was going to say	Tačno sam znao šta će reći
Being human is not human.	Biti čovjek nije čovjek.
I'm sure you already know that	Siguran sam da to već znate
He goes alone.	On ide sam.
We knew you'd come earlier.	Znali smo da ćeš doći ranije.
I know how and why it happens	Znam kako i zašto se to dešava
In fact, that is not true.	U stvari, to nije istina.
I want to go to a meeting	Želim da idem na sastanak
I didn't say that	Nisam to rekao
I am working on that.	Radim na tome.
The question is why this is not happening.	Pitanje je zašto se to ne dešava.
I wasn't too surprised	Nisam bio previše iznenađen
Even if it's not.	Čak i ako nije.
I didn't know it was happening	Nisam znao da se to dešava
If not, it probably won't be.	Ako ne, vjerovatno neće biti.
We know what is likely to happen.	Znamo šta će se verovatno dogoditi.
I didn't see you there either	Nisam te vidio ni tamo
She's not there anymore.	Ona više nije tamo.
It's you.	To si ti.
I was quite surprised	Bio sam prilično iznenađen
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
He would have it.	Imao bi je.
You don't know if they are right or not.	Ne znaš da li su u pravu ili ne.
I've heard that before.	Čuo sam to ranije.
It could be work.	Mogao bi biti posao.
I was nobody.	Ja sam bio niko.
I don't know if it is.	Ne znam da li jeste.
She was not the only one.	Ona nije bila jedina.
They should be helpful.	Oni bi trebali biti od pomoći.
It was easy, he said.	Bilo je lako, rekao je.
I still love her.	I dalje je volim.
I don't know why, really.	Ne znam zašto, zaista.
I’m glad time is never an issue.	Drago mi je da vrijeme nikada nije problem.
And so far that was still true.	I do sada je to još uvijek bilo istina.
This is a very good life	Ovo je veoma dobar život
They should not be a problem.	Oni ne bi trebali biti problem.
I need to talk to him	Moram razgovarati s njim
I still do all that	I dalje sve to radim
Maybe I know what it is.	Možda znam šta je to.
I was surprised too	I ja sam bio iznenađen
He already understood that himself.	On je to već i sam shvatio.
Don't talk anymore.	Ne govori više.
There is no time for that.	Nema vremena za to.
That would be enough.	To bi bilo dovoljno.
I knew exactly what happened	Tačno sam znao šta se dogodilo
It's something simple.	To nešto jednostavno jeste.
You can do it.	Ti to možeš.
I thought he was my father.	Mislio sam da je on moj otac.
Even one was too much.	Čak je i jedan bio previše.
But we will be back.	Ali mi ćemo se vratiti.
But he could.	Ali mogao je.
Nobody talks.	Niko ne govori.
We have a lot of problems here.	Ovdje imamo mnogo problema.
I didn't even try.	Nisam ni pokušao.
More than good.	Više nego dobro.
I doubt that's so.	Sumnjam da je to tako.
I'm ready for anything.	Spreman sam na sve.
I could have been better, be better.	Mogao sam bolje, biti bolji.
I mean, I probably would	Mislim, verovatno bi
Nobody loves them, nobody wants them.	Niko ih ne voli, niko ih ne želi.
That man knew what he wanted.	Taj čovjek je znao šta želi.
You don't know what's going to happen.	Ne znaš šta će se dogoditi.
See if you like it.	Vidi da li ti se sviđa.
I mean the problem	Mislim na problem
They did it on both of us.	Uradili su to na nama oboje.
I would like to think.	Voleo bih da mislim.
I just knew it was him	Samo sam znao da je to on
I didn't see him.	Nisam ga vidio.
I can't say how long	Ne mogu reći koliko dugo
And no one can be like him.	I niko ne može biti kao on.
There is a problem.	Tu je problem.
I tried, like you said	Pokušao sam, kao što si rekao
I can do it alone	Mogu sama
I was looking for you	Tražio sam te
He is just good and loves to help.	On je samo dobar i voli pomoći.
This is not difficult.	Ovo nije teško.
Too much for me.	Previše za mene.
But how little we know.	Ali koliko malo znamo.
Isn't she something.	Nije li ona nešto.
I just got home.	Upravo sam stigao kući.
I've never figured that out before	Nikada ranije nisam to shvatio
I wouldn't be happy	Ne bih bio sretan
And now it works.	I sada to radi.
Yes, it carries the work.	Da, nosi posao.
You know that now.	To sada znate da je to.
You gave it back to me.	Vratio si mi ga.
She didn't, but he did.	Ona nije, ali on jeste.
It can't be.	Ne može biti.
I didn't need them.	Nisu mi trebali.
I could be there for a while	Mogao bih biti tamo neko vrijeme
He can do it.	On to može uraditi.
He can see again.	Može ponovo da vidi.
This time.	Ovaj put.
It was just.	Bilo je samo.
But there were a few.	Ali bilo ih je nekoliko.
It's pretty.	Prilično je.
This can be done very easily.	Ovo se može uraditi vrlo jednostavno.
I can't be sure.	Ne mogu biti siguran.
We do it.	Mi to radimo.
I can't say that anymore either.	Ni ja to više ne mogu reći.
Do it again.	Uradi to ponovo.
I didn't know she told you those things	Nisam znao da ti je rekla te stvari
This is not difficult.	Ovo nije teško.
More and more.	Više i više.
Or a lot.	Ili mnogo toga.
He shouldn't have talked to me like that.	Nije trebao tako razgovarati sa mnom.
My friend lives here now	Ovdje sada živi moj prijatelj
But there isn't.	Ali nema.
I'll tell you what you'd better do.	Reći ću ti šta bi bilo bolje da uradiš.
I want to do better things.	Želim da radim bolje stvari.
That was obvious.	To je bilo očigledno.
I hope this happens	Nadam se da će se ovo dogoditi
It is so.	To je tako.
I was glad to see him	Bilo mi je drago što sam ga vidio
Earlier this year.	Ranije ove godine.
Just the way you want it.	Baš kako želiš.
I promised myself	Obećao sam sebi
She thinks not.	Ona misli da ne.
It's obvious now.	Sada je očigledno.
He really knows.	On zaista zna.
I don't want to be.	Ne želim biti.
And you said no.	A ti si rekao ne.
More power for you.	Više moći za tebe.
Not that your father can help you.	Nije da ti otac može pomoći.
The team should work together.	Tim bi trebao raditi zajedno.
I didn't know what to think about myself	Nisam znao šta da mislim o sebi
I can't tell you anymore	Ne mogu ti više reći
It was never her.	To nikad nije bila ona.
I wouldn't know what to say	Ne bih znao šta da kažem
Do it right.	Uradite to kako treba.
I wish I knew what you would do	Voleo bih da znam šta bi ti uradio
I shouldn't have done this	Nisam trebao ovo da uradim
That was not true at the time.	To u to vrijeme nije bila istina.
But it’s not really about that.	Ali zapravo se ne radi o tome.
I didn't think beyond that	Nisam mislio dalje od toga
It won't work.	To neće raditi.
Good day to all.	Dobar dan svima.
You have to do a lot of things.	Moraš da uradiš mnogo stvari.
But that doesn't tell me anything.	Ali to mi ništa ne govori.
I was there alone with no money	Bio sam tamo sam bez novca
I like it more than not	Više mi se nego sviđa
I see no reason why that should be the case.	Ne vidim razlog zašto bi to bilo tako.
I had to see them	Morao sam da ih vidim
You can't tell me to do anything.	Ne možeš mi reći da radim ništa.
I shouldn't have come back	Nisam se trebao vratiti
I have to be here with you.	Moram biti ovdje sa tobom.
It just couldn't be that way.	Samo što nije moglo biti tako.
You look good	Izgledaš dobro
He understood properly	Shvatio je kako treba
Now we have to do it more than ever.	Sada to moramo učiniti više nego ikada.
.	.
You don’t want any of that.	Ne želite ništa od toga.
I didn't need a life there	Nije mi trebao život tamo
A lot of people are at the moment	Mnogo ljudi je trenutno
Obviously you didn't.	Očigledno niste.
And he does everything for money.	I radi sve za novac.
I can't really believe it	Ne mogu stvarno vjerovati
And he.	I on .
I wish everyone knew that	Voleo bih da svi to znaju
They never were.	Nikada nisu bili.
That's exactly what I did to myself last week	Upravo sam to sebi uradio prošle sedmice
And that should be said today.	I to bi trebalo reći danas.
I just hope it's good	Samo se nadam da je dobro
I didn't see or hear anything last night	Sinoć nisam ništa ni vidio ni čuo
It must be a good job today.	Mora biti dobar posao i danas.
You should really talk to him.	Zaista bi trebao razgovarati s njim.
I just didn't get it	Jednostavno nisam to shvatio
I knew he was a good person	Znao sam da je dobra osoba
I really have nothing	Zaista nemam ništa
He likes the idea.	Sviđa mu se ideja.
Do that.	Uradi to.
I didn't have to see any more.	Nisam morao da vidim više.
Your life is yours.	Tvoj život je tvoj.
You can come back to us.	Možete nam se vratiti.
It was, in fact, a bad time.	To je, u stvari, bilo loše vrijeme.
Why? 	Zašto?
I thought there was no one	Mislio sam da nema nikoga
I see no reason why it should not be.	Ne vidim razlog zašto ga ne bi bilo.
I need time for myself	Treba mi vremena za sebe
That's my father.	To je moj otac.
I'm the only one who says where she is	Ja sam jedini koji ona govori gdje je
It shouldn't have been.	Nije trebalo biti.
He did his best.	Dao je sve od sebe.
We don't know anything yet.	Ne znamo još ništa.
We need to see more of him, don't we.	Moramo ga vidjeti više, ne moramo.
I needed this so much.	Ovo mi je toliko trebalo.
I didn't lose everything.	Nisam sve izgubio.
I love you, you know that	Volim te, znaš to
Not immediately, but soon enough.	Ne odmah, ali dovoljno brzo.
I was not well	Nije mi bilo dobro
And just so you know, we're here.	I da znate, tu smo.
I just won't do it.	Jednostavno neću to učiniti.
There are so many of them.	Toliko ga je.
But it probably is.	Ali vjerovatno je i to.
How old can it be.	Koliko godina može biti.
I want to say how it is	Želim da kažem kako jeste
It will probably happen soon.	Vjerovatno će se to uskoro dogoditi.
And he knows it.	I on to zna.
I haven't seen him in a few days	Nisam ga više vidio nekoliko dana
I was really bad at it	Bio sam jako loš u tome
Let me ask you this.	Da te pitam ovo.
For fun.	Za zabavu.
But now there is nothing we can do about it.	Ali sada tu ništa ne možemo učiniti.
I want him here with me	Želim ga ovdje sa mnom
The reason for a lot.	Razlog za mnogo toga.
I didn't even hear he had arrived	Nisam ni čuo da je stigao
You better be there too.	Bolje da si i ti tamo.
Actually, you know.	U stvari, znaš.
Obviously he will.	Očigledno hoće.
I like to be at home	Volim biti kod kuće
You brought her back.	Vratio si je.
In time.	U vrijeme.
I thought you might want to know	Mislio sam da bi želeo da znaš
I never have to go back	Nikad se ne moram vratiti
Anything can be done.	Sve se može uraditi.
I mean, obviously you like it	Mislim, očigledno je da ti se sviđa
I hope everything gets better soon.	Nadam se da će uskoro sve biti bolje.
So they know you mean business.	Tako da znaju da misliš na posao.
I don't think it works.	Mislim da ne radi.
I think we would be a good team	Mislim da bismo bili dobar tim
To be able to do something like that.	Da bi mogao da uradiš tako nešto.
I need a few more times or what not	Treba mi još nekoliko puta ili šta ne
I can't see her properly.	Ne mogu da je vidim kako treba.
I'm sure he had his way	Siguran sam da je imao svoj način
Nothing is too much of a problem.	Ništa nije previše problema.
You know this could be good for me.	Znaš da bi ovo moglo biti dobro za mene.
I knew it, she knew it	Ja sam to znala, ona je to znala
I knew it couldn't be	Znao sam da ne može biti
I thought he was already gone	Mislio sam da je već otišao
He could play everything we needed	Mogao je da igra sve da nam treba
I need to know how you did this	Moram da znam kako si ovo uradio
I didn't expect to be	Nisam očekivao da ću biti
It was never me.	To nikad nisam bio ja.
It just doesn't happen.	To se jednostavno ne dešava.
This is good.	Ovo je dobro.
I can’t believe it works so fast	Ne mogu vjerovati da tako brzo radi
But he wouldn't see it that way.	Ali on to ne bi vidio na ovaj način.
But you did your best.	Ali dao si sve od sebe.
So this could happen.	Tako da bi se ovo moglo dogoditi.
My friend works there	Tamo radi moj prijatelj
I'll stay here.	Ja ću ostati ovdje.
In fact, that would be a good thing.	U stvari, to bi bila dobra stvar.
I said no and asked him what he had	Rekao sam ne i pitao ga šta ima
But she just wasn't there.	Ali ona jednostavno nije bila tamo.
You were good that way.	Bio si dobar na taj način.
It couldn't be real.	Nije moglo biti stvarno.
I don't see anything anymore.	Ne vidim više ništa.
I need to know how fast you want it	Moram da znam koliko brzo to želiš
We can't be.	Ne možemo biti.
I can't say what it was	Ne mogu reći šta je to bilo
I had to do something now	Morao sam nešto da uradim sada
I haven't heard anything yet	Nisam još ništa čuo
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to istina.
It was always a problem.	Uvek je bio problem.
But I don't know how to say it	Ali ne znam kako da to kažem
I know you know what to do	Znam da znaš šta treba da radiš
He was not pleased.	Nije mu bilo drago.
There's nothing more I can do for him	Ne mogu više ništa učiniti za njega
Do it three times.	Uradite tri puta.
We don't do it like that here.	Mi to ovde ne radimo tako.
I can't even tell you	Ne mogu vam ni reći
Too many people know about us now. 	Previše ljudi sada zna za nas. 
I didn't even want to	Nisam ni htela
I will never return.	Nikad se neću vratiti.
It's just life.	To je samo život.
I like this one a lot	Ovaj mi se mnogo sviđa
I expected better	Očekivao sam bolje
I can tell you the truth	Mogu ti reći istinu
It almost seems that way.	Skoro da izgleda tako.
I know he will.	Znam da hoće.
They could have helped me, but they never did.	Mogli su mi pomoći, ali nikad nisu.
I know what she's doing	Znam šta ona radi
He has no idea how to do it.	On nema pojma kako to da uradi.
It's hard to say.	Teško je reći.
But now it is no more.	Ali sada više nije.
Too many years.	Previše godina.
You can believe me or not.	Možete mi vjerovati ili ne.
I loved having my own money	Voleo sam da imam svoj novac
But he couldn't help himself.	Ali nije si mogao pomoći.
I've never told anyone about this before	Nikada ranije nisam nikome rekao za ovo
I was so happy that year	Bio sam tako sretan te godine
This one wasn't.	Ovaj nije bio.
He understood quickly.	Brzo je shvatio.
I think you can go home now	Mislim da sada možeš kući
I'm not sure anyone knows.	Nisam siguran da neko zna.
I want her.	Želim je.
Have a nice trip.	Sretan put.
I saw him this afternoon.	Video sam ga danas popodne.
He said he should eat.	Rekao je da treba da jede.
I only have you both	Imam samo vas oboje
I thought so too.	I ja sam tako mislio.
I am ready for anything that may come	Spreman sam na sve što može doći
I think it would be so good for you	Mislim da bi bio tako dobar za tebe
It's only a matter of time.	Samo je pitanje vremena.
I could meet you there too.	Mogao bih se naći i sa tobom tamo.
I don't know why not.	Ne znam zašto nije.
As far as I know.	Koliko ja znam.
This was probably true.	Ovo je vjerovatno bilo tačno.
I could actually bring it back	Zapravo bih to mogao vratiti
That's my father.	To je moj otac.
But it was still as it was.	Ali i dalje je bilo kako je bilo.
Today it is.	Danas jeste.
He is not.	On nije.
I pretty much doubt this	Prilično sumnjam u ovo
Just a few days ago, actually.	Prije samo nekoliko dana, zapravo.
I left, but only for a while.	Otišao sam, ali samo na malo.
I easily admitted that	To sam lako priznao
I think maybe he's right	Mislim da je možda u pravu
I don't need that.	Ne treba mi to.
And it's hard.	I teško je.
But you're wrong.	Ali nisi u pravu.
Very little indeed.	Zaista vrlo malo.
I really hope you're right	Stvarno se nadam da si u pravu
I was looking for a friend	Tražio sam prijatelja
It won't help you tell me that.	Neće ti pomoći da mi to kažeš.
Time was money.	Vrijeme je bilo novac.
I really wish you hadn't told me that	Zaista bih volio da mi to nisi rekao
You have done well so far.	Sve ste dobro uradili do sada.
Obviously, he doesn't have to go to work today.	Očigledno, on danas ne mora na posao.
I guess he's right.	Pretpostavljam da je u pravu.
I didn't know if you knew	Nisam znao da li znaš
I was no longer happy	Nisam više bio sretan
I can't see him.	Ne mogu ga vidjeti.
I haven't been here before	Nisam bio ovdje prije
I'm so sorry this happened.	Jako mi je žao što se to dogodilo.
No, it was very bad.	Ne, bilo je mnogo loše.
That is more than enough.	To je više nego dovoljno.
I wonder when that happened	Pitam se kada se to dogodilo
He did what he could.	Uradio je šta je mogao.
He is not the story of the week.	On nije priča sedmice.
I didn’t even expect that to happen	Nisam ni očekivao da će se to dogoditi
She certainly didn't want to say anything.	Ona sigurno nije htela ništa da kaže.
They didn't do it.	Oni to nisu uradili.
He would need time for this.	Trebalo bi mu vremena za ovo.
I should have been there	Trebao sam biti tamo
I knew it was good.	Znao sam da je dobro.
They will trust him.	Oni će mu vjerovati.
We need this.	Ovo nam treba.
More on that, he said.	Više o tome, rekao je.
That's what he should do.	To bi trebalo da uradi.
I didn’t know anything about it until it happened	Nisam znao ništa o tome sve dok se to nije dogodilo
We are here.	Tu smo.
I didn't say anything.	Nisam ništa rekao.
I have no idea why that is	Nemam pojma zašto je to tako
I always knew they were alive	Uvek sam znao da su živi
All true so far.	Sve istina do sada.
That's something.	To je nešto.
Maybe I was more of someone.	Možda sam više bio neko.
He is one of us now.	On je sada jedan od nas.
What used to be wrong is no more.	Ono što je nekada bilo u redu više nije.
She really is.	Ona zaista jeste.
I've never been.	Nikad nisam bio.
I think it exists.	Mislim da to postoji.
I want them all here now	Želim ih sve ovdje odmah
It took a lot better.	Trebalo je mnogo bolje.
She said that.	Ona je to rekla.
I really need to talk to you.	Zaista moram razgovarati s tobom.
But he couldn't do that.	Ali on to nije mogao.
I think this time is good	Mislim da je ovo vrijeme dobro
Maybe she used to be.	Možda je nekada i bila.
If he's gone.	Ako je otišao.
I hope it will be good for both of us	Nadam se da će biti dobro za oboje
You couldn't give.	Nisi mogao dati.
I'm so glad you came when you came	Tako mi je drago što si došao kad si došao
He used to be the one who did it.	On je nekada bio taj koji je to radio.
I just have to be busy	Samo moram biti zauzet
I'm glad you're here !.	Drago mi je što ste ovdje!.
Which is good.	Što je dobro.
I think you're right.	Mislim da si u pravu.
And is this.	I je li ovo.
I'm doing something for you, you do something for me	Ja radim nešto za tebe, ti uradi nešto za mene
I didn't even start.	Nisam ni počeo.
Everything was as it should be.	Sve je bilo kako treba.
I wasn't expecting you	Nisam te očekivao
A lot is happening.	Mnogo toga se dešava.
No, he said.	Ne, rekao je.
You didn't have to be there.	Nisi morao biti tamo.
I have no problem not knowing	Nemam problem da ne znam
I could see what was going on here	Mogao sam da vidim šta se ovde dešava
I need a lot of time alone	Treba mi puno vremena sam
It wasn't exactly a question of when he said them.	Nije baš bilo pitanje kada ih je rekao.
This is your first time.	Ovo ti je prvi put.
I like my job.	Sviđa mi se posao.
There was nothing that I could do	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim
Even more than a few times.	Čak i više od nekoliko puta.
I can't do that anymore	Ne mogu to više
I'm almost sorry	Skoro da mi je žao
She loves what she does.	Ona voli ono što radi.
I didn't want to love you	Nisam htela da te volim
Why would she.	Zašto bi ona.
In fact, we can say more.	U stvari, možemo reći više.
I wanted my life	Želeo sam svoj život
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
It just doesn't work.	To jednostavno ne radi.
But that was supposed to be it.	Ali to je trebalo biti to.
I wasn’t even sure if they were there or not	Nisam čak ni bio siguran da li su tu ili ne
About the house.	O kući.
I never did, I never will.	Nikada nisam, nikad neću.
It's good, he said.	Dobro je, rekao je.
I can help you.	Mogu ti pomoći.
I can't love him.	Ne mogu da ga volim.
Nobody said that	Niko nije rekao da je tako
That's my idea and my video.	To je moja ideja i moj video.
I have to want something	Moram nešto da želim
And this was good.	I ovo je bilo dobro.
I can do that if you want	Mogu to da uradim ako želiš
Everything is now.	Sve je sada.
That's how you do it.	Tako to radite.
Do what you want to me.	Radi mi šta hoćeš.
I was thinking of you both today.	Danas sam mislio na vas oboje.
I didn't want to, really	Nisam htela, zaista
He didn't even know what he was doing, not really.	Nije ni znao šta radi, ne baš.
I just started doing what was good for me.	Upravo sam počeo da radim ono što mi je bilo dobro.
Now they were like a team.	Sada su bili kao tim.
Behind me.	I za mene.
It's probably hard for both of us.	Verovatno je teško za oboje.
He works here and there.	Radi tu i tamo.
I had no idea who he was.	Nisam imao pojma ko je on.
I wasn't sure why	Nisam bio siguran zašto
I know what I need to do	Znam šta treba da uradim
I can't go on without him	Ne mogu dalje bez njega
I know she's wanted this for so long	Znam da je htela ovo tako dugo
I didn't know who he was	Nisam znao ko je on
Only three days left.	Još samo tri dana.
That says something	To nešto govori
You are my team.	Ti si moj tim.
I was three at the time	Imao sam tri godine u to vrijeme
You know, people.	Znate, ljudi.
Do a good job.	Uradite dobar posao.
Where she was last night.	Gdje je bila sinoć.
I think that would be it.	Mislim da bi to bilo to.
That would be good enough.	To bi bilo dovoljno dobro.
It can be both.	Može biti oboje.
I would love to do that	Voleo bih to da uradim
He could have done this well.	Mogao je da uradi ovo dobro.
I just like to say that	Samo volim to da kažem
I asked who all lived here	Pitao sam ko sve živi ovdje
She loves it.	Ona to voli.
I had to know more	Morao sam znati više
He can do things whenever he wants.	On može da radi stvari kada želi.
We all knew that.	Svi smo to znali.
He wasn't happy to see her.	Nije mu bilo drago što je vidi.
I know you want her	Znam da je želiš
So that .	Tako da .
He was there, he was there.	Bio je tamo, bio je tamo.
I didn't expect it to be	Nisam očekivao da ima
Or he has been so far.	Ili je bio do sada.
He's not that at all.	On to uopšte nije.
Good for him.	Dobro za njega.
He seemed glad to see me.	Činilo se da mu je drago što me vidi.
Maybe you too.	Možda i ti.
He had to come, and he came.	Došao je morao, i došao je.
Maybe so.	Možda je tako.
I just wanted it to be easy for now.	Samo sam želio da bude jednostavno za sada.
I had no idea why that could be	Nisam imao pojma zašto bi to moglo biti
It has never been so bad again.	Nikad više nije bilo tako loše.
I need more than that	Treba mi više od toga
As long as he.	Sve dok on.
They were getting better and better	Bili su sve bolji i bolji
I wanted more time with you.	Želeo sam više vremena sa tobom.
I don't want them.	Ne želim ih.
I wish you hadn't come.	Voleo bih da nisi došao.
You are the problem.	Vi ste problem.
He might be gone by now.	Do sada je možda otišao.
I can't believe how many there are	Ne mogu vjerovati koliko ih ima
You can do it yourself.	Možete to učiniti sami.
They couldn't help it.	Nisu mogli pomoći.
I wonder what they are	Pitam se šta su oni
It was nothing he knew too well.	Bilo je to ništa što je previše dobro znao.
I just didn’t have it.	Jednostavno ga nisam imao.
Something to do.	Nešto za uraditi.
Maybe someone was there.	Možda je tamo neko bio.
I couldn't go on the trip.	Nisam mogao ići na put.
How long have you been doing this? 	Koliko dugo to radite?
We have to tell you a few things.	Moramo vam reći nekoliko stvari.
He thinks a lot about you.	On mnogo misli na tebe.
I know what your father could do	Znam šta bi tvoj otac mogao da uradi
I can't be human again	Ne mogu ponovo biti čovjek
She is only three months old.	Ona ima samo tri mjeseca.
I thought he knew better	Mislio sam da zna bolje
I wasn't sure why we were here	Nisam bio siguran zašto smo ovdje
I don't see it that way.	Ja to ne vidim tako.
I won't tell him what you said	Neću mu reći šta si rekao
But it doesn't work very well.	Ali ne radi baš.
A man of thirty, perhaps.	Čovjek od trideset, možda.
You're not too busy.	Nisi previše zauzet.
I couldn't find anything from him	Nisam mogao naći ništa od njega
I never asked.	Nikad nisam pitao.
I just didn't realize how much	Samo nisam shvatio koliko
But not me.	Ali ne ja.
I know you heard	Znam da si čuo
I'm not in myself anymore	Nisam više u sebi
Not sure how much.	Nije siguran koliko.
I want you to know.	Želim da znaš.
Truth to power.	Istina do moći.
That's not a good job.	To nije dobar posao.
It's that bad.	Toliko je loše.
And you'd be better off.	I bolje bi ti bilo.
And he no longer knew what to do.	I više nije znao šta da radi.
I'm pretty good.	Ja sam prilično dobro.
I hope so soon.	Nadam se da će uskoro.
Like this one.	Kao ovaj.
It was as it should be.	Bilo je kako treba.
I don't know how to say that.	Ne znam kako da to kažem.
Or you probably don’t know.	Ili vjerovatno ne znate.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
He never said much.	Nikad nije rekao mnogo.
I have a friend who lives there	Imam prijatelja koji tamo živi
Besides.	Osim toga.
I thought you would be.	Mislio sam da ćeš biti.
I have for some time	Imam već neko vrijeme
We should all be given more time.	Svi bi mi trebali dati više vremena.
Not now, not at any time.	Ne sada, ni u bilo koje vrijeme.
You won't have to say anything.	Nećeš morati ništa da kažeš.
This is our first.	Ovo nam je prvi.
I've had enough for one day	Dosta mi je za jedan dan
He doesn't look well either.	Ni on ne izgleda dobro.
We have enough.	Imamo dovoljno malo.
There is no one here.	Ovde nema nikoga.
I don't even know what to say.	Ne znam ni šta da kažem.
Maybe it's all true.	Možda je sve istina.
I think she probably knew why	Mislim da je verovatno znala zašto
I think this is a good thing	Mislim da je ovo dobra stvar
I still had no idea what to do	Još uvek nisam imao pojma šta da radim
I could never allow it to be so bad again	Nikada više ne bih mogao dozvoliti da bude tako loše
No one has ever heard of it.	Niko nikada nije čuo za to.
And it should have.	I trebalo je.
I won't tell anyone you were here	Neću nikome reći da ste bili ovdje
I have to go with you	Moram da idem sa tobom
He will say anything.	Reći će bilo šta.
I wasn’t sure when that happened	Nisam bio siguran kada se to dogodilo
I know more than he thinks	Znam više nego što on misli
I saw it myself.	Sam sam to video.
One of us always leaves, you know.	Jedan od nas uvek ode, znaš.
It's not really you.	To zapravo nisi ti.
Maybe there's something to it.	Možda ima nešto u tome.
They would be here.	Bili bi ovdje.
I won't be back yet	Neću se još vratiti
I guess you'll be fine here	Pretpostavljam da ćeš biti dobro ovdje
Looks like it is.	Izgleda da jeste.
I think we can still help him	Mislim da mu još možemo pomoći
It was nothing to him.	Za njega to nije bilo ništa.
I asked him what day it was.	Pitao sam ga koji je dan.
I'm just not sure who would want that	Samo nisam siguran ko bi to želeo
I just wish he ate more	Samo bih volio da jede više
But what do I know.	Ali šta ja znam.
But I have to go.	Ali moram da idem.
I didn't know where, how, she lived	Nisam znao gdje, kako, ona živi
We're fine, we're fine.	Dobro smo, dobro smo.
Or he made time.	Ili je napravio vrijeme.
And it looks better.	I izgleda bolje.
Very very difficult.	Veoma jako teško.
I didn't see anything wrong with that	Nisam vidio ništa loše u tome
A lot of things could happen	Moglo bi se dogoditi puno stvari
I'll buy everything.	Ja ću kupiti sve.
I mean, everything.	Mislim, sve.
It should have been.	Trebalo je biti.
It couldn't be.	To nije moglo biti.
But it couldn't be.	Ali to nije moglo biti.
This one works, this one doesn't.	Ovaj radi, ovaj ne.
I shouldn't have said that.	Nisam to trebao reći.
It is so.	To je tako.
Or this week.	Ili ove sedmice.
I'm sorry this happened to you	Žao mi je što ti se to dogodilo
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Ali tu ništa ne možemo učiniti.
I've had it for a few years.	Imam ga nekoliko godina.
We do it together.	To radimo zajedno.
People know it's not.	Ljudi znaju da nije.
I hope you find what you need.	Nadam se da ćeš naći ono što ti treba.
I hope that doesn't happen	Nadam se da do toga neće doći
This is us.	Ovo smo mi.
I didn't really understand that	Nisam to stvarno shvatio
I wasn't good at it	Nisam bio dobar u tome
I'm no one.	Ja sam niko.
I gave it back to him	Vratio sam mu ga
You didn't do it.	Nisi to uradio.
Tonight if you can.	Večeras ako možeš.
I never thought that would happen to me	Nikad nisam mislio da će mi se to dogoditi
I knew who she really was	Znao sam ko je ona zapravo
You can too.	I ti možeš.
Like him.	Kao on.
I really like it	Jako mi se sviđa
I think we'll go home soon	Mislim da ćemo uskoro ići kući
And not real life.	A ne pravi život.
I can say that something is wrong	Mogu reći da nešto nije u redu
I was thinking about last night	Mislio sam na sinoć
To love him.	Da ga volim.
Maybe I need more time.	Možda mi treba više vremena.
I can work from home	Mogu raditi od kuće
Maybe that's so.	Možda je to tako.
He was my friend.	Bio mi je prijatelj.
It's time to go.	Vrijeme je da idem.
I hope it still works.	Nadam se da i dalje radi.
It wasn't enough for me	Nije mi bilo dovoljno
We have to do this.	Moramo ovo da uradimo.
I shouldn't have been surprised	Nisam trebao biti iznenađen
We won't do it for you.	Nećemo to učiniti za vas.
I asked again.	pitao sam ponovo.
This is a lot.	Ovo je mnogo.
I can't trust any of you	Ne mogu vjerovati nikome od vas
There is nothing without it.	Nije ništa bez toga.
It took a long time.	Trebalo je dosta vremena.
That was true.	To je bilo tačno.
And that.	I to.
So far, so simple.	Za sada, tako jednostavno.
He was happy happy.	Bio je sretan sretan.
It will not and cannot work.	Neće i ne može raditi.
You can work with him.	Možete raditi s njim.
I'll come.	Doći ću.
I have to go now	Moram da idem sada
Maybe it's not good either.	Možda nije ni dobro.
I'm.	Ja sam.
I wish they had done it for the first time.	Voleo bi da su to uradili prvi put.
It's good to talk.	Dobro je razgovarati.
Obviously he doesn't tell you everything.	Očigledno vam ne govori sve.
I still have no idea.	Još uvijek nemam ideja.
I know him very well	Znam ga jako dobro
It was just this.	Bilo je samo ovo.
Right.	Upravo.
There is no time to wonder about that.	Nema vremena da se pitam o tome.
He said nothing.	Nije rekao ništa.
I don't like it when he does that	Ne volim kad to radi
Everything, everything, everything.	Sve, sve, sve.
I did it, and he's waiting for you.	Ja sam to uradio, i on te čeka.
I like it a little more.	Sviđa mi se malo više.
Yes, they had many friends.	Da, imali su mnogo prijatelja.
He gave us something we had never had before	Dao nam je nešto što nikada ranije nismo imali
More than that.	Više od toga.
I couldn't be there	Nisam mogao biti tamo
If you like it.	Ako ti se sviđa.
I didn't come back.	Nisam se vratio.
I know it's not what you like	Znam da nije ono što ti se sviđa
I'm not going.	Ja ne idem.
I wonder if that is always the case.	Pitam se da li je uvijek tako.
That's just not right.	To jednostavno nije u redu.
I mean, it was obvious	Mislim, bilo je očigledno
I shouldn't have done that	Nisam to trebao učiniti
Pretty good job !.	Prilično dobar posao!.
I think that's a good idea	Mislim da je to dobra ideja
Tell me what is true and what is not.	Reci mi šta je istina, a šta nije.
No one could find him.	Niko ga nije mogao naći.
And they didn't.	I nisu.
The car was safe.	Auto je bio siguran.
said my father.	rekao je moj otac.
You can help me.	Ti mi možeš pomoći.
I know you were with him	Znam da si bila sa njim
You haven't seen him, you can't.	Nisi ga vidio, ne možeš.
Or something like that.	Ili tako nešto.
I didn't expect this	Nisam ovo očekivao
Do what you will do well.	Radite ono što ćete učiniti dobro.
That's exactly what she told me.	Upravo to mi je rekla.
I just didn't know what was true	Samo nisam znao šta je tačno
I didn't want to love him	Nisam htela da ga volim
That will not happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
I told him something	Rekao sam mu nešto
I told you that earlier	Rekao sam ti to ranije
I still haven't, not completely	I dalje nisam, ne potpuno
But you are one.	Ali ti si jedan.
Anything.	Bilo šta.
I hope you will help me	Nadam se da ćeš mi pomoći
I would hear.	Čuo bih.
I didn’t expect that to happen	Nisam očekivao da će se to dogoditi
It didn't take too well.	Nije trebalo previše dobro.
I already told myself that.	Već sam to rekao sebi.
It's all true.	Sve je to istina.
I am completely surprised	Potpuno sam iznenađen
I did it and got this	Uradio sam to i dobio ovo
They did it here.	Oni su to uradili ovde.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
It's pretty easy.	To je prilično lako.
And she was.	I bila je.
It's not just me anymore	Nisam više samo ja
I just didn't want to	Jednostavno nisam htela
That's the problem.	To je problem.
Almost all, but not all.	Skoro svi, ali ne svi.
I hope someone knows what to do	Nadam se da neko zna šta da radi
Nobody said too much.	Niko nije rekao previše.
Get away from him.	Dalje od njega.
I have no idea what the problem is.	Nemam pojma u čemu je problem.
I bought it for myself	Kupio sam ga za sebe
This was difficult.	Ovo je bilo teško.
There is nothing for that now.	Za to sada nema ništa.
I know it’s not always easy.	Znam da to nije uvijek lako.
This is how it should be.	Ovo je kako treba da bude.
That's exactly it.	To je upravo to.
I had seen him before, that was for sure	Vidio sam ga ranije, to je bilo sigurno
Three out of three.	Tri od tri.
They had a good meeting.	Imali su dobar sastanak.
Maybe I told you.	Možda sam ti rekao.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
I'm not doing anything	Ne radim ništa
It's really that easy.	To je zaista tako lako.
I didn't want them there	Nisam ih želio tamo
I don't think so.	Čini mi se da nisam.
I don't want to be anything.	Ne želim da budem ništa.
It was okay.	Bilo je u redu.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
I better tell you.	Bolje je da ti kažem.
I shouldn't have said that much	Nisam trebao reći toliko
I work harder, maybe because of that	Radim više, možda zbog toga
I don't even know how to do it.	Ne znam ni kako bi to uradio.
I had no money.	Nisam imao novca.
Not just for me, but for everyone.	Ne samo za mene, nego za sve.
For now, he may be right.	Za sada je možda u pravu.
I think he's thinking of you	Mislim da misli na tebe
He had no idea what was going on here.	Nije imao pojma šta se ovde dešava.
I wasn't even here.	Nisam ni bio ovdje.
I told you earlier it wasn't	Rekao sam ti ranije da nije
The truth is how he sees it.	Istina kako je on to vidi.
You have it.	Imaš ga.
She knew what was happening.	Znala je šta se dešava.
I should help him.	Trebao bih mu pomoći.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
That would really be something.	To bi zaista bilo nešto.
We only know that there were more of us before.	Znamo samo da nas je prije bilo više.
I was really sorry for him	Zaista mi ga je bilo žao
He didn't say that.	On to nije rekao.
I hope you all come	Nadam se da ćete svi doći
Now it works.	Sada radi.
Anything is better than doing nothing.	Bilo šta je bolje nego ništa ne raditi.
He's not here either.	Ni on nije ovde.
I can't see him, not yet	Ne mogu da ga vidim, ne još
It's been years.	Prošle su godine.
I still have to stay home	Još uvijek moram ostati kod kuće
But that's good.	Ali to je dobro.
I like that you want me so much	Sviđa mi se što me toliko želiš
It couldn't be helped.	Nije se moglo pomoći.
And it can be done right away.	I to se može uraditi odmah.
It was only once, wasn't it.	Bio je to samo jedan put, zar ne.
He will get it.	On će to dobiti.
And no further.	I nema dalje.
I have seen her many times	Vidio sam je mnogo puta
I just wanted to see her	Samo sam je htio vidjeti
I loved her, you know	Voleo sam je, znaš
But I doubt you can give me one	Ali sumnjam da mi možeš dati jedan
Are you the one.	Jesi li ti taj.
We like it here.	Sviđa nam se ovdje.
Besides, he was actually very good.	Osim toga, on je zapravo bio jako dobar.
He knew it was true.	Znao je da je to istina.
He said he probably did.	Rekao je da verovatno jeste.
All that stuff.	Sve te stvari.
I won't even be here	Neću ni biti ovdje
She was good to us.	Bila je dobra prema nama.
I have to go to work	Moram na posao
He doesn't like me much either.	Ni on me mnogo ne voli.
I have no problem with that.	Nemam problema sa tim.
I know what's going on.	Znam šta se dešava.
He would be really good at it.	Bio bi stvarno dobar u tome.
I thought there was something wrong with you.	Mislio sam da nešto nije u redu s tobom.
I didn't know for sure	Nisam znao za sigurno
I do not know how.	Ne znam kako.
That was not the only reason.	To nije bio jedini razlog.
And nothing happens.	I ništa se ne dešava.
I didn't know he was there	Nisam znao da je tamo
But that was only for a while.	Ali to je bilo samo neko vrijeme.
I do that from time to time.	Ja to radim s vremena na vrijeme.
What is the problem?.	Šta je problem?.
I think you're very sorry	Mislim da ti je veoma žao
It can't.	To ne može.
Maybe that will help	Možda će to pomoći
It's obvious why you're here.	Očigledno je zašto ste ovde.
Something is happening, and soon.	Nešto se dešava, i to uskoro.
I know it shouldn't have, but it did	Znam da nije trebalo, ali jeste
He loves you too.	I on tebe voli.
I still think that's true.	I dalje mislim da je to istina.
I didn't do it.	Nisam to uradio.
I wasn't sure about that	Nisam bio siguran u to
I knew you would be safe	Znao sam da ćeš biti siguran
You and your team.	Ti i tvoj tim.
And as he did before.	I kao što je to radio ranije.
She plans something herself.	Planira nešto sama.
I wondered what he was doing and where he was	Pitao sam se šta radi i gdje je
I really like it.	Jako mi se sviđa.
But that couldn't say anything.	Ali to nije moglo reći ništa.
I'm not sure what to do with it.	Nisam siguran šta da radim s tim.
I didn't know it was happening at all	Nisam znao da se to uopšte dešava
Like a game.	Kao igra.
I could never go back to that	Nikad se ne bih mogao vratiti u to
And yes, that was for you.	I da, to je bilo za tebe.
I lost you for a while.	Izgubio sam te na neko vrijeme.
I loved doing it.	Voleo sam to da radim.
She would like you to do that.	Ona bi htela da to uradiš.
I'm here for you now	Sada sam tu za tebe
I never want him to see me.	Nikada ne želim da me vidi.
I wouldn’t know much about it	Ne bih znao puno o tome
I tried it for the first time.	Pokušao sam prvi put s njim.
I've never heard of such a thing	Nikad nisam ni čuo za tako nešto
And so soon.	I tako uskoro.
What did you think?.	Šta si mislio?.
I will always be here	Ja ću uvijek biti ovdje
But that doesn't say much.	Ali to ne govori mnogo.
I should be there for that	Trebao bih biti tamo zbog toga
I'm sorry, it took me a while	Žao mi je, trebalo mi je malo
She usually was.	Obično je bila.
I mean, unless it's	Mislim, osim ako nije
He is.	On je.
I really wanted to see what you got	Zaista sam htela da vidim šta imaš
It’s just the way he feels.	To je jednostavno način na koji se on osjeća.
Anyone but me.	Bilo ko osim mene.
I'm not going with you	Neću ići s tobom
How very.	Kako veoma.
You can only see it.	Možete to samo vidjeti.
I can't either.	Ne mogu ni .
She didn't even want that.	Ona to nije ni htela.
I already know what's up	Već znam šta ima
Looks like a good idea.	Izgleda kao dobra ideja.
I didn't want to do this	Nisam htela da ovo radim
I'm ready to go now.	Spreman sam da idem sada.
I really didn’t want to go back	Nisam se zaista htio vratiti
But this was a little more than that for me.	Ali ovo je za mene bilo malo više od toga.
I, i, i.	I, i, i.
I must have had them there	Mora da sam ih imao tamo
That's really bad.	To je stvarno loše.
And it is.	I jeste.
I do not know what to do.	Ne znam šta da radim.
You should have said that many years ago.	Trebao si to reći prije mnogo godina.
Maybe he'll be gone soon.	Možda će uskoro otići.
I know who you mean now	Znam na koga sada misliš
I still want to do all those things	I dalje želim da radim sve te stvari
Maybe three.	Možda su tri.
I would tell you that something like that happened	Rekao bih vam da se tako nešto dogodilo
I just wanted to be alone, I think	Samo sam htela da budem sama, mislim
He doesn't want to do that.	On to ne želi da uradi.
I am one and one is everything	Ja sam jedan i jedan je sve
I wasn't there at all yesterday	Jučer uopšte nisam bio
I hope so	Nadam se da ćeš tako
It was really hard for me	Bilo mi je zaista teško
I had to be alone	Morao sam da budem sam
I wasn’t sure if he would come back or not	Nisam bio siguran da li će se vratiti ili ne
And it is.	I jeste.
I wouldn't see it again	Ne bih to više vidio
A lot seems to be known.	Čini se da se to mnogo zna.
It is.	To je.
I already know he won't	Već znam da neće
Like everyone, really.	Kao i svi, zaista.
I did so little.	Tako sam malo toga uradio.
I should have talked to you about it earlier	Trebao sam ranije razgovarati s tobom o tome
You can’t tell if you don’t know.	Ne možete reći ako ne znate.
I knew what was going on	Znao sam šta se dešava
I don't know if that's true.	Ne znam da li je to istina.
More than good.	Više nego dobro.
Better than the first time.	Bolje nego prvi put.
She is not here today.	Ona danas nije ovdje.
That is not a question.	To nije pitanje.
Almost no one did that.	To skoro niko nije uradio.
I know that's true for me.	Znam da je to istina za mene.
And if it can, for how long.	I ako može, koliko dugo.
It's been years.	Prošle su godine.
I was both.	Bio sam oboje.
And always will.	I uvek će.
I won't tell you anything like that	Neću ti reći ništa tako
And that was a good thing.	I to je bila dobra stvar.
It shouldn't have been.	Nije trebalo biti.
I didn't think it was okay to talk about it with you.	Nisam mislio da je u redu razgovarati o tome s tobom.
I was supposed to work	Trebalo je da radim
Why? 	Zašto?
We are on.	Mi smo na.
I got it from a friend	Dobio sam ga od prijatelja
he wondered.	pitao se on.
But if not, that was fine too.	Ali ako nije, i to je bilo u redu.
I know he was surprised	Znam da je bio iznenađen
I can't tell you everything	Ne mogu ti sve reći
I need to know if you did it	Moram da znam da li si to uradio
I was happy to see him	Bio sam sretan što sam ga vidio
And that is the time now.	I to je vrijeme sada.
It is very difficult.	Veoma je teško.
I know it's very good	Znam da je jako dobro
We haven't been there yet.	Još nismo bili tamo.
I don't know if you've ever been.	Ne znam da li si ikada bio.
Not yet.	Još nije.
I didn't really know why he came	Zapravo nisam znao zašto je došao
I just can't.	Jednostavno ne mogu.
I think that's an idea	Mislim da je to ideja
But I have to go home	Ali moram ići kući
I did it with you today	Uradio sam to sa tobom danas
I know better than not	Znam bolje nego ne
I could only see that there was one car there	Mogao sam samo da vidim da je tamo jedan auto
I don't think that's right.	Mislim da to nije u redu.
I was in a lot of trouble.	Bio sam puno problema.
I decided	Odlučio sam se
I would love to see that.	Voleo bih to da vidim.
That's how he knew.	Tako je znao.
I was three those years old.	Imao sam tri te godine.
I don’t know if that was the only reason.	Ne znam da li je to bio jedini razlog.
I would do anything she said	Uradio bih sve što je rekla
It's mine too.	I moj je.
He knows very well who he is.	On jako dobro zna ko je.
It was very hard and difficult.	Bilo je jako teško i teško.
Obviously, we needed something better.	Očigledno, trebalo nam je nešto bolje.
She knew this.	Znala je ovo.
I know you mean it	Znam da to misliš
You need to buy much more.	Treba kupiti mnogo više.
I've been here many times	Bio sam ovdje mnogo puta
I knew we wouldn't be here long	Znao sam da nećemo dugo biti ovdje
He works there.	Radi tamo.
Or he was.	Ili je bio.
He just isn't there.	Jednostavno ga nema.
I was sure.	Bio sam siguran.
I had no idea who she was or what she was	Nisam imao pojma ko je ili šta je ona
Which was good to say.	Što je bilo dobro reći.
I would get the money.	Dobio bih novac.
For me it is.	Za mene jeste.
But you are the one at the moment.	Ali ti si taj trenutno.
I'm fine now.	Sada sam dobro.
But it works.	Ali radi.
I wondered if anyone else would be there	Pitao sam se hoće li još neko biti tamo
He thinks so.	On misli da.
And what's wrong with that.	I šta je tu loše.
But really, it's not.	Ali zaista, nije.
But it's too bad.	Ali previše je loše.
Yes, it was.	Da, bilo je.
She doesn't love me.	Ona me ne voli.
You know we know nothing about ourselves.	Znate da mi ne znamo ništa o sebi.
He should.	Trebalo bi mu.
From both of you.	Od vas oboje.
I need to see you soon	Moram te uskoro vidjeti
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
I am busy.	Zauzet sam.
We knew what to do.	Znali smo šta da radimo.
I have little doubt about that.	Malo sumnjam u to.
He likes her.	Ona mu se sviđa.
That is not true either.	Ni to nije istina.
He lost everything, just like me.	Izgubio je sve, baš kao i ja.
We did our job.	Uradili smo svoj posao.
Who she thinks.	Ko ona misli.
I probably won't be home tonight	Verovatno neću biti kući večeras
Maybe he told him to come home.	Možda mu je rekao da dođe kući.
There was nothing more.	Nije bilo ništa više.
It should work for you.	Trebalo bi da radi za tebe.
We like it.	Nama se sviđa.
This often happens.	To se često dešava.
Something must be wrong.	Nešto mora da nije u redu.
Which was not the case.	Što nije bilo.
I have to go there now	Moram ići tamo odmah
I just wouldn't.	Jednostavno ne bih.
I just wasn't sure what that would be	Samo nisam bio siguran šta bi to bilo
Maybe they don't even know she was here.	Možda ne znaju ni da je bila ovdje.
So simple.	Tako jednostavno.
But it's not helpful.	Ali nije od pomoći.
I worked on a few myself.	I sam sam radio na nekoliko.
This really needs to be seen.	Ovo se zaista mora vidjeti.
And it doesn’t have to be much.	I ne mora biti puno.
I thought you figured that out, too	I ja sam mislio da si to shvatio
She wants me to see.	Ona želi da vidim.
What it is, it is for itself.	Ono što jeste, to je za sebe.
And you didn't say anything.	I nisi ništa rekao.
And maybe that's a good thing.	A možda je to i dobro.
I just can't take it anymore	Jednostavno ne mogu više
I told you it would come to you	Rekao sam ti da će doći do tebe
I like it a lot more	Sviđa mi se mnogo više
Maybe I know what it is.	Možda znam šta je to.
But he didn't do it.	Ali on to nije uradio.
But I can't help myself	Ali ne mogu si pomoći
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
I haven't been there in a few years	Nisam bio tamo nekoliko godina
I just heard.	Upravo sam čuo.
He was ready, and he could.	Bio je spreman, i mogao je.
This works well.	Ovo radi dobro.
He was good, so good.	Bio je dobar, tako dobar.
This can be both good and bad.	Ovo može biti i dobro i loše.
I told you.	Rekla sam ti.
I hope we have it all	Nadam se da imamo sve to
Something was wrong.	Nešto nije bilo u redu.
I know he loves me.	Znam da me voli.
I'm not here to do that.	Nisam ovdje da to radim.
I hope they stay together.	Nadam se da će ostati zajedno.
Nothing could be done.	Ništa se nije moglo učiniti.
It's too good.	Previše je dobro.
There is so much we can do.	Toliko toga možemo da uradimo.
Tell him that.	Reci mu to.
I should help with that	Trebao bih pomoći u tome
But it is.	Ali jeste.
I'll tell you how to do it	Reći ću vam kako to da uradite
It's a job.	To je posao.
I may never leave.	Možda nikad neću otići.
I told you about it.	Rekao sam ti o tome.
I'm sure things will be fine	Siguran sam da će stvari biti u redu
There is more to say.	Ima još toga za reći.
I need someone to be there	Treba mi neko da bude tamo
I told him everything	Rekao sam mu sve
And that is true.	I to je istina.
And I know what is good and what is bad	I ja znam šta je dobro, a šta loše
You can't buy me.	Ne možeš me kupiti.
That's the question.	To je pitanje.
A job that only you can do	Posao koji samo ti možeš da radiš
It's not.	Nije.
I think that would be something more	Mislim da bi to bilo nešto više
I'm not sure what's wrong.	Nisam siguran šta nije u redu.
I was so sorry.	Baš mi je bilo žao.
We know what it is.	Znamo šta je to.
I want her so badly now	Želim je tako jako sada
And he did more than that.	I učinio je više od toga.
He didn't leave.	Nije otišao.
Which is fine.	Što je u redu.
Look, you're just getting better.	Vidi, samo ti bude bolje.
He told me that himself.	On mi je to sam rekao.
I hope he doesn't come home at all	Nadam se da se uopšte neće vratiti kući
I told him he needed more people	Rekao sam mu da mu treba više ljudi
Not so tonight.	Večeras nije tako.
It's like now.	To je kao sada.
And this is not a good thing.	A ovo nije dobra stvar.
It must be obvious.	Sigurno je to očigledno.
I do everything for you	Ja radim sve za tebe
No, he didn't mean that.	Ne, nije to mislio.
I guess he might be a little more busy	Pretpostavljam da je možda još malo zauzet
He had it.	Imao je to.
I can tell when you're doing it	Mogu reći kada to radiš
I came to get you.	Došao sam po tebe.
It's done this way.	To se radi na ovaj način.
I never realized it was so bad	Nikad nisam shvatio da je tako loše
I told myself they were still alive	Rekao sam sebi da su još živi
I don't think so, but it can be.	Mislim da nije, ali može biti.
I have to have you now	Moram da te imam sada
I want you to have it now	Želim da ga imaš sada
No, not the first.	Ne, ne prvi.
I didn't expect to find you here.	Nisam očekivao da ću te naći ovdje.
I think there is something to be said about that.	Mislim da o tome ima šta da se kaže.
You have to believe it.	Morate vjerovati u to.
You're not well.	Nisi dobro.
Just the things she says.	Samo stvari koje ona kaže.
And indeed, all weeks.	I zaista, sve sedmice.
They will stay together.	Oni će ostati zajedno.
I'm glad we have it.	Drago mi je da ga imamo.
I wondered what he would think of it	Pitao sam se šta bi on mislio o tome
This can't be.	Ovo ne može biti.
Now you obviously don't like this.	Sada ti se očigledno ovo ne sviđa.
Now there is none of that.	Sada nema ništa od toga.
I'm glad you're here !.	Drago mi je da ste ovdje!.
They didn't.	Nisu.
But that was and was not true.	Ali to je bila i nije bila istina.
You are here, not there.	Vi ste ovdje, ne tamo.
I just want to see it	Samo želim to vidjeti
Please help me at any time.	Molim bilo koga da mi pomogne.
Now is not the time.	Sada nije vrijeme.
He has something to say.	Ima nešto da kaže.
You were a guy here.	Bio si momak ovde.
I think he did it for me	Mislim da je to uradio za mene
He knows how we are.	On zna kako smo.
It must have been fast.	Sigurno je bilo brzo.
This has never happened before.	To se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
Now I know the right way to do it.	Sada znam pravi način da to uradim.
I can see for myself	Mogu i sam da vidim
He's gone, and so is she.	On je otišao, i ona je.
I didn't know what happened	Nisam znao šta se dogodilo
No problem for now.	Za sada nema problema.
One was my father.	Jedan je bio moj otac.
It still exists today.	I danas postoji.
Yes, that's right.	Da, tako.
That's what the team does	To je ono što tim radi
Ride with me.	Vozi sa mnom.
I was pretty sure of that.	Bio sam prilično siguran u to.
Yes, it's so good.	Da, tako je dobro.
I've never heard it before	Nikad ga ranije nisam čuo
It couldn't have come at a better time.	Nije moglo doći u bolje vrijeme.
I don't know if this works or not.	Ne znam da li ovo radi ili ne.
She knew she would.	Znala je da hoće.
Maybe he's here.	Možda je ovdje.
I wasn't there at the time	Nisam bio u to vrijeme
I wouldn't say that.	Ne bih to rekao.
He was actually surprised.	On je zapravo bio iznenađen.
Maybe it was true that there was nothing to do.	Možda je bila istina da nema šta da se radi.
I'm not sure.	Nisam siguran.
I was never good at it.	Nikad nisam bio dobar u tome.
I know this is hard for you	Znam da ti je ovo teško
Except this week.	Osim ove sedmice.
I asked him why he came to me	Pitao sam ga zašto je došao kod mene
I know where we can meet for this	Znam gdje se možemo naći za ovo
She has no friends.	Ona nema prijatelja.
But not everyone.	Ali ne svi.
It's true.	To je tačno.
I want this with you	Želim ovo sa tobom
I have to go get it	Moram da idem po to
I knew he wouldn't	Znao sam da neće
There is much more.	Ima još mnogo toga.
Not yesterday, not tomorrow, but today.	Ne juče, ne sutra, već danas.
I still think that's true	I dalje mislim da je to istina
They are simply not right.	Oni jednostavno nisu u pravu.
This is not good.	Ovo nije dobro.
I love them, I love, I love them.	Volim ih, volim, volim ih.
I told you before.	Rekao sam ti ranije.
I have to be home.	Moram biti kod kuće.
That's it.	To je to.
A lot can be done.	Mnogo toga se može uraditi.
She hadn't been in the house in many years.	Nije bila u kući mnogo godina.
What he says is what he does	Ono što kaže se i radi
It doesn't do anything else.	Ne radi ništa više.
There is a lot to do now.	Sada ima mnogo toga da se uradi.
I really needed the money	Jako mi je trebao novac
He was absolutely right.	Bio je potpuno u pravu.
I didn't even expect you to be there	Nisam ni očekivao da ćeš biti tamo
I decided it wasn't that bad	Odlučio sam da to i nije tako loše
I could tell he was waiting for me	Mogao sam reći da me čeka
I asked him how the business was going	Pitao sam ga kako ide posao
I didn't expect it from him	Nisam očekivao od njega
I wondered if he could tell	Pitao sam se može li reći
That was true.	To je bila istina.
I haven't finished it.	Nisam ga završio.
I haven't seen him in days	Nisam ga vidio nekoliko dana
It's coming soon.	To je uskoro.
But only for tonight.	Ali samo za večeras.
You said it right.	Dobro ste rekli.
Maybe it already is.	Možda već jeste.
A few years ago that didn’t happen	Prije nekoliko godina to se nije dogodilo
That would be bad.	To bi bilo loše.
We don't know what to do.	Ne znamo šta da radimo.
I don't work for when anyone knew.	Ne radim ni za koga za koga je neko znao.
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
And you got here.	I stigao si ovde.
I just never understood that before	Samo nikad ranije nisam to shvatio
I thought you might know	Mislio sam da možda znaš
No, not that.	Ne, ni to.
A little more.	Još malo.
It won't help me.	Neće mi pomoći.
But this is it.	Ali ovo je.
I’ve done enough of it and now I’m tired.	Uradio sam dovoljno toga i sada sam umoran.
Often not.	Često nije.
I love it!!.	Volim to!!.
It could come at any time.	Moglo bi doći bilo kada.
Than what he expected.	Nego što je očekivao.
I would love to see more.	Volio bih vidjeti više.
But the problem for me is how easy it is to buy something.	Ali problem za mene je koliko je lako nešto kupiti.
I wanted to see what was going on	Želeo sam da vidim šta se dešava
I know you well enough	Znam te dovoljno dobro
Which right now, she obviously wasn't.	Što trenutno, očigledno nije bila.
I left many years ago and did not return	Otišao sam prije mnogo godina i nisam se vratio
Or it should be.	Ili bi trebalo da bude.
I see what's going on here	Vidim šta se ovde dešava
I should be back in a few days	Trebao bih se vratiti za nekoliko dana
And people.	I ljudi.
I can't believe this just happened	Ne mogu vjerovati da se to upravo dogodilo
I wanted nothing more than to have him	Nisam htela ništa više od toga da ga imam
And you can't go home either.	A ni ti ne možeš ići kući.
And a few more things.	I još nekoliko stvari.
I haven't heard anything yet.	Nisam još ništa čuo.
I hope it was helpful to you	Nadam se da vam je bilo od pomoći
The more you do it, the better you get.	Što više to radite, to ćete bolje dobiti.
I can't say that for myself	Ne mogu to reći za sebe
But not us.	Ali ne mi.
It was often enough.	Često je bilo dovoljno.
I couldn't even see it	Nisam to mogao ni vidjeti
And she was alone.	I bila je sama.
They needed to do more with it	Trebali su učiniti više s tim
I just said that	Upravo sam to rekao
I really wanted to know	Zaista sam htela da znam
I doubt he could see me	Sumnjam da bi me mogao vidjeti
I can't say what you should do	Ne mogu reći šta treba da uradite
I don't have that much time	Nemam toliko vremena
He didn't have.	Nije imao.
I know he can.	Znam da može.
He can play.	On može da igra.
Mine was good.	Moj je bio dobar.
I think of you when you're not here	Mislim na tebe kad nisi tu
You wouldn't know.	Ne biste znali.
Who has never even tried.	Ko nikada nije ni pokušao.
Or the first time, actually.	Ili prvi put, zapravo.
He understood that.	On je to shvatio.
Not this, not that.	Ne ovo, ne ono.
I'm not sure what to do with it.	Nisam siguran šta da radim s tim.
And he was ready to move on.	I bio je spreman da ide dalje.
One of us, always.	Jedan od nas, uvek.
You have enough of them.	Imaš ih dovoljno.
I just want to see what it looks like now	Samo želim da vidim kako to sada izgleda
I still want to see you	I dalje te želim vidjeti
When, he can't say.	Kada, ne može reći.
No, they couldn't help it.	Ne, nisu mogli pomoći.
I know he'll say no	Znam da će reći ne
Not true.	Nije tačno.
I had no idea why.	Nisam imao pojma zašto.
There seems to be something wrong.	Čini se da nešto nije u redu.
He just does it.	On to samo uradi.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
He can find it. 	On to može naći. 
She wasn't even home when he left.	Nije ni bila kod kuće kada je otišao.
I would have to do it alone.	Morao bih to sam.
I still love you too	I ja tebe još uvijek volim
He was earlier.	Bio je ranije.
I have no doubt about that.	Ne sumnjam u to.
I wasn't there	Nisam bio tamo
I asked how he knew, but he wouldn't say	Pitao sam kako zna, ali nije htio reći
Maybe he just wasn’t one of us.	Možda jednostavno nije bio jedan od nas.
But she didn't want that.	Ali ona to nije htela.
Probably too much.	Verovatno previše.
I did everything right	Sve sam uradio kako treba
He was mine.	Bio je moj.
Maybe he won't even say anything.	Možda neće ni reći ništa.
How much he was not a man.	Koliko nije bio čovjek.
That's bad.	To je loše.
Maybe there are more.	Možda ih ima više.
I should be.	Trebalo bi da budem.
I don't have to see him again.	Ne moram ponovo da ga vidim.
He didn't really want her.	On je zapravo nije želio.
I don't see that happening.	Ne vidim da se to dešava.
I see I still know.	Vidim da još znam.
I really wanted to talk	Zaista sam htio razgovarati
What is the problem.	Šta je problem.
He is time.	On je vrijeme.
But it can't be.	Ali to ne može biti.
I searched and could not find	Tražio sam i nisam mogao naći
This is a good idea, but it is not true.	Ovo je dobra ideja, ali nije istina.
I hope you can too	Nadam se da i ti to možeš
You know what you're doing, he doesn't know.	Ti znaš šta radiš, on ne zna.
It's them.	To su oni.
I needed them, and they needed me	Trebali su mi oni, i oni mene
I can not tell you	Ne mogu ti reći
We need life.	Treba nam život.
He hadn't seen anyone in a while.	Neko vrijeme nije vidio nikoga.
It was a good life.	Bio je to dobar život.
I wondered if he could	Pitao sam se da li bi mogao
He won't.	Neće.
So little time.	Tako malo vremena.
Please don't do that.	Molim te, ne radi to.
I was surprised too	I ja sam bio iznenađen
Something is happening.	Nešto se dešava.
I can't see him.	Ne mogu ga vidjeti.
Something just doesn’t seem right to me.	Nešto mi se jednostavno ne čini u redu.
I knew he would come	Znao sam da će doći
I know it's me	Znam da sam to ja
Now at home.	Sada kod kuće.
I won't believe it	Neću vjerovati
You have to be your own.	Moraš biti svoj.
It was really simple.	Bilo je zaista jednostavno.
I could talk to him.	Mogao bih razgovarati s njim.
It happens.	To se dešava.
I can't always stay long	Ne mogu uvijek dugo ostati
And I could see it happening	I ja sam mogao vidjeti da se to dešava
I like to be alone	Volim da budem sam
But the car was not there.	Ali auto nije bilo tamo.
If something is.	Ako nešto jeste.
I had to see how it was done, just to be sure.	Morao sam da vidim kako se to radi, samo da budem siguran.
's.	' s.
I came to tell you to be like that	Došao sam da ti kažem da bude tako
I mean, we're not together anymore	Mislim, nismo više zajedno
Everything will be fine now.	Sada će biti sve u redu.
And we will never do that again.	I to više nikada nećemo raditi.
I told the truth and I couldn’t take it anymore	Rekao sam istinu i nisam mogao više
That is exactly what would happen.	To je upravo ono što bi se dogodilo.
I didn't see anything either	Ni ja nisam ništa vidio
He knew what you were thinking.	Znao je šta misliš.
She knew she would.	Znala je da hoće.
But she knew they were right.	Ali znala je da su u pravu.
And only them.	I samo oni.
We must work together, always.	Moramo raditi zajedno, uvijek.
I just wouldn't.	Jednostavno ne bi.
I just like to say it that way	Samo volim da to tako kažem
He thinks there are too many.	On misli da ih ima previše.
It was really good to do that.	Bilo je stvarno dobro to učiniti.
Very much.	Veoma.
, but it won't.	, ali neće.
I just need to know what to do	Samo moram da znam šta da radim
She says for sure.	Ona kaže sigurno.
And so on, and so on.	I tako dalje, i dalje.
I asked her for help	Zamolio sam je za pomoć
You know what you will get from him.	Znate šta ćete dobiti od njega.
I doubt there is.	Sumnjam da ima.
She said she wanted to go home.	Rekla je da želi ići kući.
And it never will be.	I nikada neće biti.
I'm not sure what to believe.	Nisam siguran u šta vjerovati.
But we are fine now.	Ali sada smo dobro.
I just can't believe it	Jednostavno ne mogu vjerovati
Not even a little.	Čak ni malo.
I know them.	Znam ih.
I'm glad you did.	Drago mi je da jeste.
It's like it wasn't there.	Tu je kao da nije bilo.
She must have known by now.	Sigurno je do sada znala.
My life.	Moj život.
He was right and we both knew it.	Bio je u pravu i oboje smo to znali.
Not so this year.	Ove godine nije tako.
I've never had them before	Nikada ih ranije nisam imao
Probably is.	Verovatno jeste.
You can tell us what he said about it.	Možete nam reći šta je rekao o tome.
I just didn't see it that way	Jednostavno ga nisam tako vidio
He was not sorry.	Nije mu bilo žao.
But she will find a way.	Ali ona će naći način.
Ride with me if you want.	Vozi sa mnom ako želiš.
Besides, it looks really, really good.	Osim toga, izgleda stvarno, stvarno dobro.
I didn't expect anyone	Nisam očekivao nikoga
I'll give it to you.	Ja ću ti to dati.
I can still do my job	Još uvijek mogu raditi svoj posao
Everything you really need.	Sve što vam zaista treba.
I didn't do the job myself	Nisam sam uradio posao
03:30.	03:30.
Maybe not everyone.	Možda ne svi.
I just finished it yesterday	Jučer sam ga upravo završio
I always pray for you.	Uvek se molim za tebe.
I still couldn’t believe he told me that	Još uvijek nisam mogao vjerovati da mi je to rekao
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
But that's not a problem here.	Ali to ovdje nije problem.
The question is how.	Pitanje je kako.
But while it is.	Ali, dok jeste.
They both knew it wasn't.	Oboje su znali da nije.
But this was too much.	Ali ovo je bilo previše.
I didn't want to be a person	Nisam htela da bude osoba
I didn't expect it	Nisam ga očekivao
What she looks like.	Kako ona izgleda.
Not a bad job.	Nije loš posao.
That will give us some time.	To će nam dati malo vremena.
But she didn't know what to do.	Ali nije znala šta da radi.
I was gone for just a few days	Nije me bilo samo nekoliko dana
I know you have a problem	Znam da imaš problema
I wonder if she knows	Pitam se da li ona zna
It's like that for everyone.	Tako je svima.
I doubt he told me what to do.	Sumnjam da mi je rekao šta da radim.
You want it bad.	Želiš to loše.
I'm no better than that here.	Ovdje mi nije bolje od toga.
I didn't even know he was there	Nisam ni znao da je tamo
I just don't see it happening.	Jednostavno ne vidim da se to dešava.
I didn't want him to leave	Nisam htela da ode
I may never see him again	Možda ga više nikad neću vidjeti
I think we should go there	Mislim da bi trebali otići tamo
This is your friend '.	Ovo je tvoj prijatelj'.
He said so much.	Toliko je rekao.
Someone needs you.	Neko te treba.
In fact, it is not.	U stvari, nije.
They said that.	Oni su to rekli.
I have enough problems to be my own	Imam dovoljno problema da budem svoj
I was just thinking of helping	Samo sam mislio pomoći
What did you do.	Šta si radio.
I thought maybe she was with you	Mislio sam da je možda s tobom
I have no doubt about that	Ne sumnjam u to
And we were the only ones there.	I bili smo jedini tamo.
I have no problem with that either.	Ni ja nemam problema sa tim.
I wanna Be With You	želim biti s tobom
Tell me if you need anything.	Reci mi ako ti nešto treba.
I can't be with anyone right now	Ne mogu sada ni sa kim biti
I know he won't come back	Znam da se neće vratiti
I told him, nobody.	Rekao sam mu, niko.
He could see now.	Sada je mogao da vidi.
I don't really need anything for myself	Ne treba mi ništa za sebe zaista
I didn't know it was your father	Nisam znao da je to tvoj otac
I haven't seen you in days	Nisam te vidio nekoliko dana
Something could happen tomorrow.	Nešto se može dogoditi sutra.
Or maybe something real.	Ili možda nešto stvarno.
What is it.	Šta je to.
I already know who you are	Ja već znam ko si ti
I would lose too much	Izgubio bih previše
But no one knows anything.	Ali niko ništa ne zna.
You were the one.	Ti si bio taj.
But this time.	Ali ovaj put.
I just couldn't	Jednostavno nisam mogao
Nobody talks about it.	Niko ne priča o tome.
They must have known.	Sigurno su znali.
I couldn't let him talk	Nisam mu mogao dozvoliti da govori
We had a car that was.	Imali smo auto koji je bio.
I did those things	Radio sam te stvari
I was him.	Ja sam bio on.
You have to do what you promised me.	Moraš da uradiš ono što si mi obećao.
It was really good.	Bilo je zaista dobro.
I know how you work.	Znam kako vi radite.
I know these things take time	Znam da za ove stvari treba vremena
The money is yours.	Novac je tvoj.
I think it will work well for me	Mislim da će mi dobro raditi
I had to be alone to do it	Morao sam biti sam da to uradim
But you are much more than that.	Ali ti si mnogo više od toga.
It's not that long.	To nije tako dugo.
I know a lot of people	Znam puno ljudi
But three is too much.	Ali tri je previše.
No, it really is.	Ne, zaista jeste.
Everything is simple.	Sve sam jednostavno.
I've never seen this happen before.	Nikada ranije nisam video da se ovo dešava.
I know what you'll find	Znam šta ćeš naći
I went to see what was going on	Otišao sam da vidim šta se dešava
I really need it.	Jako mi treba.
All this is real.	Sve ovo je stvarno.
I didn't mean you at all	Nisam uopšte mislio na tebe
I won't go there anymore.	Neću više ići tamo.
I saw everything	Sve sam vidio
None of us could.	Niko od nas nije mogao.
I could say many things	Mogao bih reći mnogo stvari
I couldn't do it anymore.	Nisam mogao više.
But yes, you have to.	Ali da, moraš.
I went home.	Otišao sam kući.
I have no idea what she's going to say	Nemam pojma šta će ona reći
Never say it's hard.	Nikad ne reci da je teško.
I should have asked you how you were	Trebalo je i da te pitam kako si
I heard you say that	Čuo sam kad si to rekao
I just wanted to do a good job	Samo sam htela da uradim dobar posao
I have to go now.	Moram da idem sada.
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam uradio ništa loše
I would love to be	Voleo bih da budem
But it's not that hard.	Ali to nije tako teško.
I didn't want to be alone	Nisam htela da budem sama
It was something more	Bilo je to nešto više
Are you in.	Jeste li u.
I didn't see any of that	Nisam vidio ništa od toga
I just got back tonight.	Upravo sam se vratio večeras.
Nobody goes home here.	Niko ovde ne ide kući.
I must be really tired	Mora da sam stvarno umoran
There was a man there who needed to know about it.	Tamo je bio čovjek koji je trebao znati za to.
But she won't.	Ali ona neće.
That's the only thing.	To je jedina stvar.
That's what's wrong.	To je ono što nije u redu.
I just had a bad day	Samo sam imao loš dan
I don't like that.	Ne sviđa mi se to.
I can always help, you know	Uvek mogu pomoći, znaš
I would never say before.	Nikada prije ne bih rekao.
I didn't expect to see him here	Nisam očekivao da ću ga vidjeti ovdje
I shouldn't go to work	Ne bih trebao ići na posao
I thought it still was	Mislio sam da je još uvek
I mean, you're right	Mislim, u pravu si
He did it.	On je to uradio.
He just didn't get it.	Jednostavno nije shvatio.
I can't tell you exactly how to do it	Ne mogu vam tačno reći kako to učiniti
In three years.	Za tri godine.
But that’s not really happening here.	Ali to se zapravo ne dešava ovdje.
I know this is hard for you.	Znam da ti je ovo teško.
I didn't know something like that was going to happen to you	Nisam znao da će ti se tako nešto dogoditi
I guess you haven't heard	Pretpostavljam da nisi čuo
Do what you can.	Uradi šta možeš.
I'm sure of this	Siguran sam u ovo
I say yes to everything	Kažem da na sve
The game is just a game.	Igra je samo igra.
I didn't get lost because of you, not this time	Nisam se izgubio zbog tebe, ne ovaj put
I was not tired at all	Uopšte nisam bio umoran
I don't know how, not yet	Ne znam kako, ne još
I asked him what he was doing	Pitao sam ga šta radi
He wasn't ready.	Nije bio spreman.
It was a video.	Bio je to video.
And there is nothing that can be done about it.	I tu se ništa ne može učiniti.
What it looks like.	Kako to izgleda.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
It's happening.	To se dešava.
He never said he was sorry.	Nikad nije rekao da mu je žao.
He came back and saw nothing.	Vratio se i ne vidi ništa.
That's exactly what he wants.	To je upravo ono što on želi.
In fact, there are many.	U stvari, ima ih mnogo.
I didn't say he was good	Nisam rekao da je dobar
Good, but only that	Dobar, ali samo to
We have little time.	Imamo malo vremena.
Actually.	Zapravo.
I didn't want that.	Nisam to htio.
Yes we do.	Da mi.
He gave everything he had.	Dao je sve što je imao.
You never know here.	Ovdje se nikad ne zna.
Really long time.	Zaista dugo vremena.
But it looks good.	Ali izgleda dobro.
I know him better than you	Znam ga bolje od tebe
That's all of us.	To smo svi.
I'm afraid of what will happen	Bojim se šta će se dogoditi
Very good, actually.	Vrlo dobro, u stvari.
You don't have to.	Ne morate.
And it can be good.	I dobro može.
I can still do it.	Ja to još mogu.
I just want to be happy	Samo želim da budem sretan
I asked her about it earlier	Ranije sam je pitao o tome
I'm still working on it.	Još uvijek radim na tome.
I love him and he loves me	Volim ga i on voli mene
I think it would be better.	Mislim da bi bilo bolje.
Okay, actually.	Dobro, u stvari.
So many times I wanted to say something	Toliko puta sam htio nešto reći
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
I was really good.	Bilo mi je stvarno dobro.
I'm going, she said.	Idem, rekla je.
I'm glad to know what you think.	Drago mi je da znam šta mislite.
I told him no, you didn't	Rekao sam mu ne, nisi
I tried to do more.	Pokušao sam učiniti više.
One was bad and one was good.	Jedan je bio loš, a jedan dobar.
I want to be here and now	Želim biti ovdje i sada
Like I saw it for the first time.	Kao da sam to prvi put vidio.
And the reason is exactly what you said.	A razlog je upravo ono što ste rekli.
I hope we can.	Nadam se da možemo.
I was surprised and wondered what it might be about	Bio sam iznenađen i pitao sam se o čemu bi to moglo biti
They did just that.	Oni su upravo to uradili.
I still have no idea what's going on	Još uvijek nemam pojma šta se dešava
I almost didn't understand.	Skoro da nisam shvatio.
I can't even tell you why	Ne mogu ti ni reći zašto
I heard or saw nothing	Nisam čuo ni vidio ništa
You just have to do this little by little.	Ovo morate raditi samo malo po malo.
He didn't want to have to say that.	Nije želio da to mora reći.
I never loved you	Nikada te nisam volio
But there is more to it than that.	Ali, tu je i više od toga.
He went to get me.	Otišao je po mene.
But we'll have to get to work soon.	Ali uskoro ćemo morati na posao.
He didn't have to do that at all.	On to uopšte nije morao da radi.
And that makes three.	I to čini tri.
I was not happy.	Nisam bio sretan.
And she wasn't the only one.	I nije bila jedina.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
We know better now.	Sada znamo bolje.
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
I didn't quite understand	Nisam baš shvatio
For a long time.	Za dugo vremena.
This is not a game.	Ovo nije igra.
There was very little.	Bilo je vrlo malo toga.
I didn't see him come back	Nisam ga vidio da se vratio
He tells us, no.	On nam kaže, ne.
I lost you earlier.	Izgubio sam te ranije.
I loved life.	Voleo sam život.
I wondered when all this happened	Pitao sam se kada se sve ovo dogodilo
I can't go on with this	Ne mogu dalje s tim
This is not like a real job.	Ovo nije kao pravi posao.
I just really wanted you there	Samo sam te stvarno želio tamo
Apparently not.	Očigledno nije.
I know who your father is	Znam ko je tvoj otac
I never wanted to come back here	Nikada se nisam htio vratiti ovdje
I have tried many times.	Pokušao sam mnogo puta.
I know what you want to do	Znam šta želiš da uradiš
You are my only friend.	Ti si moj jedini prijatelj.
I love how you are with me	Volim kako si sa mnom
That should work.	To bi trebalo da radi.
I mean, no.	Mislim, ne.
I knew they wouldn't believe me	Znao sam da mi neće vjerovati
Sam is gone.	Sam nema.
Okay, that's right.	U redu, to je tačno.
It is sufficient.	To je dovoljno.
I know what he likes	Znam šta voli
Look, one of us needs to go get help.	Vidi, jedan od nas treba da ide po pomoć.
It would be enough.	Bilo bi dovoljno.
You are not like us.	Ti nisi kao mi.
And, obviously, no one can do this for so long.	I, očigledno, niko ovo ne može raditi tako dugo.
I didn't want to hope	Nisam želeo da se nadam
I can't do anything.	Ne mogu ništa.
At any time.	U bilo koje vrijeme.
You really shouldn't.	Zaista ne bi trebao.
I was wrong	Nisam bio u redu
Or it's almost over.	Ili je skoro završio.
Everyone did it.	Svi su to uradili.
I was happy to be gone.	Bio sam sretan što sam otišao.
To work.	Na posao.
But he did come.	Ali on je zaista došao.
I think they did it so well.	Mislim da su to tako dobro uradili.
I don't see how that happened.	Ne vidim kako se to dogodilo.
And it really does nothing.	I zaista ne radi ništa.
Now he didn't expect this.	Sada ovo nije očekivao.
Do it the way you want.	Radite s tim kako želite.
I will never do that again.	Nikad to više neću uraditi.
I wasn't sure you were sure	Nisam bio siguran da si siguran
If You Can.	Ako možeš.
I had no idea there was so much	Nisam imao pojma da ima toliko toga
I wanted them to know it could be	Želio sam da znaju da bi to moglo biti
Nobody knew who we were	Niko nije znao ko smo mi
But he was more than that.	Ali on je bio više od toga.
I don't think that's it.	Mislim da to nije to.
As very bad.	Kao jako loše.
That's none of my business.	To nije moja stvar.
He's still there.	On je još uvek tamo.
Tell me what you want me to say.	Reci mi šta želiš da kažem.
I got more than he realized	Dobio sam više nego što je on shvatio
But you're not coming back.	Ali ti se nećeš vratiti.
I'm like you.	Ja sam kao ti.
I'm not sure I would today.	Nisam siguran da bi danas.
I knew it was true	Znao sam da je to istina
Neither is he.	Nije ni on.
I gave you very little time	Dao sam ti vrlo malo vremena
But it has to be done.	Ali to se mora uraditi.
Is there such a thing?	Postoji li tako nešto?
I wonder how he is	Pitam se kako mu je
He doesn't know what he wants.	Ne zna šta želi.
But he tried several times.	Ali pokušao je nekoliko puta.
None of us had a clue.	Niko od nas nije imao pojma.
I like what I can do	Sviđa mi se što mogu
And it should have been.	I trebalo je biti.
But the real problem is people.	Ali pravi problem su ljudi.
He looked so good.	Tako je dobro izgledao.
I couldn’t believe it was happening to me	Nisam mogao vjerovati da mi se to dešava
They must have had a job or something.	Mora da su imali posao ili tako nešto.
I can still see it now	Još uvijek to mogu vidjeti sada
He can't now.	Sada ne može.
I know you've done so much	Znam da si toliko toga uradio
I thought you could go and see her.	Mislio sam da bi mogao otići i vidjeti je.
He looked very good.	Izgledao je veoma dobro.
While you still can.	Dok još možeš.
I had a job.	Imao sam posao.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to da uradim.
I had it too.	I ja sam je imao.
He really knows.	On zaista zna.
A friend is a friend	Prijatelj je prijatelj
He asked what he was doing, and she told him.	Pitao je šta radi, a ona mu je rekla.
Even if it isn't, in fact.	Čak i da nije, u stvari.
I want to know what it's like	Želim da znam kako je to
I can't believe it, but you did	Ne mogu vjerovati, ali ti jesi
You are not my friend.	Ti mi nisi prijatelj.
He didn't do it.	On to nije uradio.
And there are more.	A ima ih još.
I could easily reach him	Mogao bih lako doći do njega
My father must have too.	Mora da ima i moj otac.
I didn't mean it	Nisam ni mislio
I think he thought you said	Mislim da je mislio da si rekao
I've had a problem before	Imao sam problem ranije
Or almost three.	Ili skoro tri.
I never expected this	Ovo nikad nisam očekivao
I didn't know where my father was	Nisam znao gdje mi je otac
I thought we'd be safe here	Mislio sam da ćemo ovdje biti sigurni
I wonder what we're going to do now	Pitam se šta ćemo sada
I want to ask him many things	Želim da ga pitam mnogo stvari
He's a good guy.	On je dobar momak.
The weather was earlier than last night.	Vrijeme je bilo ranije nego sinoć.
I didn't think he wanted to talk about it	Nisam mislio da želi da priča o tome
Good first date	Dobar prvi sastanak
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
He wouldn't get to work on time.	Ne bi stigao na posao na vrijeme.
So we will do our best.	Tako da ćemo dati sve od sebe.
Or you can't.	Ili ne možete.
I am him.	Ja sam on.
That hasn't happened yet.	To se još nije dogodilo.
He was the first to start working.	Bio je to prvi koji je počeo raditi.
I wondered why that was	Pitao sam se zašto je to tako
There is a lot of it.	Ima puno toga.
They were brand new to both of us.	Bili su potpuno novi za nas oboje.
It was hard, it really was.	Bilo je teško, zaista je bilo.
Still further and further and further.	I dalje i dalje i dalje i dalje.
I don't think that's a problem	Mislim da to nije problem
I didn't want this to go on	Nisam želio da ovo ide dalje
I just wanted you to know that	Samo sam htela da to znaš
I actually have a lot more.	Zapravo imam puno više.
You should be happy.	Trebao bi biti sretan.
I know there is not that much money	Znam da nema toliko novca
You seem to be doing very well.	Čini se da ti ide jako dobro.
It was hard to find	Bilo je teško naći
I can't do without it.	Ne mogu bez toga.
We don't know exactly what.	Ne znamo tačno šta.
I've never heard of it before	Nikada ranije nisam čuo za to
People know about us.	Ljudi znaju za nas.
He just bought it here.	Upravo ga je kupio ovdje.
It was a little too much for him today.	Bilo je to malo previše za njega danas.
I really couldn't say that	Zaista to ne bih mogao reći
He thought he was going to get something.	Mislio je da će dobiti nešto.
And she is.	I ona je.
Tell me everything.	Reci mi sve.
I was here for that.	Bio sam ovdje zbog toga.
I didn't know what was going to happen	Nisam znao šta će se dogoditi
Maybe he's right.	Možda je u pravu.
Look, let me tell you something.	Vidi, da ti kažem nešto.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Nisam siguran da je to tako.
I never knew who.	Nikad nisam znao ko.
I am that, but much more.	Ja sam to, ali mnogo više.
I didn't even see him	Nisam ga ni vidio
I didn't even know you had that much in you	Nisam ni znao da imaš toliko u sebi
That's really all.	To je zaista sve.
And he does a very good job	I on radi veoma dobar posao
I just love being there	Samo volim da si tu
I think it could have helped, you know	Mislim da je moglo pomoći, znaš
I wouldn't do that to you	Ne bih ti to uradio
That was the question.	To je bilo pitanje.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
I couldn't see properly.	Nisam mogao da vidim kako treba.
I didn't lose everything	Nisam sve izgubio
I'll even help.	Čak ću i pomoći.
We can do this.	Možemo ovo da uradimo.
I better go for a bit.	Bolje da idem po malo.
I need that for you	Trebao bih to za tebe
I wondered why he did it	Pitao sam se zašto je to uradio
That's good if it is.	Baš dobro ako jeste.
They know what is real.	Oni znaju šta je stvarno.
He should work with it.	On treba da radi sa tim.
And now she's gone.	I sada je nema.
I haven't asked anyone yet	Nisam još nikoga pitao
We could do more.	Mogli bismo sa više.
You really.	Ti stvarno.
I told him it wasn't enough time	Rekao sam mu da to nije dovoljno vremena
We don't know yet.	Ne znamo još.
I know what it looks like	Znam kako izgleda
I was a good person.	Bio sam dobra osoba.
It was really easy for me to do.	Za mene je to bilo zaista lako učiniti.
He came.	Došao je.
And you shouldn't.	I ne bi trebalo.
There are many more.	Ima ih mnogo više.
They knew nothing about it.	Nisu znali ništa o tome.
There was only one.	Bio je samo jedan.
It's hard to even say.	Teško je to čak i reći.
And she knows what to do.	I ona zna šta da radi.
I've been looking for him for a while	Tražio sam ga već neko vrijeme
All from me.	Sve od mene.
Neither am I.	Nisam ni ja to
I immediately understood the problem	Odmah sam shvatio problem
I could do it for you quickly and easily	Mogao bih ti to učiniti brzo i lako
I had no idea what to do next	Nisam imao pojma šta dalje
I was glad to have him	Bilo mi je drago što ga imam
I already knew all that	Sve sam to već znao
I think we have a lot of power.	Mislim da imamo mnogo moći.
And the next.	I sljedeće.
There is only one way to do it.	Postoji samo jedan način da se to uradi.
But it never is.	Ali to nikad nije.
He wants to know everything.	On želi da zna sve.
I had to believe he could	Morao sam vjerovati da može
She says nothing.	Ona ne govori ništa.
We will help you as much as we can.	Mi ćemo vam pomoći koliko možemo.
I think everyone knows who they are	Mislim da svi znaju ko su oni
It was good for him.	Bilo je dobro za njega.
No, it's actually that simple.	Ne, zapravo je tako jednostavno.
Just like me.	Baš kao ja.
Something to believe in.	Nešto u šta treba vjerovati.
We won't.	Nećemo.
You have to come now.	Moraš doći sada.
You would too.	I ti bi bio.
Out of the way.	Sa puta.
Maybe you can, but this is not for me.	Možda i možeš, ali ovo nije za mene.
Or they will find us.	Ili će nas naći.
I really wish him well	Zaista mu želim dobro
In fact, he must have done it.	U stvari, mora da je uradio.
We were glad for that.	Bilo nam je drago zbog toga.
This is pretty simple.	Ovo je prilično jednostavno.
I just have no idea.	Samo nemam pojma.
Nothing, he said.	Ništa, rekao je.
They will never get it.	Oni to nikada neće dobiti.
If there was money we would be there.	Da ima novca bili bi tamo.
It seemed that.	Činilo se da .
And that was not enough.	I to nije bilo dovoljno.
I hope he finds someone	Nadam se da će naći nekoga
It could not be found.	Nije se moglo naći.
But now we have.	Ali sada imamo.
I'm so sorry about that	Tako mi je žao zbog toga
Which you are not.	Što ti nisi.
But in fact, it is not quite so.	Ali u stvari, nije baš tako.
There is so much.	Ima toliko toga.
That's not a bad thing at all.	To uopšte nije loše.
That actually happened to me.	To mi se u stvari dogodilo.
I didn't know what to tell him.	Nisam znao šta da mu kažem.
I think he knew that too	Mislim da je i on to znao
I know what you want	Znam šta želiš
I couldn't find anything about it here.	Ovdje nisam mogao naći ništa o tome.
He's not here now.	On sada nije ovdje.
It's nothing.	Nije ništa.
He is doing well at the moment.	Trenutno mu ide dobro.
Now I really have to go.	Sada stvarno moram da idem.
I wondered what was wrong, but I didn't ask	Pitao sam se šta nije u redu, ali nisam pitao
I asked him if there was, but he didn't know	Pitao sam ga da li ima, ali nije znao
I wanted this even more than she did	Želeo sam ovo čak više nego ona
That's right.	Tako je.
Only what he knows, or doesn't know yet.	Samo ono što zna, ili još ne zna.
I would do anything for you	Učinio bih sve za tebe
But not yet.	Ali za sada neće.
They are too sure.	Previše su sigurni.
I knew he was there	Znao sam da je tamo
Think, think, think.	Misli, misli, misli.
He could come back.	Mogao bi se vratiti.
I didn't want to see her.	Nisam je htio vidjeti.
I have to do something.	Moram nešto učiniti.
He is and he is not.	On jeste i nije.
Obviously I know what you can do	Očigledno znam šta možeš da uradiš
I'm very sorry	Jako mi je žao
That's true, you know.	To je istina, znaš.
I should be scared.	Trebalo bi da se bojim.
There were many of them.	Bilo ih je mnogo.
He's pretty good.	On je prilično dobar.
He will be home soon.	Uskoro će se vratiti kući.
There is.	Ima.
I tried to come.	Pokušao sam doći.
I see her before she sees me	Vidim je prije nego ona mene
I didn't do it	Nisam to radio
Nothing for me.	Ništa za mene.
You never will.	Nikad nećeš.
I would be good at that	Bio bih dobar u tome
That's how it happens.	Tako se dešava.
That is not the case here.	To ovdje nije tako.
I said your father works for me.	Rekao sam da tvoj otac radi za mene.
But it is true.	Ali to je istina.
Neither are they.	Nisu ni oni.
I really had no idea what to do next	Zaista nisam imao pojma šta dalje
Someone should know.	Neko bi trebao znati.
I didn't want to see that	Nisam to htio vidjeti
I didn't have time for myself	Nisam imao vremena za sebe
I'm glad he's gone.	Drago mi je što je otišao.
I wanted something fast, fast	Htio sam nešto brzo, brzo
Looks like you are.	Izgleda da jesi.
I won't be working this week	Neću raditi ove sedmice
Which seems easy enough.	Što se čini dovoljno lako.
I didn't expect it at all	Nisam ga uopšte očekivao
I did what you asked	Uradio sam šta si tražio
And because of that.	I zbog toga.
Or someone we don't know about.	Ili neko za koga ne znamo.
I shouldn't have stayed that long	Nisam trebao ostati tako dugo
You came to me.	Došao si do mene.
I have that problem too.	I ja imam taj problem.
I've had enough.	Bilo mi je dosta toga.
Nobody does that today.	Danas to niko ne radi.
That's true for me.	To je istina za mene.
That he shouldn't have.	Da nije trebao.
I'm sure we both need time.	Siguran sam da nam oboje treba vremena.
She knows.	Ona zna.
I wonder how she knew that	Pitam se kako je to znala
I just wish he loved me	Samo bih volio da me voli
And they could easily have been.	I lako su mogli biti.
I love doing it.	Volim to raditi.
I had a lot of friends there	Imao sam mnogo prijatelja tamo
Everyone is here to help.	Svi su tu za pomoć.
I just wanted to be ready	Samo sam htio biti spreman
I don't know how to be.	Ne znam kako da budem.
So simple.	Tako jednostavno.
I've never seen that before	Nikad to prije nisam vidio
It was there right away	Odmah je bilo tamo
Not for many years.	Ne za mnogo godina.
I do not have much time.	Nemam puno vremena.
He wants to know what's going on.	Želi da zna šta se dešava.
And that was true.	I to je bila istina.
That is true even today.	To je istina i danas.
She's like me.	Ona je kao ja.
I had to tell him something	Morao sam mu nešto reći
We did it last night.	Uradili smo to sinoć.
There are few of them.	Malo ih ima.
I didn't think there was anything wrong with that	Nisam mislio da nešto nije u redu s tim
I never did anything wrong.	Nikad nisam uradio ništa loše.
I can see why you would do that.	Vidim zašto bi to uradio.
I didn't actually do anything.	Zapravo nisam uradio ništa.
I haven't seen him before	Nisam ga ranije vidio
But he heard and saw nothing.	Ali ništa nije čuo i video.
Maybe, and maybe not.	Može, a možda i ne.
I didn't know for sure	Nisam znao sigurno
I would have.	Imao bih.
I wonder how you knew what we needed	Pitam se kako si znao šta nam treba
Ready for anything.	Spreman za sve.
And I knew this was going to happen	I ja sam znao da će se ovo dogoditi
You have to give it to me.	Moraš mi to dati.
I mean, how.	Mislim, kako.
I mean, he was around the house	Mislim, bio je po kući
Not right there.	Ne baš tamo.
I can't talk to anyone	Ne mogu razgovarati ni sa kim
We didn't do anything.	Nismo ništa uradili.
I could not.	Nisam mogao.
But that's how it was.	Ali tako je bilo.
I know what you thought you were doing	Znam šta si mislio da radiš
Someone already lives there.	Tamo već neko živi.
I mean, everyone knows about it.	Mislim, svi znaju za to.
I really should go back	Stvarno bih se trebao vratiti
We need to do this better.	Moramo bolje da uradimo ovo.
She said no more.	Nije rekla više.
Nobody knows who he is.	Niko ne zna ko je on.
Maybe it wasn't.	Možda nije bilo.
I did more than that	Uradio sam više od toga
But it's not hard.	Ali to nije teško.
You can't help it.	Ne možeš pomoći.
I have things for you.	Imam stvari za tebe.
I want you to know this	Želim da znaš ovo
I will never tell anyone what is happening	Nikad nikome neću reći šta se dešava
If he did, he would have to do it.	Da jeste, morao bi to da uradi.
There is time.	Ima vremena.
They don't know anything about it.	Oni ne znaju ništa o tome.
If so, which one.	Ako jeste, koji.
I don't know what they can and can't do	Ne znam šta oni mogu, a šta ne mogu
I think that could be real	Mislim da bi to moglo biti i stvarno
I want to know the truth	Želim da znam istinu
She will be back.	Ona će se vratiti.
I was glad to be here tonight	Bilo mi je drago što je večeras ovdje
I can this time too	Mogu i ovaj put
I would like to say that it is, but it is not.	Voleo bih da kažem da jeste, ali nije.
He doesn't want any more.	Ne želi više.
I wouldn't try that	Ne bih to pokušao
I won't let him.	Neću mu dozvoliti.
You have to work the way you want.	Morate raditi kako želite.
Now you know almost everything.	Sada znate skoro sve.
It really wasn't necessary.	Zaista nije trebalo.
I should have talked to you about it right away	Trebao sam o tome odmah razgovarati s tobom
I very much doubt it	Veoma sumnjam
I have a lot to say.	Imam puno toga za reći.
I did everything he told me	Uradio sam sve što mi je rekao
I love him even more for that	Volim ga još više zbog toga
He said he knew and would.	Rekao je da zna i da će.
He wants it.	On to želi.
In fact, he was never sure of much.	Zapravo, nikada nije bio siguran u mnogo toga.
There must be something.	Mora da postoji nešto.
It shouldn't be like that.	Ne bi trebalo da bude tako.
I haven't seen you in a while	Nisam te vidio neko vrijeme
I was there to do it.	Bio sam tamo da je to uradio.
I think he would do a better job for you	Mislim da bi ti uradio bolji posao
I need to know the truth	Moram da znam istinu
They still don't know.	I dalje ne znaju.
I didn't think so long	Nisam mislio tako dugo
But you know, they're people.	Ali znate, oni su ljudi.
Maybe I can do something for you	Možda ću moći nešto učiniti za tebe
Just a few.	Samo nekoliko.
I think it will be so	Mislim da će biti tako
If someone says something, you did it.	Ako neko nešto kaže, ti si to uradio.
We need that.	To nam treba.
I should have known that	Trebao sam to znati
What we can help you with today.	U čemu vam danas možemo pomoći.
I actually thought so	Zapravo sam to i mislio
I couldn't trust him	Nisam mu mogao vjerovati
I don't work for him	Ne radim za njega
I've seen her do it before.	Video sam je ranije kako to radi.
I hope you do better.	Nadam se da ti ide bolje.
Not much is known about what exactly he does.	Ne zna se mnogo o tome šta tačno radi.
I knew how much you wanted something like that	Znao sam koliko želiš tako nešto
It was just her.	Bila je samo ona.
I didn't come to see you	Nisam došao da te vidim
I didn't even know what	Nisam ni znao šta
I want to tell you everything	Želim ti sve reći
I'm pretty sure of that	Skoro sam siguran u to
I ended up there last night	Sinoć sam završio tamo
I'm busy enough.	Ja sam dovoljno zauzet.
I thought he would like to know	Mislio sam da bi želeo da zna
I should go for it now	Trebao bih sada ići na to
You could have come back.	Mogao si se vratiti.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
Nothing will happen.	Ništa se neće dogoditi.
I just didn't want that life	Jednostavno nisam želeo taj život
I had to go back or leave	Morao sam se vratiti ili otići
But not really.	Ali ne baš.
I haven't done that in a while.	Nisam to već neko vrijeme.
Or tell me something.	Ili mi reci nešto.
He was ready.	Bio je spreman.
We're together tonight.	Večeras smo zajedno.
I have to do what he says	Moram da uradim šta kaže
I shouldn't have talked to him	Nisam trebao razgovarati s njim
I didn't want to be alone again	Nisam htela ponovo da budem sama
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisam mogao vjerovati.
I mean, nothing but me	Mislim, ništa osim mene
It happened here.	To se dogodilo ovdje.
I didn't ask for any of that	Nisam tražio ništa od toga
The truth about that is here.	Istina o tome je ovdje.
I really had no idea what he could do	Zaista nisam imao pojma šta bi mogao da uradi
Still no one came for him.	I dalje niko nije došao po njega.
I've never seen him want something so badly.	Nikad nisam vidio da želi nešto toliko.
We can do it.	Možemo to učiniti.
It was real life.	Bio je to pravi život.
It must be very difficult for him.	Mora da mu je jako teško.
You better not do that.	Bolje da to ne radiš.
I'm done here.	Završio sam ovdje.
The only people who would do that.	Jedini ljudi koji bi to uradili.
It wasn't that easy.	Nije bilo tako lako.
I didn't tell him it was my idea	Nisam mu rekla da je to moja ideja
I already had it, but I didn't say anything	Već sam ga imao, ali ništa nisam rekao
She said she couldn't.	Rekla je da ne može.
Just more.	Samo još više.
I thought we might be more than friends	Mislio sam da smo možda više od prijatelja
He didn't know what to think.	Nije znao šta da misli.
That couldn't be happening.	Nije moglo biti da se to dešava.
I guess she is too	Pretpostavljam da je i ona
She was here.	Bila je ovdje.
He needed money.	Trebao mu je novac.
I didn't really want him back	Nisam ga stvarno želio vratiti
And he never could be, never was.	I nikada nije mogao biti, nikada nije bio.
Not just them.	Ne samo oni.
I was still your father.	I dalje sam bio tvoj otac.
She knew it was true.	Znala je da je to istina.
I did all those things	Radio sam sve te stvari
I'm fine.	Ja sam u redu.
There seems to be something wrong	Čini se da nešto nije u redu
And so it was.	I tako je bilo.
We will not do that.	Nećemo to da radimo.
I know you can't help it	Znam da ne možeš pomoći
The question is true.	Pitanje je istina.
Everything is OK.	Sve je u redu.
I just need to know what you said.	Samo moram da znam šta si rekao.
I wasn't sure why.	Nisam bio siguran zašto.
I wish he hadn't come.	Voleo bih da nije došao.
He could tell right away that something was wrong.	Odmah je mogao reći da nešto nije u redu.
I told you this was a good idea	Rekao sam ti da je ovo dobra ideja
He had to be alone.	Morao je biti sam.
I want to have the right thing	Želim da imam pravu stvar
I said that, but it wasn't from me	Rekao sam to, ali to nije bilo od mene
It was really hard.	Bilo je to zaista teško.
And he left.	I on je otišao.
I mean, it was bad	Mislim, bilo je loše
She doesn't like them.	Ona ih ne voli.
I doubt he'll ever come back	Sumnjam da će se ikada više vratiti
And he had a lot of them.	A imao ih je dosta.
I think even he sees it	Mislim da čak i on to vidi
I wouldn't know anything.	Ne bih znao ništa.
I hope to see you all there!	Nadam se da ću vas sve vidjeti tamo!
You are not sure.	Niste sigurni.
I could never do something like that	Nikad ne bih mogao da uradim tako nešto
For you and him.	Za tebe i njega.
This is too much.	Ovo je previše.
I like that, you say	Sviđa mi se to, kažeš
They will help you there.	Oni će vam pomoći tamo.
I had nothing but time	Nisam imao ništa osim vremena
And he meant it.	I mislio je to.
It does almost everything together.	To zajedno čini skoro sve.
She said she had to go to work.	Rekla je da mora otići da ide na posao.
He had it for a long time.	Imao je to dugo vremena.
It's something you don't want to do.	To je nešto što ne želite da radite.
I want to see him again	Želim ga ponovo vidjeti
I also needed to work a little.	Trebao sam i malo raditi.
He still had little money and no job.	I dalje je imao malo novca i nije imao posao.
He must have been very happy to be home.	Mora da je bio veoma sretan što je kod kuće.
We don't know who it is.	Ne znamo ko je to.
But it’s so hard to get back on yourself.	Ali tako je teško vratiti se na sebe.
There is a problem with that.	Postoji problem sa tim.
I have to do everything myself	Sve moram sama
Just very, very hard.	Samo veoma, veoma teško.
There's one.	Tamo je jedan.
Now we know that's not true.	Sada znamo da to nije istina.
Very good for us.	Vrlo dobro za nas.
It seemed like I couldn't do better now.	Činilo se da sada ne mogu bolje.
He is not waiting.	On ne čeka.
No one should tell anyone, anywhere, ever.	Niko ne bi trebao reći nikome, bilo gdje, nikada.
I worked.	Radio sam.
I don't know anymore.	Ne znam više.
This happens when.	Ovo se dešava kada.
They are still here today.	I danas su tu.
Who could talk.	Ko bi mogao da priča.
Bad.	Loše.
I love easy.	Volim lako.
This is the truth.	Ovo je istina.
I knew what it was like	Znao sam kako je to
And another.	I još jedan.
I wouldn't be here to see them	Ne bih bio ovdje da ih vidim
I have no doubt about that	Ne sumnjam u to
To be here.	Biti ovdje.
I was just sorry	Samo mi je bilo žao
Very good times, very, very good times.	Vrlo dobra vremena, vrlo, vrlo dobra vremena.
I expected them from myself	Očekivao sam ih od sebe
And it is.	I jeste.
You came.	Došao si.
I didn't want to go home	Nisam htela da idem kući
He probably can't work yet.	On verovatno još ne može da radi.
It's happening here.	To se dešava ovde.
You have to help him.	Moraš mu pomoći.
Not everyone knows that.	Ne znaju svi to.
I thought you were just a man	Mislio sam da si samo čovjek
But we need to move on.	Ali treba ići dalje.
I know it was hard for you	Znam da ti je bilo teško
I can't go there anymore	Ne mogu više tamo
You know what makes me.	Znaš šta me to čini.
I said no.	Rekao sam ne.
I can't give it to him	Ne mogu mu dati
I mean it's you.	Mislim ti si ti.
Not much.	Nije puno.
I needed something to entertain me	Trebalo mi je nešto da me zabavi
I tried.	Pokušao sam.
I'm surprised he's not here for you.	Iznenađen sam da nije tu zbog tebe.
It should be good !.	Trebalo bi da bude dobro!.
He needs help.	Treba mu pomoć.
That way we can help.	Na taj način možemo pomoći.
I didn't know what to think or what to say	Nisam znao šta da mislim ni šta da kažem
I can't help myself	Ne mogu si pomoći
I had no idea what was wrong with that	Nisam imao pojma šta nije u redu s tim
You really can't win.	Zaista ne možeš pobijediti.
It took me a while.	Trebalo mi je neko vrijeme.
I was sure of it	Bio sam siguran u to
I didn't want to see her again	Nisam je želio ponovo vidjeti
I never could.	Nikad nisam mogao.
I think something is going to happen.	Mislim da će se nešto dogoditi.
I don't want to see them anymore.	Ne želim više da ih vidim.
He said he wasn't there.	Rekao je da ga nema.
I can't believe it was him	Ne mogu vjerovati da je to bio on
My father is back.	Moj otac se vratio.
He would never know.	Nikad ne bi znao.
All he had to do was wait.	Sve što je trebao da uradi je da čeka.
He didn't say anything.	Nije rekao ništa.
One of us has to go.	Jedan od nas mora da ide.
I'm so tired.	Tako sam umoran.
No, not the car.	Ne, ne auto.
I need to know something	Moram nešto da znam
he thought.	mislio je.
But it wasn't as bad as it could have been.	Ali nije bilo tako loše koliko je moglo biti.
.	.
I had to talk to him	Morao sam razgovarati s njim
What is this question currently doing?	Što ovo pitanje trenutno radi.
But not for this.	Ali ne za ovo.
I'm going to see him tomorrow	Idem da ga vidim sutra
Or not.	Ili nije.
I couldn't go back yet	Nisam se još mogao vratiti
I like it a lot more.	Sviđa mi se mnogo više.
But it was very good for me	Ali to je bilo jako dobro za mene
I hope you will do it again soon	Nadam se da ćete to uskoro ponovo učiniti
It's just you and me.	Samo smo ti i ja.
We do it quickly and easily.	Mi to radimo brzo i jednostavno.
He says no.	Kaže da nije.
I asked what year it was	Pitao sam koja je to godina
I was just wondering	Samo sam se pitao
I never would either	Ni ja nikad ne bih
Now we were in it together.	Sada smo bili u tome zajedno.
I heard about you	Čuo sam za tebe
I tried not to see it and I said	Pokušao sam da se to ne vidi i rekao sam
But money speaks, as always.	Ali novac govori, kao i uvek.
If you can help me.	Ako mi možete pomoći.
I guess we'll go.	Pretpostavljam da ćemo ići.
I really want to work	Zaista želim da radimo
She won't see them.	Ona ih neće vidjeti.
I don't even know what to say anymore.	Ne znam više ni šta da kažem.
I would go	Ja bih otišao
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
But they will never do that.	Ali oni to nikada neće učiniti.
They were new at the time.	U to vrijeme bili su novi.
I wasn't sure what to do	Nisam bio siguran šta da radim
I didn't want him to leave, not yet	Nisam želio da ode, ne još
I'm really happy to be here	Zaista sam sretan što sam ovdje
I can tell you're sick	Mogu reći da ti je loše
I know exactly what needs to be done	Znam tačno šta treba da se uradi
Nobody there wants to see you now.	Niko tamo ne želi da te vidi sada.
We knew he was there.	Znali smo da je tamo.
I wasn't sure at the time	Nisam bio siguran u vrijeme
I was fine what.	Bio sam u redu šta.
I just want to stay here	Samo želim ostati ovdje
He did a very good job.	Uradio je veoma dobar posao.
I still don't like it.	I dalje mi se ne sviđa.
But not much.	Ali ne puno.
Can someone help me please.	Može li mi neko pomoći molim vas.
I see what's going on	Vidim šta se dešava
This is a good thing for me right now.	Ovo je dobra stvar za mene trenutno.
But he never does.	Ali on to nikad ne čini.
You can't be sure.	Ne možete biti sigurni.
One could say how much he loved his job.	Moglo bi se reći koliko je volio svoj posao.
It was really bad.	Zaista je bilo loše.
I have already decided to love him	Već sam odlučio da ga volim
I didn't do anything for you or for myself	Nisam ništa uradio ni za tebe ni za sebe
A lot of people talk about it.	Mnogo ljudi priča o tome.
I want you to do the same today.	Želim da i ti to uradiš danas.
In fact, it probably is.	Zapravo, vjerovatno jeste.
I won't say more than that	Neću reći više od toga
Do the job.	Uradi posao.
Or that.	Ili to.
I like it a lot.	mnogo mi se sviđa.
It was just a story.	To je bila samo priča.
I'd like you to think of me	Voleo bih da misliš na mene
He didn't know how to do it.	Nije znao kako to da uradi.
She didn't want to go.	Ona nije htela da ide.
I had to believe you were fine	Morao sam vjerovati da si dobro
I mean, yes, everyone knows	Mislim, da, svi znaju
I didn't love you	Nisam te volio
I asked for it to be done	Tražio sam da se to uradi
I've never been there	Nikad nisam bio tamo
I loved all those things	Voleo sam sve te stvari
You're not doing anything.	Ne radiš ništa.
I could never be left alone	Nikada ne bih mogao ostati sam
And there were too many of them.	A bilo ih je previše.
Right now, you have to be first.	Upravo sada, morate biti prvi.
He just left.	Upravo je otišao.
It's been years now.	Sada su prošle godine.
This is your life.	To je tvoj život.
I saw that myself.	To sam i sam vidio.
I think she's fine.	Mislim da je ona dobro.
That was the only time we did it.	To je bio jedini put da smo to uradili.
I mean, you look good	Mislim, izgledaš dobro
I was glad to see that	Bilo mi je drago da to vidim
Not anymore, he says.	Ne više, kaže on.
I made them myself.	Napravio sam ih sam.
It really couldn't.	Zaista nije moglo.
All right.	U redu.
And so it should have been.	I tako je trebao biti.
I want it to be real	Želim da bude stvarno
Even if they don't know you know.	Čak i ako oni ne znaju da ti znaš.
There are people here.	Ima ljudi ovdje.
I'm sure there would be several.	Siguran sam da bi ih bilo nekoliko.
If he was.	Ako je bio.
Maybe we shouldn't.	Možda ne bismo trebali.
Many things could have happened	Mnogo stvari se moglo dogoditi
You certainly don't need money now.	Sada ti sigurno ne treba novac.
It's not.	Nije.
I tried.	Pokušao sam.
I couldn't do anything about it	Nisam mogao ništa s tim
I mean, he really loves me	Mislim, stvarno me voli
I just have no idea	Jednostavno nemam pojma
I should see something.	Trebalo bi da vidim nešto.
I'm not so sure about that.	Nisam baš siguran u to.
They really had no idea.	Zaista nisu imali pojma.
I hope he gets it.	Nadam se da će dobiti.
I have a question for you.	Imam pitanje za tebe.
I don't have it anymore.	Ja ga više nemam.
I will never return	Nikada se neću vratiti
I can't even until next week	Ne mogu čak ni do sljedeće sedmice
It's a game.	To je igra.
But those are the years from now.	Ali to su godine od sada.
I know you haven't been here that much before	Znam da nisi bio ovde toliko mnogo ranije
I didn't say how long.	Nisam rekao koliko dugo.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
It could have been anyone.	Mogao je biti bilo koji.
I'm not going there.	Ne idem tamo.
We can, you and me.	Možemo i mi, ti i ja.
I just wanted to know what it was	Samo sam htela da znam šta je to
That's life.	To je život.
I guess he asked them how they were	Pretpostavljam da ih je pitao kako su
She wasn't here yesterday or today.	Nije bila ovdje ni juče ni danas.
You need to know what could happen.	Treba znati šta bi se moglo dogoditi.
Looks like a good thing.	Izgleda kao dobra stvar.
I didn't really expect that	Nisam to zaista očekivao
I guess we'll stay for now	Pretpostavljam da ćemo ostati za sada
But it is true.	Ali to je istina.
I know you can't bring me back	Znam da me ne možeš vratiti
You are one of us now.	Sada si jedan od nas.
That was not a problem.	To nije bio problem.
Something was wrong.	Nešto nije bilo u redu.
I wonder why we're here	Pitam se zašto smo ovdje
And yes, you did.	I da, jesi.
And you can.	I možeš.
And he says yes.	I on kaže da.
That will do it.	To će to učiniti.
That will help you.	To će ti pomoći.
I know this is really hard for you	Znam da ti je ovo zaista teško
I asked him when it happened	Pitao sam ga kada se to dogodilo
I'm not going.	Ne idem.
All for that.	Sve za to.
Do it again.	Uradite to ponovo.
Let's see how it is.	Da vidim kako je.
I'd say you're absolutely right	Rekao bih da si potpuno u pravu
People told me it would be good to move on.	Ljudi su mi rekli da bi bilo dobro da idem dalje.
I have no idea what this is about	Nemam pojma o čemu se radi
I really love him	Zaista ga volim
I wondered how that could be	Pitao sam se kako bi to moglo biti
People knew that.	Ljudi su to znali.
I gave you so much	Dao sam ti sve toliko
So far, maybe.	Do sada, možda.
I couldn't help what happened	Nisam mogao pomoći šta se dogodilo
There aren't that many.	Nema ih toliko.
But it doesn’t work in just one way.	Ali ne radi samo na jedan način.
I don't want to know who she is.	Ne želim da znam ko je ona.
They weren't here tonight.	Nisu bili ovdje večeras.
Something no one can really say.	Nešto što niko zaista ne može reći.
Do what you have to.	Radite ono što morate.
We all like it.	Svima nam se sviđa.
Really, really good job.	Zaista, stvarno dobar posao.
And there must be things there.	I tamo mora da ima stvari.
He had to do this.	Morao je ovo da uradi.
I have my job	Imam svoj posao
I think you should have known	Mislim da si morao znati
Good, good, she said.	Dobro, dobro, rekla je.
He had us.	Imao nas je.
Don't do it for me.	Ne radi to za mene.
I can't be here anymore	Ne mogu više biti ovdje
I can't go back now	Ne mogu se sada vratiti
I can't believe this is happening	Ne mogu vjerovati da se ovo dešava
I need to know when he realized he loved me	Moram da znam kada je shvatio da me voli
I did as you asked of me	Uradio sam kako si tražio od mene
But the thing is, it's not that simple.	Ali stvar je u tome da nije tako jednostavno.
I think he's right	Mislim da je u pravu
Maybe he won't say anything.	Možda neće ništa reći.
More is obviously better.	Više je očigledno bolje.
Not much, but it's life.	Nije mnogo, ali je život.
I had to be.	Morao sam biti.
But there was more to do.	Ali bilo je još toga za uraditi.
He looks like that.	On tako izgleda.
I wanted her.	Želeo sam je.
In fact, I think so	Zapravo to i mislim
I was fine.	Bio sam dobro.
No, but you need it.	Ne, ali ti treba.
She told me she still loved him.	Rekla mi je da ga i dalje voli.
I want to be good enough	Želim da budem dovoljno dobar
I see her tomorrow	Vidim je sutra
I didn't know what was going on anymore	Nisam više znao šta se dešava
I heard him tell you about it	Čuo sam ga kako ti priča o tome
I just needed the money.	Samo mi je trebao novac.
I didn't get the money	Nisam dobio novac
But you have to go there.	Ali moraš ići tamo.
Not as good as mine.	Nije tako dobro kao moj.
I can't help him now	Ne mogu mu sada pomoći
I shouldn't be.	Ne bih trebao biti.
I didn't want help	Nisam želeo pomoć
I wonder if she even knows that.	Pitam se da li ona to uopšte zna.
Yes it is.	Da tu je.
He said yes.	Rekao je da.
He never did.	Nikad nije.
A good job is a good job	Dobar posao je dobar posao
We all were.	Svi smo bili.
They had both.	Imali su oboje.
I felt better, but not enough	Bilo mi je bolje, ali ne dovoljno
I didn't think it was that bad	Nisam mislio da je bilo tako loše
They won't do it.	Oni to neće uraditi.
But he was happy.	Ali bio je sretan.
But he was gone, she told herself, and he would never return.	Ali on je otišao, rekla je sebi, i nikada se neće vratiti.
I mean, maybe we shouldn't	Mislim, možda ne bismo trebali
But now it works.	Ali sada radi.
I'll just say this	Reći ću jednostavno ovo
And I thought there was more to it	I ja sam mislio da ima više toga
Even that is not all.	Čak ni to nije sve.
I have no idea what happened	Nemam pojma šta se dogodilo
And I can do bad things.	A mogu i loše stvari.
You are not here.	Vi niste ovdje.
I didn't hear him either	Ni ja ga nisam čuo
He never said anything.	Nikad ništa nije rekao.
He should have.	Trebao je.
That was pretty hard	To je bilo prilično teško
I have it for myself too.	Imam i za sebe.
Which wasn't much for me.	Što mi nije bilo puno.
I was ready to go home	Bio sam spreman da idem kući
And there is much more.	I ima još mnogo toga.
I never had to.	Nikad nisam morao.
I want him to leave	Želim da ode
Do it the right way.	Uradite to na pravi način.
He seems to have wanted more.	Čini se da je želio više.
I couldn't see it	Nisam to mogao vidjeti
That's been a long time.	To je prilično dugo.
And that would be it.	I to bi bilo to.
That could be a while	To bi moglo biti neko vrijeme
It was a little too much for him today	Bilo je to malo previše za njega danas
I like this guy right now	Sviđa mi se ovaj momak trenutno
Something was wrong.	Nešto nije bilo u redu.
We know who she is.	Znamo ko je ona.
I've only been there a few times.	Bio sam tamo samo nekoliko puta.
Yes, do it.	Da, uradi to.
I'm here now.	Sada sam ovde.
I wouldn't be here without it.	Bez toga ne bih bio ovde.
He will come after you.	Doći će za tobom.
I was glad he left	Bilo mi je drago što je otišao
I never thought it would ever happen to me	Nikad nisam mislio da će mi se to ikada dogoditi
You can do that too.	Možete i to.
I wondered what else he knew	Pitao sam se šta još zna
Next year.	Sljedeće godine.
I guess that can be said	Pretpostavljam da se to može reći
But he knows that's not the case anymore.	Ali on zna da to više nije tako.
I would love to help a lot	Volio bih puno pomoći
It would be bad.	Bilo bi loše.
I wanted to be the one to tell you	Želeo sam da budem taj koji će ti sam reći
He never was.	Nikada ga nije bilo.
I think he feels that makes him look bad	Mislim da osjeća da zbog toga izgleda loše
I think you are too	Mislim da si i ti
If they could, they would.	Da su mogli, imali bi.
I told him, and he asked if he would stay.	Rekao sam mu, a on je pitao da li će ostati.
I couldn't do my job	Nisam mogao da radim svoj posao
One could only say.	Moglo bi se samo reći.
I know it's not like that	Znam da nije tako
I really didn't want to go	Zaista nisam htela da idem
I don't have, as you know.	Nemam, kao što znate.
We did a really good job.	Uradili smo to zaista dobar posao.
You have to too.	Morate i vi.
I need help here.	Treba mi pomoć ovdje.
I saw him at a party	Video sam ga na zabavi
They are .	Oni su .
I know exactly how it is	Znam tačno kako je to
I saw it all, but I wasn’t here	Sve sam to vidio, ali nisam bio ovdje
I have no idea what this is about	Nemam pojma o čemu se radi
I wasn't ready for this	Nisam bio spreman za ovo
No, you're not done.	Ne, nisi završio.
There is that too.	Ima i toga.
We both know that's not true.	Oboje znamo da to nije istina.
You always want to do the right thing.	Uvek želiš da uradiš pravu stvar.
All of them, actually.	Svi oni, zapravo.
I love her maybe too much	Volim je možda previše
I always wondered who made it	Uvek sam se pitao ko ga je napravio
I wonder why we're here	Pitam se zašto smo ovdje
Right away.	Odmah.
He didn't look so hard.	Nije izgledao tako teško.
I'm right.	u pravu sam.
That was hard.	To je bilo teško.
Let me tell you.	Da ti kažem.
I didn't want to be seen	Nisam želeo da se vidi
There seemed to be no time for weeks.	Činilo se da sedmice nema vremena.
I was glad enough about it	Bilo mi je dovoljno drago zbog toga
A lot of that.	Mnogo toga.
I've never seen anything like it	Nikada nisam video tako nešto
He must have come to tell him something.	Mora da je došao da mu nešto kaže.
I want you in me.	Želim te u sebi.
He had no idea what he would find.	Nije imao pojma šta će naći.
He loves you.	On te voli.
If we had known before.	Da smo znali ranije.
I couldn't tell him anything	Nisam mu mogao ništa reći
There was nothing more to say.	Nije bilo šta više da se kaže.
He was all about it	On je bio sve o tome
There was something wrong here.	Ovdje nešto nije bilo u redu.
But you didn't.	Ali nisi.
I would like to see you.	Voleo bih da te vidim.
I guess that's it	Pretpostavljam da je to to
I see that happening.	Vidim da se to dešava.
I can't help you	Ne mogu ti biti od pomoći
No, it wasn't her.	Ne, to nije bila ona.
There is too much to say.	Ima previše toga za reći.
I couldn't say anything	Nisam mogao ništa reći
And you know it is.	I znate da jeste.
I certainly didn't want to.	Ja sigurno nisam htela.
We've had enough.	Bilo nam je dosta.
You probably knew that.	Verovatno ste to znali.
He doesn't know anything about anything anymore.	On više ništa ne zna ni o čemu.
He still has them so far.	On ih i dalje ima do sada.
I guess it could be.	Pretpostavljam da bi mogao biti.
He had never left before.	Nikad nije otišao ranije.
Very, very tired.	Veoma, veoma umoran.
I see who the person is	Vidim ko je osoba
I always expected it to be.	Uvek sam očekivao da će biti.
How do you do that?	Kako to radiš?
I want to know what's wrong with him	Želim da znam šta nije u redu s njim
And that is true.	I to je istina.
We know how it is here.	Znamo kako je ovdje.
O says we need to talk	O kaže da moramo razgovarati
I have money.	Imam novca.
But that's it.	Ali to je to.
Maybe that's why.	Možda je to razlog zašto.
No, not maybe.	Ne, ne možda.
He did just that.	On je upravo to uradio.
I'm not sure why	Nisam siguran zašto
There are a lot of people.	Ima mnogo ljudi.
There were a lot of people.	Bilo je puno ljudi.
I want to know more about it	Želim da znam više o tome
But that does not exist.	Ali to ne postoji.
I immediately know what works and what doesn't.	Odmah znam šta radi, a šta ne.
Maybe you are.	Možda jesi.
You have to know the truth.	Morate znati istinu.
I need a few.	Treba mi nekoliko.
Nobody will buy anything from him.	Od njega niko ništa neće kupiti.
I have to say he does his job really well	Moram reći da zaista dobro radi svoj posao
I think we are a really good team	Mislim da smo zaista dobar tim
I wish they were there	Voleo bih da su tu
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
They had a lot of problems.	Imali su mnogo problema.
And look at this.	I vidi ovo.
There's a lot going on with you.	Mnogo toga se dešava sa tobom.
I knew it wouldn't help me	Znao sam da mi to neće pomoći
Who, what and why.	Ko, šta i zašto.
Yes yes yes.	Da da da.
I don't have time for this right now	Trenutno nemam vremena za ovo
You couldn't stay with me.	Nisi mogao ostati sa mnom.
But that's more.	Ali to je više.
And tomorrow could be fine.	I sutra bi moglo biti u redu.
Several times in fact.	Nekoliko puta u stvari.
That would be it.	To bi bilo to.
Business probably.	Posao vjerovatno.
When it's good, it's good.	Kad je dobro, dobro je.
It's real, people.	Stvarno je, ljudi.
I think you already know that	Mislim da to već znaš
He has it.	On to ima.
We both knew that.	Oboje smo to znali.
I knew something was wrong with me	Znao sam da nešto nije u redu sa mnom
I just hope there is time for me now	Samo se nadam da sada ima vremena za mene
I won't say anything more.	Neću reći ništa više.
That was the reason.	To je bio razlog.
For no one.	Ni za koga.
He does not tell us what it was.	On nam ne govori šta je to bilo.
I won't be there to see him.	Neću biti tu da ga vidim.
I asked him about last night	Pitao sam ga za sinoć
I did it, if you want.	Uradio sam to, ako želiš.
I have to do this, I always do	Moram ovo da radim, uvek sam
I want to go to work	Želim ići na posao
I wonder more and more if they are right.	Sve se više pitam da li su u pravu.
I can't really see them	Ne mogu ih stvarno vidjeti
There was nothing for it.	Nije bilo ništa za to.
He was the only guy there.	On je bio jedini momak tamo.
I've told him so many times he shouldn't	Toliko puta sam mu rekao da ne treba
But it actually happens quite often.	Ali zapravo se to dešava prilično često.
But that was my life.	Ali tu je bio moj život.
But there was no problem.	Ali nije bilo problema.
But it's just me.	Ali to sam samo ja.
I must have done it this time	Mora da sam to uradio ovaj put
I know why he would look for me	Znam zašto bi me tražio
I guess he had a good reason	Pretpostavljam da je imao dobar razlog
Do not tell me.	Nemoj mi reći.
You don't have to say more.	Ne moraš više da kažeš.
She said something about it.	Rekla je nešto o tome.
I don't think anyone really knows.	Mislim da niko zaista ne zna.
I didn't have a code	Nisam imao kod
That was true.	To je bila istina.
They are no better than us.	Nisu bolji od nas.
We didn't know what happened to us.	Nismo znali šta nam se dogodilo.
I would make them if they weren't alone	Napravio bih ih, da nisu sami
I just heard about it	Samo sam čuo za to
I'm not going with you.	Ne idem s tobom.
Can't you.	Zar ne možeš.
I want to talk to you more	Želim više razgovarati s tobom
I already told you that	Već sam ti to rekao
I never thought you'd do that	Nikad nisam mislio da ćeš to uraditi
It can be a pretty good game.	To može biti prilično dobra igra.
He knew it could be bad.	Znao je da može biti loše.
That's what it was.	To je ono što je bilo.
I needed something more	Trebalo mi je nešto više
No, he didn't need anything.	Ne, nije mu ništa trebalo.
He really loves me.	On me zaista voli.
I'm in it now.	Sada sam u tome.
I heard everything.	Čuo sam sve.
I would be fine alone	Bio bih dobro sam
I did not understand.	Nisam shvatio.
I just want him to know something is going on.	Samo želim da zna da se nešto dešava.
I didn't know if he was still driving	Nisam znao da li još uvek vozi
He tells me yes.	Kaže mi da.
It's just that it never happened.	Samo što se to nikada nije dogodilo.
Yes, she said.	Da, rekla je.
But nothing was as bad as this.	Ali ništa nije bilo tako loše kao ovo.
I really don't know what's going to happen.	Zaista ne znam šta će se dogoditi.
I know something happened	Znam da se nešto dogodilo
So it works.	Tako da radi.
I still had no idea who she was.	Još nisam imao pojma ko je ona.
I'm not helping you now	Ja ti sada nisam od pomoći
As if nothing had happened.	Kao da se ništa nije dogodilo.
Like us.	Kao i mi.
I didn't want to ask.	Nisam htela da pitam.
No, not yet.	Ne, za sada nema.
That's not a good idea either.	Ni to nije dobra ideja.
He needed this.	Trebalo mu je ovo.
I can either stay there or move on	Mogu ili ostati tamo ili ići dalje
And that's us.	I to smo mi.
Can we be trusted?	Može li nam se vjerovati?
That's the problem.	To je problem.
He said he was not surprised.	Rekao je da nije iznenađen.
I'm not sure about that.	Nisam siguran u to.
Or for any of us.	Ili za bilo koga od nas.
I know you have to do this	Znam da moraš ovo da uradiš
Even when he comes.	Čak i kada dođe.
I've never seen any of you eat	Nikada nisam video da neko od vas jede
He already knew that.	On je to već znao.
I wondered if she was still there	Pitao sam se da li je još uvijek tu
I guess that's a good thing	Pretpostavljam da je to dobra stvar
I still think he could.	I dalje mislim da bi mogao.
This is where the code works.	Ovdje kod radi.
There was something to do.	Bilo je nešto za raditi.
You have a problem.	Imaš problem.
She would never want that.	Ona to nikada ne bi htela.
I knew something good was going to happen	Znao sam da će se nešto dobro dogoditi
Nobody did anything.	Niko ništa nije uradio.
I still have it today	Imam ga i danas
I often wonder if something is wrong with that.	Često se pitam da li nešto nije u redu s tim.
I wish someone could say more.	Voleo bih da neko može reći više.
Everything seems fine.	Sve izgleda u redu.
You know how to get there.	Znate kako do tamo.
And that may be the real reason.	I to je možda pravi razlog.
We don't know how.	Ne znamo kako.
I know how it works	Znam kako to radi
I still haven't.	Još uvek nisam.
She was not what he wanted.	Ona nije bila ono što je želio.
It will be so.	To će biti tako.
You couldn't see them.	Nisi ih mogao vidjeti.
This is pretty easy to see.	Ovo je prilično lako vidjeti.
And I did it.	I uradio sam to.
I completely lost it.	Potpuno sam ga izgubio.
I didn't mean, you know, that way	Nisam mislio, znaš, na taj način
The job is bad.	Posao je loš.
Good for everyone.	Dobro za sve.
I went back to the house	Vratio sam se do kuće
Nothing happened.	Ništa se nije dogodilo.
I've never heard of this	Nikad nisam čuo za ovo
I had a good life, but there was little money	Imao sam dobar život, ali novca je bilo malo
I should be glad to see him	Trebalo bi mi biti drago da ga vidim
I see it again.	Vidim to ponovo.
Which none of us have.	Koje niko od nas nema.
There are so many of them.	Tako ih ima mnogo.
I wasn't there	Nisam bio tamo
So far so good.	Za sada je dobro.
The money is safe, says the guy.	Novac je siguran, kaže momak.
If you want.	Ako želiš.
I would certainly understand that.	Ja bih to sigurno shvatio.
You are alone.	Sami ste.
I know it always has to be, in its own way	Znam da uvijek mora biti, na svoj način
It's good to be alone	Dobro mi je biti sam
It took a while.	Trebalo je malo vremena.
I have no idea what's next.	Nemam pojma šta dalje.
I just wonder if it was enough	Samo se pitam da li je bilo dovoljno
But he had to say it.	Ali morao je to da kaže.
He always plays well.	Uvek igra dobro.
They can't be that.	Oni to ne mogu biti.
She didn't want to tell him why.	Nije htela da mu kaže zašto.
I went back to school today	Danas sam se vratio u školu
I thought it could be	Mislio sam da bi mogao biti
I just wanted to say	Samo sam htela da kažem
We, we, we.	Mi, mi, mi.
No, please, no.	Ne, molim te, ne.
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije.
Nobody wants that.	Niko to ne želi.
I couldn't believe what she just told me	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta mi je upravo rekla
I really just wasn’t there	Zaista jednostavno nisam bio tamo
Is and and.	Je i i.
You have to do it.	Moraš to uraditi.
I don't know what's wrong with that now.	Ne znam šta je sada s tim.
She doesn't see it that way.	Ona to ne vidi tako.
I just ever.	Ja samo ikada.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
I would do anything for both.	Učinio bih sve za oboje.
And we all have it.	I svi to imamo.
I hope this helps you.	Nadam se da će vam ovo pomoći.
we know that.	mi to znamo.
I have to go to work.	Moram na posao.
This could just be me.	Ovo bi mogao biti samo ja.
I gave him a job.	Dao sam mu posao.
He may never come.	Možda nikada neće doći.
I couldn't do that	Ne bih to mogao
Life is so good.	Život je tako dobar.
There was money.	Bilo je novca.
I didn't want to know more.	Nisam htela da znam više.
Now was not the time.	Sada nije bilo vrijeme.
He didn't want to talk to anyone.	Nije želio da priča, ni sa kim.
I think he's really gone	Mislim da je stvarno otišao
I think that's it.	Mislim da je to to.
This is another one.	Ovo je još jedan.
I wonder if she's alone.	Pitam se da li je sama.
I can't even be sorry about that.	Ne mogu ni da mi bude žao zbog toga.
To tell me what to do.	Da mi se kaže šta da radim.
I'm so sorry for both of you	Tako mi je žao vas oboje
Life is lived.	Život se živi.
I was actually sorry	Zapravo mi je bilo žao
More is better.	Više je bolje.
I just couldn't	Jednostavno nisam mogao
I asked him what was wrong.	Pitao sam ga šta nije u redu.
I can't work for you	Ne mogu raditi za tebe
I thought he was in the house.	Mislio sam da je u kući.
She didn't want to be someone she never was again.	Nije htela da bude neko ko nikada više nije bila.
I should do that.	Trebalo bi to da uradim.
I've seen all this before	Sve sam ovo već vidio
But she is.	Ali ona jeste.
I think you know too.	Mislim da i ti znaš.
I just wanted you to know	Samo sam htela da znaš
I guess she'll be fine	Pretpostavljam da će biti u redu
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
I didn't seem to be able to help myself.	Činilo se da si nisam mogao pomoći.
I don't think he wants to talk anymore	Mislim da ne želi više da priča
There is more.	Ima još toga.
I have to get back to that	Moram se vratiti na to
This was it.	Ovo je bilo.
I have another appointment	Imam još jedan sastanak
I don't know what exactly it has been until today.	Ne znam šta je to tačno bilo do danas.
I didn't know what to think or say	Nisam znao šta da mislim ili kažem
I had to buy it.	Morao sam to kupiti.
I didn't mean it that way.	Nisam to tako mislio.
She didn't want to get it there.	Ona to nije htela dobiti tamo.
I haven't seen it this year.	Nisam to vidio ove godine.
I can't help myself	Ne mogu si pomoći
I wish you could	Voleo bih da si mogao
I think maybe it should be too much	Mislim da bi možda trebalo da bude previše
I'm telling you, she's fine.	Kažem ti da je dobro.
One for him, one for me, he said.	Jedan za njega, jedan za mene, rekao je.
We have to work together.	Moramo raditi zajedno.
I think so	Mislim da jeste
I figured this could be good	Shvatio sam da bi ovo moglo biti dobro
He was glad.	Bilo mu je drago.
He was right.	Bio je u pravu.
So that's a good thing.	Tako da je to dobra stvar.
Probably true.	Verovatno je tačno.
I'll tell you what's going on.	Reći ću ti šta se dešava.
I'd like to say you can, but you can't.	Želeo bih da kažem da možeš, ali ne možeš.
That will help us.	To će nam pomoći.
I want to know what it is	Želim da znam šta je to
Everything will be fine.	Sve će biti u redu.
That's a lot.	To je puno.
I'm not what you think	Nisam ono što misliš
Not to be real.	Da ne bude stvarno.
Nothing so far.	Ništa do sada.
I knew it existed but	Znao sam da postoji ali
I still couldn't find it.	Još nisam mogao naći.
Nobody knows what will happen.	Niko ne zna šta će se dogoditi.
A little more.	Još malo.
I couldn't see anyone	Nisam mogao nikoga da vidim
Just a little.	Samo malo.
And that's not one way to help.	I to nije jedan način da se pomogne.
I wish it was that simple	Voleo bih da je tako jednostavno
But now he's gone.	Ali sada ga nema.
I've had enough	Dosta mi je bilo
Maybe for the first time.	Možda prvi put.
Now he knew he should.	Sada je znao da je trebao.
Not with you either.	Ni kod tebe.
He didn't know how right he was.	Nije znao koliko je bio u pravu.
He won't.	Neće.
I want to be happy again	Želim ponovo biti sretan
He was there, it was enough.	Bio je tu, bilo je dovoljno.
He wouldn't want that.	On to ne bi želio.
It's not that bad, 'she said.	Nije tako loše', rekla je.
But he seems to be right.	Ali izgleda da je u pravu.
I think you could really be something	Mislim da bi ti zaista mogao biti nešto
It's not that hard.	Nije tako teško.
I'm not you anymore	Nisam više ti
That's the way you want it, isn't it.	To je način na koji to želiš, zar ne.
I asked you to tell me	Zamolio sam te da mi kažeš
You know it is.	Znate da je.
He would be right.	Bio bi u pravu.
And it's not.	I nije.
I need to talk to you.	Moram razgovarati s tobom.
But no one knows what will happen.	Ali niko ne zna šta će se dogoditi.
They are not at home.	Nisu kod kuće.
I already know how to do business	Već znam kako se radi posao
I can come again tonight	Mogu ponovo doći večeras
I wondered what had happened to him	Pitao sam se šta mu se dogodilo
That was a good question.	To je bilo dobro pitanje.
I am not allowed to work anymore	Nije mi dozvoljeno da radim više
I don't know about this one.	Ne znam za ovaj.
I know what you got.	Znam šta imaš.
Yes, everything is correct.	Da, sve je tačno.
It was a good team.	Bio je to dobar tim.
He knew that himself.	I sam je to znao.
Except it's going to happen again.	Osim što će se to još dogoditi.
You've been here three months.	Ovdje ste tri mjeseca.
He was ready for this	Bio je spreman za ovo
Not my problem.	Nije moj problem.
I was here before, just a few days ago	Bio sam ovdje prije, samo prije nekoliko dana
I have to find her.	Moram je naći.
I have nothing to say	Nemam šta da kažem
That won't happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
Actually, it wasn't that bad.	Zapravo, nije bilo tako loše.
But you shouldn't.	Ali ne bi trebalo.
I'm not now.	Nisam sada.
That's good for him.	To je dobro za njega.
But not for me.	Ali ne za mene.
So far.	Do sada.
Nobody's been here long.	Niko nije ovdje dugo.
Not for the money.	Ne zbog novca.
I don't know how to say no.	Ne znam kako da kažem ne.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I know how it was	Znam kako je bilo
I was actually happy to be home	Zapravo sam bio sretan što sam kod kuće
You're not.	Nisi.
I know you are.	Znam da jesi.
This is no longer true.	Ovo više nije istina.
He should.	Trebalo bi mu.
Don't tell him.	Nemoj mu reći.
I thought of that too	I ja sam mislio na to
I won't be home tonight	Neću biti kući, večeras
You said you would help me.	Rekao si da ćeš mi pomoći.
But it wasn't her.	Ali to nije bila ona.
We have so few friends there.	Imamo tako malo prijatelja tamo.
He never returned.	Nikad se nije vratio.
But I have a question	Ali imam pitanje
I thought, maybe a little over thirty	Mislio sam, možda nešto više od trideset
I know it can happen to you	Znam da ti se to može dogoditi
A few more.	Još nekoliko.
I would never ask anyone	Nikada nikoga ne bih pitao
Is not it? 	zar ne?
No, they won't.	Ne, neće.
I'm not doing what someone wants me to do	Ne radim ono što neko želi da radim
I really hope it will be good	Zaista se nadam da će biti dobro
That would really be something.	To bi zaista bilo nešto.
This man is a man.	Ovaj čovjek je čovjek.
I didn't tell anyone about it	Nisam nikome rekao za to
You can too.	Možeš i ti.
I told him it wasn't much	Rekao sam mu da to nije puno
Or maybe it's over.	Ili je možda završio.
He won and came back.	Dobio je i vratio se.
I can't tell you this	Ne mogu ti ovo reći
He had to go.	Morao je da ide.
I'm going to talk to him now.	Idem razgovarati s njim sada.
I never want to see her again.	Ne želim je više nikada vidjeti.
I didn't know you'd be here by this morning	Nisam znao da ćeš doći do jutros
I needed to see something	Trebao sam nešto vidjeti
And that's it and that's it.	I to je to i to je sve.
I haven't seen him before.	Nisam ga vidio ranije.
I could see it all, really	Mogao sam sve to vidjeti, zaista
He probably has.	Verovatno ima.
I don't know if that's still happening.	Ne znam da li se to još dešava.
The thing is.	Stvar je u tome.
But it's just a meeting.	Ali to je samo sastanak.
Maybe none of that really happened.	Možda se ništa od toga zaista nije dogodilo.
He couldn't tell.	Nije mogao reći.
It's easy to see why	Lako je vidjeti zašto
I saw him.	Video sam ga.
Really simple.	Zaista jednostavno.
She wants to go.	Ona želi da ode.
I hope he knows what he's doing	Nadam se da zna šta radi
You're so tired.	Tako si umoran.
I know what you're thinking now.	Znam šta sada misliš.
I'm so good.	Tako sam dobar.
I have no doubt about that	Ne sumnjam u to
He had to go home.	Morao je da ide kući.
Why buy a new one ?.	Zašto kupiti novi?.
I want to leave.	Želim otići.
I think that's true	Mislim da je to tačno
But there was no one.	Ali nije bilo nikoga.
I didn't know better	Nisam znao bolje
I decided it was.	Odlučio sam da jeste.
I've only known him for a few days	Znam ga samo nekoliko dana
he wondered	pitao se on
I have to do something	Moram nešto da uradim
Even if you're right, we shouldn't be doing this.	Čak i ako ste u pravu, ne bismo trebali ovo da radimo.
She was right.	Bila je u pravu.
But it must be safe.	Ali mora biti sigurno.
I still don't know how he did it.	Još uvek ne znam kako je to uradio.
I told him how it all happened	Rekao sam mu kako se sve dogodilo
I did it last year	Uradio sam to prošle godine
I didn't try to reach him	Nisam pokušao doći do njega
I'm not saying it's bad	Ne kažem da je to loše
He told me he had something to tell me.	Rekao mi je da ima nešto da mi kaže.
And it is.	I jeste.
It may not be tomorrow.	Sutra možda neće biti.
And I told him everything	I ja sam mu sve rekao
We are doing so well.	Toliko nam ide.
Yes, that's a good thing.	Da, to je dobra stvar.
I hope he comes after us.	Nadam se da će doći za nama.
It's a.	To je a.
I want to go tomorrow	Želim da idem sutra
I mean, there were no people	Mislim, nije bilo ljudi
It was just there.	Jednostavno je bilo tamo.
It could be.	Moglo bi biti.
He can't believe it.	Ne može vjerovati.
Maybe it's real.	Možda je stvarno.
That's what you want.	To je ono što želiš.
I guess you should know	Pretpostavljam da bi trebao znati
That wasn't really a problem.	To zapravo i nije bio problem.
This is simply not the case.	Ovo jednostavno nije tako.
I want that life.	Želim taj život.
I told him we wouldn't do it	Rekao sam mu da to nećemo učiniti
I wasn't sure	Nisam bio baš siguran
Very few people can do that.	Vrlo malo ljudi to može učiniti.
It was there.	Bilo je tamo.
Now the question is what happened.	Sada je pitanje šta se dogodilo.
That will never happen.	To se nikada neće dogoditi.
I can never find her.	Nikad je ne mogu naći.
Don't be so kind to us.	Nemoj biti tako dobar prema nama.
I just didn’t know it was that bad.	Samo nisam znao da je tako loše.
Those were the people.	To su bili ti ljudi.
I only thought of myself	Mislio sam samo na sebe
But that was before that.	Ali to je bilo i prije toga.
Easy is good.	Lako je dobro.
I haven't yet	Nisam još
I want you to have it	Želim da ga imaš
We're not doing that right now.	Trenutno to ne radimo.
I didn't even know who she was	Nisam ni znao ko je ona
I guess that might be true	Pretpostavljam da bi to moglo biti istina
Did you.	Da li si.
Except not really, obviously.	Osim ne baš, očigledno.
I want to do this for him	Želim ovo da uradim za njega
It could be something.	Moglo bi biti nešto.
I knew he didn't want to see me	Znao sam da ne želi da me vidi
Something happened here, something real.	Nešto se dogodilo ovdje, nešto stvarno.
I'm sorry about that, but it's not about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga, ali ne radi se o tome.
He no longer said the exact time.	Više nije rekao tačno vrijeme.
We have to find him.	Moramo ga naći.
I didn't know what was what	Nisam znao šta je šta
I have to think.	Moram da mislim.
I'm very glad about that.	Veoma mi je drago zbog toga.
But there was nothing better.	Ali nije bilo ništa bolje.
That day was not like today.	Taj dan nije bio kao danas.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
I can't say more about it	Ne mogu reći više o tome
You don't know what you're doing.	Ne znaš šta radiš.
I hope you are all well.	Nadam se da ste svi dobro.
You can go, you can go.	Možeš otići, možeš otići.
She wants, she wants.	Ona želi, ona želi.
I really had to see them	Zaista sam morao da ih vidim
There were many of them.	Bilo ih je mnogo.
I hope not.	Nadam se da nije.
But it won't.	Ali neće.
He didn't start eating.	Nije počeo da jede.
Next week.	Sljedeće sedmice.
Yes, that's right.	Da, to je tako.
For now, this is what you want to know.	Za sada, ovo je ono što želite da znate.
I never asked you for anything	Nikad nisam ništa tražio od tebe
It's not easy.	To nije lako.
I'm always there for you	Uvek sam tu za tebe
That was not good.	To nije bilo dobro.
Maybe it will be this week.	Možda će biti ove sedmice.
we have to go back.	moramo se vratiti.
But we didn't.	Ali nismo.
I like it there	Sviđa mi se tamo
Just why, he didn't know.	Samo zašto, nije znao.
But he was not pleased.	Ali nije mu bilo drago.
I'm sorry about him	Žao mi je zbog njega
I had no idea you'd even see it	Nisam imao pojma da ćeš to čak ni vidjeti
There is something in that.	Ima nešto u tome.
I really didn't need this at the moment	Ovo mi trenutno zaista nije trebalo
I wonder what else is going on.	Pitam se šta se još dešava.
I didn't need it anymore	Više mi nije trebao
I was looking for you tonight	Večeras sam te tražio
I'm not ready for this.	Nisam spreman za ovo.
I just love them.	Jednostavno ih volim.
He didn't see them.	Nije ih vidio.
Not much, but it was enough.	Ne mnogo, ali bilo je dovoljno.
But we didn't.	Ali nismo.
He could do anything	Mogao je sve
I really need it.	jako mi treba.
If he has to live that long.	Ako treba da živi tako dugo.
It didn't seem to be.	Činilo se da nije.
I could trust him.	Mogao sam mu vjerovati.
I didn't know you were sure.	Nisam znao da si siguran.
I said that to say this	Rekao sam to da kažem ovo
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
I think he would love a friend	Mislim da bi voleo prijatelja
It's just a little bad weather.	Samo je malo loše vrijeme.
I could tell right away	Mogao sam odmah reći
I want someone to help you	Želim da ti neko pomogne
It was not good to go there.	Nije bilo dobro ići tamo.
I think we are a good team	Mislim da smo dobar tim
I want to love you both	Želim da vas oboje volim
I need more than you	Treba mi više od tebe
It wasn’t that hard to do what he did.	Nije bilo tako teško učiniti ono što je on uradio.
She just wasn't.	Ona jednostavno nije bila.
They couldn't be.	Nisu mogli biti.
Obviously not here.	Očigledno ne ovdje.
I wasn’t sure if it was good or bad	Nisam bio siguran da li je to dobro ili loše
I knew you would come back	Znao sam da ćeš se vratiti
Thinking of you.	Mislim na tebe.
I must have done something	Mora da sam nešto uradio
I'm not sure that's the case.	Nisam siguran da je to tako.
I have a problem too	I ja imam problem
But he didn't think he could do it.	Ali nije mislio da to može.
We are alone here.	Ovde smo sami.
It's good to talk to you.	Dobro je razgovarati s tobom.
Lots to say.	Mnogo toga za reći.
This is not true.	Ovo nije istina.
There just isn’t enough time.	Jednostavno nema dovoljno vremena.
I didn't get to see him.	Taj nisam stigao da vidim.
But maybe it's true.	Ali možda je istina.
And there is much more.	A ima još mnogo toga.
I just didn't have the time	Jednostavno nisam imao vremena
He says no.	On kaže ne.

I couldn't leave without seeing you	Nisam mogao otići a da te ne vidim
He arrived on time.	Stigao je na vrijeme.
I think that's all we need.	Mislim da je to sve što nam treba.
Say what you want, do your job.	Reci šta hoćeš, radi svoj posao.
That would be something to have time for.	To bi bilo nešto da imaš vremena.

I knew it was true	Znao sam da je to istina

Which says a lot.	Što mnogo govori.
It doesn't seem to work well.	Čini se da ne radi dobro.
I'm not my own anymore.	Nisam više svoj.

I will never do that again	Nikad to više neću učiniti

It can be anything	Može biti bilo šta
He's better, you know.	Bolje mu je, znaš.
Probably the only one he would ever get.	Vjerovatno jedini koji bi ikada dobio.
It probably didn’t just happen that way.	To se vjerovatno nije dogodilo samo tako.
I hope he still thinks that	Nadam se da i dalje to misli
I would love that	To bih jako volio
No, that's fine.	Ne, to je u redu.
It's hard to find.	To je teško naći.
I want my life	Želim svoj život

In fact, it should be your first.	U stvari, trebalo bi da vam bude prvi.
Or both.	Ili oboje .
not really.	ne baš.
More than that.	Više od toga.
He probably had no idea what was going to happen.	Verovatno nije imao pojma šta će se dogoditi.
But no, she has to tell him.	Ali ne, mora mu reći.
I worked.	Radio sam.
I knew he or she could see me	Znao sam da me on ili ona mogu vidjeti

I have another reason to be sure he was there.	Imam još jedan razlog da budem siguran da je bio tamo.
He wouldn't want to leave.	Ne bi želio da ode.
You are not my friend.	Ti nisi moj prijatelj.
This is going to be hard.	Ovo će biti teško.
No one is sure why.	Niko nije siguran zašto.
But that's not the point.	Ali ne radi se o tome.
This is currently happening.	Trenutno se ovo dešava.
I think so	Mislim da jeste
Several things were obvious	Nekoliko stvari je bilo očigledno
He knew all this, but he couldn't tell anyone.	Sve je to znao, ali nikome nije mogao reći.
I just saw it	Samo sam to vidio
I decided that was enough.	Odlučio sam da je to dovoljno.
He was what he was.	Bio je ono što je bio.
And maybe not for long.	A možda neće još dugo.
I didn't want to, never again.	Nisam htela, nikad više.
There is nothing more to talk about.	Nema više o čemu da se priča.
We didn't have much time alone together.	Nismo imali puno vremena samo zajedno.
It wouldn't get any better.	Ne bi bilo bolje.
I think you thought so too.	Mislim da si i ti to mislio.
I should buy a new one	Trebao bih kupiti novi
No more problems.	Nema više problema.
I'm going to buy a new one	Idem kupiti novi
No, he would never come now.	Ne, on sada nikada ne bi došao.
I can't be here with you	Ne mogu biti ovdje sa tobom
I doubt I can do anything	Sumnjam da mogu bilo šta
I was ready.	Bio sam spreman.
A life you shouldn't want	Život koji ne bi trebalo da želi
That is not enough.	To nije dovoljno.
I didn't know who it was	Nisam znao ko je to
I'm not sure.	nisam siguran.
I've never seen him before	Nikad ga prije nisam vidio
He plays well.	On igra dobro.
Three years, that's enough.	Tri godine, dosta je.
Even when things are not going well.	Čak i kada ne ide dobro.
Now I wasn’t so sure about that	Sada nisam bio tako siguran u to
I didn't have much time	Nisam imao puno vremena
I'm glad you're here	Drago mi je što ste ovdje
He came when he decided.	Došao je kada je odlučio.
I need him to do it again	Treba mi da to ponovo uradi
I got my first job.	Dobio sam prvi posao.
We have to do it ourselves.	Moramo to sami.
I have to go for help	Moram da idem po pomoć
I need something from you	Treba mi nešto od tebe
I just never expected all that	Samo nikad nisam očekivao sve to
It seems to have exactly what you want.	Čini se da ima upravo ono što želite.
Lots of things you can do.	Puno stvari koje možeš da uradiš.
That's it.	To je to.
I thought it was easy enough	Mislio sam da je to dovoljno lako
He makes it look easy.	On čini da izgleda lako.
I couldn't do this	Nisam mogao ovo da uradim
I'm so glad for both of you	Tako mi je drago zbog vas oboje
I didn't even know	Nisam znao ni sam
How right he is.	Kako je u pravu.
I think he might know what to do	Mislim da bi mogao znati šta da radi
I had no idea how to actually do it.	Nisam imao pojma kako to zapravo učiniti.
That's the only thing you can believe right now.	To je jedina stvar u koju trenutno možete vjerovati.
I started to like it so much	Počeo sam da mi se toliko sviđa
I did it a few times	Uradio sam to nekoliko puta
That's us.	To smo mi.
And they were at home.	I bili su kod kuće.
I shouldn't have been here	Nisam ni trebao biti ovdje
And that just wasn’t enough.	I to jednostavno nije bilo dovoljno.
I won't talk to you	Neću razgovarati s tobom
He doesn't have to say much.	Ne mora mnogo da kaže.
I probably should have said this before	Vjerovatno sam ovo trebao reći prije
I didn't ask him what he had	Nisam ga pitao šta ima
I've done it before.	Radio sam to ranije.
I don't even know why.	Ne znam ni zašto.
I want to be surprised	Želim da budem iznenađen
I think we can	Mislim da možemo
Not even one.	Čak ni jedan.
I didn't know what he was looking for	Nisam znao šta je tražio
Tell him that too.	Reci mu i to.
No, that's not it either.	Ne, ni to nije to.
I'm not sure why not.	Nisam siguran zašto nije.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
It was good to work together again.	Bilo je dobro ponovo raditi zajedno.
And on time.	I to na vrijeme.
It seems so.	Čini se da je tako.
I couldn't say anything more.	Ne bih mogao reći ništa više.
I have something to say	Imam nešto da kažem
I didn't know it right away	Nisam to odmah znao
All he can do right now is buy time.	Sve što trenutno može je kupiti vrijeme.
I say my father.	Ja kažem moj otac.
He wants to eat again.	Ponovo želi da jede.
It's there.	Tamo je.
There weren't enough of us.	Nije nas bilo dovoljno.
Yes, it really is.	Da, stvarno je.
Which she always says now.	Što ona sada uvijek govori.
I must return immediately	Moram se odmah vratiti
And nothing happened.	I ništa se nije dogodilo.
I wasn't there at the time	Nisam bio tamo u to vrijeme
He told me there was no problem.	Rekao mi je da nema problema.
What you want.	Što želite.
I think it will be good for you	Mislim da će biti dobro za tebe
I knew you were there	Znao sam da si tamo
You don't need him.	Ne treba ti on.
I'm not coming back.	Neću se vratiti.
I had plenty of time yesterday	Jučer sam imao dosta vremena
Nobody was nobody.	Niko nije bio niko.
I don't like anything more than you.	Ne sviđa mi se ništa više od tebe.
It was no more.	Nije više bilo.
He was glad about that.	Bilo mu je drago zbog toga.
Or why not.	Ili zašto ne.
It was hard, really hard.	To je bilo teško, stvarno teško.
Lots of stuff here	Puno stvari ovde
I don't have to be here	Ne moram biti ovdje
I thought that was it	Mislio sam da je to to
I will not return with you	Neću se vratiti s tobom
I wish it wasn't	Voleo bih da nije
I still think we are right	I dalje mislim da smo u pravu
I think it goes beyond that	Mislim da ide dalje od toga
You didn't tell me anything.	Nisi mi ništa rekao.
If you need anything else, just say so.	Ako ti još nešto treba, samo reci.
I had no idea what he was talking about	Nisam imao pojma o čemu priča
I know we will be fine together	Znam da će nam biti dobro zajedno
Only he really was her.	Samo je on zaista bio ona.
I do not know what is happening.	Ne znam šta se dešava.
I don't have this problem anymore	Više nemam ovaj problem
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
There is nothing to be done for him.	Nema šta da se uradi za njega.
They are not.	Nisu.
I told you about him	Rekao sam ti za njega
He just got home.	Upravo je stigao kući.
I think we need to talk.	Mislim da moramo razgovarati.
Your father will be here.	Tvoj otac će biti ovdje.
This time just true.	Ovaj put samo istina.
I can't do anything	Ne mogu ništa
They were all at home.	Svi su bili kod kuće.
If he can, he is a man.	Ako može, on je čovjek.
I think he did a pretty good job	Mislim da je uradio prilično dobar posao
I thought you could say that	Mislio sam da bi to mogao reći
I can't even help you	Ne mogu ti ni pomoći
We couldn't leave, not now.	Nismo mogli otići, ne sada.
We will go there, just us.	Ići ćemo tamo, samo mi.
It's not hard.	To nije teško.
No one would tell me why	Niko mi ne bi rekao zašto
She works for a living.	Ona radi za život.
I also need money	Treba mi i novac
I saw it myself	I sam sam to vidio
Like that's it.	Kao da je to to.
I could have done better	Mogao sam bolje
This one really worked.	Ovaj je stvarno radio.
I haven't had anyone in so long	Nisam imao nikoga tako dugo
That's what they told me.	To su mi rekli.
I didn't ask to be here	Nisam tražio da budem ovde
It must be believed.	Mora se vjerovati.
I will stay there.	Ja ću ostati tamo.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim da je to dobra stvar.
I wanted things inside me	Želeo sam stvari u sebi
He knows how to play	On zna kako se igra
I love you.	Volim te.
I didn’t realize that was all	Nisam shvatio da je to sve
But he couldn't tell.	Ali nije mogao reći.
And he was.	I bio je.
Something tells me she would have said that if she hadn’t.	Nešto mi govori da bi to rekla i da nije.
It's easy to do.	Lako je to učiniti.
And you really don’t need much.	I zaista vam ne treba puno.
It was always him.	Uvek je bio on.
But now it was not as it would be.	Ali sada to nije bilo kako će biti.
I had no idea what it was about	Nisam imao pojma o čemu se radi
I was busy, I was busy	Bio sam zauzet, zauzet sam
I just can't do it to myself	Jednostavno ne mogu to sebi da uradim
But that is exactly what he did.	Ali to je upravo ono što je on uradio.
I will never be happy again	Nikada više neću biti sretan
I tried to reach him	Pokušao sam doći do njega
I didn't even know what day it was	Nisam ni znao koji je dan
I won't now, he said.	Neću sada, rekao je.
I would be glad for that.	Bilo bi mi drago zbog toga.
He wanted to talk to me.	Htio je razgovarati sa mnom.
But not like you.	Ali ne kao ti.
I know you weren't happy	Znam da nisi bio sretan
I wish he could help me	Voleo bih da mi može pomoći
To go to that meeting.	Da idem na taj sastanak.
Or a new path.	Ili novi put.
It wasn't just him.	Nije bio samo on.
And that's how we're going to do it.	I tako ćemo to uraditi.
I want real fun	Želim pravu zabavu
I can't do that anymore	Ne mogu to više da radim
I know what she says is true	Znam da je istina šta ona kaže
I would never know.	Nikad ne bih znao.
We can do better than that	Možemo i bolje od toga
I didn't have to ask her what was wrong	Nisam morao da je pitam šta nije u redu
I should have seen that something was wrong	Trebalo je da vidim da nešto nije u redu
I didn't know what to tell him	Nisam znao šta da mu kažem
I can't, or I still can't.	Ne mogu, ili još uvijek ne mogu.
Yes, it was so bad.	Da, bilo je tako loše.
She wouldn't want that.	Ona to ne bi htela.
Which I don't want.	Što ne želim.
I wish you never came.	Voleo bih da nikad nisi došao.
I won't let you do that	Neću ti to dozvoliti
I wasn't happy, right	Nisam bio sretan, tačno
That alone was wrong.	Samo to nije bilo u redu.
I asked who it was for	Pitao sam za koga je
I began to wonder why this had happened	Počeo sam da se pitam zašto se to dogodilo
I wonder why he hasn't come home yet.	Pitam se zašto još nije došao kući.
I like it there.	Sviđa mi se tamo.
He never had to.	Nikad nije morao.
It's not that simple.	Nije tako jednostavno.
I guess we won't be sure now	Pretpostavljam da sada nećemo biti sigurni
I know you're tired.	Znam da si umoran.
I just know.	Samo znam.
I hope we see him there!	Nadam se da ćemo ga tamo vidjeti!
Just a simple question.	Samo jednostavno pitanje.
I want you to have a better life	Želim da imaš bolji život
You don't have to do that if you don't want to.	Ne morate to da radite ako ne želite.
Now I can be anyone	Sada mogu biti bilo ko
Enough for now.	Za sada dosta.
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
I think that's pretty obvious	Mislim da je to prilično očigledno
I want to know who they are	Želim da znam ko su oni
Even before today.	Čak i prije danas.
Neither should we.	Ne bi trebali ni mi.
Any of you.	Bilo ko od vas.
You're still working.	Još uvijek radiš.
It was actually a sight to see.	To je zapravo bilo vidjeti.
There would be no help there.	Tu ne bi bilo pomoći.
I'm not sure you can trust him.	Nisam siguran da mu možeš vjerovati.
I asked her how to get there.	Pitao sam je kako do tamo.
Obviously, there is a lot to be done.	Očigledno je da ima mnogo toga da se uradi.
I mean, it could be	Mislim, moglo bi biti
That's exactly what's happening.	To je upravo ono što se dešava.
He said no.	Rekao je da nije.
Now they were together again.	Sada su ponovo bili zajedno.
You know, like, a job.	Znaš, kao, posao.
I really wanted him to be a bad guy	Zaista sam želio da bude loš momak
If not.	Ako ne.
I've never been so happy	Nikad nisam bio tako sretan
He saw immediately that something was wrong.	Odmah je vidio da nešto nije u redu.
But we don't know.	Ali ne znamo.
That's not.	To nije.
He actually said that.	On je to zapravo rekao.
Look, it was a bad day.	Vidi, bio je to loš dan.
That's just the truth.	To je samo istina.
It still works.	I dalje radi.
He didn't even know he said that.	Nije ni znao da je to rekao.
I didn't know who she was	Nisam znao ko je ona
It might be helpful.	Moglo bi biti od pomoći.
I would love to do that	Voleo bih to da uradim
I would think so, yes	Ja bih tako mislio, da
Things he shouldn't know.	Stvari koje ne bi trebalo da zna.
And they will come for us.	I oni će doći po nas.
This one is really both.	Ovaj je zaista oboje.
This was much better than last week.	Ovo je bilo mnogo bolje nego prošle sedmice.
I want him to see me	Želim da me vidi
We'll know soon enough.	Uskoro ćemo znati.
I haven't been expecting you in a while	Nisam te očekivao još neko vrijeme
It's bad.	Loše je.
It is to be.	To je biti.
Can you give me help.	Možete li mi dati pomoć.
I told him it was okay	Rekao sam mu da je u redu
Certainly not me	Ni ja sigurno nisam
She wasn't, no more.	Ona to nije bila, ne više.
I'm not my own anymore	Nisam više svoj
I'm sure there will be more.	Siguran sam da će se naći još.
He couldn't say why.	Nije mogao reći zašto.
You know, she works.	Znaš, ona radi.
He is right.	On je u pravu.
I was always too tired	Uvijek sam bio previše umoran
I've had enough this morning	Dosta mi je jutros
I'll help you, but you have to trust me	Pomoći ću ti, ali moraš mi vjerovati
And he's not here.	A on nije ovdje.
I already knew what he was thinking	Već sam znao šta misli
he told himself	rekao je sebi
And that really wasn't true.	I to zaista nije bila istina.
True.	Istina.
I didn't know how he felt	Nisam znao kako se osjeća
Not even me.	Čak ni ja.
I shouldn't say that, but it is	Ne bih to trebao reći, ali jeste
This will be quick.	Ovo će biti brzo.
Easy.	Lako.
And neither should you.	A ne bi trebalo ni ti.
I went to a party and got lost	Otišao sam na zabavu i izgubio se
if anyone knows.	ako neko zna.
I didn't want that from you	Nisam to želio od tebe
But there is nothing to do.	Ali nema šta da se uradi.
No, but only	Nisam, ali samo
We could have done that.	Mogli smo to da uradimo.
As much as you can, as much as you can.	Koliko možeš, koliko možeš.
I guess she can’t say much about it	Pretpostavljam da ona ne može puno reći o tome
I started with that.	Počeo sam s tim.
There is no one today.	Danas nema nikoga.
She loves life and loves it very much.	Ona voli život i voli jako.
I say what needs to be said	Ja kažem šta treba da se kaže
Not even you.	Čak ni ti.
I hope this will not be a problem.	Nadam se da ovo neće biti problem.
But not her.	Ali ne ona.
I can't do what he says	Ne mogu da radim ono što on kaže
I wasn't there to see him this morning	Nisam bio da ga vidim jutros
We never had that.	Nikad to nismo imali.
That's my game.	To je moja igra.
It was a game.	Bio je igra.
I want to do it for myself	Želim to učiniti za sebe
He's just gone, not for me.	Jednostavno ga više nema, ne za mene.
She is hope.	Ona je nada.
You can't buy this life.	Ne možeš kupiti ovaj život.
And she wanted to be there.	I htela je da bude tamo.
I couldn't do anything without help.	Ništa ne bih mogao bez pomoći.
I asked who you were	Pitao sam ko si ti
This is obviously not true.	Ovo očigledno nije tačno.
But today was a good day.	Ali danas je bio dobar dan.
Maybe I could help	Možda bih mogao pomoći
But it was day.	Ali bio je dan.
I don't like school here	Ne volim školu ovde
Yes, she said, she knew that.	Da, rekla je, znala je to.
He's already said too much.	Već je rekao previše.
And now he's doing it to us.	A sada nam to radi.
Better than you, much.	Bolje od tebe, mnogo.
I was with you last night	Bio sam sa tobom sinoć
I haven't seen her before.	Nisam je vidio prije.
There is nothing you can do.	Ne možete ništa učiniti.
I didn't know exactly what it was	Nisam tačno znao šta je to
This is going to happen.	Ovo će se dogoditi.
You can bring it back.	Možete ga vratiti.
He should have seen this.	Trebao je da vidi ovo.
I love you very much.	Volim te mnogo.
Obviously that was not the case.	Očigledno to nije bilo tako.
I wonder if she knows about it.	Pitam se da li ona zna za to.
I don't think that would be a good idea.	Mislim da to ne bi bila dobra ideja.
I'm not saying this happened	Ne kažem da se ovo dogodilo
We would.	Bismo.
I just saw them, I just realized what they are	Upravo sam ih vidio, upravo sam shvatio šta su
I immediately said yes	Odmah sam rekao da
This is difficult.	Ovo je teško.

I thought you'd be glad	Mislio sam da će ti biti drago
I went to the door	Otišao sam do vrata
A father who is a father	Otac koji je otac
I knew it could never be	Znao sam da to nikada ne može biti
She said no.	Rekla je ne.
I knew it was him	Znao sam da je to taj
That was from me.	To je bilo od mene.
Maybe I've been gone for a while	Možda me nema neko vrijeme
You are here.	Ti si ovdje.
I was there last night	Bio sam tamo sinoć
I know exactly what's going on.	Znam tačno šta se dešava.
I didn't do anything	Nisam ništa uradio
I know you know that too.	Znam da i ti to znaš.
Do you .	Da li ti .
Yes, there is something in it for us.	Da, ima nešto u tome za nas.
I couldn't see it.	Nisam to mogao vidjeti.
If you think.	Ako mislite.
That's really it.	To je zaista to.
I was gone.	Više me nije bilo.
I need a lot more.	Treba mi mnogo više.
And there is a problem.	I tu je problem.
I doubt he ever will	Sumnjam da će ikada
It might not even exist.	Moglo bi i da ne postoji.
He could find someone.	Mogao je naći nekoga.
I'm sorry, but it is.	Žao mi je, ali jeste.
I couldn't see it anymore	Nisam to više mogao vidjeti
I shouldn't have been here last night	Nisam trebao biti ovdje sinoć
I had to give you some time	Morao sam ti dati malo vremena
I wonder what he wants	Pitam se šta hoće
I asked him what was wrong	Pitao sam ga šta nije u redu
I know it was her.	Znam da je to bila ona.
I can't do this without him	Ne mogu ovo bez njega
I just have to	Samo bih morao
He could do it that way.	Mogao bi na taj način.
I don't think you will.	Mislim da nećeš.
I don't know if he was or not.	Ne znam da li je bio ili nije.
For now, it seems to me that it works.	Za sada mi se čini da to radi.
I hope to see you there	Nadam se da ću vas tamo vidjeti
But that is not enough.	Ali to nije dovoljno.
I've been here a lot.	Bio sam ovde dosta.
I just didn't know what he wanted	Samo nisam znao šta želi
And it's good.	I dobro je.
Nice to see you	Bilo mi je drago da te vidim
I think for him it will be next year	Mislim da će za njega to biti sljedeće godine
We know this will never happen.	Znamo da se to nikada neće dogoditi.
I didn't do anything.	Nisam ništa uradio.
I am happy to be back home.	Sretan sam što sam se vratio kući.
I was the first to admit it	Bio sam prvi koji je to priznao
But it was.	Ali bilo je.
I will not give a video	Neću dati video
I know he really wants to see you again	Znam da te zaista želi ponovo vidjeti
Money is not a problem.	Novac nije problem.
I can't tell you that	Ne mogu ti to reći
I wish everyone didn't know	Voleo bih da svi ne znaju
I'm glad he doesn't say anything.	Drago mi je da ništa ne kaže.
I had no idea how to be	Nisam imao pojma kako da budem
This should be good.	Ovo bi trebalo biti dobro.
I can't help you anymore.	Ne mogu ti više pomoći.
You know them.	Znaš ih.
In fact, it shouldn’t be that hard.	Zapravo, ne bi trebalo biti tako teško.
He couldn't see them, but he didn't have to.	Nije ih mogao vidjeti, ali nije morao.
He didn't do it.	On to nije uradio.
I heard him well	Čuo sam ga dobro
I don't know what he's trying to do.	Ne znam šta pokušava da uradi.
For me, it was nothing more than that.	Za mene nije bilo ništa više od toga.
I was sure he knew	Bio sam siguran da zna
I hope you like it.	Nadam se da ti se sviđa.
It was so simple.	Bilo je tako jednostavno.
Maybe that will never happen	Možda se to nikada neće dogoditi
I would be safe there.	Bio bih siguran tamo.
I have no idea what's wrong.	Nemam pojma šta nije u redu.
We always know exactly what's going on.	Uvek tačno znamo šta se dešava.
And maybe not.	A možda i nije.
Maybe there's too much of it.	Možda ima previše toga.
I just don't know what to do with you.	Samo ne znam šta da radim s tobom.
It's true.	To je tačno.
But now.	Ali sada.
I didn't come alone	Nisam došao sam
I'm much better than that	Ja sam mnogo bolji od toga
There was too much he didn't know yet.	Bilo je previše toga što još nije znao.
And he knew something else.	A znao je još nešto.
You are here for you.	Ovdje ste zbog vas.
He probably saw me.	Verovatno me je video.
I really would.	Zaista bih.
No one ever knows.	Niko nikad ne zna.
He wanted something from me.	Htio je nešto od mene.
We can't go back.	Ne možemo se vratiti.
And he says for sure.	I on kaže sigurno.
That is a problem for me.	To je za mene problem.
And that seems unlikely.	A to se čini malo vjerovatno.
He did nothing.	Ništa nije uradio.
It was exactly what it was supposed to be.	Bilo je upravo ono što je trebalo biti.
To me, it's you.	Za mene si ti.
I don't like it at all.	Ne sviđa mi se to uopšte.
She's wrong.	Ona nije u pravu.
Like it's just a matter of time.	Kao da je samo pitanje vremena.
I need some time.	Treba mi malo vremena.
Or it should have.	Ili je trebalo.
People know about it.	Ljudi znaju za to.
We all were.	Svi smo bili.
Really, really.	Zaista, zaista.
He expected that.	Očekivao je to.
I love you for a long time.	Volim te dugo vremena.
I should.	Trebao bi.
I don't think they're right	Mislim da nisu u pravu
I just want to be me.	Samo želim da budem ja.
I won't see you again	Neću te više vidjeti
I think that's the problem now	Mislim da je to sada problem
She knew that.	To je znala.
I spoke to him this morning.	Čuo sam se s njim jutros.
I don't see who's doing it	Ne vidim ko to radi
I know he did the job, but never again.	Znam da je uradio posao, ali nikad više.
I want to see how it works for itself	Želim vidjeti kako to radi za sebe
But he didn't love me.	Ali on me nije volio.
But he was a happy man.	Ali bio je sretan čovjek.
Father can't.	Otac ne može.
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
There never seemed to be enough.	Nikada se nije činilo da ima dovoljno.
And I always do	I ja to uvijek radim
There's something there.	Nešto je tamo.
We could do this.	Mogli bismo ovo da uradimo.
I didn't know who it was	Nisam znao ko je to bio
I mean, who knows what could have happened	Mislim, ko zna šta se moglo dogoditi
He was sorry.	Bilo mu je žao.
It's just me, my idea.	To sam samo ja, moja ideja.
I know how this is	Znam kako je ovo
I will never do that	Nikada to neću uraditi

This has to happen.	Ovo se mora dogoditi.
I didn't expect it to be	Nisam očekivao da će biti
And he does.	I on to radi.
It's them.	To su oni.

He says we're fine.	Kaže da smo dobro.
I thought you should know.	Mislio sam da bi trebao znati.
I can't believe he did that	Ne mogu vjerovati da je to uradio

It was with me too.	Bilo je i sa mnom.
This should be enough for us.	Ovo bi nam trebalo biti dovoljno.

I’ve heard him say it okay several times	Čuo sam ga više puta kako kaže u redu
I didn't know what to do here	Nisam znao šta da radim ovde
He was not working at the time.	U to vrijeme nije radio.
But that's not what we did.	Ali to nije ono što smo mi uradili.

Maybe that's enough.	Možda je to dovoljno.
I could never do anything right, ever	Nikada nisam mogao ništa da uradim kako treba, nikada

I hope he doesn't come back	Nadam se da se više neće vratiti

He doesn't go to school.	Ne ide u školu.
There is no one like him.	Ne postoji niko kao on.
I'm not sure if it's a lot or a little.	Nisam baš siguran da li je to puno ili malo.
But without that, we have to do these things ourselves.	Ali bez toga, te stvari moramo raditi sami.
Bad, bad, bad.	Loše, loše, loše.

I did something last night	Sinoć sam uradio nešto

I had a few.	Imao sam nekoliko.

I want to see something	Želim nešto vidjeti

More than before.	Više nego prije.
I've seen it many times.	Vidio sam to mnogo puta.
We are still working	I dalje radimo

So it will be there for a while.	Tako da će biti tamo neko vrijeme.
Nobody told me about it	Niko mi nije rekao za to
I mean, for myself.	Mislim, za sebe.

I see how he could do that	Vidim kako bi to moglo učiniti

Not that one.	Ne taj.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
Now I was sure of it	Sada sam bio siguran u to
I wonder if he will ever	Pitam se da li će ikada
I would have to go get something	Morao bih otići po nešto
I needed better	Trebao sam bolje
There is nothing better than that.	Nema ništa bolje od toga.
It happened to you for the first time.	Prvi put se to dogodilo s tobom.
But she can.	Ali ona može.
I wouldn't be the first	Ne bih bio prvi
Everything was plain, simple and ordinary.	Sve je bilo jednostavno, jednostavno i obično.
Now I probably have to do it.	Sada vjerovatno moram to učiniti.
But this is my job.	Ali ovo je moj posao.
But it wasn't enough for him, it would never be enough.	Ali to mu nije bilo dovoljno, nikad mu ne bi bilo dovoljno.
And you know, when someone doesn't say anything, it tells you something.	I znate, kada neko ne kaže ništa, to vam nešto govori.
He knows we were right.	On zna da smo bili u pravu.
No one asked for money.	Niko nije tražio novac.
I don't see this happening.	Ne vidim da se ovo dešava.
More power for him.	Više moći za njega.
I want to do my best.	Želim dati sve od sebe.
There is never enough of it.	Nikada ga nema dovoljno.
It was three-thirty.	Bilo je tri i trideset.
He doesn't know what happened to you.	On ne zna šta ti se dogodilo.
I love you, but not like that.	Volim te, ali ne tako.
I knew something was wrong	Znao sam da nešto nije u redu
You didn't know what to do.	Nisi znao šta da radiš.
I haven't seen her in so long	Nisam je vidio tako dugo
I have to wonder about you.	Moram da se pitam za tebe.
I think everyone should know this	Mislim da bi svi ovo trebali znati
What works for me may not work for you.	Ono što radi kod mene možda neće raditi za vas.
That's not you.	To nisi ti.
He shouldn't have done that.	Nije trebalo to da uradi.
Maybe I know what it is	Možda znam šta je to
It will probably help.	Vjerovatno će pomoći.
I mean, you never know	Mislim, nikad se ne zna
It was really easy	Bilo je zaista lako
He is not.	On nije.
That wasn't hard now, was it? 	To sada nije bilo teško, zar ne?
It can never be.	Nikada ne može biti.
There are many problems.	Ima mnogo problema.
I need to know these things	Moram znati ove stvari
There was no one here.	Ovdje nije bilo nikoga.
I want more than that, much more than that	Želim više od toga, mnogo više od toga
I love him very much.	Mnogo ga volim.
This was for him.	Ovo je bilo za njega.
Time was not an issue.	Vrijeme nije bilo problem.
I've never heard her say that	Nikad je nisam čuo da tako govori
We will now.	Sada ćemo.
As it should be.	Kao što bi trebalo biti.
I won't let you	Neću ti dozvoliti
I really just can't.	Zaista jednostavno ne mogu.
I didn't have much trouble	Nisam imao mnogo problema
I did it we did it.	Uradio sam to smo uradili.
I know that's not true	Znam da to nije istina
None of that.	Ništa od toga.
There is still time.	Još ima vremena.
I had to be with him	Morao sam da budem sa njim
You thought of me too.	I ti si mislio na mene.
I arrived on time	Stigao sam na vrijeme
You could have done better !.	Mogao si bolje!.
I just can't yet	Samo još ne mogu
He probably already knew this morning.	Verovatno je već jutros znao.
I know this is the day	Znam da je ovo dan
Nobody knew what to do with it.	Niko nije znao šta da radi s tim.
But it just wasn't like that	Ali jednostavno nije bilo tako
I must have asked to see him.	Mora da sam tražio da ga vidim.
I want to work with him	Želim da radim sa njim
I loved that he was the one	Voleo sam da je on taj
I haven't had you yet.	Još te nisam imao.
A real, real friend	Pravi, pravi prijatelj
He doesn't do anything.	Ne radi ništa.
I just wanted to leave.	Samo sam htio otići.
And there is certainly nothing wrong with that.	I u tome sigurno nema ništa loše.
I guess you're right.	Pretpostavljam da si u pravu.
I can't believe what you just said	Ne mogu vjerovati šta si upravo rekao
This one has.	Ovaj ima.
I've never done that before	Nikad to ranije nisam radio
I hope I can do without me	Nadam se da mogu bez mene
This is what we need.	Ovo je ono što nam treba.
I said what I thought	Ja sam rekao šta mislim
He wasn't here either.	Ni on nije bio ovdje.
She just wants to be with me.	Ona samo želi da bude sa mnom.
Except me.	Osim mene.
He saw what happened.	Video je šta se dogodilo.
I mean, that was bad enough.	Mislim, to je bilo dovoljno loše.
I said it was okay	Rekao sam da je u redu
But that's not good enough.	Ali to nije dovoljno dobro.
It doesn't work that way.	To ne radi tako.
I was sure you didn't want me	Bio sam siguran da me ne želiš
It's a little long.	Malo je dugo.
I saw his car driving	Video sam kako mu se auto vozi
I should never have said yes	Nikad nisam trebao reći da
I just couldn’t say it	Jednostavno nisam mogao to reći
I really think so	Zaista mislim da jeste
I should be ready.	Trebao bih biti spreman.
I never wanted anyone else.	Nikada nisam želeo nekoga više.
I was a little surprised	Bio sam malo iznenađen
I should have known something was wrong	Trebao sam znati da nešto nije u redu
He did not know what to do.	Nije znao šta da radi.
And it doesn't look good.	I ne izgleda dobro.
What next.	Šta dalje.
I've heard enough.	Čuo sam dovoljno.
I know you know.	Znam da ti znaš.
That would not be so easy.	To ne bi bilo tako lako.
So to speak.	Tako da kažem.
I will never go there again	Nikada više neću ići tamo
You have enough stories.	Imaš dovoljno priča.
I would always be there.	Uvek bih bio tu.
I made it for you.	Napravio sam ga za tebe.
I've been here before.	Bio sam ovdje prije.
You are one of us.	Ti si jedan od nas.
I have to do this.	Moram ovo da uradim.
This video has it all.	Ovaj video ima sve.
You still need it.	I dalje ti treba.
How much more was there.	Koliko je više bilo.
I think we all know that	Mislim da to svi znamo
This time, really.	Ovaj put, stvarno.
I can't help myself how she feels	Ne mogu si pomoći kako se ona osjeća
No, really, it happens quite often.	Ne, zaista, to se dešava prilično često.
I haven't done that yet	Nisam to još uradio
I just couldn't do it, that's all	Jednostavno nisam mogao to da uradim, to je sve
All of them, just people.	Svi oni, samo ljudi.
There are a lot of us.	Ima nas puno.
It must be said.	Mora se reći.
You have done enough.	Uradili ste dovoljno.
us.	nas.
But that was not the only reason.	Ali to nije bio jedini razlog.
But it's still true.	Ali to je i dalje istina.
I never got to that, and	Nikad nisam stigao do toga, i
This could have gone either way.	Ovo je moglo ići na bilo koji način.
I don't usually like that.	To mi se obično ne sviđa.
I just heard last night	Upravo sam čuo sinoć
That's her over there.	To je ona tamo.
And for.	I za.
I know he's right.	Znam da je u pravu.
We don't know what it is and how real it is.	Ne znamo šta je to i koliko je stvarno.
I know you know it's true.	Znam da znaš da je istina.
Real.	Pravi.
I really needed that.	To mi je stvarno trebalo.
Like you said, she can't help it.	Kao što ste rekli, ona ne može pomoći.
He never wanted that.	Nikada to nije želeo.
I am working on that.	Radim na tome.
But there was too much of it.	Ali bilo je previše toga.
I'll help you, but you have to trust me.	Pomoći ću ti, ali moraš mi vjerovati.
I thought it was very good	Mislio sam da je jako dobro
.	.
But she's not like us.	Ali ona nije kao mi.
I could have been there more for him	Mogao sam biti tu više za njega
The car is waiting for you.	Auto te čeka.
Or maybe there is nothing left to find.	Ili se možda više nema šta naći.
I knew we could do it	Znao sam da to možemo
Exactly what we have to do.	Upravo ono što moramo da radimo.
I never did that.	Nikad to nisam uradio.
I hope it will help us	Nadam se da će nam pomoći
I was surprised to see that	Bio sam iznenađen kada sam to vidio
It seems.	Izgleda.
I hope you find her	Nadam se da ćeš je naći
Can anyone tell me how this can be done.	Može li mi neko reći kako se to može uraditi.
She is not there now.	Ona sada nije tamo.
You are alone.	Sami ste.
She's just doing it.	Ona to samo radi.
I should have known something was wrong	Trebao sam znati da nešto nije u redu
I know exactly what you want	Znam tačno šta želiš
I know it's mine.	Znam da je moj.
It could have been, but it really wasn't.	Moglo je i biti, ali zaista nije.
And he began.	I počeo je.
I still want to see that	I dalje to želim vidjeti
I just wasn’t happy	Jednostavno nisam bio sretan
I want him here tomorrow	Želim ga ovdje sutra
I wonder who gave it to me	Pitam se ko mi ga je dao
I'm ready right now	Spreman sam odmah
And not just here.	I ne samo ovdje.
I didn't know what happened, not even when	Nisam znao šta se dogodilo, čak ni kada
I just want to know what it looks like	Samo želim da znam kako to izgleda
Yes, that seems like a good idea.	Da, to izgleda kao dobra ideja.
None of us say anything.	Niko od nas ništa ne kaže.
It's not good without him.	Nije dobro bez njega.
But you had.	Ali imali ste.
I asked her about it.	Pitao sam je o tome.
I just want something done	Samo želim da se nešto uradi
That must be enough for him.	To mu mora biti dovoljno.
I thought you saw me	Mislio sam da si me vidio
It seemed simple enough.	Činilo se dovoljno jednostavno.
In fact, I was pretty busy	U stvari, bio sam prilično zauzet
I bought them.	Kupio sam ih.
She will leave, but he will not stay.	Ona će otići, ali on neće ostati.
That’s the ‘how’ of it.	To je 'kako' toga.
I had to know what was going on	Morao sam znati šta se dešava
And the things she said.	I stvari koje je rekla.
There is probably no reason.	Vjerovatno ne postoji razlog.
This is unlikely	Ovo je malo vjerovatno
It knows what it's like to be you and me.	Ono zna kako je biti ti i ja.
I didn’t think they should be there.	Nisam mislio da bi trebali biti tamo.
I hope he comes back	Nadam se da će se vratiti
I never said that.	Nikad to nisam rekao.
I have to go for help	Moram da idem po pomoć
And easy enough.	I dovoljno lako.
It was hard for him.	Bilo mu je teško.
Can anyone help.	Može li neko pomoći.
That must be it.	To mora biti to.
But people shouldn't have known that.	Ali ljudi to nisu trebali znati.
I ask him if everything is okay	Pitam ga da li je sve u redu
Not right there.	Ne baš tamo.
I have us.	Imam nas.
I should know more.	Trebao bih znati više.
I didn't start very well.	Nisam baš dobro počeo.
I was there, but I wasn't there	Bio sam tamo, ali nisam bio tamo
I should know how it happened	Trebao bih znati kako se to dogodilo
I started with that.	Počeo sam s tim.
Nothing bad will happen.	Ništa loše se neće dogoditi.
There just isn’t enough time.	Jednostavno nema dovoljno vremena.
I have no idea how many there are now	Nemam pojma koliko ih sada ima
He has it.	On je ima.
You're not doing anything.	Ne radiš ništa.
I hope everything is fine with him	Nadam se da je sve u redu s njim
You never did.	Nikada nisi.
I hope someone here can help.	Nadam se da neko ovdje može pomoći.
I just didn’t think it was real	Samo nisam mislio da je stvarno
I like the way it works	Sviđa mi se način na koji to radi
But he did not expect that.	Ali, on to nije očekivao.
Say what you think.	Reci šta misliš.
I understood that immediately	To sam odmah shvatio
I have no idea where he lives.	Nemam pojma gdje živi.
I thought he might come back	Mislio sam da bi se mogao vratiti
Not much, just a little.	Ne puno, samo malo.
I didn't see it that way.	Nisam to tako vidio.
It was not easy.	Nije bilo lako.
That was three years ago.	To je bilo prije tri godine.
But none of that happened.	Ali ništa od toga se nije dogodilo.
You can never buy yourself.	Nikada se ne možeš kupiti.
I knew he would come.	Znao sam da će doći.
I know you will be good to me	Znam da ćeš biti dobra za mene
They will help him.	Oni će mu pomoći.
I was too tired to wonder about it.	Bio sam previše umoran da bih se pitao o tome.
I want it to be something more than that	Želim da to bude nešto više od toga
I really like it here	Stvarno mi se sviđa ovdje
I love working with you too	I ja volim raditi s tobom
I had to do this	Morao sam da uradim ovo
I told him it was true	Rekao sam mu da je to istina
They were for me.	Bili su to za mene.
You are a team.	Vi ste tim.
Get a job.	Dobiti posao.
This just couldn't happen.	Ovo se jednostavno nije moglo dogoditi.
I never want to see you again	Nikada te više ne želim vidjeti
It wasn't bad for him.	Nije bilo loše za njega.
I wasn't there that year	Nisam bio tamo te godine
I wonder how long ago that was	Pitam se koliko je to bilo prije
There is not much to say about that.	O tome nema puno za reći.
But that's right.	Ali tako je.
I never got to ask	Nikad nisam stigao da pitam
I love doing things for you	Volim raditi stvari za tebe
That's not it.	To nije to.
I'm really happy to be there again.	Zaista sam sretan što sam ponovo tamo.
I'd like to see.	Voleo bih da vidim.
They didn't know enough.	Nisu znali dovoljno.
We did well.	Uradili smo dobro.
But for me it's more than that.	Ali za mene je to više od toga.
I better go home	Bolje da idem kući
I just hope it helps	Samo se nadam da će pomoći
Say 'he', not 'it'.	Reci 'on', ne 'to'.
I guess we should go back	Pretpostavljam da bi se trebali vratiti
They were real people.	Bili su pravi ljudi.
No, actually, you don't.	Ne, zapravo, ne znaš.
That would be better.	Tako bi bilo bolje.
Not all, not always, but often enough.	Ne svi, ne uvijek, ali dovoljno često.
I did my best and did my best	Dao sam sve od sebe i sve od sebe
But he understood why he wanted to leave.	Ali je shvatio zašto želi da ode.
I can't believe what just happened	Ne mogu vjerovati šta se upravo dogodilo
Like, really fast.	Kao, stvarno brzo.
Please, for me.	Molim te, za mene.
I love you both	Volim vas oboje
I didn't know who these people were.	Nisam znao ko su ti ljudi.
Not here.	Ovdje nema.
I'm not sure how.	Nisam siguran kako.
A lot has not happened	Mnogo toga se nije dogodilo
will do first.	prvi će učiniti.
But this is real.	Ali ovo je stvarno.
But she said yes.	Ali ona je rekla da.
I should have known he would know all about it	Trebao sam znati da će on znati sve o tome
I asked her why she thought she would do it.	Pitao sam je zašto misli da će to učiniti.
I never thought he would tell me that	Nikad nisam mislio da će mi to reći
I want you to know everything he says	Želim da znaš sve što kaže
Don't tell me it wasn't something yet.	Nemoj mi reći da to još nije bilo nešto.
I got everything we needed	Dobio sam sve što nam je trebalo
That's the one.	To je taj.
But he would do what he could.	Ali uradio bi šta je mogao.
Nobody wants to talk to me.	Niko ne želi da priča sa mnom.
I'll come back tomorrow	Doći ću sutra
I'm not here for myself anymore	Nisam više ovdje zbog sebe
The car worked well today.	Auto je danas dobro radio.
I mean, very good.	Mislim, vrlo dobro.
Something that actually.	Nešto što zapravo.
I'm so glad he's still alive	Tako mi je drago što još živi
Nothing was there.	Ništa nije bilo tamo.
Time .	Vrijeme .
I love being with you.	Volim biti s tobom.
But something else.	Ali još nešto.
I haven't seen you in so long	Nisam te video tako dugo
It's business as usual.	To je kao i obično.
Everything except.	Sve osim.
I always have been and always will be	Uvek sam bio i uvek ću biti
There is nothing more to say.	Nema više šta da se kaže.
I don't know where anyone else lives	Ne znam gdje još neko živi
I shouldn't have told anyone	Nisam trebao nikome reći
They just don't know it yet.	Samo to još ne znaju.
And it's not right.	I nije u redu.
One who hasn't heard in days.	Jedan koji nije čuo nekoliko dana.
I just got home, actually	Upravo sam stigao kući, zapravo
But maybe he's wrong.	Ali možda nije u pravu.
More like a question, actually.	Više kao pitanje, zapravo.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
We could see that.	Mogli smo to vidjeti.
I didn't want to be here anymore	Nisam više želio biti ovdje
I haven't seen him in three years	Nisam ga video tri godine
He knew he might never see her again.	Znao je da je možda više nikada neće vidjeti.
It could have been many years ago.	Moglo bi biti prije mnogo godina.
I need to know why you need it	Moram da znam zašto ti treba
None of this is true.	Ništa od toga nije istina.
He knows that now.	On to sada zna.
But I can't help myself	Ali ne mogu si pomoći
I doubt he ever had it	Sumnjam da ga je ikada imao
No, never that.	Ne, nikad to.
He wouldn't say that.	On to ne bi rekao.
It’s the only way, and we both know it.	To je jedini način, i oboje ga znamo.
I was the only person he could ever beat.	Ja sam bio jedina osoba koju nikada nije mogao pobijediti.
I can help myself too	Mogu i sam sebi pomoći
There is something wrong with me.	Nešto nije u redu sa mnom.
You didn't have to do that.	Nisi to morao da uradiš.
It's nothing.	Nije ništa.
You know you are.	Znaš da jesi.
He can say something is wrong.	On može reći da nešto nije u redu.
He had a real job.	Imao je pravi posao.
So far, so good.	Za sada je sve dobro.
I didn't mean it as no	Nisam to mislio kao ne
I still wasn’t sure this was a good idea	Još uvijek nisam bio siguran da je ovo dobra ideja
Maybe that's how it happened.	Možda se to tako dogodilo.
Which she is not.	Što ona nije.
This is her.	Ovo je ona.
I don't want to know anymore	Ne želim više da znam
I've never even seen them.	Nikad ih nisam ni vidio.
For me, it’s not just a job.	Za mene to nije samo posao.
I'm with you for now.	Za sada sam sa tobom.
I just don't see the problem.	Jednostavno ne vidim problem.
I knew he would never do something like that again	Znao sam da nikada više neće uraditi tako nešto
He always was.	Uvek je bio.
I have to say she exists	Moram reći da ona postoji
I thought we could only move on	Mislio sam da možemo samo dalje
But we are much more than that.	Ali mi smo mnogo više od toga.
I've been there before.	Bio sam tamo ranije.
But from time to time.	Ali s vremena na vrijeme.
It's not what it seems.	Nije ono što se čini.
And they didn't.	I nisu.
I won't even stay if he doesn't want to.	Neću čak ni ostati ako on to ne želi.
.	.
He wanted that.	On je to želeo.
I had a life here, and so has he	Ja sam ovdje imao život, a i on je
He's not here now.	On sada nije ovdje.
I thought it already was	Mislio sam da već jeste
So, probably, do you.	Tako, vjerovatno, i ti.
I'm not sure that's true.	Nisam siguran da je to istina.
He never was.	Nikad nije bio.
Maybe there's still time.	Možda još ima vremena.
I really want to help	Zaista želim pomoći
That's how it is now.	Tako je to sada.
It has to be more than that.	Mora biti više od toga.
I didn't expect him to be there	Nisam očekivao da će biti tamo
I can say these things	Mogu reći ove stvari
It's good enough.	Dovoljno je dobro.
I pretty much like that	Prilično volim to
I can't do that	Ne mogu to da uradim
It was hard for him to speak.	Bilo mu je teško da govori.
Okay, so.	U redu, tako.
Something was wrong.	Nešto je bilo loše.
I feel like I'm back here again	Čini mi se da sam se ponovo vratio ovdje
I just wanted you to know she's fine	Samo sam htela da znaš da je ona dobro
I knew he would be there	Znao sam da će biti tamo
I've just heard that before	Upravo sam to čuo ranije
I just want you to know	Samo želim da znaš
He knows it will be easy now.	Zna da će sada biti lako.
I want you to know what happened, how it happened	Želim da znaš šta se dogodilo, kako se dogodilo
That's easy to say.	To je lako reći.
I didn't know he was your friend	Nisam znao da ti je prijatelj
He was a really good friend.	Bio je stvarno dobar prijatelj.
Yes, that one.	Da, taj.
I didn't say anything right away	Nisam odmah ništa rekao
I have no idea	Nemam pojma
It could be me.	Mogao bih biti ja.
I will never be well again.	Nikad više neću biti dobro.
I mean, it is, but not really	Mislim, jeste, ali ne baš
You needed me.	Trebao si me.
I had nothing to say	Nisam imao šta da kažem
But this is simply not the case.	Ali ovo jednostavno nije tako.
Maybe there's something to it.	Možda ima nešto u tome.
I should have known right away	Trebao sam odmah znati
Everything is something.	Sve je nešto.
Never anything.	Nikada ništa.
I asked him what year he was	Pitao sam ga koja je godina
Maybe he was just trying to look like one.	Možda je samo pokušao da izgleda kao jedan.
It seemed simple to me.	Činilo mi se jednostavno.
But not very often.	Ali ne baš često.
Now he is doing his way.	Sada radi svoj put.
I think everyone knows that by now	Mislim da to svi znaju do sada
I haven't been here long	Nisam više dugo ovdje
You may not want to do it alone, but someone has to.	Možda ne želite da to uradite sami, ali neko mora.
I can not.	Ne mogu.
He saw everything.	On je sve video.
I bought mine yesterday	Ja sam svoj kupio jučer
The truth is.	Istina je.
So far, it seems.	Do sada, čini se.
You said.	Ti si rekao.
I couldn't say what was going on	Nisam mogao da kažem šta se dešava
It had to be one of you.	Morao je biti neko od vas.
But it was good enough.	Ali bilo je dovoljno dobro.
Just what you want to do.	Samo ono što želiš da radiš.
Do you think so.	Mislite li da je tako.
But they are not like us.	Ali oni nisu kao mi.
She wants to come.	Ona želi da dođe.
I really know, you know	Zaista znam, znaš
It could be time.	Moglo bi biti vrijeme.
I really lost everything, everything	Zaista sam izgubio sve, sve
So many people.	Toliko ljudi.
None of us ever knows anything.	Niko od nas nikada ne zna ništa.
Something is going on here.	Nešto se dešava ovde.
I love these things	Volim ove stvari
I'm pretty sure you'll be able to do without him.	Prilično sam siguran da ćete moći i bez njega.
No one would really ask for that.	Niko to zapravo ne bi tražio.
I thought you were my friend.	Mislio sam da si mi prijatelj.
I asked that earlier.	Pitao sam to ranije.
I didn't know what to tell you.	Nisam znao šta da ti kažem.
I don't know how yet.	Još ne znam kako.
There, or there, or there.	Tamo, ili tamo, ili tamo.
You've needed it for a long time.	Trebao ti je već dugo vremena.
I didn't think he would find me	Nisam mislio da će me naći
I see this happening more and more	Vidim da se to dešava sve više i više
But not much.	Ali ne mnogo.
This was all just not true.	Ovo je bilo sve samo ne istina.
I still can't believe it	I dalje ne mogu vjerovati
I shouldn't even be here	Ne bih ni trebao biti ovdje
That will be enough for now.	To će biti dovoljno za sada.
I'm not saying you can't.	Ne kažem da ne možete.
I knew no one would come for us	Znao sam da niko neće doći po nas
He probably doesn't know any better.	Vjerovatno ne zna ništa bolje.
I mean, nobody knows that	Mislim, to niko ne zna
Yes, this is true.	Da, ovo je istina.
He started talking to me.	Počeo je da priča sa mnom.
I knew that for sure	To sam sigurno znao
She was nothing for three years.	Tri godine nije bila ništa.
Maybe everything would be fine.	Možda bi sve bilo u redu.
I didn't think I could do it alone	Nisam mislio da bi mogao sam
I had a lot of that.	Imao sam dosta toga.
It seemed easy.	Činilo se lako.
For a long time nothing happened.	Dugo se ništa nije dogodilo.
I don't know if that would ever happen	Ne znam da li bi se to ikada dogodilo
This will be my life now.	Ovo će sada biti moj život.
No, there will be no problem.	Ne, neće biti problema.
I'm not leaving anymore	Neću više otići
Something he hadn't seen before.	Nešto što ranije nije vidio.
I should be very sorry	Trebalo bi da mi je jako žao
But that didn't happen here.	Ali to se ovdje nije dogodilo.
I had no idea what was wrong	Nisam imao pojma šta nije u redu
So far we have been right.	Do sada smo bili u pravu.
I hope none of this is true	Nadam se da ništa od toga nije istina
They are certainly not the only ones.	Sigurno to nisu jedini.
He can stay where he is.	Može ostati gdje jeste.
I knew what was coming	Znao sam šta će doći
It wasn't necessary the first time.	Prvi put nije trebalo.
I wonder why they are here	Pitam se zašto su ovdje
We have too many things.	Imamo previše stvari.
This is something like that.	Ovo je tako nešto.
It was pretty obvious.	Bilo je prilično očigledno.
Three times, actually.	Tri puta, zapravo.
I will not do that	Neću to učiniti
I knew it was a problem.	Znao sam da je problem.
I really needed this job	Zaista mi je trebao ovaj posao
Things she had never said before.	Stvari koje nikada ranije nije rekla.
Nothing real, nothing helpful.	Ništa stvarno, ništa od pomoći.
But none of us are.	Ali niko od nas nije.
I had to make sure it was him	Morao sam biti siguran da je to on
But he knew that would be enough.	Ali znao je da će to biti dovoljno.
I just see you as myself	Ja te samo vidim kao sebe
Not that it was much.	Nije da je bilo mnogo.
I want you to tell me all about yourself	Želim da mi kažeš sve o sebi
The first is not.	Prvi nije.
How he did it.	Na koji način je to uradio.
I never saw her.	Nikad je nisam video.
I've never been a problem for anyone.	Nikada nikome nisam bio problem.
What you want and you don't want.	Šta želiš a ne želiš.
I should have said something earlier	Trebao sam nešto ranije reći
I'm not going to do that.	Neću to da uradim.
I couldn't tell.	Ne bih mogao reći.
He said that was true.	Rekao je da je to tačno.
Everyone should do it.	Svi bi to trebali učiniti.
I guess he could	Pretpostavljam da je mogao
But he is not happy.	Ali nije sretan.
I was the only one.	Bio sam jedini.
I didn't know what to do either.	Ni ja nisam znao šta da radim.
Both cannot be true.	Oboje ne može biti tačno.
She knew who we were.	Znala je ko smo.
This was good to know.	Ovo je bilo dobro znati.
I did my job and he did his	Ja sam radio svoj posao, a on svoj
You are all here.	Svi ste ovde.
Yes, she told him.	Da, rekla mu je.
And indeed it was so.	I zaista je bilo tako.
I probably shouldn't have said that.	Verovatno to nisam ni trebao da kažem.
I knew what he was doing right	Znao sam šta radi kako treba
I realized that was true	Shvatio sam da je to istina
And he probably will.	I vjerovatno hoće.
How can I tell you.	Kako da ti kažem.
It was all true.	Sve je to bila istina.
I doubt that's not true	Sumnjam da to nije istina
I didn't know until today.	Nisam znao do danas.
I worked here.	Radio sam ovdje.
He tried again.	Pokušao je ponovo.
I just couldn't talk to anyone	Jednostavno nisam mogao ni sa kim razgovarati
It's just a matter of time.	Samo je pitanje vremena.
He should be there.	Trebao bi biti tamo.
I didn't know you had so much in you.	Nisam znao da imaš toliko toga u sebi.
I just couldn’t tell anyone	Jednostavno nisam mogao nikome reći
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
I'm not sure why.	Nisam siguran zašto.
Now that can only be good !.	Sada to može biti samo dobro!.
And for now it is.	I za sada jeste.
I haven't even started with you yet	Nisam još ni počeo s tobom
Maybe he loves her.	Možda je voli.
I hope you will help me.	Nadam se da ćeš mi pomoći.
I think there is something in us.	Mislim da ima nešto u nama.
You didn't know.	Nisi znao.
I didn't want to go there	Nisam htela da idem tamo
I know what he means	Znam šta misli
He says.	On kaže.
I know you still have it	Znam da ga još imaš
I thought you were too	I ja sam mislio da jesi
That seems to be true.	Čini se da je to istina.
I have to see things	Moram da vidim stvari
He bought me some time.	Kupio mi je malo vremena.
No, it wasn't enough.	Ne, nije bilo dovoljno.
I'll say it again.	Reći ću to ponovo.
I think it could be	Mislim da bi moglo biti
I have.	ja imam.
It must be on the river.	Mora da je na reci.
I didn't even know he was there	Nisam ni znao da je tamo
I wasn’t sure if he worked there or not	Nisam bio siguran da li on tamo radi ili ne
That happened.	To se dogodilo.
I love you all very much	Volim vas sve jako puno
I've seen him before	Video sam ga ranije
I hope he is right	Nadam se da je u pravu
It's like.	To je kao .
But it looks bad.	Ali izgleda loše.
I would give him time	Dao bih mu vremena
I think that's obvious.	Mislim da je to očigledno.
You didn't have time to talk to anyone.	Nisi imao vremena ni sa kim razgovarati.
I didn't mean to do anything wrong.	Nisam mislio da uradim ništa loše.
I think he knows that.	Mislim da on to zna.
What about you?	Šta je s tobom.
That's all they said they would be.	To je sve što su rekli da će biti.
They just can't help themselves.	Oni jednostavno ne mogu sebi pomoći.
He should have.	Trebao je.
Maybe he was better.	Možda mu je bilo bolje.
I have to find him now	Moram ga odmah naći
I don't think so.	Mislim da nema.
It's happening.	To se dešava.
But I can't be sure	Ali ne mogu biti siguran
They never did.	Nikada nisu.
He was as good as he gave.	Bio je dobar koliko je dao.
Maybe she was.	Možda je bila.
I think we should talk	Mislim da bi trebali razgovarati
I lost everything.	Izgubio sam sve.
True, they.	Istina, oni.
All right, you can go.	U redu, možeš ići.
I can't believe this happened.	Ne mogu vjerovati da se to dogodilo.
What she does.	Što ona radi.
I need to see her	Moram da je vidim
But maybe that was a good story.	Ali možda je to bila dobra priča.
This was the day.	Ovo je bio dan.
They were nothing.	Oni su bili ništa.
The guy from this morning.	Momak od jutros.
Not for yourself.	Ne za sebe.
I haven't had it before	Nisam ga ranije imao
I just don't like it.	Ne sviđa mi se samo.
he asked.	pitao.
It was for me.	Za mene je bilo.
There is nobody.	Nema nikoga.
But there is a problem here.	Ali ovdje postoji problem.
That would never happen.	To se nikada ne bi dogodilo.
I really needed that	To mi je stvarno trebalo
He saw it too.	I on je to video.
She doesn't speak.	Ona ne govori.
What can never be must happen.	Ono što nikada ne može biti mora se dogoditi.
And you were right.	I bio si u pravu.
I thought it was a good year.	Mislio sam da je to dobra godina.
I think that might be okay.	Mislim da bi to moglo biti u redu.
It cannot be done.	To se ne može uraditi.
There was nothing for me.	Nije bilo ništa za mene.
I still think it exists	I dalje mislim da postoji
I know who they are now.	Znam ko su oni sada.
But not now.	Ali ne sada.
I'm not sure what to think	Nisam siguran šta da mislim
Nice to know right away.	Drago mi je da znam odmah.
I just don't.	Ja jednostavno ne.
And he wouldn't ask for anything.	I ne bi tražio ništa.
She didn't know what to say.	Nije znala šta da kaže.
Usually that wouldn’t have happened.	Obično se to ne bi dogodilo.
I'm working on it, you know.	Radim na tome, znaš.
That needs to be discussed.	O tome treba razgovarati.
He has his life.	Ima svoj život.
I didn't see you there	Nisam te vidio tamo
We can do it.	Možemo to učiniti.
I don't want anything to do with you.	Ne želim ništa s tobom.
I did well too	I ja sam dobro uradio
I think he's afraid of me	Mislim da me se boji
I just know he's the problem	Samo znam da je on problem
To be my own.	Da budem svoj.
Everything seemed to be fine.	Činilo se da je sve u redu.
I like to do things alone	Volim da radim stvari sam
I do that very often.	To radim vrlo često.
But there is something you have to see.	Ali postoji nešto što morate vidjeti.
I could see it happening.	Mogao sam da vidim da se to dešava.
He wished he could help.	Želio je da može pomoći.
More on that.	Više o tome.
This year, not so much.	Ove godine, ne toliko.
It can always get better	Uvijek može bolje
Just a few will suffice.	Samo nekoliko će biti dovoljno.
I guess you couldn't know that	Pretpostavljam da to nisi mogao znati
And you?.	A ti?.
I’ve never been so glad I finished the job	Nikad mi nije bilo tako drago što sam posao završio
You never worked with him.	Nikada nisi radio s njim.
That's neither here nor there.	To nije ni ovde ni tamo.
And not for the first time.	I ne po prvi put.
That's the only thing.	To je jedina stvar.
They did this to themselves.	Uradili su ovo sami sebi.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
It could be anytime.	Moglo bi biti bilo kada.
The truth is yes.	Istina je da.
That works well so far.	To do sada radi dobro.
I haven't heard anyone do that yet.	Još nisam čuo da neko to radi.
You need something else.	Treba ti još nešto.
I thought he did a good job.	Mislio sam da je uradio dobar posao.
Nothing is going.	Ništa ne ide.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
Something like that will not happen.	Tako nešto neće biti.
I knew you wouldn't go	Znao sam da nećeš ići
I know what is true	Znam šta je istina
And they knew they weren't there.	I znali su da ih nema.
I'm going with you	Idem sa tobom
If you want it.	Ako to želiš.
Never more than that.	Nikad više od toga.
They know who these people are.	Oni znaju ko su ti ljudi.
She is, but he is not.	Ona jeste, ali on nije.
She wants him for herself	Ona ga želi za sebe
He did this for me.	On je ovo uradio za mene.
I didn't know there were so many.	Nisam znao da ih ima toliko.
Like the truth.	Kao i istina.
I have no idea how he knew about it.	Nemam pojma kako je znao za to.
I'm not home to anyone.	Nisam kod kuće nikome.
I mean, it's for me too, you know.	Mislim, to je i za mene, znaš.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisam mogao vjerovati.
But we have to.	Ali moramo.
Time, as in, time.	Vrijeme, kao u, vrijeme.
I came back right away	Odmah sam se vratio
It was the first time ever.	Bio je to prvi put da je ikada.
As you will soon see, this is simply not true.	Kao što ćete uskoro vidjeti, to jednostavno nije istina.
In fact, it's good.	U stvari, to je dobro.
But she won't get it.	Ali ona to neće dobiti.
That happens here too.	To se dešava i ovdje.
But there is no help.	Ali nema pomoći.
I couldn't be here that long	Nisam mogao biti ovdje toliko dugo
I made things.	Ja sam napravio stvari.
really do not know	stvarno ne znam
Just do it fast.	Samo uradi to brzo.
He can't be here.	On ne može biti ovdje.
They did this to me.	Uradili su mi ovo.
I realized the problem	Shvatio sam problem
I thought he would go alone	Mislio sam da će otići sami
Many things need to be done	Mnogo stvari treba uraditi
I won't go if she's there	Neću ići ako je ona tamo
That's the problem.	To je problem.
I couldn't see him	Nisam ga mogao vidjeti
It is not me.	Nisam ja.
I know exactly what to do now	Tačno znam šta da radim sada
I hadn't heard her speak before.	Nisam je ranije čuo da govori.
But this never seems to happen fast enough.	Ali čini se da se ovo nikada ne dešava dovoljno brzo.
I know them all pretty well	Znam ih sve prilično dobro
I have to do it.	Moram to da uradim.
Maybe no one heard us.	Možda nas niko nije čuo.
It doesn't have to be bad.	Ne mora biti loše.
It was so obvious.	Bilo je tako očigledno.
He's like me.	On je kao ja.
She lives her own life.	Ona živi svoj život.
I think it was okay	Mislim da je bilo u redu
Except maybe that's not true either.	Osim što možda ni to nije istina.
Now, as always, he lives.	Sada, kao i uvek, živi.
They could have helped me, but they never did.	Mogli su mi pomoći, ali nikad nisu.
I didn't know anything about it	Nisam znao ništa o tome
I couldn't believe myself	Nisam mogao vjerovati sebi
It was probably a little too much.	Vjerovatno je bilo malo previše.
He is very good.	Vrlo je dobar.
I should do that.	Trebao bih to da uradim.
This is the first time	Ovo je prvi put
I didn't know what to think or say	Nisam znao šta da mislim ili kažem
I didn't know what to do	Nisam znao šta da radim
But the man won't be here long.	Ali čovjek neće dugo biti tu.
No, indeed, it is.	Ne, zaista, jeste.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post	Ne zna se da li je to tačno
I still didn't want to be with anyone	I dalje nisam htela da budem ni sa kim
I worked for him many years ago	Radio sam za njega prije mnogo godina
I can't even stay home	Ne mogu čak ni ostati kod kuće
And it should have been.	I trebalo je da bude.
I hope it will be good	Nadam se da će biti dobro
Say what needs to be said while you can.	Reci šta treba da se kaže dok možeš.
I don't like them anymore.	Ne volim ih više.
I've never seen him before.	Nikad ga ranije nisam video.
I thought tomorrow	Mislio sam sutra
There were none.	Nije ih bilo.
That was the only idea.	To je bila jedina ideja.
But she was here.	Ali ona je bila ovdje.
I'm sure of that.	U to sam siguran.
He just can do it.	On to jednostavno može.
And asked for help.	I tražio pomoć.
I didn't know you could do that	Nisam znao da to možeš
Not like they never knew.	Ne kao da nikada nisu znali.
You have one job.	Imaš jedan posao.
He seems to feel it.	Čini se da to osjeća.
And no, there's nothing you can do about it.	I ne, tu ništa ne možete učiniti.
That he was his father.	Da mu je bio otac.
I wonder where everyone is today	Pitam se gdje su svi danas
I tried to bring it all back.	Pokušao sam sve to vratiti.
It should take a few days	Trebalo bi to učiniti nekoliko dana
It's not just you.	Nisi samo ti.
I guess we didn't need anything	Pretpostavljam da nam ništa nije trebalo
He looked like me.	Izgledao je kao ja.
Not really .	Ne baš .
I never saw them again	Nikad ih više nisam video
I like both.	Sviđa mi se oboje.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
I’ve heard her say that many times	Čuo sam je kako to govori mnogo puta
Do this again.	Uradi ovo ponovo.
He didn't do that earlier yesterday.	To nije uradio ranije juče.
I was sure you would	Bio sam siguran da hoćeš
I have to go to work	Moram na posao
We have to be better.	Moramo biti bolji.
I didn't want to tell him anything	Nisam mu htio ništa reći
Nothing even tried.	Ništa čak ni pokušao.
Like her.	Kao i ona.
But that was not a problem.	Ali to nije bio problem.
I'm not sure yet.	Ni sam još nisam siguran.
It looks like everything.	To izgleda kao sve.
And yes, it really is that simple.	I da, zaista je tako jednostavno.
What he was doing at the time was fine.	Ono što je radio u to vrijeme bilo je u redu.
And it's not.	I nije.
This did not happen.	Ovo se nije dogodilo.
I got it yesterday	Dobio sam ga juče
I saw that too.	I ja sam to video.
I do not have much time	Nemam puno vremena
Really.	Zaista.
We can work more on that.	Možemo više raditi na tome.
It wasn't that easy for me.	Nije mi bilo tako lako.
I knew you would come back	Znao sam da ćeš se vratiti
I have a question.	Imam pitanje.
I know that's not true.	Znam da to nije istina.
They were and should be.	Bili su i trebali bi biti.
I didn't know what to do yet	Nisam još znao šta da radim
He was here.	Bio je ovdje.
And this one will do.	I ovaj će učiniti.
No, I never would.	Ne, nikada ne bi.
If he had time.	Kad bi imao vremena.
The job is good.	Posao je dobar.
I could no longer do my job properly	Nisam više mogao da radim svoj posao kako treba
I wish I had seen them together	Voleo bih da sam ih video zajedno
I want no.	Želim ne.
I could see what he was doing	Mogao sam vidjeti šta radi
Really good at it.	Zaista dobar u tome.
I already knew he wouldn't	Već sam znao da neće
I was sure everything that happened was real	Bio sam siguran da je sve što se dogodilo stvarno
You only needed to know what you needed to know.	Trebalo je da znate samo ono što je trebalo da znate.
I thought there was something wrong with that.	Mislio sam da nešto nije u redu s tim.
I've seen this so many times.	Vidio sam ovo toliko puta.
I hope we don't find that.	Nadam se da to nećemo naći.
I knew he never would	Znao sam da nikad neće
And it's hard to get there.	I teško doći do toga.
Don't you think so?	Zar ne misliš tako?
There is none.	Ne postoji ni jedan.
It was as good as ever.	Bilo je dobro kao i uvijek.
I'll move on.	Ja ću ići dalje.
When we can do it, we should do it.	Kada to možemo učiniti, trebali bismo to učiniti.
I wondered what he wanted	Pitao sam se šta želi
Maybe I'll even see him again.	Možda ću ga čak i ponovo vidjeti.
I haven't seen them in a while	Nisam ih vidio neko vrijeme
That is not allowed.	To nije dozvoljeno.
I think about this, from time to time	Mislim na ovo, s vremena na vrijeme
I only ever wanted you	Ja sam samo tebe ikada želeo
I love doing both.	Volim da radim oboje.
I was very tired.	Bio sam veoma umoran.
That's it for now.	To je to za sada.
For a while.	Za neko vrijeme.
This is like.	Ovo je kao.
I don't want to do this.	Ne želim ovo da radim.
I have a life here now	Sada imam život ovde
They can be much more.	Oni mogu biti mnogo više.
That he wants her.	Da je želi.
It's a job, really.	To je posao, zaista.
There are too many things to do here.	Ovdje ima previše stvari za raditi.
It was not easy to see.	Nije bilo lako vidjeti.
It really does exist.	Zaista postoji.
I could do well here	Mogao bih dobro raditi ovdje
My father knew to see if that was true.	Moj otac je znao da vidi da li je to istina.
I saw it there.	Video sam to tamo.
This may or may not be a good thing.	Ovo može ili ne mora biti dobra stvar.
I'm glad you were here	Drago mi je da ste bili ovdje
Not you, no, not you.	Ne ti, ne, ne ti.
I wasn't sure he was allowed to	Nisam bio siguran da mu je to dozvoljeno
It was just the thing.	To je bila samo stvar.
And she said it wasn't like that.	A ona je rekla da nije tako.
He didn't seem to need to eat.	Činilo se da ne treba da jede.
I can't do it alone.	Ne mogu sam.
But only.	Ali samo samo.
I didn't do anything good	Nisam uradio ništa dobro
I've been doing this for a while.	Radio sam to neko vrijeme.
We have it.	Imamo ga.
I wonder how it will be.	Pitam se kako će to biti.
You have this.	Imaš ovo.
I guess everything is fine	Pretpostavljam da je sve u redu
And that's pretty good	I to je prilično dobro
But we know better than that.	Ali mi znamo bolje od toga.
Maybe it was both.	Možda je bilo oboje.
She is really good.	Ona je zaista dobra.
I'm actually with you	Ja sam zapravo kod vas
I think that's enough for tonight	Mislim da je to dovoljno za večeras
That just didn’t happen here.	To se ovdje jednostavno nije dogodilo.
I shouldn't have done that	Nisam trebao to da uradim
I should see her here.	Trebalo bi da je vidim ovde.
I really wish this could be my life	Zaista bih volio da ovo može biti moj život
I wonder why he does that	Pitam se zašto to radi
I actually thought it was okay	Zapravo sam mislio da je u redu
But he couldn't help it.	Ali nije mogao pomoći.
I did everything for myself	Sve sam sebi uradio
I have something to ask you	Imam nešto da te pitam
I was just glad we could go home	Jednostavno mi je bilo drago što možemo ići kući
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
I could stay here with you	Mogao bih ostati ovdje sa tobom
I'm going fast.	idem brzo.
She even said.	Čak je i rekla.
He does almost everything right	On skoro sve radi kako treba
And look, 'she said.	I vidi', rekla je.
I couldn't at the moment	Trenutno nisam mogao
They could be anything.	Mogli bi biti bilo šta.
I decided to do it	Odlučio sam to učiniti
I say, do it.	Kažem, uradi to.
Really, really is.	Zaista, zaista jeste.
The problem, actually, is everything before that.	Problem je, zapravo, sve prije toga.
We have money in that.	Imamo novca u tome.
I didn't expect him to be there	Nisam očekivao da će biti tamo
I can't tell you anything more	Ne mogu vam reći ništa više
I don't know how old he is.	Ne znam koliko ima godina.
He says nothing about it.	On ništa ne kaže o tome.
I've never done that.	Nikada to nisam radio.
You can tell the truth.	Možeš reći istinu.
I asked why he was doing it	Pitao sam zašto to radi
He wants to be like you.	On želi da bude kao ti.
No one could say that.	Niko to nije mogao reći.
I've always loved it	Uvek sam to voleo
I never expected anything to come of it	Nikada nisam očekivao da će nešto biti od toga
And he will probably be right.	I vjerovatno će biti u pravu.
I didn’t expect something like that to really happen	Nisam očekivao da bi se tako nešto zaista moglo dogoditi
I didn't even know what was wrong	Ni sam nisam znao šta nije u redu
He left first.	On je prvi otišao.
I bought it from him	Kupio sam ga od njega
You always were.	Uvek si to bio.
That's fine with us.	Nama je to u redu.
Everything seems to be wrong.	Čini se da sve nije u redu.
I don't know if I should have.	Ne znam da li je trebalo.
It’s only three months, he says.	To su samo tri mjeseca, kaže.
Please tell me the truth.	Molim te reci mi istinu.
He looked good.	Dobro je izgledao.
He was so good.	Bio je tako dobar.
So he was busy.	Tako da je bio zauzet.
Maybe that was true.	Možda je to bila istina.
I know what my father did	Znam šta je moj otac uradio
She doesn't.	Ona ne.
And something not you.	I nešto ne ti.
I'm with him	Ja sam s njim
We're glad it's not.	Drago nam je da nije.
I couldn’t believe how many things he had to do	Nisam mogao vjerovati koliko stvari ima za uraditi
I never knew that, really	Nikad to nisam znao, zaista
I didn't get the job because of it	Nisam dobio posao zbog toga
It wasn't me.	Nije bilo mene.
But he did not leave	Ali on nije otišao
Maybe I won't be here that long	Možda me neće biti tako dugo
And it takes a while.	I treba neko vrijeme.
That is not what we see today.	To nije ono što se danas vidi.
Not to you.	Ne do tebe.
That should buy us more time.	To bi nam trebalo kupiti više vremena.
It's not just money.	Nije samo novac.
He may still be working there.	Možda još uvijek radi tamo.
Better you than me.	Bolje ti nego ja.
She said no, that's it for today.	Rekla je ne, to je to za danas.
I know you will	Znam da hoćeš
But it does not exist.	Ali ne postoji.
Just like me.	Baš kao i ja.
I felt sorry for you	Bilo mi je žao tebe
I want to know who did this	Želim da znam ko je ovo uradio
There are a lot of us.	Ima nas puno.
And a lot of that.	I mnogo toga.
That's all she thinks about.	To je sve o čemu ona misli.
And you.	I ti si.
Now they are gone.	Sada ih nema.
It's just, you were there.	Samo, ti si bio tamo.
I couldn't help it, I didn't want to help	Nisam mogao pomoći, nisam htio pomoći
I knew what he meant	Znao sam šta je mislio
I didn't know he was your friend.	Nisam znao da ti je prijatelj.
From now on, it's you and me.	Od sada smo ti i ja.
I saw that he was not well	Vidio sam da mu nije dobro
That's probably all you know.	To je vjerovatno sve što znaš.
I didn't know what to do.	Nisam znao šta da radim.
Maybe you could really help me.	Možda bi mi zaista mogao pomoći.
He would never do that.	On to nikada ne bi uradio.
He was ready last year.	Bio je spreman prošle godine.
I would give until tomorrow.	Dao bih do sutra.
I heard that for the first time	Prvi put sam to čuo
This time would be the first.	Ovaj put bi bio prvi.
He wanted to talk a lot.	Mnogo je želeo da govori.
Tell him to say what he has to say.	Reci mu da kaže šta ima da kaže.
Nobody wants them.	Niko ih ne želi.
That seems to be the right way to go.	Čini se da je to pravi način.
I think you have to be	Mislim da moraš biti
I can not believe	Ne mogu vjerovati
It better not be.	Bolje da ne bude.
They should be.	Trebali bi biti.
I can't go on without him	Ne mogu dalje bez njega
I am not and I cannot be.	Nisam i ne mogu biti.
And happy journey !.	I sretan put!.
I'm not afraid of him.	Ne bojim ga se.
But she's right.	Ali ona je u pravu.
I don't know much more than that, 'he said.	Ne znam mnogo više od toga', rekao je.
I want to see her again.	Želim je ponovo vidjeti.
I think it will be fine	Mislim da će biti u redu
I won't talk about it	Neću o tome
He obviously lost everything.	Očigledno je izgubio sve.
She was there.	Bila je tamo.
He has money.	On ima novac.
Good or bad.	Dobro ili loše.
I really wanted to	Zaista sam htela
No one has ever heard of it.	Niko nikada nije čuo za to.
This is it.	To je ovo.
I did everything right	Sve sam uradio kako treba
I wouldn't put money on that.	Ne bi dao novac na to.
I could say that right away	Mogao bih to odmah reći
I already know where you are and everything	Već znam gdje si i sve
You, not me.	Ti, ne ja.
I didn't see anything	Nisam video ništa
I knew no one would ever.	Znao sam da niko nikada neće.
I know what you need.	Znam šta ti treba.
I did my best.	Dao sam sve od sebe.
That's my way.	To je moj način.
I hope all is well with you	Nadam se da je sve u redu s tobom
I don't see us working	Ne vidim da radimo
We are together.	Mi smo zajedno.
I know that's bad enough for you	Znam da ti je to dovoljno loše
I just love it !.	Jednostavno volim!.
He didn't ask for her.	Nije je tražio.
I told him it worked.	Rekao sam mu da je radio.
I'm still not sure what to do with it.	Još uvijek nisam siguran šta da radim s tim.
I guess so	Pretpostavljam da bi
I do not know what it is.	Ne znam šta je to.
I expected more	Očekivao sam više
I didn't have time to ask what it was	Nisam imao vremena da pitam šta je to
I needed this this morning	Trebalo mi je ovo jutros
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
I didn't even know	Nisam ni sam znao
It's your day.	Tvoj je dan.
And do something good.	I učini nešto dobro.
I can't tell you how it happened	Ne mogu vam reći kako se to dogodilo
I wouldn't be here at all	Ja uopšte ne bih bio ovde
We didn't know what to do.	Šta da radimo nismo znali.
I'm glad to do that	Drago mi je da to uradim
We'll see about that today.	To ćemo danas vidjeti.
I think you should talk about it.	Mislim da bi trebao razgovarati o tome.
He's not sure he could.	Nije siguran da bi mogao.
It's you.	To si ti.
He's gone.	Više ga nema.
He is absolutely right	On je to potpuno u pravu
I couldn’t believe that was all	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je to sve
But she doesn't look.	Ali ona ne izgleda.
I will still be here	I dalje ću biti ovdje
I doubt it would	Sumnjam da bi
I came to be with you	Došao sam da budem sa tobom
But there isn't much to it.	Ali nema toga puno.
I just thought he had a good day	Samo sam mislio da ima dobar dan
I would like to be what you want to be	Voleo bih da budem ono što želiš
So far no one was.	Do sada niko nije.
I can do everything he can.	Ja mogu sve što može.
I didn't know what to do	Nisam znao šta da radim
I would never want to do that.	Nikada to ne bih želeo da uradim.
He certainly will.	Sigurno hoće.
Was that it.	Da li je to bilo to.
I'm here for you when I'm ready	Tu sam za tebe kad budem spreman
I'm fine with that.	U redu sam sa tim.
And it really isn't.	A zapravo i nije.
I thought you were	Mislio sam da jesi
You can help too.	I ti možeš pomoći.
I think that will happen.	Mislim da će se to dogoditi.
You know which one.	Znaš koji.
And he's waiting now.	I on sada čeka.
I want her to know.	Želim da ona zna.
And not here.	I ne ovde.
It works, he told himself, working on it.	Radi, rekao je sebi, radi na tome.
Or is it this.	Ili je to ovo.
He never will.	Nikad neće.
He's a busy guy.	On je zauzet momak.
This is simply more.	Ovo je jednostavno više.
He wants to go.	On želi da ide.
It's not life.	To nije život.
I had to know.	Morao sam znati.
I would never say something like that.	Nikad ne bih rekao tako nešto.
I thought you wanted me to be happy	Mislio sam da želiš da budem sretan
I will never be her.	Ja nikad neću biti ona.
In fact, there is no right way.	U stvari, ne postoji pravi način.
Which it may not.	Što možda neće.
I can do that.	Ja to mogu da uradim.
She can't leave.	Ona ne može otići.
I know the job.	Znam posao.
I want this more than you could know.	Želim ovo više nego što biste mogli znati.
This is really happening	Ovo se zaista dešava
I thought it was too much	Mislio sam da je to previše
I hope you will tell me soon	Nadam se da ćeš mi uskoro reći
Everyone knew that.	Svi su to znali.
But I wouldn't.	Ali ne bi.
Maybe they were right.	Možda su bili u pravu.
I knew it and she knew it	Ja sam to znao i ona je to znala
He admitted that he couldn't do anything himself.	Priznao je da ne može ništa od sebe.
No one could leave.	Niko nije mogao otići.
I didn't want to see anyone	Nisam htela nikoga da vidim
And for me, this was very strong.	I za mene je ovo bilo jako jako.
And he means it.	I on to misli.
I didn't think that was true	Nisam mislio da je to istina
But that's life.	Ali, to je život.
But the day before.	Ali dan ranije.
Not a good day for him either.	Ni za njega nije dobar dan.
I just wasn't sure what to say	Samo nisam bio siguran šta da kažem
We are not sure what to do now.	Nismo sigurni šta da radimo sada.
That's not a good thing.	To nije dobra stvar.
There was still plenty of time.	Bilo je još dosta vremena.
I couldn't know	Ne bih mogao znati
I knew you would come	Znao sam da ćeš doći
But that really isn’t helpful.	Ali to zaista nije od pomoći.
You just know there's something there, but you don't know what.	Samo znaš da je nešto tamo, ali ne znaš šta.
She lives there, okay.	Ona živi tamo, u redu.
I've seen them before	Video sam ih ranije
I haven't told him anything yet	Nisam mu još ništa rekao
I'm not like him.	Ja nisam kao on.
I have no more people.	Nemam više ljudi.
I thought you wanted to be my friend	Mislio sam da želiš biti moj prijatelj
Like, you just have to.	Kao, jednostavno moraš.
I loved having something	Voleo sam da ima nešto
I like what he does	Sviđa mi se to što radi
It won't go any further.	Neće više ići.
She was no longer right.	Više nije bila u pravu.
But, as you know, it can't be.	Ali, kao što znate, to ne može biti.
I think we all know better now	Mislim da sada svi znamo bolje
But I have a problem.	Ali imam problem.
I guess it's hope itself	Pretpostavljam da je to sama nada
And how you were.	I kako si bio.
I would too	I ja bih bio
She talks about it herself.	Ona sama o tome priča.
It's better now.	Sada je bolje.
I guess you had a bad trip.	Pretpostavljam da si imao loš put.
He couldn't do it alone.	Nije to mogao sam.
Now I can move on.	Sada mogu dalje.
I wanted it to be mine	Htela sam da bude moj
When he arrived, she was not there.	Kada je stigao, nije bila tamo.
I said the right thing	Rekao sam pravu stvar
That is what we should do.	To je ono što bismo trebali učiniti.
He was not a father.	Nije bio otac.
It was often both.	Često je bilo oboje.
But other than that, you're doing well.	Ali osim toga, dobro ti ide.
I think so much.	Mislim toliko.
This is difficult.	Ovo je teško.
He makes the car do what he likes.	On čini da auto radi ono što on voli.
But those are just things.	Ali to su samo stvari.
Now I know.	Sada znam.
I really need to talk to him	Zaista moram razgovarati s njim
I hope that's okay.	Nadam se da je to u redu.
Someone had to be there.	Neko je morao biti tamo.
That's not.	To nije.
He wanted to talk now.	Htio je sada razgovarati.
Someone is talking about it.	Neko priča sa tim.
I was there myself	I sam sam bio tamo
I'm not done with him	Nisam završio s njim
I didn't know who he was	Nisam znao ko je on
You can only know what is true for you.	Možete znati samo ono što je istina za vas.
This is all.	To je sve.
I don't like them.	Ne volim ih.
Not so, she told herself.	Nije tako, rekla je sebi.
That can’t be said, he said.	To se ne može reći, rekao je.
I need to know what she wants	Moram da znam šta ona želi
I have no idea where they are and whether they are.	Nemam pojma gdje su i da li su.
I know you thought you were	Znam da si mislio da jesi
I got this one today	Dobio sam ovaj danas
Like a lot a lot.	Kao puno puno.
I wasn’t sure how, but it just was	Nisam bio siguran kako, ali jednostavno je bilo
Does not work.	Ne radi.
If they only knew.	Kad bi samo znali.
Maybe he's gone.	Možda je otišao.
That was thirty years ago that we need to talk about.	To je bilo prije trideset godina o čemu moramo razgovarati.
If you don't like it, you don't like it.	Ako ti se ne sviđa, ne sviđa ti se.
But it doesn’t have to be just a job.	Ali to ne mora biti samo posao.
Not bad weather.	Nije loše vrijeme.
It was hard this time.	Ovaj put je bilo teško.
Like people.	Kao i ljudi.
He really loves himself.	Zaista voli sebe.
I think that's it	Mislim da je to to
That took a while.	Zbog toga je trebalo neko vrijeme.
She just knew.	Samo je znala.
He always was.	Uvek je bio.
What he was and what he did.	Šta je bio i šta je uradio.
For him, it is not life.	Za njega to nije život.
He didn't have to do that, but he did.	Nije morao to da uradi, ali jeste.
I do not have much time.	Nemam puno vremena.
But she wanted it.	Ali ona je to htela.
I knew it wouldn't be easy	Znao sam da neće biti lako
And it was raining.	I kiša je bila.
I can work.	Mogu raditi.
This is probably true.	Ovo je vjerovatno istina.
I knew right away who did this	Odmah sam znao ko je ovo uradio
I shouldn't do this for you	Ne bih trebao to da radim za tebe
And that was good for him.	I to je bilo dobro za njega.
I went back to the meeting	Vratio sam se na sastanak
No, that can't be true.	Ne, to ne može biti tačno.
He doesn't do it for you.	On to ne radi za tebe.
I didn't understand why you did what you did	Nisam shvatio zašto si uradio to što si uradio
This is probably not true.	Ovo vjerovatno nije istina.
I'm not the only one who thinks so	Nisam jedini koji tako misli
Would that be a problem?	Da li bi to bio problem?
He is just what we are all here for.	On je samo ono što smo svi mi ovde.
I can not believe	Ne mogu vjerovati
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I just couldn't stay home, you know	Jednostavno nisam mogao ostati kod kuće, znaš
For a job.	Za posao.
And so it was here.	I tako je bilo ovdje.
I didn't really want to be here	Nisam baš htela da budem ovde
It was good to help.	Bilo je dobro pomoći.
He had to be fine, he had to be.	Morao je biti dobro, morao je biti.
Or maybe they aren't.	Ili možda i nisu.
I think you knew that too.	Mislim da si i ti to znao.
No, that's not a problem.	Ne, to nije problem.
He hasn't asked for it yet.	On to još nije tražio.
I actually expected that	Zapravo sam to očekivao
And that's exactly it	I to je upravo to
I have to do this	Moram ovo da uradim
I can't believe this is your first job	Ne mogu vjerovati da ti je to prvi posao
There was another and another and another.	Bio je još jedan i još jedan i još jedan.
I don't think you're going to do anything.	Mislim da nećeš ništa uraditi.
But it will not be so.	Ali to neće biti tako.
I see that no one is.	Vidim da niko nije.
I couldn't say what he meant	Nisam mogao reći šta je mislio
I have to see him again	Moram ponovo da ga vidim
He could tell.	Mogao je reći.
I gave him a job.	Dao sam mu posao.
I'll be there soon	Doći ću uskoro
What happened next, and what happened next, you want to know.	Šta se dalje dogodilo, a šta dalje, želite da znate.
I know and it will come in handy	Znam i to će mi dobro doći
And you can never go back to that again.	I nikada se više ne možete vratiti na to.
I didn't expect him to say that	Nisam očekivao da će to reći
I just didn't know what to say	Samo nisam znao šta da kažem
This has happened so many times.	To se dogodilo toliko puta.
I've never seen her there before	Nikada je ranije tamo nisam video
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
I really want to know.	Zaista želim da znam.
I love you so, so, very much	Volim te tako, tako, mnogo
That's what he wanted to do.	To je htio da uradi.
He didn't want that, he knew so much.	Nije to želeo, toliko je znao.
That just happened.	To se upravo dogodilo.
I never did, not really.	Nikad nisam, ne baš.
And it works well.	I dobro radi.
And no, we won't tell you how it was.	I ne, nećemo vam reći kako je bilo.
I wasn't very ready	Nisam bio baš spreman
I would have to.	Morao bih.
Not many people.	Nema mnogo ljudi.
I have no idea why that is	Nemam pojma zašto je to tako
That was exactly what he wanted.	To je bilo upravo ono što je želio.
I came a little	Malo sam došao
But that's not a good idea.	Ali to nije dobra ideja.
I can't tell you now why	Ne mogu vam sada reći zašto
Does anyone know if this is true.	Zna li neko da li je to istina.
But how do I do this?	Ali kako da ovo uradim?
No it's not.	Ne nije.
I think he knew something was going on	Mislim da je znao da se nešto dešava
I had nothing to say.	Nisam imao šta da kažem.
I really think you should go now	Zaista mislim da bi sada trebao ići
Believe it.	Vjerovati u to.
I wasn't much better	Nisam bio mnogo bolji
I didn't know this existed	Nisam znao da ovo postoji
I can't say much more	Ne mogu reći mnogo više
He couldn't leave.	Nije mogao da ode.
I mean really, really	Mislim stvarno, stvarno
And it’s not always obvious.	I nije uvijek očigledno.
I know he didn't mean anything bad	Znam da nije mislio ništa loše
I wish I had your job.	Voleo bih da imam tvoj posao.
Nobody did anything.	Niko ništa nije uradio.
We are not together.	Nismo zajedno.
Be so good.	Biti tako dobar.
She said no.	Rekla je da nije.
It shouldn't have been.	Nije trebalo biti.
I don't have much to do	Nemam šta mnogo da radim
I think that says it all	Mislim da to govori sve
I would say more.	Rekao bih više.
I didn't say any of that	Nisam rekao ništa od toga
He knew nothing more.	Nije znao ništa više.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Možda malo, možda mnogo.
I didn't want to be here	Nisam htela da budem ovde
Would that be a problem if.	Da li bi to bio problem ako.
I didn't hear anything.	Nisam ništa čuo.
This happens often.	To se dešava često.
I didn't know what he was	Nisam znao šta je on
I don't want to be like her	Ne želim da budem kao ona
That will be very difficult for me.	To će mi biti jako teško.
I'm afraid of them too.	I ja ih se bojim.
I think there is something you should see	Mislim da postoji nešto što biste trebali vidjeti
Even this was not supposed to be.	Čak ni ovo nije trebalo biti.
I've already done that	Već sam to napravio
I was like her.	Bio sam kao ona.
That's what it's about.	O tome se radi.
I wondered why, but I didn’t ask	Pitao sam se zašto, ali nisam pitao
I have to do it.	Moram to da uradim.
But not so sure.	Ali ne tako sigurno.
They had plenty of time, she said.	Imali su dosta vremena, rekla je.
I tried to do things	Pokušao sam da radim stvari
I had a few friends there	Imao sam nekoliko prijatelja tamo
He knew how to do it.	Znao je kako to da uradi.
I haven't done that in so long	Nisam to radio tako dugo
He is such a good man.	On je tako dobar čovjek.
I would be very surprised if it existed	Bio bih veoma iznenađen da postoji
But how can we be sure?	Ali kako možemo biti sigurni?
You have to do this.	Morate ovo da uradite.
More than they said they ever were.	Više nego što su rekli da su ikada bili.
You are always there for me.	Uvek si tu za mene.
We can’t be anything more than friends, we just can’t.	Ne možemo biti ništa više od prijatelja, jednostavno ne možemo.
But it's not even that.	Ali nije čak ni to baš to.
I didn't mean it that way	Nisam to mislio na taj način
He wondered if she knew.	Pitao se da li ona zna.
It was hard to find.	Bilo je teško naći.
I know exactly who the father is	Znam tačno ko je otac
Maybe you were right.	Možda si bio u pravu.
You looked much better.	Izgledao si mnogo bolje.
And that takes time.	A za to treba vremena.
I won't let him.	Neću mu to dozvoliti.
I don't even want to know how bad.	Ne želim ni da znam koliko loše.
She doesn't want anything to do with me.	Ona ne želi ništa sa mnom.
Nobody knows at home.	Kod kuće niko ne zna.
And time is an issue.	I vrijeme je problem.
He just loves them.	On ih jednostavno voli.
And no one could find him.	I niko ga ne bi mogao naći.
This is simply not true.	Ovo jednostavno nije istina.
I finished work earlier	Završio sam posao ranije
I knew exactly who he was	Tačno sam znao ko je on
This better be good.	Bolje da je ovo dobro.
But maybe.	Ali možda.
But we have little time.	Ali imamo malo vremena.
I said something like that.	Rekao sam ne tako nešto.
I will never do anything	Nikada ništa neću uraditi
So everything was fine.	Tako da je sve bilo dobro.
You know it is.	Znaš da jeste.
It was our first time.	Bio nam je to prvi put.
I don't think so.	Mislim da neće.
She said yes, but that's not true.	Rekla je da jeste, ali to nije istina.
He had money.	Imao je novac.
I shouldn't have left	Nisam trebao otići
Today was a day for me.	Danas je bio dan za mene.
It was probably at the time.	U to vrijeme je vjerovatno bilo.
It happened again.	Ponovo se dogodilo.
We know what this is about.	Znamo o čemu se radi.
I didn't know it took so long	Nisam znao da je trebalo toliko dugo
I'm just glad.	Samo mi je drago.
She is mine, mine, mine.	Ona je moja, moja, moja.
That's good for us.	To je dobro za nas.
I wasn't sure about anything anymore	Nisam više ni u šta bio siguran
It's not really a bad job.	To zapravo i nije loš posao.
No, we didn't.	Ne, nismo.
But he did not leave.	Ali on nije otišao.
It was time for him.	Bilo je vrijeme za njega.
I'll give it to him	Ja ću mu dati
I will definitely win.	Sigurno ću pobijediti.
You're not your job.	Ti nisi tvoj posao.
And this is it.	I to je ovo.
I didn't tell him that	Nisam mu to rekao
I just want to be home	Samo želim biti kod kuće
But it doesn't work.	Ali ne radi.
I can't go on	Ne mogu dalje
This is the truth.	Ovo je istina.
More more more.	Više više više.
I didn't know what was wrong with me	Nisam znao šta je sa mnom
There is nothing you can do right now.	Trenutno ništa ne možete učiniti.
I didn't see any of that	Nisam vidio ništa od toga
And for me, that says something.	A za mene to nešto govori.
I was looking for myself	Tražio sam sebe
But really.	Ali zaista.
I like to think about it.	Volim da mislim o tome.
I mean, not at all	Mislim, uopšte nije
Now that was not enough.	Sada to nije bilo dovoljno.
It won't get any better.	Neće biti bolje.
I have no problem with that, good for you.	Nemam problema s tim, dobro za tebe.
You could do that, you know.	I ti bi to mogao, znaš.
I didn't decide	Nisam se odlučio
And this is simple.	I ovo je jednostavno.
It seems that from.	Čini se da od.
And for me, that is not the way to live.	A za mene to nije način da se živi.
That was hard.	To je bilo teško.
But it was always helpful.	Ali uvijek je bilo od pomoći.
No one has ever seen him.	Niko ga nikada nije vidio.
I am, and always am	Ja sam, i uvek sam tu
I'm happy to have him here.	Sretan sam što ga imam ovdje.
He would be right.	Bio bi u pravu.
I wonder why he came back	Pitam se zašto se vratio
I'm afraid of you.	Bojim te se.
I wondered what this one looked like	Pitao sam se kako ovaj izgleda
I knew the job right away	Odmah sam znao posao
But I'm not alone.	Ali nisam sama.
I can't do without you.	Ne mogu bez tebe.
This is happening.	Ovo se dešava.
I was surprised what he did	Bio sam iznenađen šta je uradio
I can't tell you what he did there	Ne mogu vam reći šta je tamo radio
I guess it was pretty bad	Pretpostavljam da je bilo prilično loše
We are on it.	Mi smo na tome.
I never finished anything	Nikad ništa nisam završio
I wouldn't be without it	Ne bih bio bez toga
There are more.	Ima ih još.
He could have helped him.	Mogao mu je pomoći.
I'm not so tired.	Nisam tako umoran.
Right now, it was time.	Upravo sada, bilo je vrijeme.
You have to do everything.	Moraš sve da uradiš.
I did not understand.	Nisam shvatio.
He was happy to do so.	Bio je sretan što je to uradio.
You can't be.	Ne možeš biti.
I wasn't sure what to say either	Ni ja nisam bio siguran šta da kažem
You said it was going to be hard, and it was.	Rekao si da će biti teško, i bilo je.
I thought he would.	Mislio sam da hoće.
I wasn't so surprised.	Nisam bio toliko iznenađen.
She's fine.	Ona je dobro.
I certainly wouldn't.	Ja sigurno ne bih.
This must be done !.	Ovo se mora uraditi!.
Neither had a clue what to say.	Ni jedan nije imao pojma šta da kaže.
I should have helped you	Trebao sam ti pomoći
But there is a problem.	Ali tu je problem.
I just have to see him	Samo ga moram vidjeti
I hope no one saw me	Nadam se da me niko nije video
I bought you a car too	Kupio sam ti i auto
I had nothing to do with it	Nisam imao ništa s tim
But he didn't tell anyone.	Ali nikome nije rekao.
Why didn't you go to dinner? 	Zašto nisi otišao na večeru?
he asked me.	pitao me je.
She knew why.	Znala je zašto.
I just thought that, you know	Samo sam to mislio, znaš
Yes, that's it.	Da, to je to.
But no one could leave.	Ali niko nije mogao da ode.
Guys, no.	Ljudi, ne.
That's my job.	To je moj posao.
There is nothing he does not know.	Ne postoji ništa što on ne zna.
I haven't seen this.	Nisam video ovo.
Business is going well.	Posao ide dobro.
I'm really happy to be here now	Zaista sam sretan što sam sada ovdje
That will be fine.	To će biti u redu.
It won't be hard to find.	Neće ga biti teško naći.
Now you know what happened.	Sada znate šta se dogodilo.
I didn't see or hear anyone.	Nisam nikoga vidio ni čuo.
I need to know about you.	Moram da znam za tebe.
I didn't expect a lot of people	Nisam očekivao puno ljudi
I know it is.	Znam da jeste.
He said.	On je rekao.
I began to see myself	Počeo sam da vidim sebe
I certainly didn’t go back to that time	Sigurno se nisam vratio u to vrijeme
But not good.	Ali ne dobar.
Do what you have to, for you.	Uradite ono što morate, za vas.
I'll tell you what we need to do, he said.	Reći ću vam šta treba da uradimo, rekao je.
It's time for work.	Vrijeme je za posao.
I hope he comes back soon	Nadam se da će se uskoro vratiti
What is it.	O čemu se radi.
They already had too many problems.	Već su imali previše problema.
So it took a while.	Tako je trebalo neko vrijeme.
We could certainly do that here.	Mogli bismo to sigurno uraditi ovdje.
I can't say how long	Ne mogu reći koliko dugo
None of us were actually there.	Niko od nas zapravo nije bio tamo.
I didn't do this for the money	Nisam ovo uradio zbog novca
You never know who might be there.	Nikad ne znaš ko bi mogao biti tamo.
I think we've done enough for tonight	Mislim da smo uradili dovoljno za večeras
I think we'll be back in three days	Mislim da smo još za tri dana
I've always done my job, and done it well.	Uvek sam radio svoj posao, i to dobro.
I never seem to have time	Čini se da nikad nemam vremena
I hope it's good	Nadam se da je dobro
I didn't expect that either	Ni ja to nisam očekivao
Until we do the right thing, it just won't work.	Sve dok ne uradimo pravu stvar jednostavno neće raditi.
I mean, how do you do something like that	Mislim, kako da uradiš tako nešto
I want to know everything	Želim da znam sve
I don't see anyone with you	Ne vidim nikoga sa tobom
And that is it!.	I to je to!.
I couldn't believe it was her	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je to ona
But it happens.	Ali to se dešava.
I'm sure we've all done it.	Siguran sam da smo svi to uradili.
I know you don't work alone	Znam da ne radiš sam
She was in .	Bila je u .
The problem is that there is no way to know this for a while.	Problem je što ne postoji način da se to zna neko vrijeme.
I'm so sorry, that's him	Tako mi je žao, to je on
I don't know what's wrong.	Ne znam šta nije u redu.
I knew it wasn't	Znao sam da nije
I never asked for help	Nikad nisam tražio pomoć
He was just one of you.	Bio je samo jedan od vas.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
Now she knew exactly who it was.	Sada je tačno znala ko je to bio.
He needed more.	Trebalo mu je više.
I just don't know.	Samo ne znam.
I don't want them to know anything about it.	Ne želim da znaju ništa o tome.
You can do your job again.	Možete ponovo raditi svoj posao.
I didn't know what he wanted to talk about.	Nisam znao o čemu želi da priča.
I haven't seen it before	Nisam to ranije vidio
It works now.	Sada radi.
It was only a matter of time before the obvious happened.	Bilo je samo pitanje vremena kada će se dogoditi očigledno.
That's the story.	To je priča.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to da uradim.
I knew you would never come alone	Znao sam da nikad nećeš doći sam
Not much now.	Ne mnogo sada.
How they did it.	Kako su to uradili.
He still can.	Još uvijek to može.
I just know he will	Samo znam da hoće
Not what was, but what wasn't.	Ne šta je bilo, nego šta nije bilo.
I always know what you mean	Uvek znam na šta misliš
I had no idea something like that could happen	Nisam imao pojma da se tako nešto može dogoditi
It's good for you too.	Dobro je i za tebe.
I wasn't sure.	Nisam bio siguran.
I even have a new job!	Čak imam i novi posao!
But he knows something.	Ali on zna nešto.
You are a friend.	Ti si prijatelj.
How can I do this.	Kako mogu ovo da uradim.
As many times before.	Kao i mnogo puta do sada.
I have no idea what to tell you	Nemam pojma šta da ti kažem
You couldn't win.	Nisi mogao pobijediti.
It doesn't exist now.	Sada ne postoji.
I still doubt you'll believe me	I dalje sumnjam da ćeš mi vjerovati
He's good at it.	Dobar je u tome.
I didn't know what to do next	Nisam znao šta dalje
I can't really say why.	Ne mogu stvarno reći zašto.
Not even a little.	Čak ni malo.
There.	Tamo.
And this is what he said.	I ovo je ono što je rekao.
The things you do.	Stvari koje radite.
It could be.	Mogao bi biti.
I didn't want it to work, you know.	Nisam želeo da radi, znaš.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
You can't give me too much.	Ne možeš mi dati previše toga.
This time I'm going alone	Ovaj put idem sam
Everything works well.	Sve radi dobro.
I thought my day was going well	Mislio sam da mi dan ide dobro
We could do that.	Mogli bismo to da uradimo.
I had to know how he was.	Morao sam znati kako mu je.
I just can't.	Ne mogu samo.
You know, it was really hard.	Znate, bilo je stvarno teško.
I know what you mean	Znam šta želiš da kažeš
You have to go now.	Morate ići sada.
I never wanted her again	Nikad je više nisam želeo
The idea itself is good.	Sama ideja je dobra.
But he doesn't seem to be doing anything.	Ali izgleda da ništa ne radi.
As if that was going to happen.	Kao da će se to dogoditi.
He was bad.	Bio je loš.
I've seen this before	Vidio sam ovo ranije
And he.	I on.
They still haven't.	I dalje nisu.
Everyone is here.	Svi su ovde.
I said it was okay and that everything was fine.	Rekao sam da je u redu i da je sve u redu.
I don't even know what to think about it.	Ni sam ne znam šta da mislim o tome.
I wonder why he was here last night	Pitam se zašto je bio ovdje sinoć
I am absolutely nothing	Ja sam potpuno ništa
I'm not sure about anything	Nisam siguran ni u šta
Being good is not good enough.	Biti dobar nije dovoljno dobro.
I think you know very well what this is.	Mislim da dobro znaš šta je ovo.
Don't think about anything.	Ne misli ni na šta.
It never was.	Nikada nije bilo.
I had to do it for you	Morao sam to uraditi za tebe
I love having it there	Volim da ga imam tamo
I want to know what's going on	Želim da znam šta se dešava
I couldn't say or do anything.	Nisam mogao ništa reći ili učiniti.
I wonder what he was looking for	Pitam se šta je tražio
And your father.	I tvoj otac.
I thought everyone just knew.	Mislio sam da svi jednostavno znaju.
I would like to pay you back now.	Htio bih vam sada vratiti.
There is nothing but me.	Ništa ne postoji osim mene.
Do it.	Uraditi to.
Here we work together as a team.	Ovdje radimo zajedno kao tim.
He is not.	On nije.
It works.	To radi.
Nothing is really what it seems.	Ništa zapravo nije ono što izgleda.
This one doesn't.	Ovaj nema.
I think you'll be fine	Mislim da ćeš biti dobro
There is much more time now.	Sada ima mnogo više vremena.
It's just you and me tonight.	Večeras smo samo ti i ja.
I said this would be fine	Rekao sam da bi ovo bilo u redu
You did your job.	Uradili ste svoj posao.
I should have been happy	Trebao sam biti sretan
I don't think they knew what was going on	Mislim da nisu znali šta se dešava
I think you know.	Mislim da znaš.
But none of that really happened.	Ali zaista se ništa od toga nije dogodilo.
I didn't know what to think	Nisam znao šta da mislim
I didn't mean that.	Nisam to mislio.
This is my life now.	Ovo je sada moj život.
I needed to know more, much more	Trebalo je da znam više, mnogo više
I thought of you so often	Tako sam često mislio na tebe
I know he couldn't do that	Znam da to ne bi mogao
I mean, unless you have to be anywhere	Mislim, osim ako ne moraš biti bilo gdje
I knew you didn't know where he lived	Znao sam da ne znaš gdje živi
So we had it.	Tako da smo ga imali.
And it works.	I to radi.
I know what you did	Znam šta si radio
You don't have to do this, you know.	Ne moraš ovo da radiš, znaš.
I'm not sure what to do.	Nisam siguran šta da radim.
This was the way to do it.	Ovo je bio način da se to uradi.
That will come soon.	To će uskoro doći.
I am the one who loves them	Ja sam taj koji ih voli
I know you can do both	Znam da možeš oboje
But the problem still exists.	Ali problem i dalje postoji.
He could be all that.	On bi mogao biti sve to.
I want that, she tells him	Želim da to, kaže mu ona
I know it's hard for you	Znam da ti je teško
He's been there a long time.	On je tamo dugo vremena.
But really, we don't know how much we don't know.	Ali zaista, ne znamo koliko ne znamo.
I've heard it a few times	Čuo sam to nekoliko puta
I don't think it's that simple.	Mislim da nije tako jednostavno.
You can't do this long enough.	Ne možete ovo raditi dovoljno vremena.
But it doesn't work.	Ali to ne radi.
I know it’s only for a little while, but it’s enough.	Znam da je to samo za malo, ali dovoljno je.
Not now, not tonight.	Ne sada, ne večeras.
I didn't even know how it happened	Nisam ni znao kako se to dogodilo
And she.	I ona.
Something bad would have happened by now.	Nešto loše bi se do sada dogodilo.
I saw you together.	Video sam vas zajedno.
That was not it.	To nije bilo to.
He could too.	Mogao bi i on.
And it is.	I jeste.
Everything is for you, and you are for me.	Sve je za tebe, a ti si za mene.
I didn't want that.	Nisam to želio.
I've had enough of him	Bilo mi je dosta od njega
I have no more friends.	Nemam više prijatelja.
We need better.	Moramo bolje.
But this may not be easy.	Ali ovo možda neće biti lako.
Just do the right thing.	Samo radi pravu stvar.
Nothing is happening anymore.	Ništa se više ne dešava.
He meant it.	On je to mislio.
I did it myself.	Sam sam to uradio.
I had to know what was going on and why.	Morao sam da znam šta se dešava i zašto.
I hope it's good.	Nadam se da je dobro.
That's your problem.	To je tvoj problem.
This is not easy to do.	Ovo nije lako uraditi.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
I might feel sorry for them	Moglo bi mi ih biti žao
I didn't know there were more	Nisam znao da ih ima više
But there really was no one.	Ali zaista nije bilo nikoga.
It works more than ever.	Radi više od bilo koga.
I just wanted to say	Samo sam želio reći
I wonder a lot about that	Mnogo se pitam o tome
I have no idea what that could be	Nemam pojma šta bi to moglo biti
He was a very good friend of mine.	Bio je jedan moj veoma dobar prijatelj.
Nothing is wrong.	Ništa nije u redu.
I know it's not just me.	Znam da nisam samo ja.
I wasn't good at it	Nisam bio dobar u tome
Life goes on.	Život ide dalje.
I was sure.	Bio sam siguran.
But even if it were true.	Ali čak i da je istina.
It's just hard.	Samo je teško.
I often had a lot more	Često sam imao mnogo više
I have so much to say	Imam toliko toga za reći
The thing is, it could have been.	Stvar je u tome što je moglo biti.
But there were so many.	Ali bilo je toliko.
I really love him a lot	Zaista ga mnogo volim
I started this morning	Počeo sam jutros
There are none.	Nema ih.
I must have thought it would be difficult	Sigurno sam mislio da će biti teško
But what we need to do goes much further.	Ali ono što treba da uradimo ide mnogo dalje.
Everything is already working.	Sve već radi.
He got lost.	Izgubio se.
I mean, you shouldn't	Mislim, ne bi trebalo
I needed a job and I’m still working	Trebao mi je posao i još uvijek radim
If he could do it, he could do anything.	Ako je to mogao, mogao je sve.
But this can happen	Ali ovo se može dogoditi
I asked someone what was going on	Pitao sam nekoga šta se dešava
He is not one of us.	On nije jedan od nas.
I thought about you a lot too	I ja sam mnogo mislio na tebe
But he doesn't have to do that.	Ali on to ne mora da radi.
You surely know that.	Vi to sigurno znate.
I really like this one	Baš mi se sviđa ovaj
It was hard not to be.	Bilo je teško ne biti.
I don't see who it is.	Ne vidim ko je to.
Nothing was real.	Ništa nije bilo stvarno.
But please know this.	Ali molim vas da znate ovo.
I didn't know what to do before	Nisam znao šta da radim ranije
We have the following.	Imamo sljedeće.
I love you very much.	Volim te mnogo.
But there is no money.	Ali nema novca.
He would do it himself.	On bi to sam uradio.
If we can.	Ako možemo.
No, this was wrong.	Ne, ovo nije bilo u redu.
I can stay a while	Mogu ostati malo
He gave me money.	Dao mi je novac.
She knows the way.	Ona zna način.
But not me.	Ali ne ja.
I know there is someone for me	Znam da postoji neko za mene
I actually like this better.	Ovo mi se zapravo više sviđa.
I didn't expect it to be difficult	Nisam očekivao da će biti teško
You lost everything.	Izgubio si sve.
I have money.	Imam novac.
It's none of that.	To nije ništa od toga.
I can't believe it all happened	Ne mogu vjerovati da se sve to dogodilo
I worked and that was it	Radio sam i to je bilo sve
I would never say that for anyone but you	Nikad to ne bih rekao ni za koga osim za tebe
It won't work without it.	Neće raditi bez toga.
I think that's a good idea.	Mislim da je to dobra ideja.
And, it seems he can.	I, čini se da može.
He still won't do anything.	I dalje neće ništa učiniti.
I got a little lost	Malo sam se izgubio
I actually work for a living	Ja zapravo radim za život
But you wanted money.	Ali ti si htela novac.
I heard you didn't want me	Čuo sam da me ne želiš
Except it wasn't her.	Osim što to nije bila ona sama.
Yes, that's better.	Da, to je bolje.
He was still sorry.	I dalje mu je bilo žao.
No, that's not enough.	Ne, to nije dovoljno.
I wasn't sure what to think about it	Nisam bio siguran šta da mislim o tome
But he had to.	Ali morao je.
Maybe you had them.	Možda ste ih imali.
I almost finished it	Skoro sam ga završio
I've never seen him.	Nikad ga nisam vidio.
I know you can.	Znam da možeš.
He didn't realize it.	Nije to shvatio.
He knew he wouldn't.	Znao je da neće.
I couldn't leave.	Nisam mogao otići.
I love my team.	Volim svoj tim.
No one has to do everything alone.	Niko ne mora sve sam.
I am sure.	Ja sam siguran.
He shouldn't want her.	Ne bi trebao da je želi.
The day is already now.	Dan je već sada.
Tell me something about it.	Reci mi nešto o tome.
I just wanted to be her	Samo sam htela da budem ja
I tried to say something.	Pokušao sam nešto reći.
I have no idea what happened	Nemam pojma šta se dogodilo
I do it to be better.	Radim to da bih bio bolji.
I didn't see it that way	Nisam to tako vidio
I hope it works.	Nadam se da radi.
I was ready.	Bio sam spreman.
I'm glad you found it helpful	Drago mi je da vam je bilo od pomoći
Or where this is.	Ili gdje je ovo.
I don't want anything to do with it	Ne želim ništa s tim
But you weren't there.	Ali ti nisi bio tamo.
He is back.	Vratio se.
I wouldn't have to stay long	Ne bih morao dugo ostati
I mean, you can trust me	Mislim, možeš mi vjerovati
And I'll get some of that	I ja ću dobiti nešto od toga
They said so.	Rekli su da je tako.
That someone was me.	Taj neko sam bio ja.
Nobody knows what to do.	Niko ne zna šta da radi.
He knows that and he won't.	To on zna i neće.
But maybe, now he will.	Ali možda, sada hoće.
I knew it existed, but not where	Znao sam da postoji, ali ne gdje
As far as I know, they never did that.	Koliko ja znam, oni to nikada nisu uradili.
That's just not good.	To jednostavno nije dobro.
I was sure things would not go well	Bio sam siguran da stvari neće ići kako treba
But he did things.	Ali on je radio stvari.
This can't be my life.	Ovo ne može biti moj život.
Or I'm afraid of you.	Ili se bojim tebe.
I just won't.	Jednostavno neću.
They were with you.	Bili su kod tebe.
I felt sorry for him	Bilo mi ga je žao
He thought he could do better.	Mislio je da može bolje.
But there is nothing wrong with that, for sure.	Ali nema ništa loše u tome, sigurno.
I didn't know what to say to that	Nisam znao šta da kažem na to
This is not right.	Ovo nije u redu.
I never wanted this life for you	Nikad nisam želeo ovaj život za tebe
But in fact it is not.	Ali u stvari nije.
It is often probable.	Često je vjerovatno.
I wish I knew.	Voleo bih da znam.
I didn't think you'd come alone	Nisam mislio da ćeš doći sam
I have seen him many times	Vidio sam ga mnogo puta
I thought it was you.	Mislio sam da si ti.
Yes, she is here.	Da, ona je ovdje.
I wasn't ready for it to be me	Nisam bio spreman da to budem ja
I wondered what to do next	Pitao sam se šta dalje
I didn't see who was driving	Nisam vidio ko vozi
May not.	Ne mora.
I didn't expect this at all	Nisam ovo uopšte očekivao
I heard about it	Čuo sam za to
I know what my father will say	Znam šta će moj otac reći
I think it was hard for him	Mislim da mu je bilo teško
You do it really well.	Radiš to stvarno dobro.
I am working on that.	Radim na tome.
He had no money for it.	Nije imao novca za to.
I haven't done enough	Nisam uradio dovoljno
A friend will never leave	Prijatelj nikada neće otići
I would give my life for you	Dao bih život za tebe
Not from me.	Ne od mene.
He lives for this.	On živi za ovo.
I couldn't do that yet	To još nisam mogao
No, she doesn't see him, and that's good.	Ne, ona ga ne vidi, i to je dobro.
In fact, it is not so.	Zapravo, nije tako.
I already know what she thinks	Već znam šta ona misli
You do this.	Ti uradi ovo.
I was right to do this	Bio sam u pravu što sam ovo uradio
I can't find anything.	Ne mogu naći ništa.
Something was wrong here.	Nešto ovdje nije bilo u redu.
As if that could ever happen.	Kao da bi se to ikada moglo dogoditi.
But we have a problem.	Ali imamo problem.
I don't know who he was	Ne znam ko je on bio
He said it seemed fine.	Rekao je da se čini u redu.
He never knew.	Nikada nije znao.
I'm not afraid.	Ne bojim se.
No one is right.	Niko nije u pravu.
I have it to this day	Imam ga do danas
I realized that myself very quickly.	To sam i sam vrlo brzo shvatio.
None of us could.	Niko od nas nije mogao.
I mean, really bad.	Mislim, stvarno loše.
But how only.	Ali kako samo.
Not that he has much to say.	Nije da ima puno toga za reći.
I would do it tomorrow	Uradio bih to sutra
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno ste u pravu.
I say, never again.	Kažem, nikad više.
I knew that would be what she said	Znao sam da će to biti ono što ona kaže
I don't know why he does that.	Ne znam zašto to radi.
But he did not completely, completely decide.	Ali nije se potpuno, potpuno odlučio.
I also know the time	Znam i vrijeme
It never will be.	Nikada neće biti.
You know he loves me.	Znaš da me voli.
I was really tired	Bio sam zaista umoran
I told him about it today	Rekao sam mu o tome danas
I'm not afraid of you	Ne bojim te se
I can't help myself	Ne mogu si pomoći
I should have seen this.	Trebao sam da vidim ovo.
I'm certainly not alone.	Ja sigurno nisam sama.
But we don't really do that.	Ali mi to zaista ne radimo.
I thought you should be here.	Mislio sam da bi trebao biti ovdje.
I know who they are now	Znam ko su oni sada
And it's fast.	I to je brzo.
He knew.	Znao je.
There was no door.	Nije bilo vrata.
He simply.	On jednostavno.
She just isn't.	Ona jednostavno nije.
And we had it.	I imali smo ga.
I just have to do this	Samo moram ovo da uradim
I really shouldn't have done that	Zaista nisam trebao to da radim
He went to work as usual.	Otišao je na posao kao i obično.
Maybe I knew.	Možda sam znao.
We're better off without him.	Bolje nam je bez njega.
Many years, actually.	Mnogo godina, zapravo.
I have to go home.	Moram do kuće.
My car just started doing this.	Moj auto je upravo počeo ovo da radi.
And they didn't have it.	I nisu ga imali.
He was right.	Bio je u pravu.
I'm glad to see you	Drago mi je da te vidim
And when he comes, he comes.	A kada dođe, dođe.
But there is much more to it than that.	Ali ima mnogo više od toga.
I think we can do it	Mislim da to možemo
You're doing well without me.	Dobro ti ide i bez mene.
Maybe no one will ever.	Možda niko nikada neće.
Or tried.	Ili pokušao.
I didn't have that	Nisam to imao
He is not the only one.	Nije jedini.
They are a very good team.	Oni su veoma dobar tim.
I see it works for you	Vidim da to radi za tebe
But it's okay.	Ali u redu je.
It really is that simple.	To je zaista tako jednostavno.
There is something.	Ima nešto.
But not for me.	Ali za mene ne.
But we need him.	Ali on nam treba.
He doesn't know better.	On ne zna bolje.
There's another one coming.	Ide još jedan.
I can't bring it back	Ne mogu to vratiti
This is not fast.	Ovo nije brzo.
That's not bad	To nije loše
She didn't want to tell the truth.	Nije htela da kaže istinu.
The first never got any further.	Prvi nikad nije stigao dalje.
Now I never would.	Sada nikada ne bi.
I didn't understand what he meant	Nisam shvatio šta je mislio
I couldn't say which ones.	Nisam mogao reći koje.
Many, many years.	Mnogo, mnogo godina.
I won't see them	Neću ih vidjeti
I hope you can help me	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći
I didn't think it worked	Nisam mislio da radi
But it does much more.	Ali radi mnogo više.
It couldn't go on.	Nije moglo dalje.
Or some of it.	Ili nešto od toga.
What is this?.	Šta je ovo?.
No, it's not like that.	Ne, nije tako.
I wasn't sure what to do or say	Nisam bio siguran šta da uradim ili kažem
I think that's how it goes	Mislim da to tako ide
I don't know what this is about.	Ne znam o čemu se radi.
I had no money, no car and no job	Nisam imao novca, auto i posao
I needed that job.	Trebao mi je taj posao.
It was a little too good.	Bilo je malo previše dobro.
That was the thing.	To je bila stvar.
But that's exactly what you need to do.	Ali to je upravo ono što treba da uradite.
It seems a bit to everyone.	Svima se čini pomalo.
yes yes yes yes yes yes.	da da da da da da.
Not one, many.	Ne jedan, mnogo.
He couldn't know anything.	Nije mogao ništa znati.
I shouldn't have known that	Nisam to trebao znati
You know, there are a lot of things.	Znate, ima puno stvari.
I have nothing.	Nemam ništa.
But much more than that.	Ali mnogo više od toga.
It would be hard not to be one.	Bilo bi teško ne biti jedan.
I did my best.	Dao sam sve od sebe.
It won't come to you here.	Neće doći do tebe ovdje.
Bad things can happen.	Loše stvari se mogu dogoditi.
That nothing happened.	Da se ništa nije dogodilo.
I was no longer alone	Nisam više bio sam
We can do better than that.	Možemo i bolje od toga.
I certainly didn't want her to know that	Sigurno nisam želio da ona to zna
And now I'm doing it.	I sada to radim.
I wasn't sure he would	Nisam bio siguran da hoće
I saw the problem	Vidio sam problem
I will know for sure where you are	Ja ću sigurno znati gdje si
I can't go back there.	Ne mogu se vratiti tamo.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
It's so good.	Tako je dobro.
You didn't even come home to tell me.	Nisi ni došao kući da mi kažeš.
That says a lot.	To puno govori.
There was no time.	Nije bilo vremena.
It's me.	To sam ja.
I should have told you right away.	Trebao sam ti odmah reći.
I just work harder.	Samo radim više.
I would love for us to do that.	Voleo bih da to uradimo.
I didn't see what it was	Nisam vidio šta je to
He asked for you.	Pitao je za tobom.
That's what it looks like.	Tako izgleda.
We have to go back.	Moramo se vratiti.
It would be good for both.	Bilo bi dobro za oboje.
I did it	Ja sam to uradio
I hope they didn’t last year.	Nadam se da nisu prošle godine.
I guess your father was right	Pretpostavljam da je tvoj otac bio u pravu
I want to see what it all looks like	Želim vidjeti kako sve to izgleda
I got lost.	Izgubio sam se.
I wondered what year to say	Pitao sam se koje godine da kažem
It was too much.	Bilo je to previše.
I'm going too.	I ja idem.
You did something good for someone.	Učinio si nešto dobro za nekoga.
He works, and how.	On radi, i kako.
I don't want them here.	Ne želim ih ovdje.
He had us there.	Imao nas je tamo.
It must have been earlier.	Mora da je bilo ranije.
Or a problem.	Ili problem.
I hope he comes home soon	Nadam se da će uskoro doći kući
I can be.	Mogu biti.
There is nothing wrong with knowing that.	Nema ništa loše u tome da to znate.
I thought he was there	Mislio sam da je tamo
I thought maybe there were things he needed to say.	Mislio sam da možda ima stvari koje treba da kaže.
I wanted to know what he really meant.	Želeo sam da znam šta on zaista misli.
Something that never happens.	Nešto što se nikada ne dešava.
You certainly want that.	Vi to sigurno želite.
I wish you both well	Želim vam oboje dobro
I haven't tried it yet.	Nisam to još pokušao.
And she knew.	I znala je.
I can probably never give you everything	Vjerovatno ti nikad ne mogu dati sve
I had to do these things myself	Morao sam da uradim ove stvari sam
You have to do this for me.	Moraš ovo uraditi za mene.
All right, all is well.	Dobro, sve je dobro.
I have asked this many times.	Pitao sam to mnogo puta.
I have nothing to say.	Nemam šta da kažem.
And he did it very well	I to je uradio veoma dobro
Or maybe he went back in time before he started.	Ili se možda vratio u vrijeme prije nego što je počeo.
But it looks like we're on it.	Ali izgleda da smo na tome.
I had no idea what to do with him	Nisam imao pojma šta da radim s njim
This is life.	Ovo je život.
In fact, he didn't have to.	Zapravo, nije morao.
I know what he needs	Znam šta mu treba
I gave good money for both	Dao sam dobar novac za oboje
So many things to do.	Toliko stvari koje treba uraditi.
I didn't know how many people	Nisam znao koliko ljudi
I just thought you wanted to know.	Samo sam mislio da bi htela da znaš.
There just isn’t much to it.	Jednostavno nema puno toga.
I guess that's the problem	Pretpostavljam da je to problem
He does it a little.	On to čini malo.
There is much more here.	Ovde ima još mnogo toga.
I still wasn't sure what.	Nisam još bio siguran šta.
But it's not, really.	Ali nije, zaista.
You don't have to tell me anything.	Ne moraš mi ništa reći.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
It doesn't work that way.	To ne radi tako.
He will help you do it.	On će ti pomoći da to uradiš.
There were many days when she was not.	Bilo je mnogo dana kada nije bila.
But maybe that was true.	Ali možda je to bila istina.
I won't let you.	Neću ti dozvoliti.
I wondered what they were	Pitao sam se šta su oni
I heard you say this and that.	Čuo sam da si rekao to i to.
She knows she never will.	Ona zna da nikad neće.
I can come and see	Mogu doći i vidjeti
You would be.	Ti bi bio.
I had no idea what he was talking about	Nisam imao pojma o čemu priča
I thought you understood that	Mislio sam da si to shvatio
I wish someone had told me that here	Voleo bih da mi je to neko rekao ovde
And you loved me.	I volio si me.
He obviously expected this.	Očigledno je ovo očekivao.
That's okay with me.	To je u redu sa mnom.
They were there.	Tu su bili.
But that is not the question.	Ali to nije pitanje.
We don't have to stay here.	Ne moramo ostati ovdje.
I ask her how old she is	Pitam je koliko ima godina
I'm not surprised how good she is.	Nisam iznenađen koliko je dobra.
She's not here.	Ona nije ovde.
I had no idea they were here	Nisam imao pojma da su ovdje
But we didn't.	Ali nismo.
I don't mean any of that.	Ne mislim ništa od toga.
I didn't think she would really leave	Nisam mislio da će ona zaista otići
I didn't need it.	Nije mi trebao.
Which probably no one will buy.	Koje verovatno niko neće kupiti.
I thought you wanted this.	Mislio sam da želiš ovo.
That no one should live like him.	Da niko ne treba da živi kao on.
I have nothing to do with it	Nemam ništa s tim
I do not know exactly.	Ne znam tačno.
He will tell me what to do.	On će mi reći šta da radim.
I didn't know what to say to anyone	Nisam znao šta da kažem nikome
I was really sorry	Zaista mi je bilo žao
If there is.	Ako postoji.
That's probably true.	Vjerovatno je to istina.
Yes, we've all done it.	Da, svi smo to uradili.
That is not the case.	To nije tako.
She has to do it for herself.	Ona to mora učiniti za sebe.
I wasn't sure you wanted me	Nisam bio siguran da me želiš
That's it.	To je to.
Very good question.	Vrlo dobro pitanje.
I just can't take it anymore	Jednostavno ne mogu više
That's it for us.	To je to za nas.
I know what's going on	Znam šta se dešava
Maybe that was true.	Možda je to bila istina.
And, good reason.	I, dobar razlog.
And that's exactly what you don't want to do.	A to je upravo ono što ne želite da radite.
She is wrong.	Ona nije u pravu.
I want to know all of you	Želim da znam sve vas
She eats little.	Ona malo jede.
I don't know what's wrong	Ne znam šta nije u redu
She's small.	Ona je malo.
How far could we go.	Koliko bismo još mogli ići.
I was never sure why	Nikad nisam bio siguran zašto
I have no idea what just happened	Nemam pojma šta se upravo dogodilo
We're not sure what else we can do.	Nismo sigurni šta još možemo da uradimo.
I didn't have to say that	Nisam morao to da kažem
No one said, never.	Niko nije rekao, nikad.
He couldn't believe it, he didn't want to believe it.	Nije mogao vjerovati, nije htio vjerovati.
Simple, and good.	Jednostavno, a dobro.
I shouldn't have been surprised.	Nisam trebao biti iznenađen.
I know you want to help	Znam da želiš pomoći
I wondered when he heard and where he was	Pitao sam se kada je čuo i gdje je bio
This is for sure.	Ovo je sigurno.
He loves us both.	On nas oboje voli.
I love them.	Ja ih volim.
I don't think they are human.	Ne mislim da su ljudi.
I know you do.	Znam da znaš.
Not from you or anyone.	Ne od tebe ili bilo koga.
You don't have to go any further.	Ne morate ići dalje.
I asked him about that too	Pitao sam ga i o tome
Or what he does.	Ili šta radi.
I think that's unlikely	Mislim da je to malo verovatno
And it's good that it's not.	I dobro je što nije.
I loved everything that made him.	Voleo sam sve što ga je činilo.
I didn't have to go home	Nisam morao da idem kući
I arrived by this afternoon.	Stigao sam do danas popodne.
I love it.	Volim to.
I have to say something	Moram nešto reći
I know my way	Znam svoj put
But he heard none of it.	Ali nije čuo ništa od toga.
I couldn’t believe he really wanted me	Nisam mogao vjerovati da me zaista želi
I know he wants you too	Znam da i on tebe želi
he wondered.	pitao se on.
Maybe a lot.	Možda jako puno.
I didn't mean it.	Nisam mislio.
That was good enough.	To je bilo dovoljno dobro.
I hope he comes.	Nadam se da će doći.
And it is.	I jeste.
I was glad to be there	Bilo mi je drago biti tamo
Everything will be fine	Sve će biti u redu
But they are right.	Ali oni su u pravu.
Right there.	Tačno tamo.
He seemed to know what to do.	Činilo se da zna šta da radi.
Is this true?	Da li je ovo tačno.
Or it used to be.	Ili je to nekada bilo.
I love everything.	Volim sve.
I can't bring it back	Ne mogu to vratiti
Together with.	Zajedno sa.
she said.	ona je rekla.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
I'm leaving now	Sada ću otići
Question a few years	Pitanje nekoliko godina
I was very happy too	I ja sam bio veoma sretan
But something more will happen.	Ali nešto više će se dogoditi.
He told me the truth.	Rekao mi je istinu.
Obviously, that is not true.	Očigledno, to nije istina.
And maybe it will help you.	I možda ti pomogne.
We can beat them.	Možemo ih pobijediti.
I never thought this day would come	Nikad nisam mislio da će doći ovaj dan
Who wants, wants.	Ko hoće, hoće.
Nobody has seen that yet.	To još niko nije video.
They were.	Oni su bili .
There is more.	Ima još.
That’s the way it’s done.	To je način na koji se to radi.
Happy to do that.	Sretan što to radim.
And we did it.	I uradili smo to.
I want to be a guy	Želim da budem momak
Do what you promised.	Uradi ono što si obećao.
I've never been right before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio u pravu.
I totally see you working there	Potpuno te vidim kako tamo radiš
I'm ready.	Spreman sam.
You know it's true.	Znaš da je istina.
That needs to be discussed.	O tome se mora razgovarati.
I should never have done that	Nikad to nisam trebao učiniti
And he feels good about us.	I on se dobro osjeća prema nama.
I had to know for sure	Morao sam da znam sigurno
you think.	ti misliš.
No, that's right.	Ne, tako je.
I heard you, you know.	Čuo sam te, znaš.
There is only one reason to live.	Postoji samo jedan razlog za život.
I really don't know why.	Zaista ne znam zašto.
Who knows if something will happen.	Ko zna hoće li se nešto dogoditi.
You're probably glad about that.	Verovatno ti je drago zbog toga.
I got this.	Dobio sam ovo.
And that was it.	I to je bilo to.
I couldn't do without it	Ne bih mogao bez toga
I think we could do more and better.	Mislim da bismo mogli više i bolje.
Someone had to.	Neko je morao.
You don't know anything.	Ne znaš ni o čemu.
I think they are both right	Mislim da su oboje u pravu
I never knew enough.	Nikad nisam znao dovoljno.
And that's a problem for me.	I to je za mene problem.
That would not happen now.	To se sada ne bi dogodilo.
That's for sure.	To je sigurno.
But she won't.	Ali ona neće.
I think he will.	Mislim da hoće.
But it won't.	Ali neće.
I wasn't ready to do that	Nisam bio spreman da to uradim
But he went beyond that.	Ali on je otišao dalje od toga.
I knew they knew	Znao sam da oni znaju
I don't think anyone knew what was going to happen.	Mislim da niko nije znao šta će se dogoditi.
Those who did bad things are still there.	Oni koji su uradili loše stvari su još uvek tu.
I knew it was wrong	Znao sam da to nije u redu
I'll buy them.	Ja ću ih kupiti.
You are it.	Ti si to.
I want to be like you	Želim da budem kao ti
But it's not about us.	Ali ne radi se o nama.
That's exactly what I realized earlier	Upravo sam to ranije shvatio
You heard her.	Čuo si je.
And they were right	I bili su u pravu
And people know me by that.	I ljudi me znaju po tome.
You could have been mine.	Mogao si biti moj.
There must be something wrong with me.	Mora da nešto nije u redu sa mnom.
I knew what he was going to say	Znao sam šta će reći
Ready for this.	Spreman za ovo.
A lot more.	Mnogo više.
But nothing is going my way.	Ali ništa mi ne ide.
I think that's all we can do for now	Mislim da je to sve što možemo učiniti za sada
No one saw them again.	Niko ih više nije video.
But it doesn't work.	Ali to ne radi.
I didn't think this was going to happen	Nisam mislio da će se ovo dogoditi
I think we can beat this.	Mislim da ovo možemo pobijediti.
I asked you what you wanted	Pitao sam te šta želiš
You weren't happy.	Nisi bio sretan.
Not now, but it was at the time.	Nije sada, ali u to vrijeme je bilo.
I was just wondering.	Samo sam se pitao.
You know it can be done.	Znaš da se to može uraditi.
I love working on it	Volim raditi na tome
She loves money.	Ona voli novac.
I think he'll see the reason	Mislim da će vidjeti razlog
And he would try to do a lot on his own.	I pokušao bi mnogo toga da uradi sam.
I wish it wasn't so, but it is	Voleo bih da nije tako, ali jeste
He's wrong.	On nije u pravu.
So much for being alone.	Toliko o tome da si sam.
We did the right thing	Uradili smo pravu stvar
And you are me.	A ti si ja.
So it was with us.	Tako je bilo i sa nama.
I have known about him for many years	Znam za njega mnogo godina
But it can be more than that.	Ali može biti i više od toga.
Just what we need.	Baš ono što nam treba.
Now it can be pretty fast.	Sada može biti prilično brzo.
I couldn't do that	Nisam mogao to da uradim
I will not be back during that time	Neću se vratiti za to vrijeme
I wish he was still with me now	Voleo bih da je sada još uvek sa mnom
Now he understood what he meant.	Sada je shvatio šta je mislio.
But a lot.	Ali mnogo.
Maybe it's not just money.	Možda nije samo novac.
But it's really pretty.	Ali zaista je prilično.
Nobody came.	Niko nije došao.
I really think we should talk.	Zaista mislim da bi trebali razgovarati.
I don't know now.	Ne znam sada.
Which we have now.	Što sada imamo.
I could tell he wasn't done	Mogao sam reći da nije završio
Everything is just nothing.	Sve je samo ništa.
He's not really there.	On zapravo nije tamo.
I went to the door and no one was there	Otišao sam do vrata i nikoga nije bilo
But that's actually the only reason.	Ali to je zapravo jedini razlog.
This reason, and that.	Ovaj razlog, i to.
I think that's it	Mislim da je to ono
I still couldn't tell.	Još uvijek nisam mogao reći.
Nobody got it.	Niko ga nije dobio.
It wouldn't take long.	Ne bi trebalo dugo.
He will stay there.	Tamo će i ostati.
I really don't know what.	Zaista ne znam šta.
It was something no one had seen before.	Bilo je to nešto što niko ranije nije video.
I didn't hear anything from him	Nisam ništa čuo od njega
Everything we have.	Sve što imamo.
They are not at all.	Oni to uopšte nisu.
More than ever before.	Više nego ikada prije.
I knew right away that it was wrong	Odmah sam znao da nije u redu
I couldn't go on	Nisam mogao dalje
I'm going to the door	Idem do vrata
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
But only just.	Ali samo samo.
I was home alone	Bio sam kod kuće sam i sam
I didn't want him to see that.	Nisam želeo da to vidi.
I knew we could do it.	Znao sam da to možemo.
I don't think he's safe either	Mislim da ni on nije siguran
Tell him anything.	Reci mu bilo šta.
It's happening here.	To se dešava ovde.
I was just thinking about it	Samo sam na to mislio
He says he's not sure.	Kaže da nije siguran.
I have something for you.	Imam nešto za tebe.
I'm the one who should be.	Ja sam taj koji bi trebao.
She told me she really loves my job.	Rekla mi je da zaista voli moj posao.
I just couldn't tell you before	Jednostavno ti nisam mogao reći prije
I didn't think so.	Nisam mislio tako.
I know it's not easy being here	Znam da nije lako biti ovde
People are not.	Ljudi nisu.
I won't help here	Neću pomoći ovdje
I was there, you know	Bio sam tamo, znaš
And they did this.	I ovo su uradili.
I wanted to do it really	Htio sam to učiniti stvarno
I can't be sure.	Ne mogu biti sigurni.
I never could do that	Nikada to nisam mogao
No idea when he'll be back.	Nema pojma kada će se vratiti.
I think she's probably not the only one.	Mislim da verovatno nije jedina.
I'm telling you if you don't know that either.	Kažem ti ako ni to ne znaš.
I think he'll leave	Mislim da će otići
Except that wasn't true.	Osim što to nije bila istina.
The man didn't seem surprised to see them.	Čovjek nije izgledao iznenađen što ih je vidio.
Work.	Posao.
I think that might help	Mislim da bi to moglo pomoći
I was sure it hadn't been before	Bio sam siguran da to prije nije bilo
I didn't think it was a good idea	Nisam mislio da je to dobra ideja
This is them.	Ovo su oni.
I started to like it very much	Počeo sam da mi se jako sviđa
She was really good.	Bila je stvarno dobra.
It was still difficult.	I dalje je bilo teško.
But he will, he will.	Ali hoće, hoće.
Or it was.	Ili to bilo.
I'm not the man for the job	Ja nisam čovjek za taj posao
I had to think of him	Morao sam da mislim na njega
And he was good at it.	I on je bio dobar u tome.
A friend is even there.	Prijatelj je čak tu.
It was good right away.	Odmah je bilo dobro.
You can't say that.	Ne možete to reći.
It doesn't look like much.	Ne izgleda mnogo.
It was good for business.	Bilo je dobro za posao.
I didn't know about him	Nisam znao za njega
That's not really a problem.	To zapravo nije problem.
You said they were there, but people couldn't see them.	Rekli ste da su bili tamo, ali ljudi ih nisu mogli vidjeti.
He didn't expect to see me here.	Nije očekivao da će me vidjeti ovdje.
They seemed to be right.	Čini se da su bili u pravu.
I will do it.	Ja ću to uraditi.
There were them.	Bilo ih je.
I never knew there were so many	Nikada nisam znao da ih ima toliko
Maybe I won't beat you at home	Možda te neću pobijediti kući
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
I will.	Ja ću tako.
Thing.	Stvar.
It works fine.	To radi u redu.
He doesn't want to.	On ne želi.
I didn't mean any of that	Nisam mislio ništa od toga
That's what he really loves.	To je ono što on zaista voli.
I don't know if he saw it.	Ne znam da li je video.
I think about it a lot myself.	I sama mnogo o tome mislim.
I should.	Trebao bih.
Like you said.	Kao što si rekao.
I want you to know that something is wrong here	Želim da znaš da ovdje nešto nije u redu
I knew who could and who couldn't	Znao sam ko može, a ko ne
The story is here.	Priča je tu.
I didn't say anything	Nisam ništa rekao
And he's probably right.	I vjerovatno je u pravu.
But no one asked her.	Ali niko je nije pitao.
She is waiting for me.	Ona me čeka.
More than you will ever know.	Više nego što ćete ikada znati.
I tried several times	Pokušao sam nekoliko puta
I do not love you.	Ne volim te.
I have no idea what my problem is	Nemam pojma u čemu je moj problem
Nothing seemed to work	Činilo se da ništa ne radi
For now, that was more than enough.	Za sada je to bilo više nego dovoljno.
But it hasn't happened yet.	Ali to još nije bilo.
I just didn't see how	Samo nisam vidio kako
We didn't need the money.	Nije nam trebao novac.
But not all.	Ali ne svi.
I had no idea this had happened	Nisam imao pojma da se ovo dogodilo
I just know how to be her	Ja samo znam kako da budem ona
You have to say it's okay.	Morate reći da je u redu.
I lost her.	Izgubio sam je.
He couldn't say he knew.	Nije mogao reći da je znao.
You know you would.	Znaš da bi.
I certainly didn't expect that	Nisam to sigurno očekivao
I wonder how they will know.	Pitam se kako će znati.
Until you couldn't come back.	Dok se nisi mogao vratiti.
But that was not the way to do it.	Ali to nije bio način da se to uradi.
Yes and no.	Da i ne.
I didn't really know her either	Nisam ni ja znao zaista
Not like us.	Ne kao mi.
I decided not to say anything	Odlučio sam da ne kažem ništa
It's not.	Nije.
When, why and how to do it.	Kada, zašto i kako to učiniti.
He was a man of almost thirty years.	Bio je to čovjek od skoro trideset godina.
Or a bad job.	Ili loš posao.
I wonder how he feels now	Pitam se kako se sada osjeća
I haven't actually done anything yet	Ja zapravo još nisam ništa radio
I just wanted to know	Samo sam htela da znam
I know you're doing your job.	Znam da radiš svoj posao.
I wonder if there is	Pitam se da li ima
I was ready for this.	Bio sam spreman za ovo.
I'm surprised by you	Iznenađen sam tobom
He is happy now.	Sada je sretan.
I thought he did it himself	Mislio sam da je to sam uradio
I should have said something	Trebao sam nešto reći
I think he is a good person	Mislim da je dobra osoba
It's not him.	Nije on.
I'm so scared.	Tako se bojim.
Something in itself.	Nešto samo po sebi.
I did what you asked	Uradio sam šta si tražio
I'm not sure what to do	Nisam siguran šta da radim
That was not the reason.	To nije bio razlog.
I didn't expect to see him until tonight	Nisam očekivao da ću ga vidjeti do večeras
This is still happening.	Ovo se još uvijek dešava.
I didn't do anything to you.	Nisam ti ništa uradio.
I was surprised I didn't see you there	Bio sam iznenađen što te nisam vidio tamo
I told you everything could be bought	Rekao sam ti da se sve može kupiti
Really work hard for nothing.	Zaista mnogo raditi ni za šta.
I knew what the car could do.	Znao sam šta auto može.
I had no idea where he was	Nisam imao pojma gdje je
I never would.	Ne bih nikad.
I know what he wants to do	Znam šta želi da radi
I wanted everyone to know it was mine	Želeo sam da svi znaju da je moja
I know you meant me	Znam da si mislio na mene
One and a half times, actually.	Jedan i po put, zapravo.
I hope to go there again	Nadam se da ću ići tamo ponovo
But.	Ali.
Much more than you know.	Mnogo više nego što znaš.
I was glad to see that he felt better	Bilo mi je drago vidjeti da se osjeća bolje
I have money.	Imam novac.
Nobody did anything.	Niko ništa nije uradio.
I was almost there alone	Bio sam skoro sam tamo
That's exactly what I wanted to say.	Upravo sam to i sam htio reći.
I did not know what to say	Nisam znao šta da kažem
He's gone now.	Sada ga nema.
It's only been a while.	To je samo neko vrijeme.
I actually wanted to go	Zapravo sam htela da idem
I couldn't believe it when he told me	Nisam mogao vjerovati kad mi je rekao
I have to work on it	Moram da radim na tome
I wish that were true	Voleo bih da je to istina
Finished like you.	Završio kao ti.
I need to see you now	Moram da te vidim odmah
I knew you would help me	Znao sam da ćeš mi pomoći
None of us know.	Niko od nas ne zna.
But it has to be.	Ali tako mora biti.
No one will come.	Niko neće doći.
I was right	Bio sam u pravu
I can't believe this happened	Ne mogu vjerovati da se ovo dogodilo
I don't think you can.	Mislim da ne možeš.
I bought this for you	Kupio sam ovo za tebe
No one will know.	Niko neće znati.
I didn't know that at the time	Nisam to znao u to vrijeme
Something happened last year.	Prošle godine se nešto dogodilo.
I thought I should.	Mislio sam da treba.
She knew about the time.	Znala je za vrijeme.
I thought it was my idea	Mislio sam da je to moja ideja
Everyone really likes it.	Svima se zaista sviđa.
I like my life.	Sviđa mi se moj život.
I love him, much more	Volim ga, mnogo više
Not now.	Ne sada.
They must be them.	Mora da su oni.
He's not right yet.	Nije još u pravu.
It's like we're doing it now.	Kao da to radimo sada.
This is my life now.	Ovo je sada moj život.
It's just hard for us.	Samo nam je teško.
She was very good.	Bila je veoma dobra.
she said.	ona je rekla.
Or they were at his place.	Ili su bili kod njega.
It looks so simple.	Izgleda tako jednostavno.
We have to go.	Moramo otići.
I mean, he's just gone.	Mislim, jednostavno ga nema.
There are too many of us.	Ima nas previše.
They didn't know.	Nisu znali.
I wish he could help you	Voleo bih da će ti pomoći
But to say it wasn't a problem, oh no.	Ali reći da to nije bio problem, o ne.
He doesn't say anything.	Ništa ne govori.
I'm very sorry.	Jako mi je žao.
I think that could be too much	Mislim da bi to moglo biti previše
You have to see how he tries to do something.	Mora se vidjeti kako pokušava nešto učiniti.
I wasn’t the person he wanted to see.	Nisam bila osoba koju je želio vidjeti.
I hope they are really good	Nadam se da su zaista dobro
That never happens again.	To se više nikada ne dešava.
I have no idea who they might be	Nemam pojma ko bi oni mogli biti
They never knew about you.	Nikada nisu znali za tebe.
I guess there will be more	Pretpostavljam da će biti još toga
Even a few days ago.	Čak i prije nekoliko dana.
I didn't know you looked like that	Nisam znao da tako izgledaš
I'm so sorry for him.	Jako mi ga je žao.
It was also fast.	Bilo je i brzo.
You think you're doing well.	Misliš da radiš dobro.
And you did.	I jesi.
There was still too much to do.	Bilo je još previše toga što je trebalo uraditi.
I wonder why that is so.	Pitam se zašto je to tako.
But something is going right.	Ali nešto ide kako treba.
I do not think so.	Ja ne mislim tako.
Maybe he was okay.	Možda je bio u redu.
But we just don't know.	Ali jednostavno ne znamo.
She's fine.	Ona je dobro.
I have nothing to say	nemam ništa za reći
We don't know how he works, what he can do.	Ne znamo kako on radi, šta može.
And you don't know.	A ti ne znaš.
I know that for sure	Znam to sigurno
And not much.	I ne mnogo.
I should get it.	Trebao bih ga dobiti.
I didn't know he had it in him	Nisam znao da ima to u sebi
I could work with that.	Mogao bih raditi s tim.
I told you.	Rekao sam ti.
I can believe everything you said	Mogu vjerovati u sve što si rekao
I hope some of us can	Nadam se da neko od nas može
They're all there.	Svi su tamo.
He said not much.	Rekao je ne puno toga.
It's just not good enough.	Jednostavno nije dovoljno dobro.
I can't go home	Ne mogu se vratiti kući
He doesn't think so.	On to ne misli.
I worked with him for three years.	Radio sam sa njim tri godine.
You know you are.	Znaš da jesi.
But it happens that way.	Ali to se dešava tako.
I am the truth.	Ja sam istina.
This is good.	Ovo je dobro.
What is this.	Šta je ovo.
But you could too.	Ali mogao bi i ti.
I didn't know what to do this morning	Nisam znao šta da radim jutros
I had to believe he was right.	Morao sam vjerovati da je u pravu.
I want to see her tomorrow	Želim da je vidim sutra
I wish it could be me, but	Voleo bih da to mogu biti ja, ali
Which was true.	Što je bila istina.
And now it is.	A sada jeste.
And it wasn't right.	I nije bilo u redu.
None of that.	Ništa od toga.
But there is a reason for that.	Ali postoji razlog za to.
But I wouldn't.	Ali ne bi.
I have a lot of friends there.	Imam puno prijatelja tamo.
The radio didn't tell me much either.	Ni radio mi nije rekao mnogo.
I did not know that.	Nisam to znao.
I need you to know that	Moram da to znaš
I just need more time, a little more time	Samo mi treba više vremena, još malo vremena
But it was not enough.	Ali nije bilo dovoljno.
All the way to you.	Sve do vas.
He gave it back to me.	Vratio mi ga je.
This will not be easy.	Ovo neće biti lako.
I'm so glad you're back	Tako mi je drago što si se vratio
I just can't bring it back	Jednostavno ga ne mogu vratiti
It could have been.	Moglo je biti.
She will find her way.	Ona će naći svoj put.
I didn't do that.	Nisam uradio tako.
I am here to tell you that it is so	Ovdje sam da vam kažem da je tako
You have to talk to him.	Moraš razgovarati s njim.
I'm not done with that yet	Nisam još završio s tim
I know he will come	Znam da će doći
Is she.	Da li je ona.
He was tired at the moment.	Trenutno je bio umoran.
I have this job for you.	Imam ti ovaj posao.
He shouldn't do that.	Ne bi trebao to da radi.
There was no one there.	Tamo nije bilo nikoga.
Do so.	Uraditi tako.
Something more than me.	Nešto više od mene.
I will now.	Sada ću.
Like everyone.	Kao i svi.
Just like now.	Kao i sada.
This time.	Ovaj put.
But never anything they will see.	Ali nikad ništa što će vidjeti.
I can't do this for you	Ne mogu to uraditi za tebe
I did not seek this life	Nisam tražio ovaj život
I'm here for you when I'm ready.	Tu sam za tebe kad budem spreman.
I just want to be your friend	Ja samo želim da ti budem prijatelj
I want them there too	I ja ih želim tamo
It couldn't be, but it was.	Nije moglo biti, ali jeste.
I'm not sure	Nisam baš siguran
Nothing more needs to be said.	Ne treba više ništa reći.
He still could.	I dalje je mogao.
This is really good.	Ovo je stvarno dobro.
This will never be enough.	Ovo nikada neće biti dovoljno.
I didn't tell anyone this	Nisam ovo nikome rekao
And he left.	I otišao je.
And so it is.	I tako je.
He would do everything right.	Uradio bi sve u redu.
He needs to do it.	On treba da to uradim.
She doesn't love me either.	Ni ona me ne voli.
How could that be.	Kako bi to moglo biti.
I want him to come home.	Želim da dođe kući.
I didn't expect her to leave before me	Nisam očekivao da će ona otići prije mene
I know what he meant	Znam šta je mislio
I didn't want to see you here	Nisam htela da te vidim ovde
I thought it was.	Mislio sam da jeste.
In one day, that will not be obvious.	Za jedan dan, to neće biti očigledno.
I hope someone can help.	Nadam se da će neko moći pomoći.
I couldn't do it alone	Ne bih to mogao sam
And she has her money, you know.	I ona ima svoj novac, znate.
I see this is hard for you	Vidim da ti je ovo teško
I didn't want to know what was going on	Nisam htela da znam šta se dešava
I can do this for you	Mogu ovo uraditi za tebe
I didn't do that either	Ni ja to nisam uradio
He never saw it.	Nikad nije vidio.
I have a question for you.	Imam pitanje za tebe.
We can work on several things.	Možemo raditi na nekoliko stvari.
I don't think that's likely.	Mislim da to nije vjerovatno.
It's nothing.	Nije ništa.
For a long time no one could speak.	Dugo niko nije mogao da govori.
I wonder what that will be	Pitam se šta će to biti
I want more.	Želim još.
There is nothing there.	Ništa tamo nema.
But it's not exactly this.	Ali nije baš ovo.
You may already know about it.	Možda već znate za to.
I was so sure.	Bio sam tako siguran.
I didn't even finish the day.	Nisam ni završio dan.
Will everything work well.	Hoće li sve raditi dobro.
You won't even be a story.	Nećeš ni biti priča.
I can trust you	Mogu vjerovati u tebe
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
I guess you would.	Pretpostavljam da bi.
But it usually works.	Ali obično radi.
It wasn't a job, really.	To nije bio posao, zaista.
Now I see further	Sada vidim dalje
I didn't want to know anymore	Nisam htela više da znam
Nothing happens without it.	Ništa se ne dešava bez toga.
This just didn't happen here.	Ovo se jednostavno nije dogodilo ovdje.
Maybe, maybe not.	Možda, možda i ne.
I decided to go for it	Odlučio sam da idem na to
But that's how it happened.	Ali tako se to dogodilo.
I had no idea where he was	Nisam imao pojma gdje je
If you want me.	Ako me želiš.
I know what you can do	Znam šta možeš da uradiš
But it shouldn't have been.	Ali to nije trebalo biti.
And this morning.	I jutros.
He tells everyone he's fine.	Svima govori da je dobro.
I can't believe all this	Ne mogu vjerovati u sve ovo
He said no.	Rekao je da nije.
I knew who you were, you know	Znao sam ko si, znaš
I know you all.	Znam vas sve.
You're like me.	Ti si kao ja.
Or, in fact, he was not.	Ili, zapravo, nije bio.
I was just trying to do a good job	Samo sam pokušao da uradim dobar posao
I would go home.	Otišao bih kući.
As far as I know, no one has done that before.	Koliko ja znam, to niko ranije nije radio.
I know exactly what she thinks	Znam tačno šta ona misli
Maybe they both had.	Možda su oboje imali.
I told you that afternoon	Rekao sam ti to popodne
I love you!.	Volim vas!.
No problem here.	Ovde nema problema.
You know that yourself.	Znaš to i sam.
I should have talked to you	Trebao sam razgovarati s tobom
I just asked you that	Upravo sam te to pitao
I guess not very much	Pretpostavljam ne baš puno
But not any job.	Ali ne bilo koji posao.
Or is it all.	Ili je sve.
I'm not sure.	Nisam siguran.
That's where the work happens.	Tu se dešava posao.
Lots of money.	Mnogo novca.
I think it is now.	Mislim da je to sada.
And he's there.	I on je tamo.
Like really, now.	Kao stvarno, sada.
I was confident	Bio sam siguran u sebe
I know what he did to you	Znam šta ti je uradio
You can't say anything.	Ne možete ništa reći.
That would be too much.	To bi bilo previše.
That's my business.	To je moja stvar.
I hope all is well for you	Nadam se da je sve dobro za tebe
Tom would never be sure.	Tom nikada ne bi bio siguran.
He needed that car.	Trebao mu je taj auto.
This was not life.	Ovo nije bio život.
There's no one but us, it's okay.	Nema nikoga osim nas, u redu je.
I saw her this morning	Video sam je jutros
We never told him.	Nikada mu nismo rekli.
There should be something more we can do.	Trebalo bi da postoji nešto više što možemo učiniti.
I have someone right now.	Imam nekoga odmah.
he asked.	pitao.
I'm a little better.	Ja sam malo bolji.
Now I really need to know everything	Sada zaista moram sve da znam
I'm really sorry about that	Zaista mi je žao zbog toga
So we have a few.	Tako da imamo nekoliko.
And they were.	I oni su bili.
There were several problems.	Bilo je nekoliko problema.
I know someone who is	Znam nekoga ko jeste
You should see him.	Trebao bi ga vidjeti.
I have a reason for that	Imam razlog za to
She's with me now.	Sada je sa mnom.
I think he was expecting you	Mislim da te je očekivao
I guess he's still there	Pretpostavljam da je još tamo
I could never get any of that	Nikada ne bih mogao dobiti ništa od toga
I want to be home.	Želim biti kod kuće.
He does what he is told.	On radi šta mu se kaže.
I mean, like it never happened	Mislim, kao da se to nikada nije dogodilo
But I didn't do anything	Ali nisam ništa uradio
They might still be there.	Možda su još tamo.
You are nothing to me.	Ti si mi ništa.
Nobody knows who it is.	Niko ne zna ko je to.
That it is for me to have some of that.	Da je za mene da imam nešto od toga.
I didn't expect that at all	Nisam to uopšte očekivao
He can't do without me.	Ne može bez mene.
That's much better.	To je mnogo bolje.
I will not do that	Neću to učiniti
I wish he was here with me now	Voleo bih da je sada ovde sa mnom
I knew right away.	Odmah sam znao.
Neither for me nor for you.	Ni za mene ni za tebe.
I want to do this right	Želim ovo da uradim kako treba
You never were.	Nikada nisi bio.
Or for me.	Ili za mene.
I really wasn't surprised at all	Zaista uopšte nisam bio iznenađen
It was hard, very hard.	To je bilo teško, veoma teško.
I can't even find him.	Ne mogu ga ni naći.
And the truth is that it is.	A istina je da jeste.
And they didn't do it.	I nisu to uradili.
I think you could do that	Mislim da bi ti to mogao
He could do it.	On je to mogao.
I shouldn't trust him	Ne bih mu trebao vjerovati
They were together again.	Ponovo su bili zajedno.
I think that might have been a good idea.	Mislim da je to možda bila dobra ideja.
But nothing could be done.	Ali ništa se nije moglo učiniti.
And there are more and more of us.	A nas je sve više.
I was right, you know	Bio sam u pravu, znaš
I have to go to work	Moram na posao
But he never did more than he had to.	Ali nikada nije radio više nego što je morao.
I'm so glad to be here	Tako mi je drago što sam ovdje
You've never seen anything.	Nikad ništa nisi video.
I'm here.	Ovde sam.
No, not at all.	Ne, baš niko.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to uraditi.
I didn't even know you were here	Nisam ni znao da si ovde
Tell me how you are.	Reci mi kako si.
I must have done something good	Mora da sam uradio nešto dobro
This is not happening.	Ovo se ne dešava.
But this is it.	Ali ovo je.
He wasn't ready for that.	Nije bio spreman za to.
I just didn't want him	Samo ga nisam htela
Everyone knows that much.	Toliko svi znaju.
He'll be gone tomorrow.	Otići će sutra.
I know that's not right	Znam da to nije u redu
I have something to do	Imam nešto da radim
No, it's not good enough.	Ne, nije dovoljno dobro.
He was very surprised.	Bio je veoma iznenađen.
This one is much better.	Ovaj je mnogo bolji.
I really know that	Zaista to znam
He is all that.	On je sve to.
I won't say anything.	Neću ništa reći.
You saw me do it.	Video si me kako to radim.
Next to him.	Do njega.
I know not everyone will be true.	Znam da istina neće svi.
I just thought I'd ask	Samo sam mislio da pitam
Better there than here.	Bolje tamo nego ovdje.
That's all there could be.	To je sve što je moglo biti.
I may never find him	Možda ga nikada neću naći
But, for a while, it is.	Ali, za malo, jeste.
I guess, you know, he should be there	Pretpostavljam, znate, on bi trebao biti tamo
But that was fine.	Ali to je bilo u redu.
I have to do the right thing for him	Moram da uradim pravu stvar za njega
That doesn’t really make me any better.	To me zapravo ne čini bolje.
But she herself was not well.	Ali ni ona sama nije bila dobro.
I might as well have nothing on me	Mogao bih i da nemam ništa na sebi
If only I could do everything.	Samo da mogu sve.
He doesn't.	On to ne čini.
I was alone that time	Bio sam sam taj put
I think that's all you need to do	Mislim da je to sve što treba da uradiš
I need it soon	Treba mi to uskoro
I couldn't do it without you	Ne bih to mogao bez tebe
He had nothing to do with it.	On nije imao ništa s tim.
But it didn't seem to be.	Ali činilo se da nije.
We didn't know much about what happened.	Nismo znali mnogo o tome šta se dogodilo.
It was really hard	Bilo je zaista teško
We would be fine without him.	Bili bismo dobro bez njega.
I think it looks better that way	Mislim da tako izgleda bolje
I can't do it alone.	Ne mogu to sama.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
It is, .	To je, .
I need you to do something	Treba mi nešto da uradiš
I had no problem with that	Nisam imao problema sa tim
It just isn't.	Jednostavno nije.
That's right.	Tako je.
This is quite difficult.	Ovo je prilično teško.
I didn't know it was him	Nisam znao da je to on
I want it and I like it.	Želim to i sviđa mi se.
He doesn't know either.	Ne zna ni on.
Life before now.	Život prije sada.
I'm not there right now.	Trenutno nisam tamo.
Which he had.	Koje je imao.
But he did better than that.	Ali uradio je bolje od toga.
But the good thing is we've all been there.	Ali dobra stvar je što smo svi bili tamo.
We both needed to know that.	To smo oboje trebali znati.
She loves you.	Ona voli tebe.
It's time for a meeting.	Vrijeme je za sastanak.
I want to make sure they are fine	Želim biti siguran da su dobro
Maybe I'm my own.	Možda sam svoj.
I wondered when he heard and where he was.	Pitao sam se kada je čuo i gdje je bio.
I guess so.	Pretpostavljam da jeste.
I heard you for the first time	Čuo sam te prvi put
I told you about this	Rekao sam ti za ovo
This is more than enough.	Ovo je više nego dovoljno.
And nothing works.	I ništa ne radi.
Nobody said it would be easy.	Niko nije rekao da će biti lako.
I work much better this way	Na ovaj način radim mnogo bolje
There was really nothing anyone could do for him.	Zaista niko ništa nije mogao učiniti za njega.
But he can't get it.	Ali on to ne može dobiti.
I see it in so many people	Vidim ga u toliko ljudi
There was no one there.	Tamo nije bilo nikoga.
You really should.	Stvarno bi trebao.
It exists and it is difficult.	Postoji i teško je.
There is something in that.	Ima nešto u tome.
I didn't expect this at all	Uopšte nisam očekivao ovo
You can’t just see things.	Ne možete jednostavno vidjeti stvari.
I had to find a new job	Morao sam naći novi posao
I'm not saying that's okay.	Ne kažem da je to u redu.
I've had enough	Dosta mi je bilo
Or something will be wrong.	Ili će nešto biti u redu.
There was no need to stay.	Nije trebalo ostati.
I think I have it.	Mislim da ga imam.
This is not my father.	Ovo nije moj otac.
Your problem.	Tvoj problem.
I couldn't let him do that	Nisam mu mogao dozvoliti da to uradi
It's a much better job.	To je mnogo bolji posao.
It's not that simple.	Nije tako jednostavno.
You know you would.	Znaš da bi.
That's her.	To je ona.
I should have told you everything	Trebao sam ti sve reći
I had to ask.	Morao sam da pitam.
I actually came to ask you both	Zapravo sam došao da vas oboje pitam
I couldn't believe what had happened	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta se dogodilo
I need to know that he really always loved me	Moram da znam da me je zaista uvek voleo
I do not know what.	Ne znam šta.
I did it for you	Uradio sam to za tebe
But they haven't yet.	Ali još nisu.
I should have said a lot of things	Trebao sam reći puno stvari
He can't do both.	Ne može oboje.
I knew it would be from you	Znao sam da će to biti od tebe
I didn't mean to say that	Nisam to htio reći
I told you he would.	Rekao sam ti da hoće.
There was certainly nothing wrong with that.	Sigurno nije bilo ništa loše u tome.
I knew you'd say that	Znao sam da ćeš to reći
He had it all to himself.	Imao ga je samo za sebe.
Just not so little.	Samo ne tako malo.
It's really that simple.	Zaista je tako jednostavno.
It's not a problem anymore.	Više nije problem.
It was hard to see.	Bilo je teško vidjeti.
You can usually tell.	Obično možete reći.
I think he loves me too much	Mislim da me previše voli
I have no doubt about it.	Ne sumnjam u to.
I wasn't sure what to do with it	Nisam bio siguran šta da radim s tim
Maybe that was a good thing.	Možda je to bila dobra stvar.
I meant well.	Mislio sam dobro.
In fact, it is not.	Zapravo, nije.
I didn't even want to go	Nisam ni htela da idem
He asked.	Pitao.
I should work harder	Trebalo bi da radim više
Always so good.	Uvek tako dobro.
Maybe I'll see him in a few days.	Možda ću ga vidjeti za nekoliko dana.
There was more.	Bilo je više.
I want to see it again	Želim to ponovo vidjeti
I saw.	Vidio sam.
Not today.	Danas nisu.
But there was more to it than that.	Ali bilo je više od toga.
They did it three times.	To su uradili tri puta.
I will never have to see him again	Nikad ga više neću morati vidjeti
Just like that here.	Samo tako ovdje.
I just needed to be there	Samo sam trebao biti tamo
They were there.	Tu su bili.
I won't say anything	Neću ništa reći
Maybe she was too.	Možda je i ona bila.
I wondered what that meeting might be about	Pitao sam se o čemu bi taj sastanak mogao biti
So are we, she says.	I mi smo, kaže ona.
But they were not alone.	Ali nisu bili sami.
This is as good as it can get.	Ovo je dobro koliko može.
Much more than you.	Mnogo više od tebe.
That would be enough.	To bi bilo dovoljno.

He knew what he was planning.	Znao je šta planira.
She can't leave.	Ona ne može otići.
I know he's better	Znam da mu je bolje

There were plenty of them this year.	Dosta ih je bilo ove godine.
He will stay with us.	On će ostati sa nama.
He was the first.	Bio je to prvi.
I saw it and I didn't	Video sam i nisam
But this year we have more power.	Ali ove godine imamo više moći.
I asked him why he was there	Pitao sam ga zašto je tamo
I just got a job there	Upravo sam tamo dobio posao

We were them.	Mi smo bili oni.
Nice to see you again.	Drago mi je da te ponovo vidim.

Not now, not here.	Ne sada, ne ovde.
My first friend.	Moj prvi prijatelj.
I was sorry to see that	Bilo mi je žao što sam to vidio
I shouldn't have told anyone.	Trebalo je da nikome nisam rekao.
I just wanted to know.	Samo sam htio znati.
I knew this was going to happen	Znao sam da će se ovo dogoditi
Never before.	Nikad prije.

That happened.	To se dogodilo.
We can help so little.	Možemo tako malo pomoći.
I want to talk to you again soon	Želim uskoro ponovo razgovarati s tobom
I really needed a car	Jako mi je trebao auto
It was not easy for him.	Nije mu bilo lako.
You're the man for the job.	Ti si čovjek za taj posao.
They're here, she told herself.	Ovdje su, rekla je sebi.
It looks very real.	Vrlo stvarno izgleda.
I thought you might have a problem	Mislio sam da bi ti mogao biti problem
I want to help you with that.	Želim ti pomoći u tome.
I didn't know he was here	Nisam znao da je on ovde
We already knew that.	To smo već znali.
They were only there that year, maybe.	Bili su tamo samo te godine, možda.
I won't do it here	Neću to raditi ovdje
That is very true.	To je veoma tačno.
I thought you already knew that	Mislio sam da to već znaš
No one but.	Niko osim.
Maybe it's not a car.	Možda nije auto.
And they were.	I oni su bili.
I know when to say no	Znam kada da kažem ne

I like this one a lot.	Ovaj mi se mnogo sviđa.
I couldn't tell who they were	Nisam mogao reći koji su
Yes.	Da.
That's what he does right there.	To je ono što radi upravo tamo.
He just has to.	On jednostavno mora.
He must be not only good but really good.	On mora biti ne samo dobar nego i zaista dobar.
I'm a bad guy.	Ja sam loš momak.
I'm telling you.	Kažem ti.
I'm not afraid anymore	Više se ne bojim
I would give anything to have them here	Sve bih dao da su ovdje
But you did.	Ali jesi.
That was what we needed	To je bilo ono što nam je trebalo
I'm not doing this for money	Ne radim ovo zbog novca
I finished school	Završio sam školu
But there is a problem.	Ali postoji problem.
And be sure.	I biti siguran.
Why are we.	Zašto smo.
You need more of that.	Treba ti više toga.
I didn't mean to say anything	Nisam mislio ništa reći
He had to be.	Morao je biti.
I never wanted to see them again	Nikada ih više nisam želio vidjeti
Either way was good enough.	Bilo koji način je bio dovoljno dobar.
But maybe it's just me.	Ali možda sam to samo ja.
I tried to talk to him	Pokušao sam razgovarati s njim
It was much more than that.	Bilo je to mnogo više od toga.
I just can't let it go on	Jednostavno ne mogu dozvoliti da to ide dalje
I can't tell you what's going to happen	Ne mogu vam reći šta će se dogoditi
I would expect that to be done	Očekivao bih da se to uradi
No, it was both.	Ne, bilo je oboje.
He worked for a long time.	Radio je dugo vremena.
We don't know who these people are.	Ne znamo ko su ti ljudi.
I do my job well, but.	Ja dobro radim svoj posao, ali.
I'm glad it's mine.	Drago mi je da je moj.
I don't even know what he's doing.	Ne znam ni šta radi.
I wondered where he was	Pitao sam se gdje je
Not how.	Ne kako.
I'll tell you something else.	Reći ću ti još nešto.
I want to know everything you know	Želim da znam sve što ti znaš
He was a friend and only that.	Bio je prijatelj i samo to.
There seemed to be nothing to say.	Činilo se da nema šta da se kaže.
But he will know.	Ali on će znati.
I thought something was wrong with me.	Mislio sam da nešto nije u redu sa mnom.
At home I didn't mean anything.	Kod kuće nisam ništa mislio.
That was exactly it	To je bilo upravo to
I couldn't believe it	Nisam mogao vjerovati
I'm in it.	Ja sam u tome.
I wonder what's going on.	Pitam se šta se dešava.
I wasn't sure which one	Nisam bio baš siguran koji
And it's still hard.	I još je teško.
I almost didn't want to	Skoro da nisam htela
There is a.	Postoji a.
Many years ago.	Prije mnogo godina.
You couldn't trust him and you shouldn't.	Nisi mu mogao vjerovati i ne bi trebao.
I thought you'd be home by now	Mislio sam da ćeš već biti kod kuće
All he asked for was a little for himself.	Sve što je tražio bilo je malo za sebe.
He understood.	On je shvatio.
He just didn't understand what it was about	Jednostavno nije shvatio o čemu se radi
It was very good.	Bilo je jako dobro.
He didn't have much money.	Nije imao mnogo novca.
They would do it again tomorrow.	Ponovo bi to uradili sutra.
I think you can give me this one	Mislim da mi možeš dati ovaj
I need something better	Treba mi nešto bolje
I very much doubt it.	Veoma sumnjam.
I wish I knew what it looked like	Voleo bih da znam kako to izgleda
I just thought he must know that	Samo sam mislio da on to mora znati
I really didn't need it	Zaista mi nije trebao
It seems to be going well.	Čini se da ide dobro.
I already said too much	Već sam rekao previše
I thought that was it.	Mislio sam da je to sve.
Someone has to bring it back.	Neko ga mora vratiti.
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
He should be home by now.	Do sada bi trebao biti kod kuće.
I probably won't be back	Verovatno se neću vratiti
I'm not exactly like you	Nisam baš kao ti
I had to see them.	Morao sam da ih vidim.
I'm doing this with or without you	Ja ovo radim sa tobom ili bez tebe
I guess that's it	Pretpostavljam da je to to
Maybe I'm really good at it	Možda sam zaista dobar u tome
If that's what you meant.	Ako si na to mislio.
No one can.	Niko ne može.
Good.	Dobro.
I had to know for sure	Morao sam da znam sigurno
I want to see him work for this	Želim da ga vidim kako radi za ovo
More, in fact.	Više, u stvari.
I haven't seen you here before	Nisam te prije vidio ovdje
Maybe you shouldn't.	Možda ne bi trebao.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to da uradim.
I didn't know you were back	Nisam znao da si se vratio
You know what's going on.	Znaš šta se dešava.
You know it is.	Znaš da jeste.
I know it's true.	Znam da je istina.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
Tell him you're busy.	Reci mu da si zauzet.
And he's good at it.	I dobar je u tome.
I hope it works	Nadam se da radi
I'll tell you everything that happened	Reći ću ti sve što se dogodilo
I got this.	Shvatio sam ovo.
I've seen this before	Video sam ovo ranije
I have a very good one	Imam jedan veoma dobar
I wouldn't know how to do this alone	Ne bih znao kako da ovo uradim sam
I was more than happy	Bio sam više nego sretan
I knew someone would say that	Znao sam da će neko to reći
I never did.	Nikad nisam.
I just don't know.	Samo ne znam.
That's who.	Taj je koji.
Maybe it's a good game.	Možda je to dobra igra.
I couldn't see you at all	Nisam mogao da te vidim uopšte
I knew how he felt	Znao sam kako se osjeća
I could still see her	Još sam je mogao vidjeti
We know the question.	Znamo pitanje.
No, not right away, but soon.	Ne, ne odmah, nego uskoro.
I knew right away what it was	Odmah sam znao šta je to
I have nothing to say, but it's okay.	Nemam šta da kažem, ali u redu je.
Today is the day.	Danas je dan.
I think you have a problem	Mislim da imaš problem
I never thought you would do something like that	Nikad nisam mislio da ćeš uraditi tako nešto
Not right away.	Ne odmah.
I knew this day would come	Znao sam da će doći ovaj dan
And don't tell me you are.	I nemoj mi reći da si to.
I can't say what he wants	Ne mogu reći šta želi
No, this is not right.	Ne, ovo nije u redu.
As if nothing had happened.	Kao da se ništa nije dogodilo.
I hope he brings me back.	Nadam se da će me vratiti.
I want to know everything	Želim da znam sve
And they are.	I oni su.
He was about it.	Bio je o tome.
I can tell you it wouldn't be good.	Mogu vam reći da ne bi bilo dobro.
I have a lot.	Imam mnogo.
Those were the people.	To su bili ljudi.
I was ready to go.	Bio sam spreman da idem.
You can come and go as you wish.	Možete doći i otići kako želite.
Everything is as it was.	Sve je kao što je bilo.
Nobody has it.	Niko ga nema.
In fact, it is.	U stvari jeste.
But maybe he won't say it right away.	Ali možda to neće odmah reći.
It was really really good.	Bilo je stvarno jako dobro.
She knew he could give it.	Znala je da on to može dati.
I was here.	Bio sam ovdje.
I wish I knew the truth	Voleo bih da znam istinu
Not for sure.	Ne sigurno.
I really can't believe it	Zaista ne mogu vjerovati
He doesn't do something like that.	Ne radi tako nešto.
Maybe we were for him.	Možda smo za njega bili.
I'm obviously back	Očigledno sam se vratio
That's what he expected.	To je ono što je očekivao.
It should work.	Trebalo bi da radi.
It could be .	Moglo bi biti .
It was now or never.	Bilo je sada ili nikad.
It was never enough for me.	Za mene to nikada nije bilo dovoljno.
I told you it would be	Rekao sam ti da će biti
I wanted him to love me so much	Toliko sam želio da me voli
And that is happening now.	I to se sada dešava.
I have to tell you about it	Moram da ti kažem o tome
I knew who they were	Znao sam ko su oni
I had no idea what to say	Nisam imao pojma šta da kažem
I'm sure you know how it is.	Siguran sam da znaš kako je.
He still says nothing.	I dalje ne govori ništa.
Must be.	Mora biti.
I knew you would never come back	Znao sam da se nikad nećeš vratiti
I have a lot of time.	Imam dosta vremena.
I was just.	Bio sam samo.
We need to know why.	Moramo znati zašto.
We don't know yet what will happen.	Za sada ne znamo šta će se dogoditi.
I have something else to say	Imam još nešto da kažem
I didn't think so.	Nisam mislio tako.
Everything he does is for money.	Sve što radi je zbog novca.
Something this man knows something about.	Nešto o čemu ovaj čovjek nešto zna.
He was sure she would never tell anyone.	Bio je siguran da ona nikada nikome neće reći.
I don't think this is a good idea	Mislim da ovo nije dobra ideja
It is not me.	Nisam ja.
I know this is not going to be easy	Znam da ovo neće biti lako
How right he was.	Kako je bio u pravu.
I'm sure you can too.	Siguran sam da i ti možeš.
I really hope not	Zaista se nadam da nije
I asked who was home	Pitao sam ko je kod kuće
And it's not.	I nije.
It was for fun.	Bilo je za zabavu.
I want to know why.	Želim da znam zašto.
I should have seen that	Trebao sam to vidjeti
Say nothing, do nothing.	Ne govori ništa, ne radi ništa.
There are, but certainly not enough for everyone.	Ima ih, ali sigurno nije dovoljno za sve.
That's all anyone sees.	To je sve što neko vidi.
I like to be busy.	Volim biti zauzet.
Really good.	Zaista dobro.
But there can only be one.	Ali, može biti samo jedan.
You know he couldn't do this.	Znaš da nije mogao ovo da uradi.
I wouldn't be here today without him	Ne bih bio ovdje danas da nije bilo njega
Everything he had to do.	Sve što je morao da uradi.
And we will never beat them.	I nikada ih nećemo pobijediti.
I know how hard this is	Znam koliko je ovo teško
I couldn't allow that.	Nisam to mogao dozvoliti.
I am glad.	Drago mi je.
I knew this was not going to be good	Znao sam da ovo neće biti dobro
He did what he had to do.	Uradio je ono što je morao.
I have nothing bad to say about it	Nemam ništa loše da kažem o tome
Like that.	Kao i to.
She was good at it.	Bila je dobra u tome.
I already bought a new one.	Već sam kupio novi.
They didn't say why.	Nisu rekli zašto.
He hasn't come yet.	Još nije došao.
But it's happening again.	Ali to se dešava ponovo.
I had to do something now	Morao sam nešto da uradim sada
It was good for a little for my life.	Bilo je dobro za malo za moj život.
She told me to tell you that.	Rekla mi je da ti to kažem.
I never had to help anyone	Nikad nisam morao nikome pomoći
Nice to meet you all.	Drago mi je svima.
It was a question of when.	Bilo je pitanje kada.
As it should be.	Kako treba.
Just right.	Baš kako treba.
That is what it is.	To je ono što jeste.
I didn't hear the door either	Ni ja nisam čuo vrata
You may find it difficult.	Možda će vam biti teško.
That's how I wanted it to work	Tako sam htela da radi
I expected little to happen	Očekivao sam da će se malo toga dogoditi
Nothing right, nothing right.	Ništa kako treba, ništa kako treba.
Maybe, this time.	Možda, ovaj put.
You knew you wanted to leave.	Znao si da bi želeo da ode.
Not that it will be easy.	Nije da će biti lako.
I don't need that.	Ne treba mi to.
He told me he was sorry.	Rekao mi je da mu je žao.
I'm here to see if that happens	Ovdje sam da vidim da li će se to dogoditi
I just can't take it anymore	Jednostavno ne mogu više
I just wanted to stay here a little longer	Samo sam htio ostati ovdje još malo
I don't think that's what you want.	Mislim da to nije ono što želiš.
I just have to do it.	Samo moram to da uradim.
You know you want it.	Znaš da to želiš.
I didn't think anything about it.	Nisam mislio ništa o tome.
It's hard enough to reach you.	Dovoljno je teško doći do tebe.
But we have to do it.	Ali moramo to učiniti.
I didn't expect you to come to me	Nisam očekivao da ćeš doći kod mene
I brought them back.	Vratio sam ih.
I wish someone could help me !.	Voleo bih da mi neko može pomoći!.
He didn't want to leave.	Nije želio otići.
I only had until tomorrow	Imao sam samo do sutra
Or he was.	Ili je bio.
Really good friend	Zaista dobar prijatelj
I already had enough money	Već sam imao dovoljno novca
For what they did to me.	Za ono što su mi uradili.
You can't say who he is.	Ne možete reći ko je on.
I couldn't find him	Nisam ga mogao naći
This is the first way.	Ovo je prvi način.
I knew something was going on	Znao sam da se nešto dešava
That is so true.	To je tako istina.
I want to go with him	Želim da idem s njim
I know them well	Znam ih dobro
Maybe I'm the only one who loves them.	Možda sam jedini koji ih voli.
I haven't decided yet	Nisam se još odlučio
He knew it was.	Znao je da jeste.
I wonder if it's good.	Pitam se da li je dobro.
Not that it was very difficult.	Nije da je bilo jako teško.
I thought so too	I ja sam tako mislio
This was not him.	Ovo nije bio on.
You have something about yourself.	Imaš nešto o sebi.
That's exactly what we need.	To je upravo ono što nam treba.
I would never be alone again	Nikada više ne bih bila sama
I didn't see her.	Nisam je vidio.
Like real.	Kao pravi.
I know where this is	Znam gdje je ovo
It can be just a few or a little more.	Može biti samo nekoliko ili malo više.
Anything that is not very difficult.	Sve što nije jako teško.
He's still not home.	Još uvijek nije kod kuće.
They will do it together.	Oni će to zajedno.
I already knew what happened	Već sam znao šta se dogodilo
I would love to see her again	Voleo bih da je ponovo vidim
That could be it.	To bi moglo biti to.
I would give it	Dao bih ga
I thought it wasn't working for me.	Mislio sam da ne radi zbog mene.
But it was difficult.	Ali bilo je teško.
You can't know what he is.	Ne možete znati šta je on.
I have to find him, now	Moram ga naći, odmah
I wasn't expecting you so soon	Nisam te očekivao tako brzo
What's happening.	Šta se dešava.
He is here now.	On je sada ovde.
I didn't even expect him to come	Nisam ni očekivao da će doći
I just didn't need this right now	Jednostavno mi ovo trenutno nije trebalo
But she was the only one.	Ali ona je bila jedina.
Now that seems to be true.	Sada se čini da je to istina.
Not to say it could never happen.	Da ne kažem da se to nikada ne bi moglo dogoditi.
This is a pretty obvious question.	Ovo je prilično očigledno pitanje.
I didn't want to see you here.	Nisam želeo da te vidim ovde.
He did it again.	Ponovo je to uradio.
That's what everyone said.	To su svi rekli.
It wasn't me anymore.	Više nisam bio ja.
And you're back.	A ti si se vratio.
But it can be found.	Ali može se naći.
He didn't know how much time he had.	Koliko je imao vremena, nije znao.
All you have to do is want it.	Sve što treba da uradite je da to želite.
Something was better than nothing.	Nešto je bilo bolje nego ništa.
I don't want a job.	Ne želim posao.
You have to believe in it.	Morate vjerovati u to.
I had no idea what it looked like	Nisam imao pojma kako izgleda
I wonder how much he actually got	Pitam se koliko je zapravo dobio
And I couldn't help it.	I nisam mogao pomoći.
She knew the time.	Znala je za vrijeme.
There would be none of that.	Ne bi bilo ništa od toga.
It all happened.	Sve se to dogodilo.
I know everything you're going to say	Znam sve što ćeš reći
I really want that to be true.	Zaista želim da to bude istina.
Nobody could tell me that either.	Ni to mi niko nije mogao reći.
And he worked with me to make it even better.	I radio je sa mnom da to bude još bolje.
There was no one before him	Prije njega nije bilo nikoga
You have to tell this to anyone	Moraš nikome da kažeš ovo
Not with you.	Ne sa tobom.
You couldn't trust anyone.	Nisi mogao nikome vjerovati.
I would do anything to be with you	Učinio bih sve da budem s tobom
And that's a good thing.	I to je dobra stvar.
And that's life.	I to je život.
I thought you'd know.	Mislio sam da ćeš znati.
He was like.	Bio je kao.
I can help him with that	Mogu mu pomoći u tome
That was before she knew exactly who he was.	To je bilo prije nego što je tačno znala ko je on.
I mean, nobody knows that.	Mislim, to niko ne zna.
Please can anyone help me.	Molim vas može li mi neko pomoći.
That's what it looks like.	Tako izgleda.
There is, much more.	Ima, mnogo više.
They are always alone.	Uvek su sami.
No one can ever know.	Niko nikada ne može znati.
I can't know.	Ne mogu znati.
I can't be a father now	Ne mogu sada biti otac
She has her own way of doing it	Ona ima svoj način na koji to radi
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
I love everything you've done here	Volim sve što si uradio ovde
I knew this was not going to be easy.	Znao sam da ovo neće biti lako.
I probably would too.	Verovatno bih i ja.
And that is usually true.	I to je obično tačno.
We will do everything together.	Sve ćemo uraditi zajedno.
That was not good of him.	To nije bilo dobro od njega.
You know it’s really very simple.	Znate da je to zaista vrlo jednostavno.
I never know how to say these things	Nikad ne znam kako da kažem ove stvari
But it looks good.	Ali izgleda dobro.
I said that before, now there is nothing to do	Rekao sam to ranije, sada nema šta da se radi
I want to know if that's true	Želim da znam da li je to istina
It happened three times.	Tri puta se to dogodilo.
I never would.	Nikada ne bi.
If he's here, he feels good.	Ako je ovdje, osjeća se dobro.
I never have time to do anything	Nikad nemam vremena da uradim bilo šta
I'll know why.	Ja ću znati zašto.
It is.	Da jeste.
I had a lot of money	Imao sam dosta novca
Where she was.	Gdje je ona bila.
I wondered where he could have gone	Pitao sam se gdje je mogao otići
We are alive and together.	Živi smo i zajedno.
I just want you for myself for a while	Samo te želim samo za sebe na neko vrijeme
Both good and bad.	I dobro i loše.
He knew he had to leave before that happened.	Znao je da mora otići prije nego što se to dogodilo.
I've got it so far.	Do sada sam ga dobio.
I don't have it anymore.	Nemam ga više.
He said it was wrong.	Rekao je da to nije u redu.
I think about it.	Mislim na to.
He gave me this job here.	On mi je dao ovaj posao ovde.
I'm glad you came.	Drago mi je što si došao.
They would know that.	Oni bi to znali.
I can't do this properly either	Ne mogu ni ovo da uradim kako treba
He got lost again for a while.	Ponovo se izgubio na neko vrijeme.
Thirty years.	Trideset godina.
I know there is more to it than that	Znam da za mene postoji više od toga
Me from home.	Ja od kuće.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Nisam siguran kako da ovo uradim.
I will always be here.	Ja ću uvijek biti ovdje.
We'll find it.	Naći ćemo.
He doesn't want to say.	Ne želi da kaže.
I only see them when something is wrong	Vidim ih samo kada nešto nije u redu
But there is not that much money at the moment.	Ali trenutno nema toliko novca.
It was simple.	Jednostavno je bilo.
I could get help now	Mogao bih sada dobiti pomoć
I know there is a way	Znam da postoji način
I didn't tell anyone	Nisam nikome rekao
But even that is not true.	Ali ni to nije istina.
If it wasn't, it wouldn't be.	Da nije, ne bi.
You might think it's not so bad.	Možda mislite da nije tako loše.
I want you all this time	Želim vas sve ovaj put
You tried to help.	Pokušao si pomoći.
I wanted to see him	Želeo sam da ga vidim
You just have to believe.	Samo treba vjerovati.
You have to trust me.	Moraš mi vjerovati.
And there is a good reason.	I postoji dobar razlog.
That's him.	To je on.
Only she is not.	Samo ona nije.
I saw it right away.	Odmah sam to vidio.
I had no idea what was waiting for me	Nisam imao pojma šta me čeka
We do work.	Radimo posao.
There could be more.	Moglo bi biti i više.
I couldn't help it anymore	Nisam više mogao pomoći
I think I could tell you a lot	Mislim da bi vam mogao reći puno toga
I think it will be fine	Mislim da će biti u redu
Nobody wanted it as much as they did.	Niko to nije toliko želeo kao oni.
I didn't know what to think.	Nisam znao šta da mislim.
People didn’t really know about it	Ljudi zapravo nisu znali za to
There's a door.	Tu su vrata.
I wasn't there for him.	Nisam bila tu za njega.
We have to do much better at home.	Moramo da uradimo mnogo bolje kod kuće.
I knew what he was going to say	Znao sam šta će reći
Not like us, who know what we're doing.	Ne kao mi, koji znamo šta radimo.
No more than that.	Ne više od toga.
We did the right thing.	Uradili smo pravu stvar.
Was he sure of this? 	Je li bio siguran u ovo?
Just better.	Samo bolje.
But she just looks.	Ali ona samo izgleda.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
I like to be surprised	Volim biti iznenađen
We need more and more.	Treba nam sve više i više.
I didn't know where he was	Nisam znao gdje je
I knew it was going to happen.	Znao sam da će se to dogoditi.
Or he thinks he is.	Ili misli da jeste.
I can't do it tomorrow	Ne mogu baš sutra
Can you believe it ?.	Možeš li vjerovati?.
I didn't do any of that	Nisam uradio ništa od toga
They said yes.	Oni su rekli da.
It was very difficult for me.	Bilo mi je jako teško.
I knew he was right.	Znao sam da je u pravu.
I knew he would be gone soon	Znao sam da će uskoro otići
This one isn't.	Ovaj nije.
It was simply the truth.	To je jednostavno bila istina.
But I couldn't help it	Ali nisam mogao pomoći
Actually, that's not my story.	Zapravo, to nije moja priča.
Tell me how you are.	Reci kako si.
I don't even know what to say.	Ne znam ni šta da kažem.
It often works.	Često radi.
Everything you need is here.	Sve što vam treba je ovdje.
He was so tired.	Bio je tako umoran.
Maybe I'm not ready	Možda nisam spreman
It was obvious what was happening now.	Bilo je očigledno šta se sada dešava.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry	Žao mi je, tako mi je žao
I'm glad you're better	Drago mi je da ti je bolje
It wasn’t much, but it was better than nothing.	Nije bilo puno, ali je bilo bolje nego ništa.
I'm here and I'm not going	Ovde sam i ne idem
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
I only have myself.	Imam samo sebe.
I could say too much	Mogao bih reći previše
I only saw him as a friend	Vidio sam ga samo kao prijatelja
I knew what they did	Znao sam šta su uradili
I'll be with you soon	Idem sa tobom uskoro
You don't have to be like them, like him.	Ne moraš biti kao oni, kao on.
I think so, but not that	Mislim da, ali ne to
I just need to know what to do next.	Samo moram da znam šta dalje da radim.
It certainly is.	Sigurno jeste.
I'm not home right now	Trenutno nisam kod kuće
He always tries to help me.	Uvek pokušava da mi pomogne.
Those people were there.	Ti ljudi su bili tamo.
And now I love them	I sada ih volim
I heard you there.	Čuo sam te tamo.
So it won't work.	Tako da to neće raditi.
I knew what he wanted.	Znao sam šta želi.
He’s like us, but he does a little more.	On je kao i mi, ali radi malo više.
And he knows it.	I on to zna.
I've done it before.	Radio sam to ranije.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
I just need a day to be alone	Samo mi treba dan da budem sama
And tonight was .	A večeras je bilo .
I love this and this	Volim ovaj i ovaj
I've seen bad code before.	Već sam vidio loš kod.
And I do that very well	I to radim veoma dobro
May not.	Ne mora.
You know, if I can't, they'll say no.	Znate, ako ne mogu, reći će ne.
It works well for me.	Kod mene dobro radi.
I hope everyone is well at home	Nadam se da su svi kod kuće dobro
I tried to see why they were here	Pokušao sam da vidim zašto su ovde
I never thought I would say that	Nikad nisam mislio da ću to reći
You can talk to him yourself.	Možete sami razgovarati s njim.
I always wondered what that would be like	Uvijek sam se pitao kako bi to bilo
It must be seen.	Mora se vidjeti.
Is that it.	Je li to to.
Which they had.	Koje su imali.
She's waiting for me.	Čeka me.
Maybe even too much.	Možda čak i previše.
Not as bad as it looks.	Nije tako loše kao što izgleda.
I was sure something bad had happened.	Bio sam siguran da se nešto loše dogodilo.
I can't reach you	Ne mogu doći do tebe
I was surprised to see him	Bio sam iznenađen kad sam ga vidio
Really, very hard.	Zaista, jako teško.
If he had given those things, he would never have returned them.	Da je dao te stvari, nikada ih ne bi vratio.
I began to wonder what they might be	Počeo sam da se pitam šta bi oni mogli biti
Really very long.	Zaista jako dugo.
That is very, very difficult.	To je veoma, veoma teško.
I have what you say you need	Imam ono što kažeš da ti treba
I didn't think he felt that way	Nisam mislio da se tako osjeća
It wasn't easy either.	Ni to nije bilo lako.
I didn't hear anything	Nisam ništa čuo
I was surprised to see her	Bio sam iznenađen kad sam je vidio
I asked her what she hoped to find	Pitao sam je šta se nada da će naći
I didn't have to know what it was	Nisam morao da znam šta je to
Good friend.	Dobar prijatelj.
I wonder how he feels	Pitam se kako se osjeća
He did everything.	On je sve uradio.
That's why we're here.	Zbog toga smo ovdje.
I know you too	Znam i ti
Besides, he won't stay here long.	Osim toga, neće dugo ostati ovdje.
I'm here with you	Tu sam sa tobom
I probably could.	Verovatno bih mogao.
I haven't done this before	Nisam ovo radio ranije
I decided that today	Odlučio sam to danas
I could tell how good he was	Mogao sam reći koliko je dobar
I didn't really know what	Nisam baš znao šta
I didn't see anything wrong with that	Nisam vidio ništa loše u tome
Something is obviously wrong.	Očigledno nešto nije u redu.
I'm sorry I didn't want to	Žao mi je što nisam želio
It didn't take me that long	Nisu mi trebali tako dugo
I was looking for something	Tražio sam nešto
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
They are the ones who did it.	Oni su ti koji su to uradili.
I doubt he may be gone	Sumnjam da ga možda nema
They could have said no so easily.	Mogli su tako lako reći ne.
I'm not going there	Ne idem tamo
He saw.	Video je.
Maybe I'm gone for a few days	Možda me nema nekoliko dana
I didn't mean to tell you this	Nisam htela da ti ovo kažem
I have to do this	Moram ovo da uradim
Or maybe not.	Ili možda neće.
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
I guess that's good enough	Pretpostavljam da je to dovoljno dobro
You can tell me what happened your way.	Možeš mi reći šta se dogodilo na tvoj način.
What was there?	Šta je tu bilo.
I could never do that to you	Nikad ti to ne bih mogao uraditi
I didn't want to go see things.	Nisam htela da idem da vidim stvari.
I guess I do	Pretpostavljam da to uradim
I didn't know what you meant	Nisam znao na šta misliš
I've never seen that before	Nikada ranije to nisam video
He couldn't help me.	Nije mi mogao pomoći.
There could have been more.	Moglo je biti i više.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
It felt like home.	Činilo se kao kod kuće.
I think that's all you really need	Mislim da je to sve što zaista treba
Yes, it's hard.	Da, teško je.
I hope you can see that well enough.	Nadam se da to možete vidjeti dovoljno dobro.
He was not the only one.	On nije bio jedini.
We can't take it anymore.	Ne možemo više.
But now I could go back	Ali sada bih se mogao vratiti
We didn't do anything.	Ništa nismo uradili.
I wouldn't do that, I couldn't.	Ja to ne bih, ne bih mogao.
I thought maybe she knew something	Mislio sam da je možda znala nešto
She would tell me herself.	Ona bi mi sama rekla.
Live a good life.	Živi dobar život.
I'm sorry, but many times.	Žao mi je, ali mnogo puta.
There was another.	Bio je još jedan.
That's much better.	To je mnogo bolje.
You can see it here.	Možete ga vidjeti ovdje.
No, not like him.	Ne, ne kao on.
But everything was better than good.	Ali sve je bilo bolje nego dobro.
I wonder why it took him so long	Pitam se šta mu je trebalo toliko vremena
I think it's even better	Mislim da je to još bolje
He lost everything.	Izgubio je sve.
Things are too much or something.	Stvari je previše ili tako nešto.
Nobody saw it.	Niko to nije video.
I want good and bad.	Želim dobro i loše.
I wouldn't want to do this without you	Ne bih želio ovo raditi bez tebe
Stay home.	Ostati kod kuće.
I arrived by this afternoon	Stigao sam do danas popodne
I don't know anything.	Ne znam ništa.
But I have to see you	Ali moram da te vidim
In fact, it is.	U stvari jeste.
I wish there was a better way	Voleo bih da postoji bolji način
You can't do any better.	Ne možeš ništa bolje.
She didn't know when it would be.	Kada će to biti, nije znala.
And the wait is very long	I čeka se jako dugo
We can talk there.	Možemo tamo razgovarati.
It's so good.	Tako je dobro.
I was already pretty busy today	Danas sam već bio prilično zauzet
I'm sure it's very easy.	Siguran sam da je to vrlo lako.
Maybe you're even right.	Možda si čak i u pravu.
This can happen pretty quickly.	Ovo se može dogoditi prilično brzo.
I still couldn't see anyone	I dalje nisam mogao nikoga vidjeti
But for now, we’re doing it for you.	Ali za sada, mi to radimo za vas.
I'm really sick	Zaista mi je loše
That's how I did it	Ja sam to tako radio
That's the thing you do.	To je stvar koju radiš.
I mean, he was right	Mislim, bio je u pravu
That's what's happening here.	To je ono što se dešava ovde.
I know it wouldn't be easy	Znam da to ne bi bilo lako
You never know what he might say.	Nikad ne znaš šta bi mogao reći.
I have no problem with that.	Nemam problema sa tim.
They shouldn't be a problem.	Oni ne bi trebali biti problem.
He didn't tell him anything.	Ništa mu nije rekao.
I have nothing more to say	Nemam više šta da kažem
There's a little more to it than that.	Ima malo više od toga.
That's it.	To je to.
This is usually a way to do good.	To je obično način da se učini dobro.
And that is what we will do today.	I to je ono što ćemo učiniti danas.
She didn't know.	Nije znala.
It's still going strong.	I dalje ide jako.
I never did that.	Nikad to nisam uradio.
I wouldn't want that	Ne bih to želio
I could help with that.	Mogao bih pomoći u tome.
Okay, maybe this wouldn't be too hard.	Dobro, možda ovo ne bi bilo previše teško.
I didn't need anyone	Niko mi nije trebao
Maybe it's actually wrong.	Možda zapravo nije u redu.
I'm going after him	Idem za njim
I didn't know he had it in him.	Nisam znao da ima to u sebi.
It’s not just a matter of being a good person.	Nije samo stvar biti dobra osoba.
But it couldn't.	Ali nije moglo.
This has happened three times.	Ovo se dogodilo tri puta.
He never asked again.	Nikada više nije pitao.
I need him to tell me everything will be fine.	Treba mi da mi kaže da će sve biti u redu.
So many people want to know what you know now.	Toliko ljudi želi da zna ono što vi sada znate.
But that is not enough.	Ali to nije dovoljno.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
If he could be here with you, you know he would.	Da je mogao biti ovdje sa tobom, znaš da bi.
I can't do that, you know.	Ne mogu to da uradim, znaš.
Not so here.	Ovdje nije tako.
But we can do better.	Ali možemo bolje.
I wonder if you already know that	Pitam se da li to već znate
I'm still here for you	I dalje sam tu za tebe
If you really don't want to.	Ako stvarno ne želiš.
Maybe even better.	Možda čak i bolje.
I knew he would do it	Znao sam da će to učiniti
But now I couldn't do that	Ali sada to nisam mogao
Came there.	Došao tamo.
And they couldn't do that.	A to nisu mogli učiniti.
We know the way home.	Znamo put kući.
But he needed that.	Ali to mu je trebalo.
I thought it was you	Mislio sam da si to ti
But we know that's not true.	Ali znamo da to nije istina.
I'm sure you have to find him	Siguran sam da ga morate naći
I couldn't do that to you	Nisam mogao to da ti uradim
Certainly not.	Sigurno neće.
That was not entirely obvious to me.	To mi nije bilo potpuno očigledno.
He's going with you.	On ide sa tobom.
I know this is hard for you	Znam da ti je ovo teško
It could have been anyone.	Mogao je biti bilo ko.
Not everyone.	Nisu svi.
I knew it was true.	Znao sam da je to istina.
I know that in.	Znam to u.
I was surprised to see that.	Bio sam iznenađen kada sam to video.
I'll pick you up soon	Doći ću po tebe uskoro
I knew he would do it	Znao sam da će to učiniti
From a friend now.	Od prijatelja sada.
And you are absolutely right.	I potpuno ste u pravu.
But it can't be that simple.	Ali to ne može biti tako jednostavno.
I know he's wrong.	Znam da nije u pravu.
None of us said anything.	Niko od nas nije rekao ništa.
I say who can come and who can go.	Ja kažem ko može da dođe, a ko može da ode.
She knew she would never return.	Znala je da se nikada neće vratiti.
I asked what it was for.	Pitao sam za šta je to.
We were just there.	Upravo smo bili tamo.
All right.	U redu.
I don't think they're right for me.	Mislim da nisu pravi za mene.
He didn't want to see anymore.	Nije želio više da vidi.
I really liked telling him this	Zaista sam volio da mu ovo kažem
But we didn't, really.	Ali nismo, zaista.
That's usually enough for me.	To mi je obično dovoljno.
I thought you might be able to help.	Mislio sam da biste mogli pomoći.
I had to tell you that	Morao sam to da ti kažem
I hope it works.	Nadam se da radi.
I can't do everything.	Ne mogu sve.
I wonder if it will help me	Pitam se hoće li mi pomoći
He is perhaps thirty years old.	Ima možda trideset godina.
I had no money	Nisam imao novca
I don't see anything more we can do now	Ne vidim ništa više što sada možemo učiniti
But this was even better.	Ali ovo je bilo još bolje.
I have to go to work	Moram na posao
It's just us.	To smo samo mi.
More time than we know what to do.	Više vremena nego što ćemo znati šta da radimo.
But that was me.	Ali to sam bio ja.
You were there.	Bio si tamo.
We don't know what we are.	Ne znamo šta smo.
I was so happy to see you	Bio sam tako sretan što sam te vidio
I know he doesn't like staying there	Znam da ne voli ostati tamo
That's actually it.	To je u stvari to.
That was fine with me.	To je bilo u redu sa mnom.
I knew my father would come	Znao sam da će moj otac doći
I shouldn't know this	Ne bi trebalo da znam ovo
But few really do.	Ali malo ko to zaista radi.
In any way.	Na bilo koji način.
I asked if something was wrong	Pitao sam da li nešto nije u redu
That's enough to say.	To je dovoljno za reći.
I no longer know if that is true or not	Više ne znam da li je to istina ili ne
Maybe you were right.	Možda ste bili u pravu.
People are not sure of me.	Ljudi nisu sigurni od mene.
You are much further away.	Mnogo si dalje.
You probably are, too.	I ti si, vjerovatno.
I could see a little more	Još sam malo mogao vidjeti
Or he tried.	Ili je pokušao.
I knew it was going to happen	Znao sam da će se to dogoditi
I want to see her.	Želim da je vidim.
This is not good.	Ovo nije dobro.
I would never leave home	Nikada ne bih otišao od kuće
That would not be difficult.	To ne bi bilo teško.
I guess that's fine.	Pretpostavljam da je to u redu.
He shouldn't have had it.	Nije trebao da ga ima.
He didn't expect that.	On to nije očekivao.
I was just thinking about you	Samo sam mislio na tebe
Someone has to do it.	Neko mora to da radi.
Don't say that.	Ne govori tako.
I mean, he didn't ask anyone for help	Mislim, nije ni od koga tražio pomoć
It wouldn't take long	Ne bih trebao dugo
He doesn't say.	Ne kaže.
It just doesn’t work.	To se jednostavno ne radi.
I hope you can	Nadam se da ćeš moći
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
I didn't hear anything	Nisam ništa čuo
I have enough for myself	Imam ih dovoljno za sebe
For one day.	Za jedan dan.
You won't have to do anything.	Nećeš morati ništa da radiš.
I wondered why.	Pitao sam se zašto.
I can't say who.	Ne mogu reći ko.
That's my father.	To je moj otac.
But he will come tomorrow.	Ali sutra će doći.
I should have seen this	Trebao sam ovo vidjeti
But she was right.	Ali bila je u pravu.
I did the right thing	Uradio sam pravu stvar
And that was fine.	I to je bilo u redu.
He's been here a long time.	Vrlo dugo je ovdje.
We both know what needs to be done here.	Oboje znamo šta ovde treba da se uradi.
You won't say no.	Nećeš reći ne.
I mean, nothing.	Mislim, ništa.
But he obviously won.	Ali očigledno je da je dobio.
I had too much.	Imao sam previše.
And he was much better	A bio je mnogo bolji
I did.	Ja sam uradio.
And there was simply nothing we could do.	I jednostavno ništa nismo mogli učiniti.
That's all I do.	Samo to radim.
But not me.	Ali ne ja.
There is a lot of time.	Ima dosta vremena.
They are not.	Nisu.
I can't think	Ne mogu da mislim
You can't do that.	Ne možete to učiniti.
It must have been her.	Mora da je to bila ona.
I'm sure she didn't say that	Siguran sam da to nije rekla
I think it was okay.	Mislim da je bilo u redu.
I always wanted to do that	Uvek sam želeo da to uradimo
Maybe he was right.	Možda je bio u pravu.
He thought that was wrong.	Mislio je da to nije u redu.
I can't trust anyone	Ne mogu nikome vjerovati
I want to know how it happened	Želim da znam kako se to dogodilo
He never was.	Nikada nije bio.
I hope not.	Nadam se da ne.
Who do you think?	Šta misliš ko?
He did it all.	Sve je to uradio.
I really want them.	Zaista ih želim.
Not exactly.	Ne baš tako.
I have to go to work.	Moram na posao.
I have something to say	Imam nešto da kažem
Never happened before.	Nikad se prije nije dogodilo.
This seems unlikely.	Ovo se čini malo vjerovatno.
I'll bring you back	Ja ću te vratiti
I wouldn't work with you anymore, for nothing	Ne bih više radio s tobom, ni za šta
I never got that	Nikad to nisam dobio
I think we could do that	Mislim da bismo to mogli
Everything is working properly.	Sve radi kako treba.
I was both those people	Ja sam oboje bio ti ljudi
And that doesn't help either.	A ni to nije od pomoći.
It really should.	Zaista treba.
I think he's there now.	Mislim da je sada tamo.
Hope is what we have.	Nada je ono što imamo.
Everything you said is true.	Sve što si rekao je istina.
But what happened is still there.	Ali šta je bilo tu je i dalje.
I'm not saying it is.	Ne kažem da jeste.
I wasn't ready for that	Nisam bio spreman za to
Nothing bad has ever happened to me.	Nikada mi se ništa loše nije dogodilo.
He just has things.	On samo ima stvari.
I didn't expect this	Nisam ovo očekivao
Maybe he's sorry.	Možda mu je žao.
I think you're right	Mislim da si u pravu
It could not be found.	Nije se moglo naći.
Maybe she said something.	Možda je nešto rekla.
I don't want you to do that.	Ne želim da to uradiš.
Everything looks better than ever.	Sve izgleda bolje nego ikada prije.
I guess there could be more here too	Pretpostavljam da bi i ovdje moglo biti više
And you can't buy them anymore.	I više ih ne možete kupiti.
He won't have to know.	Neće morati da zna.
Everything was so easy, so fast.	Sve je bilo tako lako, tako brzo.
I just asked what you think about it	Samo sam pitao šta misliš o tome
He could.	Mogao je.
Apparently he is too.	Očigledno je i on.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
I was quite happy.	Bio sam prilično sretan.
And no no.	I ne ne.
I did not know that.	Nisam to znao.
He thought he would be better.	Mislio je da će mu biti bolje.
So far it's working fine.	Za sada radi dobro.
And maybe.	I možda.
No one is sure what to make of it.	Niko nije siguran šta da radi o tome.
I can't bring back what happened.	Ne mogu vratiti ono što se dogodilo.
It didn't take long.	Nije dugo trebalo.
He is a person.	On je osoba.
Or maybe it is.	Ili možda jeste.
I already like it a lot	Već mi se mnogo sviđa
But we are wrong.	Ali nismo u pravu.
I wonder what will happen to me	Pitam se šta će biti sa mnom
I wonder how he is	Pitam se kako mu je
I probably should have been.	Verovatno sam trebao biti.
Quick and easy.	Brzo i lako.
I knew nothing more than you	Nisam znao ništa više od tebe
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
He couldn't do anything.	Nije mogao ništa.
They know what happened.	Oni znaju šta se dogodilo.
It was life.	Bio je to život.
It’s not just about what she looks like.	Ne radi se samo o tome kako ona izgleda.
I think it will be this week.	Mislim da će biti ove sedmice.
What could be the problem?	Šta bi mogao biti problem?
I know you know something	Znam da znaš nešto
I was good, but good was not good enough.	Bio sam dobar, ali dobro nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
Until he realized.	Dok nije shvatio.
I have to be with him	Moram biti s njim
Time before time.	Vrijeme prije vremena.
I thought it was just	Mislio sam da je samo
I haven't been there in a while	Nisam bio tamo neko vrijeme
I'm doing this for you	Ja ovo radim za tebe
I do not know what.	Ne znam šta.
We do what he tells us.	Radimo ono što nam kaže.
I thought he would be here	Mislio sam da će biti ovdje
I just want to know why you did this	Samo želim da znam zašto si ovo uradio
They were alone.	Bili su sami.
I couldn't do anything.	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim.
We didn't know what was going on.	Nismo znali šta se dešava.
I do this alone.	Ja ovo radim sam.
It was more him than you.	Bio je više on nego ti.
Obviously I should have bought it	Očigledno sam ga trebao kupiti
But he could not see them.	Ali nije ih mogao vidjeti.
I would never tell you, ever.	Nikada ti ne bih rekao, nikad.
That is what people should help us with	To je ono u čemu bi nam ljudi trebali pomoći
Why not? 	Zašto ne?
You can see what you think.	Možete vidjeti šta mislite.
They would not see what he could see.	Oni neće vidjeti ono što je on mogao vidjeti.
But he will come.	Ali on će doći.
I can only hope he does the right thing	Mogu samo da se nadam da radi pravu stvar
What people know, they know.	Ono što ljudi znaju, znaju.
We were both.	Oboje smo bili.
No one is happy.	Niko nije sretan.
But that's him.	Ali to je on.
But they should.	Ali trebali bi.
You saw him.	Video si ga.
And that is exactly what is happening.	I upravo se to dešava.
You don't want to, but you will.	Ne želiš, ali hoćeš.
I asked that.	Pitao sam to.
Not now, not tomorrow.	Ne sada, ne sutra.
And we do.	I mi to radimo.
Please, you have to.	Molim te, moraš.
But how.	Ali kako.
I just needed to get it	Samo sam trebao dobiti
But this is too much.	Ali ovo je previše.
I did my best	Dao sam sve od sebe
But now he had to do something.	Ali sada je trebalo nešto da uradi.
I'm not afraid of you anymore	Ne bojim te se više
I never did that.	Nikad to nisam uradio.
And not just yours.	I ne samo tvoj.
He knew everything.	Znao je sve.
I didn't want to ask	Nisam htela da pitam
That’s what’s next.	To je ono što je sljedeće.
I just want to talk to you	Samo želim razgovarati s tobom
And it is very likely that it will.	I vrlo je vjerovatno da hoće.
I really didn't expect it to be you	Zaista nisam očekivao da ćeš to biti ti
I didn't have anyone to help me either	Ni ja nisam imao ko da mi pomogne
I'll tell you it's hard	Reći ću vam da je teško
I'm really glad for you	Zaista mi je drago zbog tebe
I never saw him either	Ni ja ga nikad nisam vidio
I'm not even sure how it happened.	Nisam ni siguran kako se to dogodilo.
I arrived first	Ja sam prvi stigao
He'll be here soon.	Doći će uskoro.
Just to see.	Samo da vidim.
I don't know what to do next.	Ne znam šta dalje.
I didn't see anything	Nisam ništa video
I didn't really mean that	Nisam to stvarno mislio
Look, nothing happened.	Vidi, ništa se nije dogodilo.
I know you know better than that.	Znam da ti znaš bolje od toga.
He wasn't here.	On nije bio ovde.
I knew he wouldn't know	Znao sam da neće znati
I can't do that	Ne mogu to učiniti
He could see that it was.	Mogao je da vidi da jeste.
I'm not much.	Nisam mnogo.
It doesn't work that way.	To ne radi tako.
I just want to see him again	Samo ga želim ponovo vidjeti
I can't see it yet.	Ne mogu to još vidjeti.
No one knew better.	Niko nije znao bolje.
I shouldn't know	Ne bi trebalo da znam
I said can you tell me	Rekao sam da li možeš da mi kažeš
Nobody really likes to be told what to do.	Niko zaista ne voli da mu se govori šta da radi.
This has happened now.	Ovo se sada dogodilo.
I knew he wouldn't be happy.	Znao sam da mu neće biti drago.
No, he's not mine.	Ne, on nije moj.
I should be able to do this	Trebalo bi da mogu ovo da uradim
I know this is hard.	Znam da je ovo teško.
No one ever asked.	Niko nikada nije tražio.
I can do it tomorrow	Mogu to sutra
It's just not going to happen.	To se jednostavno neće dogoditi.
I'm not coming back.	Neću se vratiti.
I thought I'd talk to you	Mislio sam razgovarati s tobom
I won't let you do that	Neću ti dozvoliti da to uradiš
No, no, just a little.	Ne, ne, samo malo.
This doesn't work.	Ovo ne radi.
But.	Ali.
I should have been here	Trebao sam biti ovdje
I've been here before.	Bio sam ovdje prije.
You just have to go.	Jednostavno morate ići.
We just work together.	Samo radimo zajedno.
I never see him enough either.	Ni ja ga nikad ne vidim dovoljno.
But she doesn't have to.	Ali ona ne mora.
It seemed like a very good idea at the time.	Činilo se kao vrlo dobra ideja u to vrijeme.
We know they are there.	Znamo da su tamo.
I didn't want any of that	Nisam htio ništa od toga
I can tell you where to find it.	Mogu ti reći gdje ga možeš naći.
I hope you can help me.	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći.
I almost felt sorry for him	Skoro mi ga je bilo žao
I thought he would tell you	Mislio sam da bi ti rekao
No problem.	Nema problema.
I can tell there.	Mogu reći tamo.
I see pretty well.	Prilično dobro vidim.
I didn't and I won't	Nisam i neću
I told him myself.	Rekao sam mu sam.
And that is very difficult.	I to je veoma teško.
I think he can do whatever he wants	Mislim da može da radi šta hoće
It won't go in order.	Neće ići po redu.
I'm so glad you're all here tonight	Tako mi je drago da ste svi večeras ovdje
She is so afraid of being without me.	Ona se tako boji biti bez mene.
I hope they bring me back.	Nadam se da će me vratiti.
Unless you do.	Osim ako to ne uradiš.
I couldn't do this alone.	Ne bih mogao ovo sam.
That's what it's really about.	To je ono o čemu se zapravo radi.
I hope you will.	Nadam se da hoćeš.
Not as often as he wanted.	Ne tako često koliko je želio.
You're not that bad.	Nisi tako loš.
Not if you really like it.	Ne ako ti se zaista sviđa.
We just know.	Samo znamo.
I'm done.	Završio sam.
I wonder why they are here	Pitam se zašto su ovdje
He can talk.	On može da priča.
It was so fast.	Bilo je tako brzo.
That's exactly it.	To je upravo to.
A little bad, probably.	Malo loše, vjerovatno.
I tried, but I couldn't	Pokušao sam, ali nisam mogao
I shouldn't talk to him	Ne bih trebao razgovarati s njim
I think we'll see about that soon.	Mislim da ćemo to uskoro vidjeti.
It’s actually very simple.	Zapravo je vrlo jednostavno.
He really has to work.	On zaista mora da radi.
I know you wish you had it	Znam da bi volio da ga imaš
He wants something.	Želi nešto.
We still have a lot to do.	Imamo još mnogo toga da uradimo.
None of us have ever been.	Niko od nas nikada nije bio.
But maybe that says too much.	Ali možda i to govori previše.
The first came last year.	Prvi je došao prošle godine.
That never happened.	To se nikada nije dogodilo.
Pretty long.	Prilično dugo.
Even money.	Čak i novac.
It's not mine either.	Nije ni moj.
Now you have me.	Sada imaš mene.
It doesn't work anymore.	Ne radi više.
It wasn't bad, it was really good.	Nije bilo loše, bilo je stvarno dobro.
I just, you know, thought.	Samo sam, znaš, mislio.
I really have to go.	Stvarno moram da idem.
I couldn’t believe he was back, but he was	Nisam mogao vjerovati da se vratio, ali jeste
I want to be something	Želim da budem nešto
They won't know, not here.	Neće znati, ne ovdje.
I want him to see me	Želim da me vidi
I just couldn't help it	Jednostavno nisam mogao pomoći
I have a job for him tomorrow	Imam posao za njega sutra
But there was a problem.	Ali tu je bio problem.
I see something.	Vidim nešto.
You're doing your job.	Radiš svoj posao.
You won't find me here anymore.	Nećeš me više naći ovde.
I saw what he was doing.	Video sam šta radi.
This could be true.	Ovo bi moglo biti istina.
I can see everything	Mogu vidjeti sve
We didn't know what we were doing.	Nismo znali šta radimo.
He wants to, you know.	On želi, znaš.
Maybe this morning.	Možda već jutros.
There is nothing to talk about.	Nema šta da se priča.
I should have told you	Trebao sam ti reći
She always was and always will be.	Ona je uvek bila i uvek će biti.
I really hope not	Zaista se nadam da neće
It wasn't always easy.	Nije uvijek bilo lako.
That's a first for you.	To je prvi za tebe.
I think you said that	Mislim da si to rekao
You need to be sure who you are working with.	Morate biti sigurni s kim radite.
You really will.	Zaista hoćeš.
I need another one	Trebao bih još jedan
He wouldn't want to know.	Ne bi želio da zna.
I hope he didn't come alone	Nadam se da nije došao sam
Not now, never.	Ne sada, nikad.
I won't let you want to	Neću ti dati da želiš
Nobody does that today.	Danas to niko ne radi.
I have no idea how he got them	Nemam pojma kako ih je dobio
I knew what was going on	Znao sam šta se dešava
It's not just like he's not here.	Nije samo kao da nije ovdje.
I know as much as you do.	Znam koliko i ti.
Someone was there.	Neko je bio tamo.
I shouldn't be here.	Ne bih trebao biti ovdje.
I know he'll be here	Znam da će biti ovde
But you have to tell me.	Ali moraš mi reći.
This would not always be the case.	Ovo ne bi uvijek bilo tako.
I want to do my best	Želim dati sve od sebe
I couldn't do this alone	Ne bih mogao ovo sam
I had a few friends there	Imao sam nekoliko prijatelja tamo
This is being done.	Ovo se radi.
I mean, yes, but we can't	Mislim, da, ali ne možemo
It will be.	Biti će.
More people are talking.	Više ljudi govori.
I don't know what happened until today	Ne znam šta se dogodilo, do danas
I thought it was going well	Mislio sam da ide dobro
Just for now.	Samo za sada.
I have no idea where he is	Nemam pojma gdje je
The road is life itself	Put je sam život
I did it for him.	Radio sam to za njega.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
I was sure there were more	Bio sam siguran da ih ima još
There is still something to be done.	Ima još nešto da se uradi.
He knew about it.	Znao je za to.
Probably me.	Vjerovatno ja.
But just a little.	Ali samo malo.
I do everything bad, everything	Radim sve loše, sve
I knew it was because of me	Znao sam da je to zbog mene
He was tired, but there was more to it than that.	Bio je umoran, ali bilo je više od toga.
I looked like one too	I ja sam izgledao kao jedan
It's simple enough even for you.	Dovoljno je jednostavno čak i za vas.
But that is the only reason.	Ali to je jedini razlog.
If not, don't.	Ako ne, nemoj.
More than you should.	Više nego što bi trebao.
Not yet, but soon.	Ne još, ali uskoro.
We know even better.	Još bolje znamo.
She told him everything.	Rekla mu je sve.
The code for that would be here.	Kod za to bi bio ovdje.
None of us has anything to say.	Niko od nas nema šta da kaže.
It's so obvious.	To je tako očigledno.
Things may not work.	Stvari možda neće raditi.
I won't help you in any way	Ni na koji način ti neću pomoći
I just didn’t know how to pray better	Jednostavno nisam znao kako da se bolje molim
He said, you can only do what you can.	Rekao je, možete učiniti samo ono što možete.
I love you so much	Toliko te volim
This should have been done.	Trebalo je ovo uraditi.
I'm sure it is.	Siguran sam da jeste.
That was not what he expected.	To nije bilo ono što je očekivao.
I didn't know about that	Nisam znao za to
Now I do more than that	Sada radim više od toga
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
And you have it.	I imaš ga.
You must know something.	Sigurno znaš nešto.
I prefer to do things for myself	Više volim da radim stvari za sebe
But he was.	Ali bio je.
I couldn't have said it better myself	Ni sam to ne bih mogao bolje reći
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
I was completely and completely alone	Bio sam potpuno i potpuno sam
I wondered what he was playing.	Pitao sam se na šta igra.
I knew she saw it too	Znao sam da i ona to vidi
He wasn't ready.	Nije bio spreman.
I don't work for you.	Ne radim za tebe.
I always thought you were too	Uvek sam mislio da si i ti
I know you're there	Znam da si tamo
It can't be real.	Ne može biti stvarno.
And soon there is.	I uskoro postoji.
That's what you need.	To je ono što ti treba.
I can do it now	Mogu to da uradim i sada
It still is.	Još uvijek je.
But nothing was a problem.	Ali ništa nije bilo problem.
Maybe she can help you.	Možda ti ona može pomoći.
It's always like that.	Tako je uvek.
This has never happened to me before.	To mi se nikada ranije nije dogodilo.
I have nothing bad to say.	Nemam ništa loše da kažem.
I can never go back with him	Nikada se ne mogu vratiti s njim
So people can help.	Tako da ljudi mogu pomoći.
He didn't know how it could have been, but he did.	Kako je to moglo biti, nije znao, ali jeste.
He still doesn't know what you look like.	On još ne zna kako izgledaš.
It has to be like that with everyone.	Tako mora biti sa svima.
and I'm still not going.	a ja i dalje ne idem.
I need it tonight	Trebalo bi mi večeras
Yes, there.	Da i tamo.
It could have been very bad.	To je moglo biti jako loše.
I've never done anything like that	Nikad nisam uradio tako nešto
I have to tell myself it is	Moram sebi reći da jeste
They need to be told.	Treba ih reći.
I heard no more.	Nisam čuo više.
I have to be able to trust you	Moram ti moći vjerovati
That's very bad.	To je jako loše.
I wouldn't ask that of you.	Ne bih to tražio od tebe.
We already knew everything.	Već smo sve znali.
This is very easy to do.	To je vrlo lako uraditi.
I didn't want to see him	Nisam htela da ga vidim
I doubt you never did	Sumnjam da nikad nisi
But little is known yet.	Ali još malo se zna.
I knew he didn't think of me	Znala sam da ne misli na mene
I probably would	Vjerovatno bih
I just can't do it	Ja to jednostavno ne mogu
And he wanted to see her again.	I želio je ponovo da je vidi.
He had help, that's for sure.	Imao je pomoć, to je sigurno.
He was for a while.	Bio je neko vrijeme.
A lot can happen in three months	Mnogo toga se može dogoditi za tri mjeseca
When she.	Kada ona.
We know this can be done.	Znamo da se ovo može uraditi.
We did everything.	Uradili smo sve.
I can't be afraid of that	Ne mogu da se bojim toga
I knew that much earlier	Znao sam to mnogo ranije
I have it now	Imam ga sada
I wondered what was wrong	Pitao sam se šta nije u redu
He is not.	On nije.
I wish you could stay with us	Volio bih da si mogao ostati s nama
He did bad things.	Uradio je loše stvari.
It looks right now.	Sada izgleda kako treba.
I didn't know what to think anymore	Nisam više znao šta da mislim
Why now that we can tomorrow.	Zašto to sada kada možemo sutra.
I was tired of it.	Bio sam umoran od toga.
He was my father.	On je bio moj otac.
I did it for you too	Uradio sam to i za tebe
This is not true either.	Ni ovo nije istina.
And not only that.	I ne samo to.
You have to believe in yourself.	Morate vjerovati u sebe.
Or for a car.	Ili za auto.
I can't tell you what it will be	Ne mogu vam reći šta će to biti
For now, he knew he loved her.	Za sada je znao da je voli.
Everything will be good.	Sve će biti dobro.
This was too much for him.	Ovo je bilo previše za njega.
I hope you come back soon	Nadam se da ćeš se uskoro vratiti
I looked for her, but I couldn't find her	Tražio sam je, ali nisam mogao naći
I wonder what he was doing here	Pitam se šta je radio ovde
I think it goes on	Mislim da ide dalje
I didn't have to know	Nisam morao da znam
So simple.	Tako jednostavno.
But that could not have happened.	Ali to se nije moglo dogoditi.
These are just a few.	To je samo nekoliko.
I couldn't for a long time	Nisam mogao još dugo
What works for me, works for me.	Ono što radi za mene, radi i za mene.
A lot of time actually	Mnogo vremena zapravo
I decided to do this	Odlučio sam da uradim ovo
But maybe he can do more.	Ali možda može više.
I didn't ask for anything	Nisam ništa tražio
I will never tell anyone.	Nikad nikome neću reći.
It may never happen.	Možda se to nikada neće dogoditi.
It seems to work.	Čini se da radi.
Which is more than we can say.	Što je više nego što možemo reći.
I know that, and so did he	Ja to znam, a znao je i on
I won't say anything more	Neću reći ništa više
I suppose .	Pretpostavljam .
He liked to say that it was so.	Voleo je da kaže da je tako.
He worked so hard that no one knows.	Toliko je radio da niko ne zna.
I guess he saw them	Pretpostavljam da ih je vidio
This is probably not what you want.	Ovo vjerovatno nije ono što želite.
Now I know what to do	Sada znam šta da radim
I wouldn’t be good there, he said.	Ne bih bio dobar tamo, rekao je.
Not a little.	Ni malo.
I just wanted to know	Samo sam htela da znam
I have something you want	Imam nešto što želiš
I lost my job.	Izgubio sam posao.
I shouldn't have come back for you	Nisam se trebao vratiti po tebe
I just did that	Upravo sam to napravio
It's just that it's not.	Samo što nije.
He said he would get it and come back.	Rekao je da će ga dobiti i vratiti se.
I've never heard of this before.	Nikada ranije nisam čuo za ovo.
I really wanted to buy it	Zaista sam to htio kupiti
I can't do anything wrong	Ne mogu da uradim ništa loše
I like .	Sviđa mi se .
I saw and heard everything	Sve sam vidio i čuo
I should talk.	Trebao bih razgovarati.
You didn't want any of that.	Nisi želeo ništa od toga.
I'll be leaving soon	Uskoro ću otići
You didn't give anything.	Ništa nisi dao.
Right now it's you.	Trenutno si to ti.
Simple.	Jednostavno.
I just need to see her	Samo treba da je vidim
Where to find you.	Gdje te naći.
I do it for myself.	Ja to radim za sebe.
I'm not sure what's next.	Nisam baš siguran šta dalje.
You don't know anything yet.	Još ne znaš ništa.
I wasn't even home.	Nisam čak ni bio kod kuće.
About anything, really.	O bilo čemu, zaista.
Which is true.	Što je tačno.
He doesn't think anything.	Ne misli ništa.
Now it really is.	Sada zaista jeste.
But we never will.	Ali nikada nećemo.
Yes, we know more than we told you.	Da, znamo više nego što smo vam rekli.
I didn't want anything to do with it.	Nisam htio ništa s tim.
The code is good when it works and we can work with it.	Kod je dobar kada radi i možemo raditi s njim.
It looks a little difficult.	Izgleda malo teško.
I started right away.	Počeo sam odmah.
I didn’t expect that to happen	Nisam očekivao da će se to dogoditi
He is now.	On je sada.
I never thought it would happen this way	Nikad nisam mislio da će se to dogoditi na ovaj način
He is right.	On je u pravu.
He would be all we need.	On bi bio sve što nam treba.
He is with me.	On je sa mnom.
I can not see anything.	Ne vidim ništa.
She's been gone a long time.	Dugo je nema.
He was my idea.	On je bio moja ideja.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
I knew something was wrong	Znao sam da nešto nije u redu
I'm so glad you came home	Tako mi je drago što si došao kući
That actually says something.	To zapravo nešto govori.
I just want to make sure that's what it is	Samo želim da budem siguran da je to ono što jeste
I have to go even further.	Moram ići još dalje.
He had to help himself.	Morao je sam sebi pomoći.
These are not real people.	To nisu pravi ljudi.
Something is really wrong.	Nešto zaista nije u redu.
In fact, that is not true.	Zapravo, to nije istina.
As you could get.	Kao što ste mogli dobiti.
I do not know what to say	Ne znam šta da kažem
I couldn't see them.	Nisam ih mogao vidjeti.
I had it with that	Imao sam ga sa tim
It works well.	To radi dobro.
Really, just a little.	Zaista, samo malo.
Good thing.	Dobra stvar.
I never knew why.	Nikad nisam znao zašto.
He did not return.	Nije se vratio.
But it does nothing.	Ali to ne čini ništa.
We should now.	Sada bi trebali.
I'm going a little	Idem po malo
Who knows what will happen.	Ko zna šta će se dogoditi.
Not with you.	Ne sa tobom.
At the time it happened.	U vrijeme kada se to dogodilo.
I really should have gotten this.	Stvarno sam trebao ovo dobiti.
He wants to see you, and you're here.	On želi da te vidi, a ti si ovde.
It looks good now.	Sada izgleda dobro.
It works pretty well.	Radi prilično dobro.
I knew exactly where we were	Tačno sam znao gdje smo
I do not know what to do	Ne znam šta da radim
I knew they were right	Znao sam da su u pravu
No problem with that.	Nema problema sa tim.
In my way.	Na moj način.
He plans to leave soon.	Planira da ode uskoro.
Yes and me.	Da, i ja.
I saw it too.	I ja sam to vidio.
I still don't know.	I dalje ne znam.
I don't want to know anything	Ne želim da znam ništa
Maybe never.	Možda nikada neće.
I can be your friend	Mogu biti tvoj prijatelj
But he still knows who he is.	Ali on i dalje zna ko je on.
I asked you so we could talk	Tražio sam te da možemo razgovarati
I couldn’t trust anyone, not even myself	Nisam mogao vjerovati nikome, čak ni sebi
You know how to be alone.	Znaš kako biti sam.
That is what we will continue to work on.	To je ono na čemu ćemo dalje raditi.
I really like it here	Zaista mi se sviđa ovdje
You know you can do it.	Znaš da to možeš.
I want it to be good	Želim da bude dobro
There are so many of them.	Toliko ih je.
But we know more.	Ali znamo više.
They were all just people.	Svi su bili samo ljudi.
Not everyone is like you.	Nisu svi kao ti.
I know how hard it was for you today	Znam kako ti je danas bilo teško
That's what they should have believed.	To je ono u šta su trebali vjerovati.
I tried to reach you	Pokušao sam doći do tebe
What do you know, you know.	Šta znaš, znaš.
I couldn't see much, but it was enough	Nisam mogao mnogo da vidim, ali bilo je dovoljno
I was nothing more than that	Nisam bio ništa više od toga
I pray for everyone here	Molim se za sve ovdje
Maybe I didn't do it	Možda to nisam uradio
But that's not really it.	Ali to zapravo nije to.
That's the way she said it.	To je način na koji je to rekla.
I have to go there	Moram ići tamo
Maybe you are, but maybe you are not.	Možda jesi, ali možda nisi.
There was nothing wrong.	Nije bilo ništa loše.
Mine is not so bad.	Moj nije tako loš.
But we never do that.	Ali mi to nikada ne radimo.
But he says he won't come.	Ali on kaže da neće doći.
But they are there for us.	Ali oni su tu za nas.
We're not sure what that is.	Nismo sigurni šta je to.
I did some of that for you.	Uradio sam nešto od toga za tebe.
That is hope.	To je nada.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
I should have trusted you	Trebao sam ti vjerovati
I couldn't do this	Nisam mogao ovo da uradim
Today is not your day.	Danas nije tvoj dan.
There is nothing anyone can do here to help you.	Ovdje niko ništa ne može učiniti da vam pomogne.
I guess you'll know soon enough	Pretpostavljam da ćeš uskoro znati
Now she knew why.	Sada je znala zašto.
I would have no idea	Ne bih imao pojma
I doubt anyone else heard that besides me	Sumnjam da je to još neko čuo osim mene
In a good way.	Na dobar način.
It was nothing like what we have today.	Nije bilo ništa kao što imamo danas.
It was just this.	Bilo je samo ovo.
I mean, really okay	Mislim, stvarno u redu
I knew better than that	Znao sam bolje od toga
I don't have a job anymore	Više nemam posao
I want to make sure you get home safely	Želim biti siguran da ćeš se sigurno vratiti kući
I've never done that	Nikad to nisam radio
Nothing came of it.	Ništa nije bilo od toga.
She wouldn't know.	Ona ne bi znala.
Yes.	Da.
It's just fast.	Jednostavno je brzo.
I hope so.	Nadam se.
Much or nothing is bad.	Mnogo ili ništa je loše.
You should know who these people are.	Trebao bi znati ko su ti ljudi.
I think she's someone everyone should know.	Mislim da je ona neko koga bi svi trebali znati.
Either for better or for worse.	Bilo na dobro ili loše.
I didn't want to see her again.	Nisam je želio ponovo vidjeti.
Looks like it could be.	Izgleda da bi moglo biti.
I tell him we can meet again tomorrow	Kažem mu da se možemo ponovo naći sutra
I hope he didn't see me	Nadam se da me nije video
It was me and not me.	Bio sam ja a ne ja.
He saw beyond years.	Vidio je dalje od godina.
I can't return them.	Ne mogu ih vratiti.
Do with it as you wish.	Radite s tim kako želite.
I had nothing and no one but you	Nisam imao ništa i nikoga osim tebe
Not only that.	Ne samo da je.
I would very much like to see that	Veoma bih voleo da to vidim
I see how it works	Vidim kako radi
It seemed to work.	Činilo se da radi.
He knows they are there.	On zna da su tamo.
She just didn't know who he was.	Samo nije znala ko je on.
Not a single one.	Ni jedan jedini.
It's not, and it's not.	Nije, i nije.
That should tell us something.	To bi nam trebalo nešto reći.
They didn't do this.	Ovo nisu uradili.
He will do it.	On će to uraditi.
We really were.	Zaista smo bili.
I mean, there was a lot of that.	Mislim, bilo je puno toga.
So it was very difficult to find a job.	Tako da je bilo jako teško naći posao.
We know he is a good person.	Znamo da je on dobra osoba.
That's it, you think.	To je to, mislite.
I didn't even see her	Nisam je ni vidio
Like my father.	Kao i moj otac.
I can't do it alone	Ne mogu to sama
I didn't give it to him	Nisam mu dao
I was so happy to be back in it	Bio sam tako sretan što sam se vratio u to
I will be my own	Ja ću biti svoj
Tell us what you think.	Reci nam šta misliš.
I was glad it wasn't going	Bilo mi je drago što ne ide
That's long enough.	To je dovoljno dugo.
I couldn't be here long	Nisam mogao biti ovdje dugo
It's more than money.	Radi se o više od novca.
And she sees it.	I ona to vidi.
I need help here.	Treba mi pomoć ovdje.
I had almost no money or time	Skoro da nisam imao novca ni vremena
It really can and often is.	Zaista može i često jeste.
He came right away.	Došao je odmah.
All this is small.	Sve ovo je malo.
I'm not usually home.	Obično nisam kod kuće.
I guess they're together	Pretpostavljam da su zajedno
I didn't think it would be a problem	Nisam mislio da će to biti problem
I shouldn't have come.	Nisam trebao doći.
Don't do them.	Ne radi ih.
I wondered if we could	Pitao sam se da li bismo mogli
I don't know how to get to him.	Ne znam kako doći do njega.
He knows where you are.	Zna gdje si.
You are safe.	Vi ste sigurni.
Maybe not.	Možda i neće.
I really see.	Zaista vidim.
That was him.	To je bio on.
They knew what needed to be done, what needed to be done.	Znali su šta treba da se uradi, šta je trebalo da se uradi.
I've heard it many times	Čuo sam to mnogo puta
You don't know what to do next.	Ne znate šta dalje.
I don't need to be trusted	Ne treba mi vjerovati
Very, very bad.	Veoma, veoma loše.
I didn’t think that could happen	Nisam mislio da se to može dogoditi
I couldn't see what he was doing	Nisam mogao da vidim šta radi
I love you all, but we do	Volim vas sve, ali mi
I am going home.	Idem kući.
And don't try to do what you do.	I ne pokušava da radi ono što ti radiš.
I like it a lot.	Mnogo mi se sviđa.
I think he wants that.	Mislim da on to želi.
I know what you mean.	Znam šta misliš.
And they are people.	I oni su ljudi.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
And he could very well.	I vrlo dobro je mogao.
I just made this code for you.	Upravo sam napravio ovaj kod za tebe.
I should have trusted you enough to tell you everything	Trebao sam ti dovoljno vjerovati da ti sve kažem
I can talk to him about anything	S njim mogu razgovarati o bilo čemu
I can't stay here anymore.	Ne mogu više ostati ovdje.
He didn't tell me.	Nije mi rekao.
I wish my father was here	Voleo bih da je moj otac ovde
Anyone would tell you that.	Bilo ko bi ti to rekao.
I understood the question	Shvatio sam pitanje
You shouldn't have given this.	Nije ti trebalo ovo dati.
Nobody did that anymore.	To više niko nije radio.
I just needed time for myself	Samo mi je trebalo vremena za sebe
He would lose everything.	Izgubio bi sve.
Probably them too.	Vjerovatno i oni.
In fact, I really like it	U stvari mi se jako sviđa
And we know what is good and what is not.	I znamo šta je dobro, a šta nije.
Not so today.	Nije tako, danas.
I'm not sure how you could have done that.	Nisam siguran kako si to mogao uraditi.
We just don't know.	Mi jednostavno ne znamo.
No.	Nema.
I thought it was years	Mislio sam da su godine
What happened today should not have happened.	Ono što se danas dogodilo nije se trebalo dogoditi.
It's like he's doing everything right.	Kao da to čini sve u redu.
It doesn't look like that now.	Sada ne izgleda tako.
He didn't tell me anything.	Nije mi ništa rekao.
Everyone should.	Svi bi trebali.
I was soon ready to go home	Uskoro sam bio spreman da idem kući
I guess he's thinking of me	Pretpostavljam da misli na mene
This was last week.	Ovo je bilo prošle sedmice.
But he does something more.	Ali radi nešto više.
There was very little time.	Bilo je vrlo malo vremena.
I didn't know what to do anymore	Nisam više znao šta da radim
A lot of that.	Mnogo toga.
I really lost my job	Zaista sam izgubio posao
I have to go get it	Moram da idem po to
You know how it is.	Znaš kako je to.
I'll tell you when the time comes	Reći ću ti kad dođe vrijeme
That's it.	To je to.
I have to find him and tell him	Moram ga naći i reći mu
She never does that.	Ona to nikad ne čini.
I knew he had to tell me that	Znao sam da mi to mora reći
That really happened.	To se zaista dogodilo.
They are hard to find.	Teško ih je naći.
I have no idea	Nemam pojma
He didn't do anything, really.	Ništa nije uradio, zaista.
It certainly wasn't always like that.	To sigurno nije uvijek bilo tako.
I'll do it.	Ja ću to raditi.
He didn't tell me anything.	Ništa mi nije rekao.
I should have known this was going to happen	Trebao sam znati da će se ovo dogoditi
I came back to work alone	Vratio sam se da radim sam
You have to stay where you are.	Morate ostati gdje jeste.
Not now.	Sada neće.
I wasn't sure who it was	Nisam bio siguran ko je to bio
I knew you would come back to us and you did	Znao sam da ćeš nam se vratiti i jesi
I would know it existed	Znao bih da postoji
I've never seen her before	Nikada je ranije nisam video
I have no idea why he thinks that	Nemam pojma zašto to misli
Nothing really happened there.	Tamo se zaista ništa nije dogodilo.
All he asked for was money.	Sve što je tražio je novac.
Which would be.	Što bi bilo.
I think he's right.	Mislim da je u pravu.
I had no problem with that.	Nisam imao problema sa tim.
Everything is easy to do.	Sve je lako uraditi.
So there is.	Tako da postoji.
Unless it's just me.	Osim ako nisam samo ja.
I'm as tired as you are now	I ja sam sada veoma umoran kao i ti
Sam goes first.	Sam ide prvi.
I wondered why.	Pitao sam se zašto.
He knows exactly what He has given us.	On tačno zna šta nam je dao.
This was a good idea.	Ovo je bila dobra ideja.
I figured that would be a really good story	Shvatio sam da bi to zaista bila dobra priča
I want to tell you something.	Želim nešto da ti kažem.
Which shouldn’t be too hard.	Što ne bi trebalo biti previše teško.
He could tell she knew it wasn't going to happen.	Mogao je reći da je znala da se to neće dogoditi.
It's just a good job.	To je samo dobar posao.
More and more.	Sve više i više.
I'm certainly not there yet.	Sigurno još nisam tamo.
I can't be your friend now either.	Sada ne mogu biti ni tvoj prijatelj.
He saw something.	Video je nešto.
He was always good.	Uvek je bio dobro.
He wants to work on himself a lot.	Želi mnogo da radi na sebi.
I can't be.	Ne mogu biti.
And that was it.	I to je bilo to.
I know how it is.	Znam kako je.
He did what he had to do.	Uradio je ono što je morao.
I have no idea what he's talking about	Nemam pojma o čemu priča
It can't be that way.	To ne može biti tako.
I can't be sure which one	Ne mogu biti siguran koji
I never had it	Nikad je nisam imao
It was a new life.	Bio je to novi život.
I know you did your best	Znam da si dao sve od sebe
What could happen tomorrow.	Što bi se moglo dogoditi sutra.
I doubt this is true	Sumnjam da je ovo istina
Hard isn't it.	Teško zar ne.
I was happy to hear that	Bio sam sretan što sam to čuo
It's just too much.	Jednostavno ga je previše.
I can't pray anymore	Ne mogu više da se molim
I didn't even know why	Nisam ni znao zašto
I was ready for anything	Bio sam spreman na sve
I won't go any further.	Neću dalje.
But that’s not all we do.	Ali to nije sve što radimo.
I have no idea if it was or not.	Nemam pojma da li je bilo ili nije.
I saw he was home.	Vidio sam da je kod kuće.
Just an idea.	Samo ideja.
I'm afraid he won't be the only one	Bojim se da neće biti jedini
But a few days.	Ali nekoliko dana.
He doesn't like them.	On ih ne voli.
Very good day.	Vrlo dobar dan.
I didn't know if he ever came	Nisam znao da li je ikada došao
He was happy to do that.	Bio je sretan što je to radio.
We didn't know either.	Ni sami nismo znali.
Probably not a good thing.	Verovatno nije dobra stvar.
The car was right.	Auto je bio u pravu.
I don't need a reason.	Ne treba mi razlog.
Maybe more than that.	Možda i više od toga.
As it was.	Kao što je bilo.
I know that pretty well	Znam to prilično dobro
But he will.	Ali hoće.
He was alone now.	Sada je bio sam.
I mean, he said that.	Mislim, on je to rekao.
I said, no, no more.	Rekao sam, ne, ne više.
I did everything she told me	Uradio sam sve što mi je rekla
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
He wondered if this was as bad as it was going to be.	Pitao se da li je ovo toliko loše koliko će biti.
I have to get to him	Moram do njega
He must have meant it.	Sigurno je to mislio.
I arrived earlier.	Stigao sam ranije.
I'd just like him to leave	Samo bih volio da ode
I can't do anything better than that	Ne mogu ništa bolje od toga
I saw it.	Vidio sam to.
I am very sorry, but that is what needs to be done now.	Jako mi je žao, ali to je ono što sada treba učiniti.
I wasn't even sure why	Nisam ni bio siguran zašto
I did things my way	Radio sam stvari na svoj način
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam uradio ništa loše
I never wanted anything more.	Nikad nisam htela ništa više.
They said it wouldn't help.	Rekli su da to neće pomoći.
Time is short.	Vremena je malo.
How good it is to be human.	Kako je dobro biti čovjek.
You saw me do it.	Video si me kako to radim.
I wish you were here	volio bih da si ovdje
I don't know what's next	Ne znam šta dalje
I don't know if he knew this.	Ne znam da li je znao ovo.
But that is hardly a problem.	Ali teško da je to problem.
I need something more than that.	Treba mi nešto više od toga.
I had someone who did all these things	Imao sam nekoga ko je radio sve ove stvari
I wasn't.	Nisam bio.
I didn't know what he was talking about.	Nisam znao o čemu priča.
Let people know who we are and what we are.	Da ljudi znaju ko smo i šta smo.
It was obvious that she was not a very good person.	Bilo je očigledno da ona nije baš dobra osoba.
I told him everything.	Rekao sam mu sve.
It all took time.	Za sve je trebalo vremena.
I can't do this anymore.	Ne mogu ovo više.
I should have before	Trebao sam prije
But that time is not now.	Ali to vrijeme nije sada.
But we needed money.	Ali trebao nam je novac.
It just took me a little longer	Samo mi je trebalo malo više vremena
Maybe I'll go home	Možda ću otići kući
They had a job.	Imali su posao.
I actually figured that out myself	To sam zapravo i sam shvatio
He told me that, several times.	Rekao mi je to, više puta.
I've never heard of it	Nikad nisam čuo za to
I couldn't even see anything	Nisam ni mogao ništa da vidim
I was happy with him	Bio sam sretan s njim
Maybe that's how it should be.	Možda bi tako trebalo biti.
Which is not.	Što nije.
It works from now on.	Od sada radi.
It must have been a few years ago.	Mora da je bilo prije nekoliko godina.
I tried it myself, many times	Pokušao sam i sam, mnogo puta
I wanted what he wanted	Želeo sam šta je on želeo
My father had a car.	Moj otac je imao auto.
I didn’t expect everyone to already know about it	Nisam očekivao da svi već znaju za to
I didn't expect it.	Nisam očekivao.
But they don't know.	Ali oni ne znaju.
We still have it.	Još ga imamo.
Not so bad.	Nije tako loše.
That's what he said too.	Tako je i on to rekao.
It's that, but it's more.	To je to, ali je i više.
We were always together.	Uvek smo bili zajedno.
None of that is happening here	Ništa od toga se ovde ne dešava
I wouldn't even know what it was like	Ne bih ni znao kako je to
I really need help.	Stvarno mi treba pomoć.
I didn't mean to see you again	Nisam mislio da te ponovo vidim
What to do with it.	Šta učiniti s tim.
They are alive.	Oni su živi.
I should have stayed	Trebao sam ostati
I have no one to love me	Nemam ko da me voli
I have no idea where they are and whether they are	Nemam pojma gdje su i da li su
And not only yourself.	I ne samo sebe.
But this is real life.	Ali ovo je pravi život.
But he still says we have to go back.	Ali on i dalje govori da se moramo vratiti.
This is where another one helps me from time to time.	Tu mi s vremena na vrijeme pomogne još jedan.
That's what he thought.	To je i mislio.
And you know it.	I ti to znaš.
I knew that at the time	Znao sam to u to vrijeme
I'm totally with you	Potpuno sam sa tobom
I had no idea what to do	Nisam imao pojma šta da radim
That is not the case here or there at the moment.	Toga trenutno nema ni ovdje ni tamo.
That won't help.	To neće pomoći.
I've done a lot myself	Dosta sam toga uradio sam
I've never done that before.	Nikada to ranije nisam radio.
And it still works.	I još uvijek radi.
I can't believe it's you	Ne mogu vjerovati da si to ti
She wasn't even there.	Nije ni bila tamo.
I can't say why that is	Ne mogu reći zašto je to tako
It must be so.	Mora da je tako.
Never really.	Nikad zaista.
I knew right away what it was	Odmah sam znao šta je to
But it won't.	Ali neće.
There is no way to know.	Ne postoji način da se zna.
I just know that's not true.	Znam samo da to nije istina.
I couldn't let him do that	Nisam mu to mogao dozvoliti
I would hear that it is	Čuo bih za to da jeste
Lots of things you don't do.	Mnogo stvari koje ne radite.
I can't believe you did this	Ne mogu vjerovati da si ovo uradio
I mean, you're a man	Mislim ti si čovjek
I've done it so many times before	Radio sam to toliko puta ranije
They were there last night.	Bili su tamo sinoć.
She was fine on her own.	Bila je dobro sama.
That would take time.	Za to bi trebalo vremena.
I never knew about this	Nikad nisam znao za ovo
I would tell you so	Rekao bih ti tako
No, not at all.	Ne, ni malo.
She wants to help him, even to love him.	Ona želi da mu pomogne, čak i da ga voli.
This is wrong, that is wrong.	Ovo nije u redu, to nije u redu.
He is not the only one.	Nije jedini.
You were fine.	Bio si dobro.
Not as bad as it looks.	Nije tako loše kao što izgleda.
I couldn't go.	Nisam mogao da idem.
And there is so much to talk about.	I ima toliko toga da se priča.
I thought you saw that	Mislio sam da si to vidio
Like we said, there's nothing wrong with that.	Kao što smo rekli, u tome nema ništa loše.
He had no idea what this man knew.	Nije imao pojma šta ovaj čovjek zna.
You know that's not true.	Znate da to nije istina.
I'm so happy to have you	Tako sam sretan što te imam
That was me.	To sam bio ja.
In fact, like you	U stvari, kao ti
I hope not.	Nadam se da ne.
You can't be.	Ne možeš biti.
I have no idea	Nemam pojma
I tried to tell you that	Pokušao sam da ti to kažem
He left.	Otišao je.
I did my job.	Uradio sam svoj posao.
Maybe he's fine.	Možda je on dobro.
I'm not sure it works at all.	Nisam siguran da to uopšte radi.
One more day.	Još jedan dan.
It was always easy.	To je uvek bilo lako.
I guess nothing more needs to be said	Pretpostavljam da ništa više ne treba reći
He is my life.	On je moj život.
I didn't start working with you for the money	Nisam počeo da radim sa tobom zbog novca
But that is not happening.	Ali to se ne dešava.
I can't come to see you today	Ne mogu doći da te vidim danas
I think we should stay here if we can	Mislim da bismo trebali ostati ovdje ako možemo
All right! 	U redu!
I want to see what he can do	Želim da vidim šta može da uradi
I always thought it was just me	Uvek sam mislio da sam samo ja
I was always happy, always	Uvijek sam bio sretan, uvijek
That's what I do.	To je ono što ja radim.
I have no idea about that	Nemam pojma o tome
You had nothing.	Nisi imao ništa.
I must have been the only one	Mora da sam bio jedini
I know this is hard for you	Znam da ti je ovo teško
This is going very fast.	Ovo ide jako brzo.
But he never came home.	Ali nikada nije došao kući.
But this may not be true.	Ali ovo ne može biti tačno.
This is not the first time.	Ovo nije prvi put.
I wondered if he was telling the truth at all	Pitao sam se da li uopšte govori istinu
I can not believe	Ne mogu vjerovati
I guess we all did a little	Pretpostavljam da smo svi uradili malo
I don't want to do it again.	Ne želim to da radim ponovo.
He knew exactly what he had done.	Tačno je znao šta je uradio.
Probably lost.	Verovatno se izgubio.
I like what she's doing here	Sviđa mi se šta ona radi ovde
But this is me.	Ali ovo sam ja.
I didn't mean to say that	Nisam mislio to reći
I won't help you if that's what you want	Neću ti pomoći ako je to ono što želiš
I can not anymore	Ne mogu više
I think you need someone to want you	Mislim da ti treba neko da te želi
I wonder who it is.	Pitam se koji je to.
I shouldn't have gone with him	Nisam trebao ići s njim
I can tell you that here	To vam mogu reći ovdje
No one can really help.	Niko zaista ne može pomoći.
I want it again.	Želim to ponovo.
I have no help, nothing	Nemam pomoći, ništa
He had time for everything.	Imao je vremena za sve.
I don't know what they are	Ne znam šta su
Why it doesn't work.	Zašto ne radi.
It was never me.	Nikad nisam bio ja.
And it's easy.	I to je lako.
He has it.	Ima ga.
I told you all this before	Rekao sam ti sve ovo ranije
He had a new life.	Imao je novi život.
I didn't expect this.	Nisam ovo očekivao.
Maybe it's you.	Možda si ti.
I know she loves me too	Znam da i ona mene voli
I can't see beyond that yet	Ne mogu još da vidim dalje od toga
I would know her anywhere	Znao bih je bilo gdje
I said it was okay with me.	Rekao sam da mi je to u redu.
I just wasn't sure what to do with it yet	Samo još nisam bio siguran šta da radim s tim
please.	molim te.
I want to know.	Želim da znam.
I've done that many times	To sam radio više puta
It was no longer okay.	Više nije bilo u redu.
He won't tell me the reason.	Neće mi reći razlog.
I can't do this without you	Ne mogu ovo bez tebe
If you knew, you couldn't.	Da si znao, ne bi mogao.
I always did a good job	Uvijek sam dobro radio posao
They couldn't tell me anything about it.	Nisu mi mogli reći ništa o tome.
We'll tell him together.	Reći ćemo mu zajedno.
Sure here and there.	Sigurno tu i tamo.
But it never is.	Ali nikad nije.
I know more things.	Znam više stvari.
I know you wanted to do me no harm.	Znam da si mi htio učiniti ništa loše.
Must be.	Mora biti.
There is so much we can see.	Toliko toga možemo vidjeti.
Nobody saw you.	Niko te nije video.
Maybe he's right.	Možda je u pravu.
I knew he would give it back to me	Znao sam da će mi vratiti
I really just couldn't have done it without the help.	Zaista jednostavno ne bih mogao bez pomoći.
This works exactly as it should.	Ovo radi tačno kako treba.
She knew where he was.	Znala je gdje je.
I heard you last night.	Čuo sam te sinoć.
Not much, really.	Nema puno toga, zaista.
I didn't do this for you	Nisam ovo uradio za tebe
I really have no idea why it works	Zaista nemam pojma zašto to radi
I didn't know he was waiting for me there	Nisam znala da me čeka tamo
He went home.	Otišao je kući.
Nobody loves him.	Niko ga ne voli.
I couldn't help myself either	Nisam mogao ni sebi pomoći
I know what's wrong with him	Znam šta nije u redu s njim
You can tell right away.	Možete reći odmah.
I'm not with anyone.	Nisam ni sa kim.
But no more than that.	Ali ne više od toga.
Nobody has heard that yet.	To još niko nije čuo.
Surely he could have done better.	Sigurno bi mogao bolje.
I could do anything, go anywhere	Mogao sam sve, ići bilo gdje
They could do anything.	Mogli su sve.
I see him for the first time	Vidim ga prvi put
It wasn't easy being with me	Nije bilo lako biti sa mnom
To this day, no one knows exactly why.	Do danas niko ne zna tačno zašto.
Which it really isn't.	Što zapravo nije.
I've never seen him.	Nikad ga nisam video.
That's enough for me.	To mi je dovoljno.
I should have gone with him.	Trebalo je da idem s njim.
This is a question of money.	Ovo je pitanje novca.
And they knew it.	I oni su to znali.
I don't think there's anything you can do.	Mislim da ne možete ništa da uradite.
You have me.	Imaš me.
I didn't expect you to do this	Nisam očekivao da ćeš ovo uraditi
I don't like this job.	Ne volim ovaj posao.
I think he could do that	Mislim da bi on to mogao
I say no.	Ja kažem da nije.
Either he loves me or he doesn't.	Ili me voli, ili ne voli.
This was not how it should be.	Ovo nije bilo kako bi trebalo biti.
I would never say that	Nikad to ne bih rekao
He always knew what he was wearing	Uvek je znao šta nosi
Three and three.	Tri i tri.
I will definitely be back	Sigurno ću se vratiti
In 30 years.	Za 30 godina.
I can't see them now	Ne mogu ih sada vidjeti
But she is.	Ali ona jeste.
I didn't need that.	Nije mi to trebalo.
I have nothing to do with it.	Ja nemam ništa s tim.
He is often here.	Često je ovdje.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu ide.
He hasn't been here in a while.	Već neko vrijeme nije bio ovdje.
This is not difficult.	Ovo nije teško.
I would do that	Ja bih to uradio
I want people to know they are not alone	Želim da ljudi znaju da nisu sami
We can't say.	Ne možemo reći.
I just want to know why	Samo želim da znam zašto
I suppose.	Pretpostavljam.
I couldn’t believe this was all real	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je sve ovo stvarno
You never asked me to.	Nikada mi to nisi tražio.
I didn't know how long.	Nisam znao koliko dugo.
I really wish I didn’t have to go tomorrow.	Zaista bih volio da ne moram da idem sutra.
I need to talk to him	Moram razgovarati s njim
Probably not, he decided.	Vjerovatno ne, odlučio je.
I'm happy for you.	Drago mi je zbog tebe.
I've never done that.	Nikad to nisam radio.
A few, but not too many	Nekoliko, ali ne previše
I know you mean it	Znam da to misliš
I did what anyone would	Uradio sam ono što bi bilo ko
He still has it.	Još uvek ga ima.
I didn't really want to know.	Nisam baš htela da znam.
I wanted you here for that	Želio sam te ovdje zbog toga
I asked to go with him.	Tražio sam da idem s njim.
I didn't do anything.	Nisam uradio ništa.
Maybe I haven't told you everything yet	Možda ti još nisam sve rekao
I know why he did it.	Znam zašto je to uradio.
Not good, but better.	Ne dobro, ali bolje.
I wasn't for him	Ja nisam bila za njega
We are here today just for you.	Danas smo ovdje samo za vas.
I've never seen that.	Nikad to nisam video.
I want to do this with him	Želim ovo da uradim sa njim
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
I was so happy to be home	Bio sam tako sretan što sam kod kuće
I would still be with him yes.	I dalje bi bila s njim da.
I asked you, and you said no	Pitao sam te, a ti si rekao ne
And we were a good team.	I bili smo dobar tim.
Not really mine.	Ne baš moj.
That's my story.	To je moja priča.
I made it three times last week.	Napravio sam ga tri puta prošle sedmice.
In fact, he still lives here.	U stvari, još uvijek živi ovdje.
I would say that to myself many times	Rekao bih to sebi više puta
I know what needs to be done	Znam šta treba da se uradi
There are so many of them.	Ima ih toliko.
And not much more.	I ne mnogo više.
I'm not sure how long.	Nisam siguran koliko dugo.
It's hard to say how many there were.	Teško je reći koliko ih je bilo.
I mean that and more than that	Mislim to i više od toga
Just not here.	Samo ne ovde.
Enough, enough, enough.	Dosta, dosta, dosta.
This was a few years ago.	Ovo je bilo prije nekoliko godina.
I haven't heard them before	Nisam ih ni čuo ranije
I love it so much	Toliko volim
But I just didn't know what to do	Ali jednostavno nisam znao šta da radim
Just like you.	Baš kao ti.
I hope he can be there	Nadam se da može biti tamo
I can't do this for you	Ne mogu to učiniti za tebe
He really was.	On je zaista bio.
I know something is wrong with him	Znam da mu nešto nije u redu
I'm just going for it.	Samo idem na to.
That was really good.	To je bilo stvarno dobro.
But that was not all.	Ali sve to nije bilo to.
All of them.	Svi oni.
No, you certainly didn't.	Ne, sigurno nisi.
If you want, we can talk.	Ako želiš, možemo razgovarati.
I can't believe this is happening to me	Ne mogu vjerovati da mi se ovo dešava
I think he's my father	Mislim da je on moj otac
I can't tell you how we know	Ne mogu vam reći kako znamo
I'm sure it was her	Siguran sam da je to bila ona
That's what I've wanted to say for a long time	To sam dugo želio reći
I'm doing what you're supposed to be doing	Radim ono što bi ti trebalo da radiš
I don't want that.	Ne želim to.
She didn't say anything bad.	Nije rekla ništa loše.
I don't know what you mean.	Ne znam na šta misliš.
Too much time.	Previše vremena.
I was looking for you	Tražio sam te
He doesn't know how to do them.	On ne zna kako da ih uradi.
I was better than him	Bio sam bolji od njega
He knows the real truth.	On zna pravu istinu.
We both work together.	Oboje radimo zajedno.
Something like.	Tako nešto.
We just said no.	Upravo smo rekli ne.
I think it is.	Mislim da je.
Now no one could reach him.	Sada niko nije mogao da dođe do njega.
He had never done that before.	Nikad to ranije nije uradio.
I hope you won't let me	Nadam se da nećeš dozvoliti
This is a good thing	Ovo je dobra stvar
I knew you would	Znao sam da bi
I knew immediately what had happened	Odmah sam znao šta se dogodilo
I love you and I'm sorry	Volim te i žao mi je
We've been here before.	Bili smo ovdje prije.
I never do anything	Nikada ne radim ništa
And he can do it right here	I on to može učiniti upravo ovdje
That time is here now.	To vrijeme je sada ovdje.
I never thought this could happen	Nikad nisam mislio da bi se ovo moglo dogoditi
I couldn't see him anymore	Više ga nisam mogao vidjeti
I really like this one too.	I ovaj mi se jako sviđa.
That's the only hope.	To je jedina nada.
We are here.	Tu smo.
I never thought that would happen	Nikad nisam mislio da će se to dogoditi
I do not know exactly.	Ne znam tačno.
I'm glad to be here.	Drago mi je što sam ovdje.
The reason for that was the person.	Razlog za to je bila osoba.
I didn't mean any of that	Nisam ništa mislio od toga
It's still hard to see.	I dalje ga je teško vidjeti.
I need that for me.	To mi treba za mene.
It was pretty obvious why.	Bilo je prilično očigledno zašto.
But it's okay.	Ali u redu je.
I think there is more	Mislim da ima još toga
But you can't.	Ali ne možeš.
I don't know who it is.	Ne znam ko je to.
No problem so far.	Nema problema do sada.
You can do it.	Možeš ti to.
And three.	I tri.
I love him as always	Volim ga kao i uvek
I heard it was really good, but hard.	Čuo sam da je bilo jako dobro, ali teško.
I only see him, he only sees me	Ja samo njega vidim, on samo mene
But he lost it.	Ali on ga je izgubio.
Is it really.	Da li je zaista.
I know you can do anything	Znam da možeš sve
It takes more than that.	Treba više od toga.
We just have to see.	Moramo samo vidjeti.
I would love to be.	Voleo bih da budem.
Several of us even drive them	Nekoliko nas ih čak i vozi
I've always wondered what you look like	Uvek sam se pitao kako izgledaš
It was too much.	Bilo je previše.
That was it for the day.	To je bilo to za taj dan.
Maybe today.	Možda danas.
It never is and never will be.	Nikad nije i nikada neće.
I'm sure it will be	Siguran sam da će biti
That was true.	To je bila istina.
He tried it.	On je to pokušao.
We need to know.	Moramo znati.
But life happens.	Ali, život se dešava.
And more than that.	I više od toga.
If anyone knew, they would know.	Da je neko znao, znao bi.
But he never told us anything.	Ali on nam nikad ništa nije rekao.
A lot of things happen to me, you know	Mnogo stvari mi se dešava, znaš
We don't know what will happen.	Ne znamo šta će se dogoditi.
It's just not there anymore.	Jednostavno ga više nema.
There's nothing there for you.	Tamo nema ništa za tebe.
Not a lot of people.	Nije puno ljudi.
I guess we have to	Pretpostavljam da moramo
I know very well.	Znam vrlo dobro.
And now that day has come.	I sada je došao taj dan.
I was glad she told me	Bilo mi je drago što mi je rekla
There is no one to see.	Nema nikoga da vidi.
Tell me now.	Reci mi sada.
We only had three.	Imali smo samo tri.
All right, he says.	U redu, kaže on.
It wasn't enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno.
I'm asking this.	Pitam ovo.
But he told me, no.	Ali on mi je rekao, ne.
If so, fine.	Ako jeste, u redu.
I need to see farther than before.	Moram vidjeti dalje nego prije.
A friend told me about this.	Prijatelj mi je rekao za ovo.
He was a man.	Bio je čovjek.
It's really that bad.	Zaista je tako loše.
I could for a while longer.	Mogao bih još neko vrijeme.
He doesn't do that.	On to ne radi.
I couldn't say that	Ne bih to mogao reći
Someone has to say them.	Neko ih mora reći.
They knew it.	Oni su to znali.
I wasn’t ready and she knew it	Nisam bio spreman i ona je to znala
I still haven't.	I dalje nisam.
I'd like to tell him that	Voleo bih da mu to kažem
Maybe I have something for you	Možda imam nešto za tebe
I couldn't believe it when he told me.	Nisam mogao vjerovati kad mi je rekao.
I could do that.	Ja bih to mogao.
I didn't know he was here.	Nisam znao da je ovde.
We had enough money.	Imali smo dovoljno novca.
I'm never tired of it	Nikada nisam umoran od toga
I should have known he was okay	Trebao sam da zna da je u redu
He doesn’t even have to talk to it.	Ne mora čak ni razgovarati s tim.
I just want to know what's going on	Samo želim da znam šta se dešava
Don't see him.	Ne vidi ga.
It was nothing to me	Nije mi bilo ništa
Tired of it.	Umoran od toga.
This is for me.	Ovo je za mene.
I never thought it would happen.	Nikad nisam mislio da će se dogoditi.
Not so much he talks, but what to do.	Ne toliko on priča, nego šta da radiš.
He didn't seem to be able to help himself.	Činilo se da si nije mogao pomoći.
I started to see things.	Počeo sam da vidim stvari.
I'm ready for anything	Spreman sam na sve
But what he wanted was someone who didn’t want him.	Ali ono što je želio je neko ko nije želio njega.
He was better.	Bio je bolji.
.	.
But it's not something you can't do at all.	Ali to uopšte nije nešto što ne možete učiniti.
But he must come too.	Ali i on mora doći.
He saw what needed to be done and he did it.	Video je šta treba da se uradi i uradio je to.
I've been there before as usual	Bio sam tamo ranije kao i obično
Now he could see the truth like any of us.	Sada je mogao da vidi istinu kao i bilo ko od nas.
You don't know what's out there.	Ne znaš šta je tamo.
And it was very bad.	I bilo je jako loše.
It takes time.	Za to treba vremena.
It could have happened anywhere.	Moglo se dogoditi bilo gdje.
You are safe now.	Sada ste sigurni.
I was here alone	Bio sam ovde sam
That's not it.	To nije to.
I know you have to get back to work	Znam da se moraš vratiti na posao
And that was still difficult.	A to je i dalje bilo teško.
I didn't really see it	Nisam stvarno vidio
He said it could be a problem.	Rekao je da bi to mogao biti problem.
That's not a problem now.	To sada nije problem.
That never happened.	To se nikada nije dogodilo.
I can give it to you now	Mogu ti ga dati sada
Maybe I should say something more about that	O tome bih, možda, trebao reći nešto više
I love you today more than ever before	Volim te danas više nego ikada prije
I should probably go back now	Verovatno bih se sada trebao vratiti
There are probably more, but maybe not many more.	Vjerovatno ih ima još, ali možda i ne mnogo više.
I always wondered what that could be.	Uvek sam se pitao šta bi to moglo biti.
This was very bad.	Ovo je bilo jako loše.
I didn't know any of that.	Nisam znao ništa od toga.
That was really it.	To je zaista bilo to.
It’s the only time it’s going to be that bad.	To je jedini put da će biti tako loš.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
I need to talk to him.	Moram razgovarati s njim.
My new life.	Moj novi život.
Yes, he needed that.	Da, to mu je trebalo.
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
I see you know something.	Vidim da znaš nešto.
We are not who we are.	Nismo to ko smo.
I already have a job	Već imam posao
Must be.	Mora biti.
I never go there.	Nikad ne idem tamo.
He's already back.	Već se vratio.
But you seem to be doing just that.	Ali izgleda da radite upravo to.
I loved life and all of you	Voleo sam život i sve vas
To know that he can do anything.	Da zna da može sve.
I know you were just doing your job	Znam da si samo radio svoj posao
I really wasn't sure	Zaista nisam bio siguran
To work.	Na posao.
But you know who they are.	Ali znate ko su oni.
I have to work here	Moram raditi ovdje
I've said everything there is to say.	Rekao sam sve što se može reći.
The thing with you.	Stvar sa tobom.
It just happened.	Upravo se dogodilo.
I know this is not all	Znam da ovo nije sve
I can't do everything for you	Ne mogu sve za tebe
Often not.	Često nije.
Maybe that was it.	Možda je to bilo to.
I thought that was it	Mislio sam da je to to
There is nothing to see here either.	Ni ovdje nema šta vidjeti.
But he left.	Ali on je otišao.
I like it when he says that	Sviđa mi se kad to kaže
And this is the problem.	I ovo je problem.
It's always been that way for me.	Za mene je uvek bilo tako.
I was there when it happened.	Bio sam tamo kada se to dogodilo.
He didn't do it.	On to nije uradio.
She must have been.	Mora da je bila.
You should be here.	Trebao bi biti ovdje.
This doesn't seem right.	Ovo ne izgleda tačno.
I would like to work together	Voleo bih da radimo zajedno
He hasn't done that in a long time.	On to nije radio dugo vremena.
I didn't think he was good enough.	Nisam mislio da je dovoljno dobar.
I won't be long	Neću dugo otići
I don't want to be here	Ne želim biti ovdje
She was nobody.	Ona je bila niko.
Is that right?	Je li tako?
I've seen and heard enough	Video sam i čuo dovoljno
I think he would be good.	Mislim da bi bio dobar.
I didn’t have much to say about it	Nisam imao puno toga da kažem o tome
Everyone should know this.	Ovo bi svi trebali znati.
I would go anywhere with you	Otišao bih bilo gdje s tobom
In fact, it happens a lot.	U stvari, to se dešava mnogo.
I heard he came last night	Čuo sam da je došao sinoć
Yes, for a long time.	Da, dosta dugo.
Maybe that will help.	Možda će to pomoći.
I had no idea.	Nisam imao pojma.
No one can stay here long.	Ovdje niko ne može dugo ostati.
I don't think so.	Ja tako ne mislim.
I ask him if he is better	Pitam ga da li mu je bolje
Tell me.	Reci mi.
I never thought of them.	Nikada ih nisam mislio.
I'm glad he was here.	Drago mi je da je bio ovde.
We can't do that.	To ne možemo učiniti.
That man must have been there.	Taj čovjek je sigurno bio tu.
I think you could say	Mislim da bi mogli reći
Maybe that's the reason.	Možda je to razlog.
There is not much to do.	Nema puno toga za raditi.
I didn’t think things were that bad	Nisam mislio da su stvari tako loše
I couldn't.	Ne bih mogao.
They are people.	Oni su ljudi.
So far, that’s pretty little.	Do sada je to prilično malo.
We can only do so much.	Možemo samo toliko.
i.	i.
It was hard for me to get to him again	Bilo mi je teško ponovo doći do njega
Is that.	Je li to.
I wonder what that was	Pitam se šta je to bilo
I saw it this morning	Video sam to jutros
He knew it wouldn't do him any good.	Znao je da od toga neće biti dobro.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
And he was there.	I on je bio tamo.
I want to tell you something	Želim da ti kažem nešto
I just hope no one comes	Samo se nadam da niko neće doći
It was good to bring him back.	Bilo je dobro vratiti ga.
And, yes, it is.	I, da, jeste.
I should have seen it was you.	Trebao sam da vidim da si to ti.
I could never see myself doing that	Nikad se nisam mogao vidjeti kako to radim
I was ready for that life	Bio sam spreman za taj život
Nobody knew anything.	Niko ništa nije znao.
You know it and I know it.	Ti to znaš i ja to znam.
I knew what it could be	Znao sam šta bi to moglo biti
I should never have told him that	Nikada mu to nisam trebao reći
If so, good and good.	Ako je tako, dobro i dobro.
I decided not to tell him anything at the moment	Odlučio sam da mu trenutno ništa ne kažem
I had to know what he was saying	Morao sam da znam šta govori
I just want the truth	Ja samo želim istinu
Pretty much this.	Prilično ovo.
Indeed, it is not.	Zaista, nije.
I knew this was not going to be easy.	Znao sam da ovo neće biti lako.
I knew where he lived	Znao sam gdje živi
I said yes, that's right.	Rekao sam da, tako je.
I can't tell you what to do	Ne mogu ti reći šta da radiš
I thought there was only one.	Mislio sam da postoji samo jedan.
I should have said something better	Trebao sam reći nešto bolje
He saw it himself.	On je to sam video.
He was tired now.	Sada je bio umoran.
And it goes on and on.	I ide dalje i dalje.
I can't believe this happened	Ne mogu vjerovati da se to dogodilo
I can't believe he did this for me	Ne mogu vjerovati da je ovo uradio za mene
You have to help him.	Moraš mu pomoći.
I didn't want to go	Nisam htela da idem
I didn't know there were so many	Nisam znao da ih ima toliko
But it is currently.	Ali to je trenutno.
A meeting like this	Sastanak kao ovaj
Don't be sorry.	Nemoj da ti bude žao.
I have a question for you.	Imam pitanje za tebe.
But why would that be.	Ali zašto bi to bilo.
It probably wouldn't be good either.	Verovatno ne bi ni bilo dobro.
I'm sorry, but it is.	Žao mi je, ali jeste.
I knew it was only a matter of time	Znao sam da je samo pitanje vremena
I knew what he was going to do	Znao sam na šta ide
It looks bad.	Izgleda loše.
You know it is.	Znate da jeste.
Yes, that's very good.	Da, to je jako dobro.
That's what we did.	To smo i uradili.
There is something else he needs to say.	Ima još nešto što treba da kaže.
People were safe because of him.	Ljudi su bili sigurni zbog njega.
I'm just saying it's not a good thing.	Samo kažem da to nije dobra stvar.
It was a life he loved.	Bio je to život koji je volio.
I knew we wouldn't be here long.	Znao sam da nećemo dugo biti ovdje.
There is nothing to do here.	Ovde nema šta da se uradi.
I haven't done anything good here	Nisam uradio ništa dobro ovde
Not you and me.	Ne ti i ja.
I saw a friend working there	Video sam prijatelja, koji tamo radi
I hope everything is fine	Nadam se da je sve u redu
For that.	Za taj.
Now I understand it better.	Sada sam to bolje shvatio.
I have no idea why not	Nemam pojma zašto ne bi
I can't tell you what to do.	Ne mogu nam reći šta da radimo.
I know better than that	Znam bolje od toga
I wasn't sure how to say it	Nisam bio siguran kako da to kažem
This is enough.	Ovo je dovoljno.
I will be better, and you will be better.	Ja ću biti bolji, a i vi ćete biti bolji.
I better go home	Bolje da idem kući
It won't be long.	Neće još dugo.
I did almost nothing	Skoro da nisam ništa uradio
No, you're right.	Ne, u pravu si.
I didn't expect it to be that way	Nisam očekivao da će biti tako
And what happens happens.	I dešava se šta se dešava.
I used to be.	Nekada sam.
Nothing can be done.	Ništa se ne može učiniti.
I knew it couldn't be done	Znao sam da se to ne može učiniti
I'm still sure of that.	I dalje sam siguran u to.
I love being there.	Volim što sam bio tamo.
He was always looking for me.	Uvek me je tražio.
I had no idea why this was happening	Nisam imao pojma zašto se to dešava
But maybe you don't know.	Ali možda i ne znaš.
They won't know, not here.	Neće znati, ne ovdje.
I want to be ready	Želim da budem spreman
You just like it.	Jednostavno ti se sviđa.
You think you are.	Misliš da jesi.
But no more than enough.	Ali ne više nego dovoljno.
You are real people.	Vi ste pravi ljudi.
Or if you work on it.	Ili ako radite na tome.
But it doesn't work.	Ali to ne radi.
I did what was needed	Uradio sam ono što je trebalo
You know we know.	Znaš da znamo.
It’s just a matter of time and time.	To je samo pitanje vremena i vremena.
In fact, he was sure she wanted it.	U stvari, bio je siguran da ona to želi.
It was like he was doing it.	Bilo je kao da on to radi.
But maybe.	Ali možda.
This in itself is bad.	Ovo je samo po sebi loše.
I was really good	Zaista sam bio dobro
One just can’t help it	Čovjek jednostavno ne može pomoći
He would be there.	On bi bio tamo.
It just doesn't work for me.	Kod mene jednostavno ne ide.
It certainly had its day for me.	To je sigurno imao svoj dan za mene.
But none of that happened.	Ali ništa od toga se nije dogodilo.
But, really, he wouldn't be able to.	Ali, zaista, ne bi da može.
It wasn't good enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
I'm just guessing.	Samo pretpostavljam.
He talks and talks and talks.	On priča i priča i priča.
I just couldn't.	Jednostavno nisam mogao.
You're welcome.	Nema na čemu.
But it didn't have to be him.	Ali to nije morao biti on.
It probably doesn't even exist.	Vjerovatno čak i ne postoji.
I never would.	Nikad ne bih.
I didn't come back in time	Nisam se vratio na vrijeme
My team is there.	Moj tim je tamo.
I didn't feel sorry for you	Nije mi te bilo žao
I didn't know what was going to happen.	Nisam znao šta će se dogoditi.
That is no longer a problem.	To više nije problem.
I didn't have time to do anything.	Nisam imao vremena ništa da uradim.
I said that would be fine.	Rekao sam da bi to bilo u redu.
I left.	Otišao sam.
I want to know how your day was	Želim da znam kako je bio tvoj dan
I was fine.	Dobro mi je bilo.
It has to be you.	Moraš biti ti.
Yes, she says.	Da, kaže ona.
I told him that too	I ja sam mu to rekao
This time just you and me.	Ovaj put samo ti i ja.
I told him yes.	Rekao sam mu da.
But they didn't, she knew.	Ali nisu, znala je.
That is completely true.	To je potpuno tačno.
I was alone, doing nothing	Bio sam sam, ništa nisam radio
I didn't expect there to be people	Nisam očekivao da će biti ljudi
I know what it is now	Znam šta je to sada
I think a lot of what she said is true.	Mislim da je mnogo toga što je rekla istina.
They were already there with him.	Već su bili tamo s njim.
I began to wonder what they might be.	Počeo sam da se pitam šta bi oni mogli biti.
I think you were fine	Mislim da si bio dobro
It may not be much or it may be a lot.	Možda neće biti mnogo ili može biti mnogo.
Alone.	Sama.
It looks so good.	Izgleda tako dobro.
I didn't know anything about it	Nisam znao ništa o tome
You know what you are.	Znaš šta si.
But there was no help.	Ali nije se moglo pomoći.
Or maybe it just seemed that way.	Ili se možda samo tako činilo.
We need better.	Moramo bolje.
They are nothing.	Oni nisu ništa.
I've never seen anything like it	Nikad nisam vidio tako nešto
You're welcome.	Nema na čemu.
I don't want to go there.	Ne želim da idem tamo.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
They weren't.	Nisu bili.
I didn't know you were there	Nisam znao da si tamo
And from.	I od.
But that is not the reason.	Ali to nije razlog.
No.	Ne može.
He just didn't understand what it was about.	Jednostavno nije shvatio o čemu se radi.
There are a lot of us	Ima nas puno
We couldn't do this without you.	Ne bismo ovo mogli bez vas.
I could go any way.	Mogao bih da idem na bilo koji način.
I will be with you from now on	Ja ću biti s tobom od sada
They will not allow it.	Oni to neće dozvoliti.
I can't believe you're here.	Ne mogu vjerovati da si ovdje.
I won't be here long	Neću dugo biti ovdje
Behind you.	I za tebe.
I'm not what you say	Ja nisam ono što kažeš
I can't do that now	Ne mogu to sada
I didn't say anything	Nisam ništa rekao
That is exactly the problem.	Upravo tu je problem.
I can't tell you what we're doing here	Ne mogu vam reći šta radimo ovdje
I had no one to talk to	Nisam imao s kim razgovarati
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
I can't do it alone	Ne mogu sama
He did it pretty well.	Uradio je to prilično dobro.
I would like to know.	Želio bih da znam.
This is not happening at the moment.	To se trenutno ne dešava.
It took both.	Trebalo je oboje.
I made them.	Napravio sam ih.
I’m not entirely sure if that’s a good thing or not.	Nisam potpuno siguran da li je to dobra stvar ili ne.
I wasn't sure how long.	Nisam bio siguran koliko dugo.
This is hard for me.	Ovo mi je teško.
He just thought he was right.	Jednostavno je mislio da je u pravu.
You are mine and only mine.	Ti si moj i samo moj.
She didn't know if any of that was true.	Da li je bilo šta od toga istina, nije znala.
A game that wasn’t always a game	Igra koja nije uvijek bila igra
That it was real.	Da je bilo stvarno.
It's not like that with you.	Nije tako s tobom.
He can still do something.	Još uvek može nešto da uradi.
I knew what he was going to tell me	Znao sam šta će mi reći
In fact, this is not true.	U stvari, ovo nije istina.
There is not much to say.	Nema se šta puno reći.
It doesn't have to be that way.	To ne mora biti tako.
I've done it before	Već sam to radio
It is hard.	Teško je.
I'm not saying he will, but who knows.	Ne kažem da hoće, ali ko zna.
I just didn’t arrive on time	Jednostavno nisam stigao na vrijeme
Say things, maybe.	Reći stvari, možda.
It's bad for my job.	Loše je za moj posao.
I wish he never came back	Voleo bih da se nikada nije vratio
She's not like you.	Ona nije kao ti.
It's good here too.	I ovdje je dobro.
I need to know what else he knows	Moram da znam šta još on zna
I didn't ask how he did it	Nisam pitao kako je to uradio
I didn't mean to say that.	Nisam to htio reći.
There's nothing you can do to me.	Ništa mi ne možeš učiniti.
No, no problem.	Ne, nema problema.
Nothing good will come of it.	Ništa dobro neće biti od toga.
See also.	Vidi i.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
And I knew how much you needed	I ja sam znao koliko ti treba
Maybe he really thought he was.	Možda je zaista mislio da jeste.
It still works.	I dalje radi.
Know things you can’t know.	Znati stvari koje ne možete znati.
You did what no one thought you could or would.	Uradio si ono što niko nije mislio da možeš ili hoćeš.
And really, it's not too hard.	I zaista, nije previše teško.
We'll go, you and me.	Otići ćemo, ti i ja.
They had much more.	Imali su mnogo više.
But it doesn't work now.	Ali to sada ne radi.
I saw you.	Vidio sam te.
Sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga.
I'm still alone.	I dalje sam.
I had a meeting	Imao sam sastanak
He knew she would see him.	Znao je da će ga vidjeti.
I wish they hadn't done that	Voleo bih da to nisu uradili
I do, obviously.	Ja to radim, očigledno.
I would see what else awaits me	Vidio bih šta me još čeka
Everything seems to be working well.	Čini se da sve radi dobro.
I would never go back	Nikad se ne bih vratio
Everything that can be.	Sve što može biti.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
So you know but you don’t know.	Tako da znate ali ne znate.
There's just nothing I can do here	Jednostavno ne mogu ništa učiniti ovdje
I still wonder what's wrong with him	I dalje se pitam šta je s njim
I just know who.	Samo znam ko.
I don't do this anymore.	Više ne radim ovo.
I said it was okay	Rekao sam da je to u redu
I don't think they are there now	Mislim da ih sada nema
For the better.	Na bolje.
We will not return them.	Nećemo ih vratiti.
He had to do it himself.	Morao je to sam da uradi.
I don't like that.	Ne sviđa mi se to.
It may never be seen again.	Možda se više nikada neće vidjeti.
Which was a pretty good thing.	Što je bila prilično dobra stvar.
I shouldn't have done that.	Nisam to trebao učiniti.
I think that's all, so far	Mislim da je to sve, do sada
I didn't really see it	Ja to zapravo nisam video
I always loved you	Uvek sam te voleo
He never did.	Nikad nije.
More to come.	Još će doći.
There really was no money.	Zaista nije bilo novca.
I said yes, and he said you won	Rekao sam da, a on je rekao da si dobio
I see she was right	Vidim da je bila u pravu
Yes, he had.	Da, imao je.
I just haven't seen you here before	Jednostavno te ranije nisam vidio ovdje
I wish my father was here.	Voleo bih da je moj otac ovde.
It's just you.	Ti si samo ti.
They know what will happen soon.	Oni znaju šta će se uskoro dogoditi.
He would do it now.	Sada bi to uradio.
I know he just loves me and I need him	Znam da me samo voli i treba mi
I didn't even see who it was	Nisam ni vidio ko je to
That has never happened and will never happen.	To se nikada nije dogodilo i nikada se neće dogoditi.
I mean, he's not here anymore	Mislim, on više nije ovdje
These things will probably help you with that.	Ove stvari će vam vjerovatno pomoći u tome.
I am glad.	Drago mi je.
He reached me.	Stigao je do mene.
Only this time.	Samo ovaj put.
This was none of those things.	Ovo nije bilo ništa od toga.
It was a game.	Bila je to igra.
I really love him right now	Trenutno ga stvarno volim
I wanted more, more than they had	Želeo sam više, više nego što su oni imali
It should be.	Trebalo bi biti.
There is usually so little we can do.	Obično je tako malo što možemo učiniti.
I wasn't sure what else was going on	Nisam bio siguran šta se još dešava
I love seeing them.	Volim ih vidjeti.
He and I never had a problem.	Ja i on nikada nismo imali problema.
I came home this morning	Jutros sam došao kući
I know you're here.	Znam da si ovde.
I did this for him.	Uradio sam ovo za njega.
I can’t believe no one wants to buy this	Ne mogu vjerovati da ovo niko ne želi kupiti
To be sure, you have to stay here.	Da biste bili sigurni, morate ostati ovdje.
I still really hope there is a little more time	I dalje se stvarno nadam da ima još malo vremena
I hope this makes you feel better	Nadam se da će vam ovo biti bolje
I have time to do it	Imam vremena da to uradim
I already told you this	Već sam ti rekao ovo
I was alone long before that	Bio sam sam mnogo prije toga
This is the way home.	Ovo je put kući.
Everything is better than me.	Sve je bolje od mene.
Something will happen.	Nešto će se dogoditi.
It is hard.	Teško je.
You know how.	Znaš kako.
I didn't do anything	Nisam ništa uradio
I still can’t believe she’s really here	Još uvijek ne mogu vjerovati da je ona zaista ovdje
I didn't know who you were	Nisam znao ko si ti
I know you want more	Znam da želiš više
But there is much more.	Ali ima još mnogo toga.
I want to work on it	Želim da radim na tome
Except for a few people.	Osim nekoliko ljudi.
I hope someone can help me.	Nadam se da mi neko može pomoći.
I didn't come home on time	Nisam se vratio kući na vrijeme
You weren't here.	Nisi bio ovde.
I hope you like it	Nadam se da ti se sviđa
Maybe you're sure of it.	Možda ste sigurni u to.
How are you.	Kako si.
But it's about being there.	Ali radi se o tome da ste tamo.
We are not that.	Mi nismo to.
There seemed to be a lot of problems.	Činilo se da ima mnogo problema.
I couldn't get it	Nisam ga mogao dobiti
If so, no problem.	Ako je tako, nema problema.
I hope it's okay tomorrow	Nadam se da je sutra u redu
I didn't know this existed	Nisam znao da ovo postoji
She told me everything.	Rekla mi je sve.
I know a lot from home.	Znam dosta toga od kuće.
I can't do anything.	Ne mogu ništa.
I could have done better	Mogao sam možda bolje
I'm so glad about that.	Tako mi je drago zbog toga.
I had no idea he lived here	Nisam imao pojma da živi ovdje
Have a nice trip.	Sretan put.
But that's it.	Ali to je to.
It was good to know.	Bilo je dobro znati.
You saw her.	Video si je.
He knows his way.	Zna svoj put.
That's bad, bad stuff.	To je loše, loše stvari.
But that may not happen here.	Ali to se možda neće dogoditi ovdje.
Not easy, but simple.	Nije lako, ali jednostavno.
I couldn't help myself anymore	Nisam si više mogao pomoći
That would be him.	To bi bio on.
He is not the only one.	On nije jedini.
And they should.	I trebali bi.
I just thought you could	Samo sam mislio da bi mogao
You were always there.	Uvek si bio tu.
I didn't do anything about it	Nisam ništa uradio tome
He didn't get it.	Nije dobio.
I didn't know who you were	Nisam znao ko si ti
I pray you're right	Molim se da si u pravu
I've never seen them here	Nikada ih nisam vidio ovdje
We had a good team.	Imali smo dobar tim.
I have no idea why this is happening	Nemam pojma zašto se to dešava
And it happened.	I to se dogodilo.
You may need to do this several times.	Možda ćete to morati učiniti nekoliko puta.
I know that now.	Znam to sada.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim da je to dobra stvar.
This is simply more.	Ovo je jednostavno više.
I almost got something	Skoro sam dobio nešto
I'm all just not that	Ja sam sve samo ne to
He said he had no time.	Rekao je da nema vremena.
This was too much.	Ovo je bilo previše.
I didn't know at the time.	U to vrijeme nisam znao.
I hope it will be a good job.	Nadam se da će to biti dobar posao.
I'm really sorry.	Zaista mi je žao.
I still won't believe it	Još uvijek neću vjerovati
Which it often was.	Što je često i bilo.
I knew what he wanted	Znao sam šta želi
Probably say no.	Verovatno reci ne.
That seems obvious.	To izgleda očigledno.
I've been there a few times	Bio sam tamo nekoliko puta
I just work.	Ja jednostavno radim.
And so it should be.	I tako bi trebalo da bude.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
Does anyone else have this problem?	Ima li još neko ovaj problem?
So it wasn't such a good idea	Tako da to nije bila tako dobra ideja
He was there for a while.	Bio je tamo neko vrijeme.
I can't say that's true	Ne mogu reći da je to istina
There was still time.	Još je bilo vremena.
I couldn't tell him no	Nisam mu mogao reći ne
I think all this happened so fast	Mislim da se sve ovo dogodilo tako brzo
What are we?	Šta smo mi.
Not bad either.	Nije ni loše.
I think we better work fast	Mislim da je bolje da radimo brzo
She has to.	Ona mora.
I hope we will all be safe	Nadam se da ćemo svi biti sigurni
I couldn't believe it was him.	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je to on.
I was ready to see what else was there	Bio sam spreman da vidim šta još ima tamo
I've never been there before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio tamo.
As many as three.	Čak tri.
Not that anyone would ask me.	Nije da bi me neko pitao.
But nothing can be done about it.	Ali tu se ništa ne može učiniti.
They could hardly have been more.	Teško da su mogli biti više.
He said he hoped he would come.	Rekao je da se nada da će doći.
I don't see why this is so difficult.	Ne vidim zašto je ovo tako teško.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay	Samo sam htio biti siguran da si dobro
I don't think we should have known	Mislim da nismo trebali znati
But no.	Ali ne.
I haven't done this in a long time	Nisam ovo radio dugo vremena
It's just, he's not here for me	Samo, nije tu, za mene
I just want to go home.	Samo želim da idem kući.
He sure looked like one.	Sigurno je izgledao kao jedan.
All of them.	Svi oni.
Something like we do now.	Nešto kao što radimo sada.
The man is coming towards us	Čovjek ide prema nama
I wanted this as much as you did	Želeo sam ovo koliko i ti
I went back to see who he was	Vratio sam se da vidim ko je on
It has to be found here.	Mora se naći ovdje.
I wish it didn't have to be that way.	Voleo bih da ne mora biti tako.
You just never knew.	Samo nikad nisi znao.
But you know that.	Ali ti to znaš.
What to do?	Šta da radi?
And that would be fine.	I to bi bilo u redu.
And that was not true.	I to nije bila istina.
I never say no.	Nikad ne kažem ne.
I know what it looks like.	Znam kako to izgleda.
You mean well.	Misliš dobro.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
But nothing happened to me.	Ali ništa mi se nije dogodilo.
That goes beyond that.	To ide dalje od toga.
I want to see you all	Želim vas sve vidjeti
Maybe you should go home.	Možda bi trebao otići kući.
Nothing will ever bring her back.	Ništa je nikada neće vratiti.
Now there is.	Sada postoji.
It doesn't have to be.	Ne mora biti.
I've never seen that.	Nikad to nisam vidio.
It was a difficult time.	Bilo je to teško vrijeme.
He would try anything.	Pokušao bi sve.
A few more days, he told himself	Još nekoliko dana, rekao je sebi
I could only hope.	Mogao sam samo da se nadam.
I didn't have that either	Ni to nisam imao
But if you are.	Ali ako jesi.
I couldn't help it.	Nisam mogao pomoći.
He should be fine.	On bi trebao biti dobro.
I can't allow this anymore	Ne mogu ovo više dozvoliti
You didn't have to do this.	Nisi morao ovo da uradiš.
Not to anyone.	Ne nikome.
I have something to tell you	Imam nešto da vam kažem
I should have done as he asked this morning	Trebalo je da uradim kako je jutros tražio
Maybe it's for you too.	Možda je i za tebe.
I know they were here	Znam da su bili ovde
Just do it.	Samo uradi.
It never will be.	Nikada neće biti.
I need something you know	Treba mi nešto što znaš
Maybe not anymore, not like it used to be.	Možda ne više, ne kao nekada.
He doesn't do anything.	Ne radi ništa.
I can't tell you anything more.	Ne mogu vam reći ništa više.
He obviously didn't expect to see me there.	Očigledno nije očekivao da će me vidjeti tamo.
Or, the team that wins.	Ili, tim koji će pobijediti.
And much, much more.	I mnogo, mnogo više.
I can't do better	Ne mogu bolje
I would give my life for him	Dao bih život za njega
Someone needs to say something.	Neko treba nešto da kaže.
I'm not sure we can do it again.	Nisam siguran da li ćemo to moći ponovo.
I asked what was wrong, and he really didn’t want to say.	Pitao sam šta nije u redu, a on zaista nije htio reći.
You can never do enough.	Nikada ne možete učiniti dovoljno.
He was there.	Bio je tamo.
I didn't do anything	Nisam ništa uradio
Make the day yours.	Da dan bude tvoj.
Are you and she.	Jeste li ti i ona.
I'm not surprised at all.	Uopšte nisam iznenađen.
They did nothing wrong.	Nisu uradili ništa loše.
I think today is a good day	Mislim da je danas dobar dan
He's doing it to me now.	Sada mi to radi.
The first is money.	Prvi je novac.
I've never heard him say that before	Nikad ga ranije nisam čuo da to kaže
That was not enough.	To nije bilo dovoljno.
You had to be the one to tell him.	Morao si biti taj koji će mu reći.
It's just a question of when.	Samo je pitanje kada.
This really, really works.	Ovo stvarno, stvarno radi.
The problem is that there will be no more of them.	Problem je što ih više neće biti.
I just think you should know that	Samo mislim da bi to trebao znati
He asked what we had.	Pitao je šta imamo.
I didn't want to see what happened next.	Nisam htela da vidim šta se dalje dešava.
Now that we are alone.	Sada kada smo sami.
But she knew better.	Ali ona je znala bolje.
I saw that there was still some money	Vidio sam da još ima nešto novca
He's just a thing for you.	On je samo stvar za tebe.
If there is.	Ako postoji.
I didn't really want anything	Nisam baš ništa želeo
She was really alone now.	Sada je zaista bila sama.
There is obviously something in that.	Očigledno ima nešto u tome.
This is true, if not true enough.	Ovo je tačno, ako ne i dovoljno tačno.
We like this.	Sviđa nam se ovo.
I can do it a little, but not a lot.	Mogu to učiniti malo, ali ne puno.
That was hard.	To je bilo teško.
We need to know for sure.	Moramo znati sigurno.
I was right, that was bad.	Bio sam u pravu, to je bilo loše.
For me, it still exists.	Za mene i dalje postoji.
I always wondered what you were doing	Uvek sam se pitao šta radiš
I'm back now.	Sada sam se vratio.
And he did it here.	I to je uradio ovde.
I'm sick of it at home	Dosta mi je toga kod kuće
I can't believe this is it	Ne mogu vjerovati da je to to
What a problem.	Što je problem.
I can't say no.	Ne mogu reći ne.
You would too.	I ti bi.
He asked for more than he knew.	Tražio je više nego što je znao.
I love my job too much	Previše volim svoj posao
It was obvious that none of us wanted that.	Bilo je očigledno da niko od nas to ne želi.
Right here.	Upravo ovdje.
But hope is more than that.	Ali nada je više od toga.
I had to go for it	Morao sam da idem za tim
I lost my own and I was looking for him	Izgubio sam svoj i tražio sam ga
Don't say you don't know.	Nemoj reći da ne znaš.
You would do this.	Ovo bi ti uradio.
Obviously I say no.	Očigledno kažem ne.
It was very bad this morning.	Jutros je bilo jako loše.
Enough.	Dosta.
That's the only thing that really needs to be done.	To je jedina stvar koju zaista treba učiniti.
There's something wrong there.	Tamo nešto nije u redu.
I just know they're not together	Samo znam da nisu zajedno
I have no idea why this is so difficult.	Nemam pojma zašto je ovo tako teško.
I just can't buy it	To jednostavno ne mogu kupiti
But not for much.	Ali ne za mnogo.
I can not believe.	Ne mogu vjerovati.
And I still have it	I ja ga još uvijek imam
I could tell something was wrong	Mogao sam reći da nešto nije u redu
He is not. 	On nije. 
I wasn't sure if he would leave or stay	Nisam bio siguran da li će otići ili ostati
We are all doing badly at the moment.	Svi mi to trenutno loše radimo.
That was the day before he left.	To je bilo dan prije nego što je otišao.
You will never be.	Nikad nećeš biti.
I can't even find him	Ne mogu ga ni naći
He's wrong.	On nije u pravu.
Nothing was too good for us.	Ništa nije bilo previše dobro za nas.
As if he wants to say even more.	Kao da želi reći još više.
I'm certainly not my game.	Ja sigurno nisam moja igra.
I never thought he would do something like that	Nikad nisam mislio da će tako nešto uraditi
I guess he did it again.	Pretpostavljam da je to ponovo radio.
I wondered that too	I ja sam se to pitao
We could have won, and we should have won.	Mogli smo pobijediti, i trebali smo pobijediti.
Here we will do what we have to.	Ovdje ćemo učiniti ono što moramo.
But it wouldn't.	Ali ne bi.
I hadn’t had any of that before	Nisam imao ništa od toga ranije
Even if it isn't.	Čak i da nije.
I have someone too	I ja imam nekoga
It's all something.	Sve je to nešto.
I hope you will allow it	Nadam se da ćeš dozvoliti
I mean, nobody.	Mislim, niko.
But it was more than that.	Ali to je bilo nešto više od toga.
I hope you understood that.	Nadam se da si to shvatio.
I wasn't in it	Nisam bio u tome
I shouldn't have done that.	Nisam trebao to da uradim.
You don't have to go, you know.	Ne moraš ići, znaš.
Day after day.	Dan po dan.
I have no idea how it works	Nemam pojma kako to radi
There is no one to talk to.	Nema s kim razgovarati.
That shouldn't be difficult.	To ne bi trebalo biti teško.
I know who you really are	Znam ko si ti zaista
Everything they said was.	Sve što su rekli bilo je.
I just.	Ja samo.
I say, that's enough	Kažem, dosta je bilo
I needed more.	Trebalo mi je više.
I really love her.	Zaista je volim.
Just in time.	Samo na vrijeme.
I think it looks pretty good.	Mislim da izgleda prilično dobro.
She will say no.	Ona će reći ne.
He couldn't wait any longer.	Nije mogao više da čeka.
This was not the case.	Ovo nije bilo tako.
Or for a few days.	Ili na nekoliko dana.
But I have a question	Ali imam pitanje
You told me a lot last night.	Mnogo si mi rekao sinoć.
I still had a meeting	Još sam imao sastanak
Why? 	Zašto?
And maybe you are.	A možda i jesi.
It's simple, but it's not easy.	Jednostavno je, ali nije lako.
I'm not done yet.	Nisam još završio.
I was tired this morning	Jutros sam bio umoran
I do not have much time	Nemam puno vremena
I just got it from him this morning.	Upravo sam ga jutros dobio od njega.
I pray that everything is fine	Molim se da je sve u redu
Maybe just for now.	Možda samo za sada.
You need a team.	Treba ti tim.
But this is my team.	Ali ovo je moj tim.
Yes, he would try more.	Da, pokušao bi više.
I just can’t believe it happened	Jednostavno ne mogu vjerovati da se to dogodilo
I know he's trying to tell me something	Znam da pokušava nešto da mi kaže
He saw it.	Video je to.
Little money	Malo novca
There was nothing like here.	Nije bilo ništa kao ovdje.
Surely you can believe that too.	Sigurno i u to možete vjerovati.
I lost too much.	Izgubio sam previše.
It could have been any.	Moglo je biti bilo koje.
I hope everyone likes it	Nadam se da se svima sviđa
Is this enough?	Je li ovo dovoljno?
I had no idea what it might be about	Nisam imao pojma o čemu bi to moglo biti
He decided.	Odlučio se.
Now he really wants one.	Sada zaista želi jedan.
You are only one.	Ti si samo jedan.
He was tired and decided.	Bio je umoran i odlučio se.
I think we could do that	Mislim da smo to mogli
I don't have that power anymore	Više nemam te moći
I wanted a life for myself	Želeo sam život za sebe
For both of us.	Za nas oboje.
I've done it before	Radio sam to ranije
Nothing will happen to him.	Ništa mu se neće dogoditi.
I told you that before.	Rekao sam ti to ranije.
I know what he's talking about	Znam o čemu govori
Maybe you're okay with that.	Možda si u redu s tim.
I wish I had it now	Voleo bih da ga imam sada
They are themselves.	Oni su oni sami.
I had to work harder than ever	Morao sam da radim više od bilo koga
I really wish my father was here	Zaista bih volio da je otac ovdje
But she wouldn't want that.	Ali ona to ne bi htela.
I didn't expect what happened next	Nisam očekivao šta se dalje dogodilo
I didn't expect it to be that easy	Nisam očekivao da će biti tako lako
He is my friend.	On je moj prijatelj.
I don't know why really.	Ne znam zašto zaista.
I doubt there are more	Sumnjam da ih ima više
It was really good.	Bilo je stvarno dobro.
I've never had a problem with that	Nikad nisam imao problema sa tim
But if you can.	Ali ako možeš.
He really knew that.	On je to zaista znao.
Indeed, he really had.	Zaista, stvarno je imao.
Not that he would ever do something like that.	Nije da bi ikada uradio tako nešto.
I can't go on without him	Ne mogu dalje bez njega
He always knows what to do.	On uvek zna šta treba da radi.
I knew exactly what was going on	Tačno sam znao šta se dešava
He wasn't there when they did this to me.	Nije bio tamo kada su mi to uradili.
I’ve never been too much for school	Nikada nisam bio previše za školu
I just hadn't seen him before	Jednostavno ga ranije nisam vidio
She has no friends there.	Ona tamo nema prijatelja.
I actually wanted to see the real thing	Zapravo sam htela da vidim pravu
I will.	Ja ću tako.
That's how I wanted to be with you	Tako sam htela da budem sa tobom
I hope he comes soon	Nadam se da će uskoro doći
And so on.	I tako dalje.
This is the one.	Ovo je taj.
They probably didn't even know how.	Verovatno nisu ni znali kako.
I had it many years ago.	Imao sam to prije mnogo godina.
He obviously could never do that.	On to očigledno nikada ne bi mogao da uradi.
But maybe not.	Ali možda nije tako.
We did the right thing.	Uradili smo pravu stvar.
I'm glad it's good.	Drago mi je da je dobro.
In fact, we don’t.	U stvari, ne radimo.
Three.	Tri.
I didn't have to do anything	Nisam morao ništa da radim
You can't get anything from me.	Ne možeš ništa dobiti od mene.
I was no better than him	Nisam bio bolji od njega
You think you can, but you can't.	Mislite da možete, ali ne možete.
I should have known he would	Trebao sam znati da hoće
I have no time.	Nemam vremena.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ali nije mogao ništa.
Where he lives.	Gdje živi.
he asked.	pitao.
She knew that now.	To je sada znala.
I asked them why, and they couldn’t tell.	Pitao sam ih zašto, a oni nisu mogli reći.
What's going on here.	Šta se dešava ovde.
I should go back	Trebao bih se vratiti
I don't want to see that	Ne želim to vidjeti
He knew it so well.	On je to tako dobro znao.
It's a team.	To je tim.
I'm not done yet.	Nisam još završio.
I say as it is	Ja kažem kako jeste
You or anyone.	Ti ili bilo ko.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
Besides, it's not for me.	Osim toga, nije za mene.
It's hard to be.	Teško je to biti.
If he can get better, good for him.	Ako može da bude bolji, dobro za njega.
I expected more from him	Očekivao sam više od njega
I don't mean anything like that.	Ne mislim ništa tako.
It was not easy.	Nije bilo lako.
And there she was.	I tamo je bila.
Easy for you, maybe, but hard for me.	Lako za vas, možda, ali teško za mene.
Know where to go, where things are.	Znati gdje ići, gdje su stvari.
So many things are happening to me right now	Toliko stvari mi se trenutno dešava
I was just wondering where they were	Samo sam se pitao gdje su
There he is.	Tamo je on.
You got your money.	Dobio si svoj novac.
I just couldn’t see.	Jednostavno nisam mogao vidjeti.
I mean, he's still better than me.	Mislim, on je i dalje bolji od mene.
He's already done it.	Već je to radio.
And it wasn't better.	I nije bilo bolje.
Maybe not so bad.	Možda i nije tako loše.
But that was him.	Ali to je on bio.
I just wasn’t that good	Jednostavno nisam bio tako dobar
It didn't take much more.	Nije trebalo mnogo više.
Maybe because of that.	Možda zbog toga.
I should be on time tonight	Večeras bih trebao doći na vrijeme
They did a very good job.	Uradili su veoma dobar posao.
We only know that we are alone.	Samo znamo da smo sami.
She's already here.	Ona je već ovde.
I didn't know he was here	Nisam znao da je ovde
We have a lot to do.	Moramo da uradimo dosta toga.
But we did a lot.	Ali uradili smo mnogo.
But that did not happen	Ali to se nije dogodilo
I did everything you asked of me	Uradio sam sve što si tražio od mene
And she was right.	I ona je bila u pravu.
He worked really well.	Radio je zaista dobro.
I'm sure she's never been there before	Siguran sam da nikada ranije nije bila tamo
That was not a problem.	To nije bio problem.
I didn't see him.	Nisam ga vidio.
Maybe someone would be home.	Možda bi neko bio kod kuće.
I can't come right away	Ne mogu odmah doći
I told you what would happen.	Rekao sam ti šta će se dogoditi.
I really didn't know what to do	Zaista nisam znao šta da radim
Do only what you do.	Radi samo ono što vi radite.
You really will.	Zaista hoćeš.
He thought only of himself.	Mislio je samo na sebe.
I wasn't sure before	Nisam bio siguran ranije
That's what he does.	To je ono što on radi.
We do not know, and we cannot know.	Ne znamo, i ne možemo znati.
I know you all want to go to work	Znam da svi želite na posao
This will not work.	Ovo neće raditi.
I'm not sure if that's true.	Nisam siguran da li je to istina.
Besides, it was a good day.	Osim toga, bio je to dobar dan.
And it was.	I bilo je.
I knew what it was about	Znao sam o čemu se radi
Maybe he would.	Možda bi i on.
I saw him do it myself	I sam sam ga vidio kako to radi
Nothing can be done.	Ništa se ne može uraditi.
I didn't see it.	Nisam to vidio.
Just say what you think.	Reci samo ono što misliš.
Bad is bad.	Loše je loše.
I never said we would find her	Nikad nisam rekao da ćemo je naći
Everything is going as it should.	Sve ide kako treba.
That is not really the case.	To u stvari nije tako.
Maybe I don't always like it	Možda mi se ne sviđa uvek
Too many stories.	Previše priča.
He must have had nothing better to do.	Mora da nije imao ništa bolje da radi.
I know everything, everything, everything is fine.	Znam sve, sve, sve je u redu.
Better than you think.	Bolje nego što mislite.
That way she was like me.	Na taj način je bila kao ja.
I was surprised it was still working	Bio sam iznenađen da još uvijek radi
I don't need help.	Ne treba mi pomoć.
And it happens.	I to se dešava.
I did that to him too	I ja sam mu to uradio
That's what he wants.	To je ono što želi.
I want someone to tell me what to do	Želim da mi neko kaže šta da radim
He will talk to you.	On će razgovarati s tobom.
I could do that	Mogao sam to da uradim
I didn't think he should go there	Nisam mislio da treba da ide tamo
I think he's a good guy	Mislim da je dobar momak
She's probably never been here.	Verovatno nikada nije bila ovde.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
I asked him to leave.	Zamolio sam ga da ode.
I wanted those things.	Želeo sam te stvari.
I couldn't do it without you and I wouldn't want to	Ne bih to mogao bez tebe i ne bih htio
And so can we all	A možemo i svi mi
I almost like it a lot	Skoro da mi se mnogo sviđa
I did something right.	Uradio sam nešto kako treba.
And you can be together again.	I možete ponovo biti zajedno.
Okay, really good.	U redu, stvarno dobro.
I'm the only one.	Jedini ja sam ja.
I never saw him again	Nisam ga više vidio
Certainly not.	Sigurno neće.
I expected to talk to him earlier	Očekivao sam da ću ranije razgovarati s njim
I heard what you have to say	Čuo sam šta imaš da kažeš
You are someone who has things.	Vi ste neko ko ima stvari.
I'm surprised he's here.	Iznenađen sam da je ovdje.
I shouldn't have said that.	Nisam to trebao reći.
I can't believe it either	Ni ja ne mogu vjerovati
It was hard for me because of that	Bilo mi je teško zbog toga
I am anything but a yes person.	Ja sam sve samo ne da osoba.
I just can’t get it today	Jednostavno ne mogu dobiti danas
I went after him.	Otišao sam za njim.
For nothing.	Ni po čemu.
I want to work on myself	Želim da radim na sebi
I didn't want to be here	Nisam htela da budem ovde
Never a good idea.	Nikad dobra ideja.
And those who didn't or couldn't, wouldn't.	A oni koji nisu ili nisu mogli, ne bi.
I never know what to say.	Nikad ne znam šta da kažem.
I doubt he's right.	Sumnjam da je u pravu.
What do you think?	Šta mislite?
I can stay here like yours	Mogu ostati ovdje kao tvoj
I was actually there	Ja sam zapravo bio tamo
I don’t do those things anymore and I have a new life.	Više ne radim te stvari i imam novi život.
I was not happy at home when she was there	Nisam bio sretan kod kuće, kada je ona bila tamo
We're not so sure.	Nismo tako sigurni.
I didn't even know he was going home	Nisam ni znala da će biti kući
This is not like you.	Ovo nije kao ti.
I certainly didn't even start	Sigurno nisam ni počeo
I couldn't say why	Nisam mogao reći zašto
Indeed, there can be nothing.	Zaista, ne može biti ništa.
I also saw a few.	Vidio sam i nekoliko.
Everything is OK.	Sve je u redu.
I would have to find him	Morao bih ga naći
I don't need anything.	Ne treba mi ništa.
And she was.	I ona je bila.
We never did.	Nikad nismo.
He could go there.	Mogao bi da ode tamo.
I think you're right.	Mislim da si u pravu.
I said it would be you	Rekao sam da ćeš to biti ti
And we will do it.	I mi ćemo to učiniti.
We have a problem.	Imamo problema.
I just love doing it	Samo volim to raditi
There are three more.	Ima još tri.
That was many years ago.	Bilo je to prije mnogo godina.
I doubt that is the case.	Sumnjam da je to tako.
This was something more.	Ovo je bilo nešto više.
We have this.	Imamo ovo.
Or, as they said.	Ili, kako su rekli.
Don't say no, she said.	Nemoj reći ne, rekla je.
I'm not sure what to do with it.	Nisam siguran šta da radim s tim.
He never told me when.	Nikad mi nije rekao kada.
There was nothing that I could do	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim
But that didn't happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
I knew someone had to know something	Znao sam da neko mora nešto da zna
One man doesn’t make a team.	Jedan čovjek ne čini tim.
He couldn't stay here.	Nije mogao ostati ovdje.
Do it right this time	Uradi to kako treba ovaj put
Nobody wanted them.	Niko ih nije želeo.
You seem to know a few things.	Čini se da znaš nekoliko stvari.
I wouldn't want that if it wasn't	Ne bih to želio da nije
When something works, that’s it.	Kad nešto radi, to je to.
They don't know what's really going on.	Oni ne znaju šta se zapravo dešava.
I didn't expect this	Nisam ovo očekivao
That was not my problem.	To nije bio moj problem.
I had to give it to him	Morao sam mu to dati
Me or mine.	Ja ili moj.
I can't say anything about that	Ne mogu ništa reći o tome
We couldn't do that.	Nismo mogli to da uradimo.
She said she was fine.	Rekla je da je dobro.
Probably would.	Vjerovatno bi.
I can't say anything yet	Ne mogu još ništa reći
I would never do that again	Nikad to više ne bih uradio
I like to be ready.	Volim da budem spreman.
This time will be upon us.	Ovo vrijeme će biti na nama.
And now they are gone.	A sada ih više nema.
That's what he told himself.	To je on sam sebi rekao.
We know all that for sure now.	Sve to sada sigurno znamo.
We know how it is there.	Znamo kako je tamo.
Can someone help me please.	Može li mi neko pomoći molim vas.
I didn't know about you	Nisam znao za tebe
I ask why.	Pitam zašto.
She's good at it.	Ona je dobra u tome.
I saw it and left	Video sam to i otišao
But it will be tomorrow.	Ali to će biti sutra.
It could be anything.	Moglo bi biti bilo šta.
Which I don't really like.	Što mi se baš i ne sviđa.
He wants to talk to you.	Želi razgovarati s tobom.
Nice to see you here.	Drago mi je da te vidim ovdje.
Help was probably a good idea.	Pomoć je vjerovatno bila dobra ideja.
I have to do this alone	Moram ovo sam da uradim
What we are doing now is this.	Ono što sada radimo je ovo.
And maybe it's true.	I možda je istina.
I won't give you anything more	Neću ti dati ništa više
I hope you see it all now	Nadam se da ćeš sada sve vidjeti
I want to be as far away as possible.	Želim da budem što dalje.
I didn't figure this out myself	Nisam ovo sam shvatio
I knew what we both needed	Znao sam šta nam oboje treba
I would probably say the same	Verovatno bih i ja tako rekao
I was very happy	Bio sam veoma sretan
So it was hard for him.	Tako da mu je to bilo teško.
None of this will work anymore.	Ništa od toga više neće raditi.
I thought that was it.	Mislio sam da je to to.
She won't believe it from him.	Ona to neće vjerovati od njega.
But only a little.	Ali samo malo.
I thought I could help you	Mislio sam da bi ti mogao pomoći
See who it is.	Vidi ko je to.
It could be anywhere.	Moglo bi biti bilo gdje.
I thought you'd be fine	Mislio sam da ćeš biti dobro
I have a lot of money now	Sada imam puno novca
I mean, that's not the way to do it	Mislim, to nije način da se to uradi
He came.	Došao je.
Maybe he's busy.	Možda je zauzet.
I decided tomorrow would be a good day	Odlučio sam, sutra će biti dobar dan
I often think that.	Često to mislim.
That's the problem with you.	To je problem sa tobom.
We are like them.	Mi smo kao oni.
I had to know what was going on	Morao sam da znam šta se dešava
I want to see you now	Želim da te vidim sada
That's actually the way it is.	To je u stvari tako.
He had so little time.	Imao je tako malo vremena.
Not even that she was good.	Čak ni da je bila dobra.
He didn’t want to stay and help anyone.	Nije želio ostati i pomoći nikome.
He says.	On kaže .
It's because of you.	To je zbog tebe.
I can't let you do that	Ne mogu ti to dozvoliti
That would be it.	Toliko bi.
This will be easy.	Ovo će biti lako.
And nothing is wrong.	I ništa nije u redu.
That's what I wanted	Tako sam to htela
But he is not like us.	Ali on nije kao mi.
I was very sorry to hear that.	Bilo mi je jako žao što sam to čuo.
I never heard from him.	Nikad se nisam čuo s njim.
I didn't see it when they were	Nisam to vidio kada su oni
I want everything you can get out of it	Želim sve što možeš dobiti od toga
I said it before.	Rekao sam to ranije.
I have something to tell him.	Imam nešto da mu kažem.
I could tell there was something wrong with him	Mogao sam reći da nešto nije u redu s njim
You know it always will be.	Znaš da će uvek biti.
I was fine with that.	Bio sam u redu sa tim.
No problem yet.	Još nema problema.
I've never seen him	Nikad ga nisam video
He will come back to me.	On će mi se vratiti.
I'm not surprised at all.	Nisam iznenađen ni malo.
You shouldn't have done this.	Nisi trebao ovo da uradiš.
I thought it would be okay	Mislio sam da će biti u redu
You can't go this time.	Ovaj put ne možeš ići.
You can tell.	Možeš reći.
I wasn't expecting you, or anyone, really	Nisam očekivao tebe, ili bilo koga, zaista
You know how he does.	Znaš kako mu ide.
But that was not the case.	Ali to nije bilo tako.
I really did this	Stvarno sam ovo radio
No one will talk to us.	Niko neće razgovarati sa nama.
I think we need to know more about that	Mislim da moramo znati više o tome
They do not know.	Ne znaju.
The car was still there and still working.	Auto je još uvijek bio tamo i još je radio.
I told him things, but not the truth	Rekao sam mu stvari, ali ne i istinu
There's just a lot going on.	Samo se mnogo toga dešava.
I love being here	Volim da si ovde
They had no money.	Nisu imali novca.
I didn't know how long he would stay.	Nisam znao koliko će dugo ostati.
Still and still.	I dalje i dalje.
They are not here.	Ovde ih nema.
I would still love to do that	I dalje bih to volio da radim
You always have been.	Ti si uvek bio .
That's why they're here.	Zbog toga su tu.
But not for me anymore.	Ali za mene ne više.
I just didn't.	Ja jednostavno nisam.
But he seemed to be done with me.	Ali činilo se da je završio sa mnom.
I can do without him	Mogu i bez njega
That was me.	To sam bio ja.
He's been there before.	Bio je tamo ranije.
I was sure he heard me	Bio sam siguran da me je čuo
Rain and rain.	Kiša i kiša.
I knew you would say something	Znao sam da ćeš nešto reći
He's not there.	On nije tamo.
I always feel sorry for them	Uvijek mi ih je žao
If or for.	Ako je ili za.
I knew something was wrong	Znao sam da nešto nije u redu
I want you to know you're not alone	Želim da znaš da nisi sam
We know little about it.	Znamo malo o tome.
You seemed to need a friend.	Činilo se da ti treba prijatelj.
I didn't want to know.	Nisam htela da znam.
I had more time and I always worked more	Imao sam više vremena i uvijek sam radio više
I didn't even know what he was talking about	Nisam ni znao o čemu priča
I had to go there myself from time to time.	Morao sam i sam s vremena na vrijeme ići tamo.
I was ready for it	Bio sam spreman za to
We just work.	Mi jednostavno radimo.
I have no idea why I'm here	Nemam pojma zašto sam ovdje
Unless I say so.	Osim ako ja tako kažem.
We really needed him.	Zaista nam je trebao.
I thought he did a good job	Mislio sam da je uradio dobar posao
I really love you	Ja te stvarno volim
You can go.	Možeš ići.
Your life is not.	Tvoj život nije.
I pray a lot.	Mnogo se molim.
She actually feels good about herself.	Ona se zapravo osjeća dobro u sebi.
But he's fine.	Ali on je dobro.
Want to know a little more?	Želite li znati malo više?
I didn't want to go, it wasn't my idea	Nisam htela da idem, to nije bila moja ideja
And he was good at it.	I bio je dobar u tome.
It must be good.	Mora da je dobro.
There is nothing more to say.	Nema šta više da se kaže.
I want to go home.	Želim kući.
My game was not good.	Moja igra nije bila dobra.
I thought you were going to say that	Mislio sam da ćeš to reći
I'm just not sure.	Samo nisam siguran.
I doubt it ever was	Sumnjam da je to ikada bilo
That's not the point.	Nije u tome stvar.
I just thought it was time	Samo sam mislio da je vrijeme
Without money they would not be able to.	Bez novca oni to ne bi mogli.
There were things and more.	Bilo je stvari i još mnogo toga.
The question is when and how.	Pitanje je kada i kako.
I'm not sure if that's true.	Nisam siguran da li je to istina.
I just didn't expect this	Ovo jednostavno nisam očekivao
I'm still not going	I dalje ne idem
We just don't know what's real.	Samo ne znamo šta je stvarno.
I don't want anything from you	Ne želim ništa od tebe
But we are doing something that is wrong.	Ali mi radimo nešto što nije u redu.
Good day people.	Dobar dan ljudi.
He's better than that.	On je bolji od toga.
I didn't say no	Nisam rekao da nije
I just couldn't go.	Jednostavno nisam mogao da idem.
I know it is.	Znam da jeste.
I can give you what you need	Mogu ti dati šta ti treba
But it's just me.	Ali to sam samo ja.
Someone should.	Neko bi trebao.
It's not what it looks like.	Nije ono što izgleda.
Nobody has done that before.	To niko ranije nije radio.
Do it, do it, do it.	Uradi to, uradi to, uradi to.
I have no problem with that	Nemam problema sa tim
It can't be anymore.	Ne može biti više.
I was glad he didn't get lost	Bilo mi je drago da se nije izgubio
I really want to talk to you.	Zaista želim razgovarati s tobom.
Maybe not this time.	Ovaj put možda i ne.
He is here to help you.	Ovdje je da vam pomogne.
There is nothing more to say.	Nema više šta da se kaže.
I guess that would be fine	Pretpostavljam da bi to bilo u redu
He still didn't know what to say.	I dalje nije znao šta da kaže.
He had a little more at home.	Imao je još malo kod kuće.
There is usually a good reason for this.	Obično postoji dobar razlog za to.
I love when it works	Volim kad to radi
I wasn't always there for you	Nisam uvek bio tu za tebe
That's a really good job.	To je zaista dobar posao.
She was fine with that.	Bila je u redu sa tim.
But what about that.	Ali šta o tome.
I asked you to do it last week	Zamolio sam te da to uradiš prošle sedmice
I need to know everything	Moram da znam sve
No, not the first time.	Ne, ne prvi put.
I will never be alone again	Nikada više neću biti sam
That's my father.	To je moj otac.
She didn't say more.	Nije rekla više.
I knew it was for me	Znao sam da je za mene
You have a problem.	Imaš problema.
Sure yes, he says.	Sigurno da, kaže on.
But it could be.	Ali moglo bi biti.
By themselves, they never will.	Sami po sebi, nikada neće.
Do what you have to.	Uradite ono što morate.
You are the problem.	Vi ste problem.
I think it's both.	Mislim da je oboje.
I was completely busy	Bio sam potpuno zauzet
I saw them tonight	Video sam ih večeras
I really wasn't sure what to say	Zaista nisam bio siguran šta da kažem
I think that's it	Mislim da je to sve
I guess everyone knows	Pretpostavljam da svi znaju
It is very easy to see.	To je vrlo lako vidjeti.
You can do this if you want.	Možete to učiniti ako želite.
It's exactly what we needed.	To je upravo ono što nam je trebalo.
Maybe more than once.	Možda više puta.
I asked him what happened	Pitao sam ga šta se dogodilo
It should work.	Trebalo bi da radi.
Indeed, it seems it even should have.	Zaista, čini se da je čak i trebalo.
A lot needed to be done	Mnogo je trebalo uraditi
This is all for the best.	Ovo je sve za dobro.
I really like the idea	Mnogo mi se sviđa ideja
But maybe that's not right.	Ali možda to nije u redu.
I should have done it the day before.	Trebao sam to uraditi prije dana.
It was simple.	Jednostavno je bilo.
I was right.	Bio sam u pravu.
Which is hard.	Što je teško.
So it was with him.	Tako je bilo i sa njim.
He was for a while.	Neko vrijeme je bio.
Maybe it already is.	Možda već jeste.
More needs to be done.	Mora se uraditi više.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to učiniti.
This is just the first.	Ovo je samo prvi.
I need to know if he's there.	Moram da znam da li je tamo.
I'm going for it.	Idem na to.
This should be for good.	Ovo bi trebalo da bude za dobro.
I didn't have to do that	Nisam to morao da radim
I wondered what this could be	Pitao sam se šta bi ovo moglo biti
If anyone can help me, they could.	Ako mi neko može pomoći, mogao bi.
I knew what he meant.	Znao sam šta je mislio.
But there was something wrong.	Ali tu nešto nije bilo u redu.
I would like to be sure he is safe.	Želio bih biti siguran da je siguran.
There seemed to be nothing here.	Činilo se da ovdje ništa nije bilo.
I don't think that's it.	Mislim da to nije to.
I just didn’t like him.	Jednostavno ga nisam volio.
It works pretty well for now.	Za sada radi prilično dobro.
I just need to know he's there	Samo moram znati da je tamo
Maybe it's nothing.	Možda nije ništa.
Not for you.	Nije za tebe.
I would ask.	Zamolio bih.
I could go back	Mogao sam se vratiti
I didn't know anything about it	Nisam znao ništa o tome
They can.	Oni mogu.
I can do it, you know	Ja to mogu, znaš
I was tired, so, so tired	Bio sam umoran, tako, tako umoran
I have so much to do	Imam toliko toga da uradim
She loves me so, a lot.	Ona me voli tako, puno.
I needed both.	Trebalo mi je oboje.
Lots of money.	Mnogo novca.
You look good too.	I ti izgledaš dobro.
It does not exist.	Ne postoji.
I don't want anything without you	Neću ništa bez tebe
I mean, you were there	Mislim, bio si tamo
This will certainly never happen.	Ovo se sigurno nikada neće dogoditi.
Everyone knows you're there.	Svi znaju da si tamo.
Things he shouldn't know.	Stvari koje ne bi trebalo da zna.
And they are wrong.	I nisu u pravu.
I won't, not even for you.	Neću, čak ni za tebe.
How can I do that.	Kako mogu to da uradim.
I didn't say that at all	Nisam to uopšte rekao
He was what he was and that was it.	Bio je ono što je bio i to je bilo to.
I can say all things	Mogu reći sve stvari
They will find him.	Naći će ga.
Can we do this? 	Možemo li ovo?
we can do it.	mi to možemo.
I do what my job tells me	Radim ono što mi posao kaže
It was three years ago.	Bilo je to prije tri godine.
But you're not really like him.	Ali ti zapravo nisi kao on.
Nobody had money.	Niko nije imao novca.
I want to do it	Želim da to uradim
I decided we had to do something.	Odlučio sam da moramo nešto učiniti.
He was always easy to talk to before.	Prije je uvijek bilo lako razgovarati s njim.
I would just love to.	Samo bih volio.
I knew what we had to do	Znao sam šta treba da uradimo
I thought you should know	Mislio sam da bi trebao znati
I can’t believe they’re still a thing	Ne mogu vjerovati da su još uvijek stvar
I saw some of what she could do.	Video sam nešto od toga šta ona može da uradi.
I may not go much longer	Možda neću ići još dugo
I wonder what that says? 	Pitam se šta to govori?
We can't do this.	Ne možemo ovo da uradimo.
he wondered	pitao se on
I go to work.	Idem na posao.
You can do almost anything you want.	Možete raditi skoro sve što želite.
Still the door.	Još uvek vrata.
I wouldn't ask you to	Ne bih to tražio od tebe
It's just like that.	To je jednostavno tako.
I tried to make one	Pokušao sam da uradim jedan
I can't say what exactly	Ne mogu reći šta tačno
We knew that.	To smo znali.
Maybe you will too.	Možda ćeš i ti.
That was it.	To je bilo tako.
I would like to know	Želio bih da znam
He did it for me.	To je uradio za mene.
I think he should stay with us for now	Mislim da bi za sada trebao ostati s nama
I'm just not into it today	Danas jednostavno nisam u tome
She was something.	Ona je bila nešto.
They won't be what you think.	Oni neće biti ono što mislite.
Yes, they are there.	Da, tamo su.
I had no idea what to say	Nisam imao pojma šta da kažem
We can't be sure of him.	Ne možemo biti sigurni sa njim.
It's really hard.	Zaista je teško.
I did not know what to say	Nisam znao šta da kažem
He is good.	On je dobar.
I'm pretty sure they never were.	Prilično sam siguran da nikada nisu bili.
I've already lost everything	Već sam sve izgubio
I know it is.	Znam da jeste.
I can't say now why	Ne mogu sada reći zašto
And he does.	I on to radi.
I had a.	Imao sam.
But that's what it was.	Ali to je ono što je bilo.
I think it should be.	Mislim da bi trebalo biti.
It's you.	To si ti.
Besides, something can happen.	Osim toga, može se nešto dogoditi.
He's not good enough for you.	On nije dovoljno dobar za tebe.
I would have to say that.	Morao bih to reći.
But he thinks so too.	Ali i on to misli.
There were too many of them.	Bilo ih je previše.
I guess that's true	Pretpostavljam da je to istina
I ask him how he is and he says well	Pitam ga kako je i on kaže dobro
Things are a little better, but not much.	Stvari su malo bolje, ali ne mnogo.
But he can't say yes.	Ali ne može reći da.
It's not.	Nije.
I'm not sure, but what would you do pretty well.	Nisam siguran, ali šta bi ti uradio prilično dobro.
He's been there so long.	Toliko dugo je tamo.
We do better when we know better.	Radimo bolje kada znamo bolje.
I just came to tell you that	Došao sam samo da ti to kažem
I can't say that's a good thing.	Ne mogu reći da je to dobra stvar.
I knew it couldn't happen	Znao sam da se to ne može dogoditi
I can't help but be tired	Ne mogu a da ne budem umoran
I wonder how often he does that.	Pitam se koliko često to radi.
I should know everything.	Trebalo bi da znam sve.
I always knew this was coming	Uvek sam znao da će ovo doći
And I thought it was pretty good	I ja sam mislio da je prilično dobro
No one had any idea what he had just said.	Niko nije imao pojma šta je upravo rekao.
It wouldn't be what it is now.	Ne bi bio ono što je sada.
If you work here, you have to be one of us.	Ako radite ovdje, morate biti jedan od nas.
I'm really tired now	Sada sam stvarno umoran
That's for sure.	To je sigurno.
No, not really.	Ne, ne baš to.
He just has to help himself.	Mora samo sebi pomoći.
I wonder how you do it	Pitam se kako to radiš
Now we know the truth.	Sada znamo istinu.
He never wanted that.	Nikad to nije želio.
She just.	Ona samo.
I don't really like it.	Ne volim to baš.
I think you're right	Mislim da si u pravu
You don't need that.	Ne treba to.
Right now, and gone from it.	Upravo sada, i otišao od toga.
A lot is happening	Mnogo toga se dešava
I was there often, but I never went any further	Bio sam tamo često, ali nikad nisam otišao dalje
I can't leave you again	Ne mogu ponovo otići od tebe
I would do it even if it wasn't	Uradio bih to čak i da nije
She will talk to anyone.	Ona će razgovarati sa bilo kim.
We had them.	Imali smo ih.
I guess there's nothing more to talk about	Pretpostavljam da nema o čemu više da se priča
Not such a good idea.	Nije tako dobra ideja.
It's like you said earlier.	To je kao što ste ranije rekli.
I could tell he was waiting for me.	Mogao sam reći da me čeka.
Maybe not anymore.	Možda više neće biti.
I knew it wouldn't be a new car	Znao sam da to neće biti novi auto
I gave him this	Dao sam mu ovo
I'm not alone in that	Nisam sam u tome
She says no.	Ona kaže ne.
I saw it for the first time	Vidio sam to po prvi put
I never heard from him	Nikad se nisam čuo s njim
I still didn't get it	I dalje nisam shvatio
I don't think we ever will	Mislim da nikada nećemo
I must be very tired	Mora da sam jako umoran
It was pretty simple.	To je bilo prilično jednostavno.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
I didn't tell you anything	Nisam ti ništa rekao
That's how it's done.	Tako se to radi.
You have them all.	Imaš ih sve.
I'm so sorry for him	Tako mi je žao zbog njega
I can't do this to you anymore	Ne mogu ti to više raditi
Was she there.	Da li je bila tamo.
She has to go.	Ona mora da ide.
You should go if you're not busy.	Trebao bi ići ako nisi zauzet.
I just didn’t decide how, that’s all	Jednostavno nisam odlučio kako, to je sve
We both know she's not coming back.	Oboje znamo da se ona neće vratiti.
You have to go get it.	Moraš otići po to.
I saw and heard	Video sam i čuo
I know you've never seen him	Znam da ga nikad nisi vidio
The money was not bad.	Novac nije bio loš.
We can't say no.	Ne možemo reći ne.
I think it will be much earlier	Mislim da će to biti mnogo ranije
I don't see myself with him	Ne vidim sebe sa njim
I always saw the truth there, as I do now	Tu sam uvijek vidio istinu, kao i sada
He has done a good job so far.	Do sada je uradio dobar posao.
That's really not a lot of people.	To zaista nije mnogo ljudi.
I was sure it wasn't because of me	Bio sam siguran da to nije zbog mene
I just want to do it.	Samo želim to da uradim.
And it would be easy.	I bilo bi lako.
It only took a little.	Trebalo je samo malo toga.
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
That was probably the reason.	Vjerovatno je to bio razlog.
I mean, really, she doesn't have to know	Mislim, stvarno, ona ne mora da zna
There was no help for that.	Nije bilo pomoći za to.
Not one.	Ni jedan.
I couldn't leave without him	Nisam mogao otići bez njega
There was no reason.	Nije bilo zašto.
I know it couldn't be easy.	Znam da nije moglo biti lako.
We have time.	Imamo vremena.
I just had to know what would happen next	Samo sam morao znati šta će se dalje dogoditi
That's what this is.	To je ono što je ovo.
Besides, no.	Osim toga, ne.
I expected more, much more	Očekivao sam više, mnogo više
I have to go home.	Moram kući.
I’ve known long enough when it’s not good.	Dovoljno sam dugo da znam kada nije dobro.
It seems fine.	Čini se u redu.
I can't really believe it's mine	Ne mogu baš vjerovati da je moja
I told you it would be	Rekao sam ti da će biti
I can not anymore	Ne mogu više
They are not a team.	Oni nisu tim.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.	Žao mi je što sam ja taj koji će ti reći.
I never asked.	Nikada nisam pitao.
It's hard for me to say why.	Teško mi je reći zašto.
I've been there before.	Bio sam tamo ranije.
And, that may be true, but it doesn't have to be.	I, i to može biti istina, ali i ne mora.
And that's the problem.	I to je problem.
I know too many things.	Znam previše stvari.
This was bad.	Ovo je bilo loše.
So it will be.	Tako da će biti.
I wondered what that might say	Pitao sam se šta bi to moglo reći
Yes, she told the truth.	Da, istina je rekla.
I hope you stay	Nadam se da ćeš ostati
I just thought you might know something	Samo sam mislio da možda znaš nešto
Maybe I'm the only one who's not surprised	Možda sam jedini koji nije iznenađen
He knew things that no one could know.	Znao je stvari koje niko nije mogao znati.
I see well.	Vidim dobro.
I still have it.	Još uvek imam to.
I tell him he can get it now	Kažem mu da ga sada može dobiti
I couldn’t believe she was still there	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je još uvijek tu
I love it!.	Volim to!.
I wasn't sick	Nije mi bilo loše
I know something has to be	Znam da nešto mora biti
That's more money for us.	To je više novca za nas.
All the what ifs.	Sve šta ako.
I didn't want to be there	Nisam htela da budem tamo
And we will bring him back.	I mi ćemo ga vratiti.
First, no problem.	Prvi, nema problema.
I have no time.	Nemam vremena.
I know there are many of you there	Znam da vas ima mnogo tamo
And she wants to see you.	I ona želi da te vidi.
And that was today.	I to je bilo danas.
And myself.	I sebi.
I'm like that too.	I ja sam kao.
I had to do this.	Morao sam ovo da uradim.
I want to be alone for that	Želim da budem sama za to
He was still there.	Još je bio tamo.
It was pretty hard.	Bilo je prilično teško.
I did it to you	Ja sam ti to uradio
I didn't mean to do that	Nisam mislio to da uradim
She knew he loved her.	Znala je da je voli.
You will never do that.	Nikad to nećeš učiniti.
I'm sure not	Siguran sam da nije
I need to see you tonight	Moram da te vidim večeras
Nobody loves her.	Niko je ne voli.
I asked him what he saw	Pitao sam ga šta je vidio
I wasn't good.	Nisam bio dobar.
Today was supposed to be a good day.	Danas je trebao biti dobar dan.
It was afternoon.	Bilo je popodne.
He saw more than that.	Video je više od toga.
And she was.	I bila je.
Maybe you're right.	Možda si u pravu.
So many years ago.	Prije toliko godina.
I should have done it earlier	Trebao sam to uraditi ranije
It was easy enough.	Bilo je dovoljno lako.
I thought that might be a good thing	Mislio sam da bi to moglo biti dobro
Long and hard.	Dugo i teško.
I guess she was right	Pretpostavljam da je bila u pravu
They just couldn’t get it fast enough.	Jednostavno ga nisu mogli dobiti dovoljno brzo.
I realized, for the first time	Shvatio sam, po prvi put
Everything was exactly as he expected.	Sve je bilo tačno kako je očekivao.
She has it all.	Ona ima sve.
None of this was done properly.	Ništa od toga nisu uradili kako treba.
Do what you have to.	Uradite ono što morate.
It doesn't look like much, does it?	Ne izgleda mnogo, zar ne.
I didn't even see it.	Nisam to ni vidio.
I mean, there weren't that many.	Mislim, nije ih bilo toliko.
I know how hard it is	Znam koliko je teško
I would have to do everything	Morao bih sve da uradim
What is happening to us is real.	Ono što nam se dešava je stvarno.
I can't come to dinner.	Ne mogu doći na večeru.
You and her.	Ti i ona.
They know the truth.	Oni znaju istinu.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
And it wouldn't.	I ne bi.
I had none of that	Nisam imao ništa od toga
I'll.	Ja ću.
I have nothing.	Nemam ništa.
He couldn't see anyone.	Nije mogao nikoga da vidi.
I have, you have, we all have	Ja imam, ti imaš, svi imamo
I just didn't know that was it	Samo nisam znao da je to to
Nothing about.	Ništa o.
I really like that question.	Stvarno mi se sviđa to pitanje.
We don't.	Mi ne.
.	.
We'll be with him tomorrow.	Sutra ćemo biti s njim.
And maybe it's true.	A možda je i istina.
That's a good thing about it.	To je dobra stvar za to.
I'm not entirely sure yet	Nisam još potpuno siguran
I seemed to like it	Činilo se da mi se sviđa
She didn't tell the truth either.	Ni ona nije rekla istinu.
It could be him.	To bi mogao biti on.
I do not know what.	Ne znam šta.
But it's not good.	Ali nije dobro.
Maybe even better.	Možda čak i bolje.
I want where you are	Želim gdje si ti
I know how it is.	Znam kako je.
Or you would be sorry for me.	Ili bi ti bilo žao mene.
You have to come home.	Moraš doći kući.
He never told you about it.	Nikad ti nije rekao za to.
That was another reason why it is done this way.	To je bio još jedan razlog zašto se to radi na ovaj način.
Please don't do that.	Molim te, nemoj to raditi.
I had no idea who was here and why	Nisam imao pojma ko je ovde i zašto
I have something for him	Imam nešto za njega
Now he knew what it was.	Sada je znao šta je to nešto.
There's not much not to like.	Nema mnogo toga što se ne sviđa.
I've never heard of such a thing before	Nikada ranije nisam čuo za tako nešto
He had a good job and a lot of friends.	Imao je dobar posao i mnogo prijatelja.
I gave him so much.	Toliko sam mu dao.
This simply does not exist.	Ovo jednostavno ne postoji.
Code.	Kod.
I can't say more.	Ne mogu više reći.
More than I thought.	Više sam nego mislio.
I would like him to eat more.	Voleo bih da jede više.
I know who these people are	Znam ko su ti ljudi
I didn't have to be here	Nisam morao da budem ovde
I can't see him this way	Ne mogu da ga vidim na ovaj način
You have to stay here.	Moraš ostati ovdje.
I don't see how it will help me anymore.	Ne vidim kako će mi više pomoći.
I think he did it.	Mislim da je to radio.
I want to go home and	Želim ići kući i
He needed money.	Trebao mu je novac.
I was happy to do that.	Bio sam sretan što sam to uradio.
I couldn’t believe that was it	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je to to
And it was.	I bilo je.
And it works well.	I radi dobro.
Nothing happened to us.	Ništa nam se nije dogodilo.
Someone had to do it	Neko je to morao da uradi
That must have happened to us.	To nam se sigurno dogodilo.
He won't be home.	Neće biti kod kuće.
I need to know if you are	Moram da znam da li jesi
I will always be there for you	Uvek ću biti tu za tebe
I've told you many times	Rekao sam ti mnogo puta
I would love to stay here again!	Volio bih ostati ovdje ponovo!
Maybe he's there.	Možda je tamo.
It doesn't work that way.	Ne radi na taj način.
I just saw that.	Upravo sam to vidio.
I saw you.	Vidio sam te.
I felt sorry for him	Bilo mi ga je žao
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
Maybe very soon.	Možda vrlo brzo.
A little about us.	Malo o nama.
It just won’t happen.	To se jednostavno neće dogoditi.
Nobody can do anything.	Niko ne može ništa.
I thought of that myself	I sam sam na to mislio
There was little to talk about.	Bilo je malo o čemu se priča.
I could tell he was looking for someone	Mogao sam reći da je tražio nekoga
But it could only be me.	Ali to bih mogao biti samo ja.
Something is wrong here.	Ovdje nešto nije u redu.
They can't help it.	Oni ne mogu pomoći.
I didn't know what to say or do	Nisam znao šta da kažem ili uradim
I can't say what he thinks	Ne mogu reći šta on misli
I just realized.	Upravo sam shvatio.
This cannot happen here.	Ovdje se to ne može dogoditi.
I knew it was day	Znao sam da je to bio dan
But there were too many of them.	Ali previše ih je bilo.
He said he loved us.	Rekao je da nas voli.
I have so little time.	Imam tako malo vremena.
I couldn't say exactly what he was doing	Nisam mogao tačno reći šta je radio
It was never enough.	Nikada nije bilo dovoljno.
I didn’t want to do anything more with it.	Nisam htio ništa više da radim s tim.
I know you wouldn't.	Znam da ne bi.
I never told him	Nikad mu nisam rekao
It's not, and it still works.	Nije, i još uvijek radi.
I didn't even buy anything	Nisam ni kupio ništa
It exists to this day.	Postoji do danas.
I'll tell you when we do	Reći ću vam kada to uradimo
There is no way.	Ne postoji način.
I mean, I'm sure he can be good	Mislim, siguran sam da može biti dobar
It must be done properly.	Mora da se uradi kako treba.
I may not like her, but she can	Možda mi se ne sviđa, ali ona to može
I didn’t mean like the people there	Nisam mislio kao ljudi tamo
I didn't have to go.	Nisam morao da idem.
Tell the truth.	Reci istinu.
You never heard of me.	Nikad nisi čuo za mene.
You are mine.	Ti si moja.
How do I do that?	Kako da to uradim?
He won't be around much longer.	Neće biti tu još dugo.
I needed to find a new job	Trebao sam naći novi posao
Either way.	Na bilo koji način.
She says yes.	Ona kaže da.
Maybe not.	Možda neće.
But no one is right.	Ali niko nije u pravu.
He did so the following year.	Učinio je to sljedeće godine.
I'll stay with you	Ja ću ostati s tobom
I did not know what to say	Nisam znao šta da kažem
You know everything.	Znaš sve.
I doubt everything and everything	Sumnjam na sve i na sve
I can never go back	Nikad se ne mogu vratiti
And it was just a job.	I to je bio samo posao.
I had it.	Imao sam ga.
You can never get it back.	Nikada ga ne možeš vratiti.
I've never seen her before tonight	Nikad je ranije večeras nisam video
I don't know how much.	Ne znam koliko.
I love you for that.	Volim te zbog toga.
I thought you'd be here	Mislio sam da ćeš biti ovdje
I didn't see why we didn't do just that	Nisam vidio zašto ne radimo baš to
Or for yourself.	Ili za sebe.
I beg for more.	Više toga molim.
I thought you wanted her to know	Mislio sam da želiš da ona zna
We are not these people.	Mi nismo ti ljudi.
I doubt it was a bad life	Sumnjam da to nije bio loš život
It works well.	To dobro radi.
It's going so fast.	To ide tako brzo.
Not yet.	Ne još.
I didn't want to see her	Nisam je htio vidjeti
I guess that's just the thing	Pretpostavljam da je to samo stvar
I guess they always were	Pretpostavljam da su uvek bili
You can give it back to us.	Možete nam vratiti.
I can't see that happening.	Ne mogu da vidim da se to dešava.
I won't be better.	Neću biti bolje.
He wants me now.	Želi me odmah.
I'll tell you something	Reći ću ti nešto
I'm sorry about him.	Žao mi je zbog njega.
There really is a little more to be said.	Zaista ima malo više da se kaže.
We can't say for tomorrow.	Ne možemo reći za sutra.
I can't talk to you right now	Ne mogu razgovarati s tobom sada
I just decided today	Upravo sam se danas odlučio
Maybe I'd like to do that	Možda bih želeo da to uradim
I know why you did what you did today	Znam zašto si uradio to što si uradio danas
But like you said, this is not what you want.	Ali kao što ste rekli, ovo nije ono što želite.
He also lost his job.	Izgubio je i posao.
But obviously not.	Ali očigledno nije tako.
I just know it was.	Ja samo znam da je bilo.
That will happen.	To će se dogoditi.
He is for you.	On je za tebe.
I want to do it so much	Toliko želim da to uradim
I knew it was too easy	Znao sam da je bilo previše lako
What you want to do for you is there.	Ono što želite da uradite za vas je tu.
No one came to the door.	Niko nije došao na vrata.
Please say yes.	Molim te reci da.
That must have been it.	Mora da je to bilo to.
You don't work tomorrow.	Ne radiš sutra.
They have been with me for a long time.	Oni su sa mnom dugo vremena.
I hope it will.	Nadam se da hoće.
I have to do things my way	Moram da radim stvari na svoj način
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
That seems very likely.	To izgleda vrlo vjerovatno.
I've never seen him play better	Nikada ga nisam video da igra bolje
What is, is.	Šta jeste, jeste.
I didn't expect to ever see you again	Nisam očekivao da ću te ikada više vidjeti
I asked her what she was talking about	Pitao sam je o čemu priča
We had almost nothing.	Nismo imali skoro ništa.
I haven't seen them in a while.	Nisam ih vidio neko vrijeme.
I just knew who you were	Samo sam znao ko si ti
I should never have come back	Nikad se nisam trebao vratiti
I just wanted to talk to you	Samo sam htio razgovarati s tobom
I can tell you what you think.	Mogu reći šta misliš.
I haven't made it yet	Još ga nisam napravio
I saw all that stuff	Vidio sam sve te stvari
He is my father.	On je moj otac.
I shouldn't hope	Ne bih trebao da se nadam
I knew he wasn't my father	Znao sam da mi nije otac
We would all be better off.	Svima bi nam bilo bolje.
Actually, it's not that bad.	Zapravo i nije tako loše.
This is not the time for that.	Ovo nije vrijeme za to.
So it was easy.	Tako da je bilo lako.
Everyone who was here knew about it.	Svi koji su bili ovde su znali za to.
I had to be busy	Morao sam biti zauzet
I do not know exactly.	Ne znam tačno.
I have to come and give you this	Moram doći i dati ti ovo
I haven't seen it before	Nisam to ranije vidio
It was not easy.	To nije bilo lako.
I almost didn't come, you know	Skoro da nisam došao, znaš
I'll tell him what happened	Reći ću mu šta se dogodilo
I may have to do it again	Možda ću morati ponovo
I'm sorry I didn't do that.	Žao mi je što to nisam uradio.
They are not there.	Nisu tamo.
It's not there.	To nije tamo.
I thought that was a pretty good way to do it	Mislio sam da je to prilično dobar način da se to uradi
I had everything to myself	Imao sam sve samo za sebe
But they know there are people here.	Ali oni znaju da ovdje ima ljudi.
I wonder if he knows	Pitam se da li zna
I'm ready for something.	Spreman sam za nešto.
I'm sure it is.	Siguran sam da jeste.
But he's really not a bad guy.	Ali on zaista nije loš momak.
I've never heard of such a thing	Nikad nisam čuo za tako nešto
One by one.	Jedan po jedan.
I have nothing to say to any of you.	Nemam šta da kažem nikome od vas.
I never saw him again.	Nikad ga više nisam vidio.
Everything works for now.	Za sada sve radi.
Not good.	Nije dobro.
I seem to have come at a bad time	Čini se da sam došao u loše vrijeme
He just wasn't in it.	On jednostavno nije bio u tome.
indeed.	zaista.
For you as well as for me.	Za tebe kao i za mene.
The problem is that this is not true.	Problem je što to nije istina.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
Yes, he says.	Da, kaže on.
I never saw her again	Nikad je više nisam video
I never had to tell everyone what we did	Nikada nisam trebao svima reći šta smo uradili
I have not yet decided how to do this	Nisam još odlučio kako da ovo uradim
So that's fine.	Tako da je u redu.
He wanted everything.	Želeo je sve.
I just couldn't reach him	Jednostavno nisam mogao do njega
So far so good.	Za sada dobro.
He said again.	Ponovo je rekao.

I loved her very much	Mnogo sam je voleo
I want it as much as you do	Želim to koliko i ti

I told you and I already told you	Rekao sam ti i već sam ti rekao
That's why you came.	Zbog toga si došao.
This works fine for me.	Ovo mi dobro ide.
That was pretty safe.	To je bilo prilično sigurno.
I didn't know what was going on	Nisam znao šta se dešava
No, I can't do that.	Ne, ne mogu to učiniti.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
Always has been, always will be.	Uvek je bilo, uvek će biti.
I will never see her again	Nikad je više neću vidjeti
Just do it.	Samo uradi to.
And he must have known that.	I on je to sigurno znao.
I have no idea, really	Nemam pojma, stvarno
You know, he'd just come back for us.	Znaš, samo bi se vratio po nas.
I know what you're going to say	Znam šta ćeš reći
I wasn't sick	Nije mi bilo loše
I'm sure of it.	Siguran sam u to.
I heard them.	Čuo sam ih.
I just can't do it	Ja to jednostavno ne mogu
You really can do it.	Ti to zaista možeš.
Difficult question.	Teško pitanje.
It's just a matter of time.	To je samo pitanje vremena.
I know it could only be tonight	Znam da bi to moglo biti samo večeras
Now there is.	Sada ima.
I looked like him	Izgledao sam kao on
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I know you wouldn't.	Znam da ne bi.
I thought you wanted me	Mislio sam da me želiš
I just didn't know exactly how it was going to happen	Samo nisam znao kako će se to tačno dogoditi
I still couldn't believe it was him	Još uvijek nisam mogao vjerovati da je to bio on

I can see him.	Mogu ga vidjeti.
He is with us.	On je sa nama.
She was nothing.	Ona je bila ništa.
And you weren't there this morning.	A jutros te još uvijek nije bilo.
What? 	Šta?
I think that's what we have to do.	Mislim da je to ono što moramo učiniti.
he said.	on je rekao.
But it wasn't supposed to be him.	Ali to nije trebao biti on.
Yes, you are.	Da, da jesi.
I have no idea what they could be.	Nemam pojma šta bi oni mogli biti.
I have to be with him	Moram biti s njim
No one could see anything.	Niko ništa nije mogao da vidi.
I need to know that's not true	Moram da znam da to nije istina
And a good thing.	I dobra stvar.
He said you would tell me.	Rekao je da ćeš mi reći.
That is not life.	To nije život.
I know you will.	Znam da hoćeš.
He has me.	On me ima.
I have a busy life.	Imam zauzet život.
He should do what he wants.	Trebalo bi da radi šta hoće.
And it was true.	I bila je istina.
So very, very tired.	Tako veoma, veoma umoran.
I wasn't very happy.	Nisam bio baš sretan.
It could be you too.	To bi mogao biti i ti.
I think you can trust him	Mislim da mu možeš vjerovati

There was plenty of that too.	Bilo je i toga dosta.
This is all.	To je sve.
And I often wondered	I ja sam se često pitao

That's why they're here.	Zbog toga su tu.
But you came.	Ali ti si došao.
I can't really say.	Ne mogu stvarno reći.

I just couldn’t believe how fast it happened.	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati koliko se brzo to dogodilo.
I've heard too much about it before	Već sam čuo previše o tome
Just for this and this.	Samo za ovo i ovo.

I knew exactly who she was	Tačno sam znao ko je ona
He will surely come.	Sigurno će doći.
And what it looks like today.	I kako to danas izgleda.

There were a lot of problems with that.	Bilo je dosta problema s tim.
I thought it was just me.	Mislio sam da sam samo ja.

It’s not as simple as you think.	Nije tako jednostavno kao što mislite.
There is .	Postoji .

I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.	Žao mi je, ne možemo ništa učiniti.
Who knew what was going on.	Ko je znao šta se dešava.

I just arrived first	Upravo sam stigao prvi

They didn't know.	Nisu znali.
I'm really bad.	Zaista sam loš.
I don't know anything about myself	Ne znam ništa o sebi

We could never see it properly.	Nikada to nismo mogli vidjeti kako treba.
No, not all of them.	Ne, ne svi.
I guess this will be enough	Pretpostavljam da će ovo biti dovoljno
I still had no idea what he was talking about	Još nisam imao pojma o čemu priča
And that can't be bad, right?	I to ne može biti loše, zar ne?
We know exactly where the problem was.	Tačno znamo gdje je bio problem.
But that's all.	Ali to je sve.
That's what he did.	To je on uradio.
I think you should.	Mislim da bi trebao.
I did it all myself	Sve sam to uradio sam
Maybe not him either.	Možda nije ni on.
If so, where.	Ako je tako, gdje.
The money is there.	Novac je tu.
I can't tell you what's going to happen	Ne mogu vam reći šta će se dogoditi
But obviously not.	Ali očigledno nije.
This was supposed to go more.	Ovo je trebalo da ide više.
But there was more.	Ali bilo je još toga.
My father.	Moj otac.
He would leave.	On bi otišao.
I can do it, he told himself.	Ja to mogu, rekao je sebi.
I'll meet you there.	Naći ćemo se tamo.
But not so simple.	Ali ne tako jednostavno.
I didn’t have much to say about it	Nisam imao previše da kažem o tome
I don't want help.	Ne želim pomoć.
I already had one meeting	Već sam imao jedan sastanak
He needed this.	Ovo je trebao.
I thought he would never come back	Mislio sam da se nikada neće vratiti

But it's hard.	Ali teško je.
He doesn't want to leave.	On ne želi da ode.
He will surely come tonight.	Večeras će sigurno doći.
I couldn't tell where	Nisam mogao reći gdje
You should know that.	Trebao bi to znati.
He just told me he wanted to see us right away.	Upravo mi je rekao da želi da nas vidi odmah.
This should be a good thing.	Ovo bi trebalo da bude dobra stvar.
I better have done this	Bilo mi je bolje da sam ovo uradio
I wasn't sure if they were right	Nisam bio siguran da li su bili u pravu
I didn't hear you come	Nisam te čuo da si došao
I need someone who really wants to help me	Treba mi neko ko zaista želi da mi pomogne
What's happening?.	Šta se dešava?.
He told me how he felt.	Rekao mi je kako se osjeća.
It was your first date.	Bio je to tvoj prvi sastanak.
With .	Sa .
This is not so.	Ovo nije tako.
I must have done something.	Mora da sam nešto uradio.
Do so.	Uraditi tako.
I don't know what exactly.	Ne znam šta tačno.
All right.	U redu.
Very busy.	Veoma zauzet.
I want to see what he sees	Želim da vidim šta on vidi
A little earlier.	Malo ranije.
You didn't do it with more people.	Nisi to uradio sa više ljudi.
He had never seen him before.	Nikad ga prije nije vidio.
But not everyone is so sure.	Ali nisu svi tako sigurni.
I don't know what you are.	Ne znam šta si ti.
I can't believe she's gone	Ne mogu vjerovati da je nema
I really wish this hadn’t happened	Zaista bih volio da se ovo nije dogodilo
I had never been so glad to be home before.	Nikad mi ranije nije bilo tako drago što sam se vratio kući.
I can't be.	Ne mogu biti.
I never asked for this	Nikad nisam tražio ovo
Everything is OK.	Sve je u redu.
I don't think that's right.	Mislim da to nije u redu.
I won't be able to go to work	Neću moći na posao
They will tell us.	Oni će nam reći.
That was the first time.	To je bilo prvi put.
I can never tell you how much.	Nikad ti ne mogu reći koliko.
I need more from you, from us	Treba mi više od tebe, od nas
We have him.	Imamo ga.
I don't want anything more from him	Ne želim više ništa s njim
You have to go, he said.	Moraš ići, rekao je.
Look, he can't tell me.	Vidi, ne može mi reći.
I'm here for you.	Tu sam za tebe.
We should have known.	Trebali smo znati.
I wasn't sure he could be trusted	Nisam bio siguran da mu se može vjerovati
I haven't done anything good here.	Nisam uradio ništa dobro ovde.
That's it.	To je to.
Like it’s too hard to say more.	Kao da je previše teško reći više.
But it still doesn't work.	Ali i dalje ne radi.
How long have we been there.	Koliko dugo smo tamo.
We have to do something right.	Mora da radimo nešto kako treba.
So far it hasn't.	Do sada nije.
It's not very difficult.	Nije mnogo teško.
I did what you asked	Radio sam ono što si tražio
I was getting better at it	Bio sam sve bolji u tome
I saw right away that you were not like them.	Odmah sam vidio da nisi kao oni.
And don't speak.	I ne govori.
I can do this, no problem	Mogu ja ovo, nema problema
I got it.	Shvatio sam to.
It could have been very bad.	Moglo je biti jako loše.
I only have this one	Imam samo ovaj
I always am.	Ja sam uvek.
Just one problem.	Samo jedan problem.
I saw that he felt something too	Vidio sam da i on nešto osjeća
Maybe we were a lot of people.	Možda smo bili mnogo ljudi.
I mean, we need money, but not so much	Mislim, treba nam novac, ali ne toliko
I knew it was me, always me	Znao sam da sam to ja, uvijek ja
I didn’t know when and how it was going to happen	Nisam znao kada i kako će se to dogoditi
Do either or.	Uradite bilo ili.
In fact, no, that wouldn’t happen.	Zapravo, ne, to se ne bi dogodilo.
So easy.	Tako lako.
Let's do it again.	Uradimo to ponovo.
I didn't want that.	Nisam to htela.
We would be much better off without him.	Bilo bi nam mnogo bolje bez njega.
I'm tired of seeing him.	Umoran sam da ga vidim.
Everything is true	Sve je tačno
And like that.	I kao to.
I can't bring it back now	Ne mogu to vratiti sada
I had no idea what my problem was	Nisam imao pojma šta je moj problem
I don't know what's going on there	Ne znam šta se tamo dešava
I didn't want to go and I said	Nisam htela da idem i rekla sam
I want real money.	Želim pravi novac.
I can not anymore	Ne mogu više
But you didn't.	Ali nisi.
They didn't do it.	Oni to nisu uradili.
That was true.	To je bila istina.
I haven't done anything in a long time	Dugo nisam ništa radio
I mean, if you're not ready yet.	Mislim, ako još nisi spreman.
Nobody said this.	Ovo niko nije rekao.
I thought it didn't work for me	Mislio sam da ne radi zbog mene
That's my job.	To je moj posao.
It was there too.	Bilo je i tamo.
Very very good.	Jako jako dobar .
I know better than that.	Znam bolje da to radim.
The truth was right.	Istina je bila u pravu.
Yes, that must have been it.	Da, sigurno je to bilo to.
She's like you.	Ona je kao ti.
I'll be there soon.	Doći ću uskoro.
You are alone and you know what you know.	Sami ste i znate šta znate.
I will be with you.	Ja ću biti s tobom.
I will not, never again	Neću, nikad više
That's one.	To je jedan.
We really aren't.	Zaista nismo.
I only do it with you	Ja to radim samo sa tobom
Not a good day for me.	Nije dobar dan za mene.
I guess it's good.	Pretpostavljam da je dobro.
I should know these things.	Trebao bih znati ove stvari.
That we will both.	Da ćemo oboje.
I didn't have to work too hard	Nisam morao previše da radim
I've never seen that.	Nikad to nisam video.
In fact.	U stvari.
As you must.	Kao što moraš.
And here you will find it.	I ovdje ćete ga naći.
Okay, that's it.	U redu, to je to.
But it is true.	Ali to je istina.
He doesn't say anything unless he really has nothing to say.	Ne govori ništa osim ako zaista nema šta da kaže.
I do work.	Ja radim posao.
Say what needs to be said.	Reci šta treba da se kaže.
I don't think so.	Ne mislim tako.
I have so many of you	Imam vas toliko
But you are.	Ali ti jesi.
I just wanted to do it	Samo sam htela da to uradim
I'll leave before tomorrow.	Otići ću prije sutra.
I know you have something	Znam da imaš nešto
I didn't want him to leave	Nisam htela da ode
But he had to work on it.	Ali morao je da radi na tome.
I know it wasn't easy for you	Znam da ti nije bilo lako
You don't have to go together.	Ne morate ići zajedno.
I can't tell you anymore	Ne mogu vam više reći
I never wanted that	Nikad to nisam želeo
I am all of that and none of that	Ja sam sve to i ništa od toga
Which he is not.	Što on nije.
I want everything.	Želim sve.
I came to tell you the truth	Došao sam da vam kažem istinu
Not even that hard.	Čak ni tako teško.
I need help please.	Treba mi pomoć, molim.
I won't do anything for you	Neću ništa učiniti za tebe
He can't come back.	Ne može se vratiti.
I was so happy to see them both.	Bio sam tako sretan što sam ih oboje vidio.
I said it all.	Sve sam rekao.
I can't say what he did with it	Ne mogu reći šta je uradio s tim
That would be enough.	To bi bilo dovoljno.
I didn't want people to not know	Nisam želeo da ljudi ne znaju
I saw he was home	Vidio sam da je kod kuće
And this is still true.	I ovo je još uvijek istina.
Which makes it a lot.	Što ga čini mnogo.
That was it, right there.	To je bilo, upravo tamo.
And made a team.	I napravio tim.
It wasn't bad.	Nije bilo loše.
I love her.	Volim je.
I love you as a friend	Volim te kao prijatelja
I didn't have much time	Nisam imao puno vremena
I was just looking for you	Samo sam tebe tražio
And you know that's true.	I znate da je to istina.
You did what you did.	Uradio si ono što si uradio.
I had none of that	Nisam imao ništa od toga
I'm not the only one	Nisam jedini
And so for us.	I tako i za nas.
He understood that.	To je shvatio.
I didn't know who these people were	Nisam znao ko su ti ljudi
I think you're safe there	Mislim da si tamo siguran
But they know it's there.	Ali oni znaju da je tamo.
If you don’t think so, that’s fine too.	Ako ne mislite tako, i to je u redu.
That carries me.	To me nosi.
Okay, a lot.	U redu, puno.
They were just together.	Jednostavno su bili zajedno.
It was always there.	Uvijek je bilo tu.
And he tells you why.	I on vam kaže zašto.
There was nothing that I could do	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim
He meant it.	On je to mislio.
Could this be your team?	Može li ovo biti tvoj tim?
That will be very soon.	To će biti vrlo brzo.
I'm glad you're okay	Drago mi je da si dobro
I shouldn't have gone to see him	Nisam trebao ići da ga vidim
I think they will.	Mislim da hoće.
But it doesn't work.	Ali ne radi.
He wanted to have fun today.	Želio je da se danas zabavi.
I won't be there either	Ni ja neću biti tamo
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
This is usually not a good idea.	Ovo obično nije dobra ideja.
He said, she's right, you know.	Rekao je, ona je u pravu, znaš.
I would never do anything	Nikad ništa ne bih uradio
I think he realized it was me	Mislim da je shvatio da sam to ja
You know what you want.	Znaš šta želiš.
But he didn't do more.	Ali nije učinio više.
I mean, something happened today	Mislim, nešto se dogodilo danas
Yesterday wasn't so good either.	Ni jučer nije bilo tako dobro.
We both know it's wrong.	Oboje znamo da nije u redu.
He gave me this.	Ovo mi je dao.
Nobody should have told me that.	Niko mi to nije trebao reći.
I'm not that happy.	Nisam toliko sretan.
I had no idea what was going on	Nisam imao pojma šta se dešava
I am very happy here.	Veoma sam sretan ovdje.
And this is what we have to say.	I ovo je ono što imamo za reći.
Nobody can find anything.	Niko ništa ne može naći.
Nobody tells me why.	Niko mi ne govori zašto.
This took time.	Za ovo je trebalo vremena.
We work together.	Radimo zajedno.
I didn't think he could do this	Nisam mislio da može ovo da uradi
I thought that was all.	Mislio sam da je sve.
You are the first.	Ti si prvi.
I didn't know things	Nisam znao stvari
It was hard to see him.	Bilo ga je teško vidjeti.
I have to go.	Mora da idem.
They said that.	Oni su to rekli.
We have to work together.	Moramo da radimo zajedno.
I wonder how old he is	Pitam se koliko ima godina
If only there was one.	Samo da je jedan.
I saw her three days ago	Vidio sam je prije tri dana
I shouldn't have known this.	Nisam trebao ovo da znam.
I think that could happen.	Mislim da bi se to moglo dogoditi.
I really had no idea what to think	Zaista nisam imao pojma šta da mislim
Yes, we have to do it.	Da, moramo to učiniti.
I was alone now	Sada sam bila sama
I think someone told me something.	Mislim da mi je neko rekao nešto.
I need help with this.	Treba mi pomoć za ovo.
It seemed that.	Činilo se da.
Yes, maybe even do it.	Da, možda čak i to uradi.
There was no time for school.	Nije bilo vremena za školu.
It's really not hard.	Zaista nije teško.
It was easy for me.	Bilo mi je lako.
Nobody can tell me anything anymore.	Niko mi više ništa ne može reći.
I know what he's talking about	Znam o čemu priča
He was so good to us.	Bio je tako dobar prema nama.
I still had no idea what he wanted from me	Još nisam imao pojma šta želi od mene
I can't say.	Ne mogu reći.
This was not a problem.	Ovo nije bio problem.
She knows what she knows.	Ona zna šta zna.
But not so fast.	Ali ne tako brzo.
You still don't know anything, but you know you know nothing.	Još uvek ništa ne znaš, ali znaš da ništa ne znaš.
I'm going to do this.	Idem da ovo uradim.
He didn't know if that was true.	Nije znao da li je to istina.
In fact, I didn't like them very much	U stvari, nisam ih mnogo voleo
I guess that's what happened here	Pretpostavljam da se to ovde dogodilo
I'm pretty tired of it	Prilično sam umoran od toga
I have made it many times.	Napravio sam ga puno puta.
I hope soon	Nadam se da će uskoro
There is something else.	Postoji još nešto.
I did this and it works well	Uradio sam ovo i radi dobro
You just have to do it yourself	Samo moraš da uradiš sebe
I have to go home now	Moram ići kući sada
I wouldn't want to see what's there now	Ne bih volio da vidim šta je sada tamo
If she's in it, fine.	Ako je ona u tome, u redu.
And that's a good thing.	I to je dobra stvar.
Don't, don't, don't.	Nemoj, nemoj, nemoj.
He's gone now.	Sada ga nema.
It was like that.	Bilo je kao da.
You wouldn’t be human if you weren’t.	Ne biste bili ljudi da niste.
I have to tell him not to do that.	Moram mu reći da to ne radi.
I didn't know any of that	Nisam znao ništa od toga
I thought it was a pretty good deal	Mislio sam da je to prilično dobar posao
I shouldn't have done that.	Nisam to trebao učiniti.
I've never seen anything like it	Nikad nisam video tako nešto
I know how busy you are	Znam koliko si zauzet
It was a game.	Bila je to igra.
I want to know what's going on	Želim da znam šta se dešava
It's not that he didn't want you.	Nije da te nije želio.
I'll tell you everything	Reći ću ti sve
Easy and safe.	Lako i sigurno.
I'm better.	Bolje mi je.
Just something about that.	Samo nešto o tome.
More people want this job than they can get.	Više ljudi želi ovaj posao nego što ga može dobiti.
I never asked for him	Nikad ga nisam tražio
I'm really sorry you know	Zaista mi je žao što znaš
He didn't really know how to say it.	Nije baš znao kako da to kaže.
Probably not.	Vjerovatno nije.
I don't want to go at all	Uopšte ne želim da idem
It must not be easy to do.	Mora biti da to nije lako učiniti.
If he does anything at all.	Ako uopšte nešto uradi.
It could have been anything.	Moglo je biti bilo šta.
I do things my way, not yours	Ja radim stvari na svoj način, ne na tvoj
It better be.	Bolje da bude.
It happened even this morning.	To se dogodilo čak i jutros.
It's us.	To je nama.
I just want to be with you tonight	Samo želim biti s tobom večeras
We are it.	Mi smo to.
Maybe they're right.	Možda su u pravu.
I had something to do	Imao sam nešto da radim
Not much.	Nema puno toga.
But don't do it that way.	Ali ne radite to tako.
Not even you.	Čak ni ti.
It was easy to see.	Bilo je to lako vidjeti.
I'm glad the job is done	Drago mi je da je posao završio
I know exactly what to do	Znam tačno šta da radim
In fact, we can't.	U stvari, ne možemo.
I'm not sure about this myself.	Ni sam nisam siguran u ovo.
I was, really.	Bio sam, zaista.
Went to work.	Otišao na posao.
But I know better	Ali znam bolje
She wants more.	Ona želi više.
This is simply not good enough.	Ovo jednostavno nije dovoljno dobro.
I am much more than that.	Ja sam mnogo više od toga.
And now we know.	A sada znamo.
Nothing can find him here today.	Danas ga ništa ne može naći ovdje.
I wouldn't know them anymore	Ne bih ih više znao
These are the people who are the problem.	To su ljudi koji su problem.
I certainly can't go back there	Sigurno se ne mogu vratiti tamo
But you can't be both.	Ali ne možete biti oboje.
He is here now and will stay here.	On je sada ovdje i ovdje će ostati.
I didn’t get it, but my friend is right	Nisam to shvatio, ali moj prijatelj je u pravu
That's how I want to have you here.	Tako želim da te imam ovdje.
But that's not your problem.	Ali to nije tvoj problem.
I tried to see who it was	Pokušao sam da vidim ko je to
I'm going with you.	Idem s tobom.
I just finished dinner	Upravo sam završio večeru
It doesn't look real.	Ne izgleda stvarno.
I still said it very well.	I dalje sam to vrlo dobro rekao.
I went to get it this morning	Otišao sam jutros po to
I wondered what they were	Pitao sam se šta su
I didn't hear what they said	Nisam čuo šta su rekli
This is very fast.	Ovo je vrlo brzo.
Maybe that's the only way.	Možda je to jedini način.
I don't know why this would happen.	Ne znam zašto bi se ovo dogodilo.
I won't be here long	Neću biti ovdje još dugo
He did something.	Uradio je nešto.
I knew what was going on	Znao sam šta se dešava
You can't say.	Ne možeš reći.
I'm not saying it can't be done.	Ne kažem da se to ne može uraditi.
And we were a good team.	I bili smo dobar tim.
There was no need to say more.	Nije trebalo više da se kaže.
I didn't expect to see you	Nisam očekivao da te vidim
Maybe a lot, maybe a little.	Možda mnogo, možda malo.
I guess we all do this	Pretpostavljam da svi ovo radimo
Which wasn't long.	Što nije bilo dugo.
I thought you would.	Mislio sam da hoćeš.
But people don't.	Ali ljudi ne.
I think so	Mislim da je bilo tako
I don't know how it happened	Ne znam kako se to dogodilo
But that is no longer thought to be true.	Ali to se više ne misli da je istina.
I thought no one could be there	Mislio sam da niko ne može biti tamo
Or better for that.	Ili bolje za to.
I wonder what she's doing	Pitam se šta ona radi
I think.	Mislim, da.
I think he likes it more than me	Mislim da on to voli više od mene
He knew it was.	Znao je da jeste.
I can do it again.	Mogu to ponovo.
Yes, that could be it.	Da, to bi moglo biti to.
I never have, never will be.	Nikada nisam, nikada neće biti.
I have a lot to tell you, and little time	Imam mnogo da ti kažem, a malo vremena
He was not ready for that at all.	Uopšte nije bio spreman za to.
I hope we always will	Nadam se da ćemo uvek
That has already happened.	To se već dogodilo.
He has everything.	On ima sve.
The sooner the better.	Što ranije, to bolje.
But she knew it before he said it.	Ali ona je to znala prije nego što je to rekao.
I want to know how it is	Želim da znam kako je
I was so sorry for myself	Bilo mi je tako žao sam sebe
I already had something even better	Već sam imao nešto još bolje
I guess you'll get them soon too	Pretpostavljam da ćeš ih i ti uskoro dobiti
I certainly wasn't a good person	Ja sigurno nisam bila dobra osoba
I know it will be fine.	Znam da će biti dobro.
I thought it was really good.	Mislio sam da je stvarno dobro.
Maybe he was just tired.	Možda je samo bio umoran.
If not, there may be a problem.	Ako ne, može doći do problema.
That was not the case with me.	To sa mnom nije bilo tako.
They are.	Oni su.
And you shouldn't.	I ne bi trebalo.
I am now going.	Idem sada.
All because of you.	Sve zbog tebe.
I hope he's there.	Nadam se da je tamo.
I have no idea what's going on	Nemam pojma šta se dešava
You have to trust me.	Morate mi vjerovati.
And I.	I ja.
He told me he would help me.	Rekao mi je da će mi pomoći.
Not today.	Nije danas.
I'm with you.	Ja sam sa tobom.
There seems to be nothing I can do	Čini se da ne mogu ništa da radim
It will not be easy for you.	Neće vam biti lako.
That actually happened.	To se zapravo dogodilo.
This is my friend.	Ovo je moj prijatelj.
I have said that many times	To sam i rekao više puta
I think we have it all	Mislim da imamo sve
Just a few.	Samo nekoliko .
I guess he's pretty good	Pretpostavljam da je prilično dobar
It often is.	Često jeste.
Enough time.	Dovoljno vremena.
I knew nothing about being a father.	Nisam znao ništa o tome da budem otac.
I said what the problem was	Rekao sam šta je problem
Everything that was was there.	Sve što je bilo bilo je tu.
I want you to tell me	Želim da mi kažeš
It just has to happen.	To se jednostavno mora dogoditi.
You've done all you can so far.	Do sada ste uradili sve što ste mogli.
I want to be there for you.	Želim biti tu za tebe.
I want you to have them	Želim da ih imaš
I said it was almost there	Rekao sam da je skoro tu
I've never heard her talk so much.	Nikad je nisam čuo da govori toliko.
But now there is none of that.	Ali sada nema ništa od toga.
It wasn't that much.	Nije bilo toliko.
I knew he didn't want to be there	Znao sam da ne želi biti tamo
I never told anyone about it	Nikad nikome nisam rekao za to
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
I really like it	Stvarno mi se sviđa
You are everything.	Ti si sve.
Not me, no.	Ne ja, ne.
I guess that was the idea	Pretpostavljam da je to bila ideja
That was all.	To je bilo sve.
You didn't do anything.	Nisi ništa uradio.
She was so good.	Bila je tako dobra.
I didn't.	Nisam.
Don't say that.	Ne govori tako.
I knew he loved me.	Znala sam da me voli.
I've never seen it before	Nikada prije nisam vidio
I had it here, I will soon	Imao sam ga ovdje, uskoro sam
Or maybe it wasn't him.	Ili možda to nije bio on.
It may never be.	Može biti da nikada neće biti.
No one asked them.	Niko ih nije pitao.
There you are.	Tu si ti.
I guess you're right.	Pretpostavljam da si u pravu.
I'm fine with that.	U redu sam sa tim.
They did a lot of that.	Uradili su dosta toga.
And I asked about it	I ja sam pitao o tome
They really were.	Zaista su bili.
I really don't want to know.	Zaista ne želim da znam.
I had no money or friends	Nisam imao ni novca ni prijatelja
There was not enough time.	Nije bilo dovoljno vremena.
I didn't mean any of that	Nisam mislio ništa od toga
And it's not just me.	I nisam samo ja.
Nothing does that today.	Ništa danas to ne radi.
I'm not sure if that's a problem or not.	Nisam siguran da li je to problem ili ne.
Like us.	Kao i mi.
I don't want to go there again	Ne želim da idem tamo ponovo
It never did.	Nikad nije.
And he was there.	I on je bio tamo.
Maybe I could give you that reason	Možda bih ti mogao dati taj razlog
I've been there many times	Bio sam tamo mnogo puta
There is no time for that.	Nema vremena za to.
You don't need a reason.	Ne treba razlog.
I hadn't heard her say that before	Nisam je čuo ranije da to govori
I could no longer go to work or school	Nisam više mogao da idem ni na posao ni u školu
I needed something real	Trebalo mi je nešto stvarno
What works for me may not work for you.	Ono što radi kod mene možda neće raditi za vas.
I probably didn’t say it the right way	Vjerovatno nisam to rekao na pravi način
I never thought it was that bad	Nikad nisam mislio da je tako loše
Yes, it works.	Da, radi.
I didn't ask.	Nisam pitao.
I think we will be fine	Mislim da ćemo biti dobro
I've never had a problem	Nikad nisam imao problema
I had no idea who he was	Nisam imao pojma ko je on
He knew how he could help.	Znao je kako može pomoći.
I heard what happened	Čuo sam šta se dogodilo
.	.
I know that very well	Znam to jako dobro
Not a little.	Ni malo.
I had no idea what was going to happen	Nisam imao pojma šta će se dogoditi
I have to make sure she's okay	Moram biti siguran da je ona dobro
We have to be there.	Moramo biti tamo.
That would not be a problem.	To ne bi bio problem.
If he really loved me, he would never have done this.	Da me je zaista volio, nikada ovo ne bi uradio.
Nothing is as it seems.	Ništa nije kako izgleda.
What you can and may not want.	Što možete, a možda i ne želite.
I would love to do that.	Voleo bih to da uradim.
You should go there too.	I ti bi trebao otići tamo.
I just want to say this	Samo želim ovo da kažem
I went to see him this morning	Otišao sam da ga vidim jutros
I could tell he knew that too	Mogao sam reći da je i on to znao
Yes yes yes.	Da da da .
He probably needs money.	Verovatno mu treba novac.
We can't do that.	Ne možemo to da uradimo.
I know, you didn't mean it that way	Znam, nisi tako mislio
I don't know what exactly.	Ne znam šta tačno.
The question is how to do it.	Pitanje je kako to učiniti.
Indeed, we did not know what it was about.	Zaista, nismo znali o čemu se radi.
Yes, this really happened.	Da, ovo se zaista dogodilo.
There is a reason for that.	Za to postoji razlog.
I'll come see you	Doći ću da te vidim
you have to come to me.	morate doći kod mene.
That wasn't a problem either.	Ni to nije bio problem.
They couldn't help it.	Nisu mogli pomoći.
Like you said.	Kako si rekao.
I was sure it was him	Bio sam siguran da je to on
And there's a reason for that.	I postoji razlog za to.
This says a lot.	Ovo puno govori.
It could just be me.	To bih mogao biti samo ja.
You will go together.	Ići ćete zajedno.
It should work fine.	Trebalo bi dobro raditi.
Maybe you should.	Možda bi trebalo.
He didn't want to talk to anyone right now.	Trenutno nije želio ni sa kim razgovarati.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
That's the problem, she thinks.	To je problem, misli ona.
I still want him	Još ga sada želim
You know it's not.	Znaš da nije.
That's what he did.	To je on uradio.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
Little by little.	Malo pomalo.
He said again that he was sorry.	Ponovo je rekao da mu je žao.
They couldn’t do enough for us.	Nisu mogli učiniti dovoljno za nas.
Maybe we should.	Možda bi trebali.
I couldn't see how he could	Nisam mogao da vidim kako je mogao
It must be seen.	Mora se vidjeti.
It should be simple.	Trebalo bi da bude jednostavno.
I'm really glad to see you	Zaista mi je drago da te vidim
I didn't know you had so much in you	Nisam znao da imaš toliko toga u sebi
But maybe they are.	Ali možda oni.
And it was him.	I to je bio on.
Certainly not.	Sigurno nisu.
No, you better not.	Ne, bolje nemoj.
It does not exist.	Ne postoji.
I asked what we were doing	Pitao sam šta mi to radimo
That was not the case.	To nije bilo tako.
I have to do it.	Moram da uradim.
It must be so.	Mora biti tako.
Except when there is.	Osim kada postoji.
I didn't have a job.	Nisam imao posao.
That's exactly what we did.	Upravo to smo i uradili.
I was sure of it	Bio sam siguran u to
I hardly need to be told	Teško da mi treba reći
I hope everyone is fine	Nadam se da su svi dobro
I know it can't be easy	Znam da ne može biti lako
He knew more.	Znao je više.
I don't know why, but they know.	Ne znam zašto, ali znaju.
So it took so long now.	Tako da je sada trebalo toliko vremena.
I've never seen your car	Nikad nisam video tvoj auto
He had everything we needed.	Imao je sve što nam je trebalo.
I know that's not allowed	Znam da to nije dozvoljeno
I haven't been here that long either	Ni ja nisam bio ovdje toliko dugo
I didn't finish it	Nisam ga završio
And saw him there.	I vidio ga tamo.
I just need to see something	Jednostavno moram nešto vidjeti
I was so happy to get it.	Bio sam tako sretan što sam ga dobio.
If you know, you know.	Ako znaš, znaš.
I just thought you should know	Samo sam mislio da bi trebao znati
He wondered if she knew that.	Pitao se da li ona to zna.
I would like to work again	Voleo bih ponovo da radim
I seemed to know what to do with it	Činilo se da znam šta da radim s tim
Maybe that would be good for us.	Možda bi to bilo dobro za nas.
He's good at it.	Dobar je u tome.
And for you, obviously.	I za tebe, očigledno.
But even that was not enough.	Ali ni to nije bilo dovoljno.
I'm always alone, really alone	Uvek sam sama, zaista sama
And now I'm on.	I sada sam na.
You have to help him.	Moraš mu pomoći.
Not if he can wait.	Ne ako može da čeka.
There was so little time, and so much to say.	Bilo je tako malo vremena, a toliko toga za reći.
You just don't know it.	Vi to jednostavno ne znate.
He wanted to.	On je htio.
I wonder why that is	Pitam se zašto je to tako
I think it probably is.	Mislim da verovatno jeste.
I hope you all will be fine.	Nadam se da će vam svima biti dobro.
I don't know what, not even today	Ne znam šta, ni dan danas
It was you.	To si bio ti.
That cannot be true.	To ne može biti istina.
This was okay with me	Ovo je bilo u redu sa mnom
I didn't know why he did it	Nisam znao zašto je to uradio
It was what it was.	Bilo je ono što je bilo.
I didn't have any money either	Ni ja nisam imao novca
And it works.	I radi.
Better than nothing.	Bolje nego ništa.
But tonight he was tired.	Ali večeras je bio umoran.
Do your job.	Radi svoj posao.
We are human.	Mi smo ljudi.
I saw for myself that it was true	Vidio sam i sam da je to istina
It was good the first time.	Bilo je dobro prvi put.
I didn't want him to think of me.	Nisam htela da misli na mene.
I didn't know what he was saying	Nisam znao šta govori
It wasn't three yet.	Još nije bilo tri.
I really didn't know what to say	Zaista nisam znao šta da kažem
Any of that.	Bilo šta od toga.
I started to wonder.	Počeo sam da se pitam.
I think you already know why	Mislim da već znate zašto
I'm too sorry.	Previše mi je žao.
He didn't think of anything.	Nije mislio ni na šta.
I could do something better	Mogao bih uraditi nešto bolje
I haven't been there in a long time	Nisam bio tamo dugo vremena
Here is my problem with it.	Ovdje je moj problem s tim.
I'm glad you're with us again	Drago mi je što ste ponovo sa nama
I know the team will be fine without me.	Znam da će tim biti dobro bez mene.
I almost knew what it was	Skoro sam znao šta je to
And you can see why.	I možete vidjeti zašto.
Did this really happen? He says.	Da li se ovo zaista dogodilo?, kaže on.
I couldn't tell you that.	Ne bih vam to mogao reći.
I want to do these things	Želim da radim ove stvari
But you're the only one who could.	Ali ti si jedini koji je mogao.
I couldn't do that to us	Nisam mogao to da nam uradim
Or maybe it is.	Ili možda jeste.
That in itself is not a problem.	To samo po sebi nije problem.
I didn't know how much until now	Nisam znao koliko do sada
I asked him if something was wrong	Pitao sam ga da li nešto nije u redu
I didn't want to do that	Nisam htela to da uradim
Maybe he should have done it.	Možda je to trebalo da uradi.
I'm glad that's so.	Drago mi je da je tako.
I doubt he'll be surprised	Sumnjam da će biti iznenađen
I need to see her in a minute	Moram da je vidim za malo
It's not hard, just for a long time.	Nije teško, samo dugo.
It's not thirty yet.	Još nema trideset.
There aren't that many of them.	Nema ih toliko.
I can't help you there	Tu ti ne mogu pomoći
I love what we do here	Volim ono što radimo ovdje
But it happened.	Ali to se dogodilo.
It's not us.	To nismo mi.
I could even tell you about it	Mogao bih ti čak i reći o tome
I think it could be good	Mislim da bi moglo biti dobro
He says he wants a job.	Kaže da želi posao.
And so it looked.	I tako je izgledao.
Now that he had.	Sada kada je imao.
I didn't know what to tell him.	Nisam znao šta da mu kažem.
I lost everything there	Izgubio sam sve tamo
I won't tell you anything.	Neću ti ništa reći.
Maybe he got lost when he came.	Možda se izgubio kada je došao.
And he probably will.	I vjerovatno hoće.
Everyone said to ask you.	Svi su rekli da te pitam.
It was okay.	Bilo je u redu.
I thought it could have been you	Mislio sam da si to mogao biti ti
But we can't do without you.	Ali ne možemo bez vas.
But it's not just that.	Ali nije samo to.
I guess he was good at it.	Pretpostavljam da je u tome bio dobar.
Yes, it's all there.	Da, sve je tu.
You should talk to him about it.	Morao bi razgovarati s njim o tome.
But everyone knew what it was and who it was.	Ali svi su znali šta je i ko je.
I was glad he came back	Bilo mi je drago što se vratio
He's like a father to me.	On mi je kao otac.
Maybe we should.	Možda bi trebali.
I'm not sure what the reason was	Nisam siguran šta je bio razlog
It's good to be here.	Dobro je biti ovdje.
There is a lot to do	Ima dosta toga da se uradi
I hope that.	Nadam se da.
I know him well enough	Znam ga dovoljno dobro
I didn't expect to go beyond that	Nisam očekivao da ću ići dalje od toga
But he didn't want to do it.	Ali on to nije htio učiniti.
I have no idea what those things are	Nemam pojma šta su to stvari
I just need time for myself	Samo mi treba vremena za sebe
He couldn't do that.	On to nije mogao.
I think maybe he still loves her	Mislim da je možda još voli
We did something together.	Uradili smo nešto zajedno.
But we are human too.	Ali i mi smo ljudi.
There is still work to be done here.	Ovdje još treba raditi.
I needed more than that	Trebalo mi je više od toga
I hope it helps you.	Nadam se da će ti pomoći.
I know we will never be sure	Znam da nikada nećemo biti sigurni
I have no idea if that's true.	Nemam pojma da li je to istina.
I was a good guy.	Bio sam dobar momak.
I will know.	Ja ću znati.
Or someone could.	Ili bi neko mogao.
We will never know if we were right or not.	Nikada nećemo znati da li smo bili u pravu ili ne.
Everything is wrong with you.	Nije sve u redu s tobom.
But that's all.	Ali to je sve.
I ask if it really works.	Pitam da li stvarno radi.
She just lives her life.	Ona samo živi svoj život.
Do my job.	Radi moj posao.
I better know this	Bilo mi je bolje da znam ovo
It's okay if you don't want to tell me why.	U redu je ako ne želiš da mi kažeš zašto.
That way is safe.	Taj način je siguran.
I should have known better	trebao sam znati bolje
It looked like a good day.	Izgledao je kao dobar dan.
He wasn't sure how he felt either.	Ni on nije bio siguran kako se osjeća.
See if anyone saw him.	Vidi da li ga je neko video.
And without money.	I to bez novca.
He does almost everything right.	On skoro sve radi kako treba.
Only this morning.	Samo jutros.
I don't even know anymore.	Više ni ne znam.
All of you.	Svi vi.
You want to be there.	Želiš biti tamo.
I have no idea what she's talking about	Nemam pojma o čemu ona priča
A little too much, obviously	Malo previše, očigledno
The question is why.	Pitanje je zašto.
I want my life.	Želim svoj život.
He came alone.	Došao je sam.
I must have done both.	Sigurno sam uradio oboje.
I haven't even seen him yet	Nisam ga još ni vidio
There are a lot.	Ima ih puno.
No one was expecting him this morning.	Jutros ga niko nije očekivao.
I had to do it.	Morao sam to uraditi.
I was happy about that	Bio sam sretan zbog toga
I've never had it before	Nikada ga ranije nisam imao
Drive one day.	Vozi jedan dan.
I was fine with that	Bio sam u redu sa tim
Nothing could happen.	Ništa nije moglo.
I had no idea it was that long	Nisam imao pojma da je tako dugo
He wants to go with you.	Želi ići s tobom.
I can do this if you want	Mogu ovo da uradim ako želiš
There was something.	Nešto je bilo.
And that's not a problem for me at all.	I to mi uopšte nije problem.
I have to do this now	Moram ovo da uradim sada
I doubt we could.	Sumnjam da bismo mogli.
I can't come now, not today	Ne mogu doći sada, ne danas
But it was really hard.	Ali bilo je zaista teško.
You need it.	Treba ti.
I mean really really bad.	Mislim stvarno jako loše.
I already know what happened	Već znam šta se dogodilo
To me.	Do mene.
I'm really sorry.	Zaista mi je jako žao.
Too much, actually.	Previše, zapravo.
I guess he was right	Pretpostavljam da je bio u pravu
I'm not sure how to do it.	nisam siguran kako to učiniti.
I couldn't be either	Nisam ni ja mogao biti
It was hard to find time.	Bilo je teško naći vremena.
I mean, you gave me everything	Mislim dao si mi sve
And so it is.	I to je tako.
They know what it's like.	Oni znaju kako je to.
I can't talk about it	Ne mogu o tome
I can't be.	Ne mogu biti.
I would never do anything	Nikada ne bih ni za šta
She was really great.	Bila je zaista veoma .
Not much more.	Ne još mnogo.
I was there last night	Bila sam tamo sinoć
I couldn't see her yet	Nisam je još mogao vidjeti
Your father.	Tvoj otac.
You can't help yourself.	Ne možete si pomoći.
No more than he saw himself.	Ne više nego što je video sebe.
I have done that.	Uradio sam to.
I just thought you should know the truth	Samo sam mislio da treba da znaš istinu
He is no longer with us.	On više nije sa nama.
I couldn't help you	Ne bih ti mogao pomoći
But I saw it.	Ali video to.
I've never been.	Nikad nisam bio.
I didn't know how long	Nisam znao koliko dugo
I think your team is your team	Mislim da je tvoj tim tvoj tim
I didn't hear that.	Nisam to čuo.
No, it can't be.	Ne, ne može biti.
I'm sorry this happened to you	Žao mi je što ti se ovo dogodilo
That just doesn’t happen here.	To se ovdje jednostavno ne dešava.
I was not well	Nije mi bilo dobro
They won't get it.	Oni to neće dobiti.
I just can't buy it	Jednostavno ne mogu to kupiti
Or mine.	Ili moj.
Very good job.	Veoma dobar posao.
I never meant anything bad to you	Nikad ti nisam mislio ništa loše
She wanted to say no.	Htela je da kaže ne.
I just have no one to talk to.	Jednostavno nemam s kim razgovarati.
I've seen it many times.	Vidio sam to mnogo puta.
Not such a good idea.	Nije tako dobra ideja.
The question is how good.	Pitanje je koliko dobro.
I should have said that long before now	Trebao sam to reći mnogo prije sada
I really dont know.	Ne znam, stvarno.
I heard something	Čuo sam nešto
It is very easy to work with.	Sa njim je veoma lako raditi.
I didn't even have to get a job	Nisam ni trebao dobiti posao
This one is.	Ovaj je.
I know what she thinks	Znam šta ona misli
I just can’t believe it’s true	Jednostavno ne mogu vjerovati da je to istina
He had to be.	Morao je biti.
I can go any way	Mogu ići na bilo koji način
A little.	Malo.
I mean, it really goes	Mislim, stvarno ide
We will do it for you.	Mi ćemo to učiniti za vas.
That's fine - this is happening.	Kao u redu to se dešava.
We didn't say anything.	Ništa nismo rekli.
You really are.	Ti si to zaista.
I can't say this enough	Ne mogu ovo dovoljno reći
He knew exactly what she was thinking.	Tačno je znao šta ona misli.
What can we do.	Što možemo učiniti.
I already have enough of them	Imam ih već dovoljno
I mean, that wasn’t even an issue	Mislim, to čak i nije bilo pitanje
I hope it will.	Nadam se da hoće.
They will get it.	Oni će to dobiti.
So it is here.	Tako je i ovdje.
He didn't get much.	Nije dobio mnogo.
I think he expected that	Mislim da je to očekivao
If so.	Ako je to tako.
This is probably not what you want.	Ovo vjerovatno nije ono što želite.
I think that's probably true.	Mislim da je to vjerovatno istina.
Indeed, it is not.	Zaista, nije.
I couldn’t believe this was happening to me	Nisam mogao vjerovati da mi se ovo dešava
I'm afraid he'll never be well again	Bojim se da mu više nikada neće biti dobro
I was alone, as usual	Bio sam sam, kao i obično
Just to say you are.	Samo da kažem da jesi.
I did my best	Dao sam mu sve od sebe
I used to love him very much	Nekada sam ga jako volio
This is both good and bad.	Ovo je i dobro i loše.
I wondered how many were still together	Pitao sam se koliko ih je još uvijek zajedno
I can't tell you why.	Ne mogu vam reći zašto.
I think money is good	Mislim da je novac dobar
None of us can.	Niko od nas ne može.
I can't do anything like that	Ne mogu ništa tako
I know she wants to tell you	Znam da ti sama želi reći
I did exactly what he told me	Uradio sam tačno ono što mi je rekao
I thought he wouldn't be able to	Mislio sam da neće moći
I only have a little time to live.	Imam samo malo vremena za život.
Like him.	Kao i on.
I know what you mean	Znam na šta misliš
I'll get it.	Ja ću je dobiti.
I hope he is too.	Nadam se da je i on.
And there was more.	I bilo je više.
Not so bad.	Nije tako loše.
He couldn't really play.	On zapravo nije mogao da igra.
I'm not even sure what it was.	Nisam ni siguran šta je to bilo.
I wanted that too, but not now	I ja sam to želeo, ali ne sada
And that, and that.	I to, i to.
And a lot of time.	I puno vremena.
I didn't do it.	Nisam to uradio.
I didn't do those things	Nisam radio te stvari
I wouldn't be here to see them.	Ne bih bio ovdje da ih vidim.
There is plenty of time now.	Sada ima dosta vremena.
I know what this is.	Znam šta je ovo.
I'm still not sure why	Još uvijek nisam siguran zašto
And now it looks like we can.	A sada izgleda da možemo.
Nothing is certain.	Ništa nije sigurno.
Maybe more than you need to know.	Možda više nego što treba da znate.
I don't want this anymore	Ne želim ovo više
But no one really knows.	Ali niko zaista ne zna.
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno ste u pravu.
I didn't know that before	Nisam to znao ranije
Not only did you do it.	Ne samo da ste to uradili.
He just couldn't.	Samo što nije mogao.
We have to stay there for a while.	Moramo ostati tamo neko vrijeme.
I still wasn't too sure	Još uvijek nisam bio previše siguran
Actually a few.	Zapravo nekoliko.
I knew that was not the case	Znao sam da nije tako
No one could do that.	Niko to nije mogao.
I can say that about myself	To mogu reći o sebi
They know it.	Oni to znaju.
When she wasn't, he knew that too.	Kad ona nije bila, i on je to znao.
If he wanted to, he would have to work for it.	Da je želio, morao bi da radi za to.
I think he just likes to say that	Mislim da samo voli to da kaže
I wondered what it was all about	Pitao sam se o čemu se radi
I want to do this	Želim ovo da uradim
He was pretty sure that was what he had.	Bio je prilično siguran da je to ono što je imao.
The question is when and not.	Pitanje je kada a ne.
I've known you for a long time	Znam te jako dugo
I decided not to.	Odlučio sam da ne.
I need to know what's going on with you	Moram da znam šta se dešava sa tobom
He is what he is.	On je ono što jeste.
He was absolutely sure of it.	Bio je potpuno siguran u to.
See what's going on.	Vidi šta se dešava.
I think that's enough	Mislim da je to dovoljno
I think he's good	Mislim da je dobar
That's actually my job.	To je zapravo moj posao.
I mean it.	Mislim to.
I could tell right away that something was wrong with him	Mogao sam odmah reći da nešto nije u redu s njim
True, he worked with it.	Istina je, radio je s tim.
Now let me ask you something.	A sada da te pitam nešto.
At your place.	Kod vas.
I guess that's all you really need to know	Pretpostavljam da je to sve što zaista treba da znaš
This often happens.	Ovo se često dešava.
And I'm good at it.	I ja sam dobar u tome.
We do not know what it is in itself.	Šta je to samo po sebi ne znamo.
He said no.	Rekao je ne.
You have to give it to him.	Moraš mu to dati.
I wonder if that was more for me than for him.	Pitam se da li je to bilo više za mene nego za njega.
He didn't have a job, he didn't work.	Nije imao posao, nije radio.
It was simple.	Bilo je jednostavno.
There was very little he knew about himself.	Bilo je vrlo malo što je znao o sebi.
I just love my job.	Ja jednostavno volim svoj posao.
I just wanted to go home	Samo sam htela da idem kući
Or my life.	Ili moj život.
It all happened.	Sve se to dogodilo.
He said he was glad to help.	Rekao je da mu je drago što može pomoći.
We can't say.	Ne možemo reći.
It won't work.	To neće raditi.
Today is your day.	Danas je tvoj dan.
Not like them at all.	Uopšte ne kao oni.
Man.	Čovjek.
I just have to see things	Mora da samo vidim stvari
And maybe that's so.	A možda je to tako.
But it's not that simple.	Ali to nije tako jednostavno.
I'm sure of it.	Siguran sam u to.
You can do it now.	Možete to učiniti sada.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
I just hope not for me.	Samo se nadam da ne za mene.
I wish you were here with me	Voleo bih da si ovde sa mnom
I shouldn't have done that	Nisam trebao to učiniti
Or maybe you need it.	Ili vam možda treba.
I thought he wouldn't, that he was done with me.	Mislio sam da neće, da je završio sa mnom.
Or just .	Ili samo .
None of us should.	Niko od nas ne bi trebao.
He just loves it.	On to jednostavno voli.
We have more than that.	Imamo više od toga.
You work for us.	Radite za nas.
There's nothing good I can do here.	Ne mogu da uradim ništa dobro ovde.
That is exactly what he wants to do.	To je upravo ono što on želi da uradi.
I can see.	Mogu da vidim.
I can't say what it is	Ne mogu reći šta je to
They are few.	Oni su malo.
I'm much better today	Danas mi je mnogo bolje
I think he knew it was that day.	Mislim da je znao da je to bio taj dan.
I have said this many times.	Ovo sam rekao više puta.
Except she wasn't.	Osim što ona nije bila.
I didn't ask.	Nisam tražio.
And today was that day.	I danas je bio taj dan.
And tell the truth.	I reci istinu.
I was very sorry for him	Bilo mi ga je jako žao
I don't know if it will be tonight.	Ne znam da li će to biti večeras.
Time is money.	Vrijeme je novac.
I'm afraid you're right	Bojim se da ste u pravu
I am you, and you are me	Ja sam ti, a ti si ja
I know how it was	Znam kako je to bilo
We knew it was going to be hard.	Znali smo da će biti teško.
Not what it was.	Ne ono što je bilo.
I'm not afraid to say this.	Ne bojim se ovo reći.
I couldn't tell you	Ne bih ti mogao reći
I didn't know all this	Nisam znao sve ovo
You know, probably not.	Znate, vjerovatno ne.
I thought it existed.	Mislio sam da postoji.
I never thought you would give me time.	Nikad nisam mislio da ćeš mi dati vremena.
I can do what you do	Mogu da radim ono što ti radiš
It's good you told me while there's still time.	Dobro je što si mi rekao dok još ima vremena.
That is never enough	Nikada to nije dovoljno
He had done it before.	On je to radio ranije.
I think that would happen	Mislim da bi se to dogodilo
You know I can't do anything for you.	Znate da ne mogu ništa učiniti za vas.
I didn't ask for more	Nisam tražio više
I guess that's obvious.	Pretpostavljam da je to očigledno.
Be good.	Biti dobro.
Before that, there is nothing.	Prije toga, nema ništa.
You told me.	Rekao si mi.
It just took me a while.	Samo mi je trebalo malo vremena.
And there was nothing wrong with that.	I nije bilo ništa loše u tome.
That is certainly true.	To je sigurno istina.
Like it's real.	Kao da je stvarno.
I don't know yet.	Ne znam za sada.
There were very few of them.	Vrlo malo ih je bilo.
But she doesn't have to live with it.	Ali ona ne mora da živi sa tim.
My father wouldn't.	Moj otac ne bi.
I can't see you anymore	Ne mogu te više vidjeti
But it didn’t happen that way, not there and not here.	Ali to se nije dogodilo tako, ne tamo i ne ovdje.
I want to say more	Želim da kaže više
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
Yes, everything was as it should be.	Da, sve je bilo kako treba.
You know we can do it.	Znaš da mi to možemo.
There were problems.	Bilo je problema.
I knew it wouldn't help me	Znala sam da mi neće pomoći
I didn't even ask you about your day	Nisam te ni pitao za tvoj dan
Yes, we know.	Da, znamo.
He should have stayed.	Trebao je ostati.
You did your job.	Uradio si svoj posao.
I was good too.	I ja sam bio dobar.
It happens to almost everyone	To se dešava skoro svima
I have things to do	Imam stvari koje treba uraditi
I have to be ready for tonight.	Moram biti spreman za večeras.
She was, you know.	Bila je, znate.
Look what he did.	Vidi šta je uradio.
I would like to work	Voleo bih da radim
I have to do more, you tell yourself	Moram učiniti više, kažeš sebi
You are so happy.	Tako si sretan.
We had several in the house.	Imali smo ih nekoliko u kući.
That day has come.	Došao je taj dan.
I didn't tell anyone what he did to me	Nikome nisam rekao šta mi je uradio
She doesn’t have many friends and doesn’t want any more.	Ona nema mnogo prijatelja i ne želi više.
There is nothing we can do for now.	Ne možemo ništa učiniti za sada.
And so you will.	I tako ćeš.
Actually, you know better.	U stvari, ti znaš bolje.
That's how we did it.	Tako smo to uradili.
But he wants more.	Ali on želi više.
I didn’t know if it was good or bad	Nisam znao da li je to dobro ili loše
That is something we are obviously working on.	To je nešto na čemu očigledno radimo.
I was glad for that	Bilo mi je drago zbog toga
I can't do that to myself	Ne mogu to sebi da uradim
Only they couldn't see her that way.	Samo što je nisu mogli vidjeti na taj način.
I realized what you really are tonight	Shvatio sam šta si ti stvarno večeras
But that will not be enough.	Ali to neće biti dovoljno.
Just none of that.	Samo ništa od toga.
I told him he was wrong	Rekao sam mu da nije u pravu
I've seen her do this before	Video sam je ranije da radi ovo
I may not see her for a long, long time.	Možda je neću vidjeti još dugo, dugo.
I was more than a little surprised	Bio sam više nego malo iznenađen
But he did it.	Ali on je to učinio.
And so good.	I tako dobro.
But it's pretty good!.	Ali prilično je dobro!.
I was not good with him.	Nije mi bilo dobro s njim.
I never have and I never will	Nikad nisam i nikad neću
I have no idea where he is.	Nemam pojma gdje je.
I had no idea who might have been there	Nisam imao pojma ko je mogao biti tamo
I didn't ask him why	Nisam ga pitao zašto
We haven't been together long.	Nismo dugo zajedno.
Everything is not right, he told himself.	Sve nije u redu, rekao je sebi.
He always knows.	On uvek zna.
I haven't told anyone yet	Nisam još nikome rekao
That was a long time.	To je bilo dosta vremena.
It's true.	To je istina.
He's not here yet.	Još nije tu.
Is someone who.	Da li je neko ko.
He's too good at it.	Previše je dobar u tome.
He was doing his job.	Radio je svoj posao.
I hope this works.	Nadam se da ovo radi.
I've never done that before	Nikad to ranije nisam radio
I could see him again	Mogao sam ga ponovo vidjeti
I knew it too.	I ja sam znao.
It's pretty simple.	To je prilično jednostavno.
He can tell you things.	Može vam reći stvari.
We didn't even know it was there.	Nismo ni znali da je tamo.
This was too much for me.	Za mene je ovo bilo previše.
He never asked for it.	On to nikada nije tražio.
I have to do something.	Moram nešto da uradim.
No, he actually did things.	Ne, on je zapravo napravio stvari.
I've never been there before	Nikada ranije nisam bio tamo
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
It should be.	Trebalo bi da bude.
Not for now.	Za sada nije.
And another and another and another.	I još jedan i još jedan i još jedan.
Not that he didn't expect it.	Nije da to nije očekivao.
This has been true for some time.	Ovo je istina već neko vrijeme.
Or if not.	Ili ako ne.
I've done it before	Mogao sam to i prije
He really should work harder.	Zaista bi trebao više da radi.
I lost.	Izgubio sam.
This is just me asking.	Ovo samo ja pitam.
I didn't mean to do that	Nisam mislio to da uradim
She like never before	Ona kao nikada do sada
No, not that.	Ne, ne to.
And that one.	I taj.
I'll do it tonight.	Ja ću to večeras.
Did he do something.	Da li je uradio nešto.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
I lost so much.	Toliko sam izgubio.
I have to find him.	Moram ga naći.
I shouldn't talk about it	Ne bih trebao o tome
She knew she couldn't go beyond that.	Znala je da ne može ići dalje od toga.
But that was before.	Ali to je bilo prije.
I knew she probably was	Znao sam da je vjerovatno bila
I hope he's good.	Nadam se da je dobar.
It works well.	Radi dobro.
He'll probably get it.	Verovatno će je dobiti.
He was that.	On je to bio.
I thought something had happened.	Mislio sam da se nešto dogodilo.
I know this is the right guy	Znam da je ovo pravi momak
She said yes, that's right.	Rekla je, da, tačno.
I always see everything	Uvek sve vidim
It really is.	Zaista je.
I thought that was a good thing	Mislio sam da je to dobra stvar
Yes, you can do that.	Da, možete to učiniti.
She was thirty years old.	Bila je trideset godina ranije.
He really loved me.	Zaista me volio.
I guess he wouldn't have a problem with that	Pretpostavljam da ne bi imao problema s tim
Only they didn't say that.	Samo što to nisu rekli.
But he never heard.	Ali nikada nije čuo.
I didn't want to be alone	Nisam htela da bude sam
And where it can, it's not with that.	A gdje može, nije s tim.
There was more to it.	Više je bilo šta.
This is hard to do.	Teško je ovo uraditi.
Maybe good, maybe bad.	Možda dobro, možda loše.
They didn't do this.	Ovo nisu uradili.
I think you have to do it	Mislim da to moraš da uradiš
I am glad.	Drago mi je.
I couldn't get it.	Nisam ga mogao dobiti.
And that is it.	I to je to.
Me too, a few days.	I ja, nekoliko dana.
I know what's going on next	Znam šta se dalje dešava
I wasn't quite ready for that	Nisam bio baš spreman za to
In fact, there are more.	U stvari, ima više.
I just want to be here with you	Samo želim biti ovdje sa tobom
I have no idea what to say	Nemam pojma šta da kažem
And we can't help ourselves.	I ne možemo si pomoći.
I asked him if something was wrong.	Pitao sam ga da li nešto nije u redu.
I'm working.	Radim.
Just talk to me.	Samo reci sa mnom.
Can anyone help ??	Može li neko pomoći??
I can get it tomorrow	Mogu to dobiti sutra
And do you know.	I da li znate.
But it may exist.	Ali možda postoji.
You should do this.	Ti treba da uradiš ovo.
He's not ready yet.	Još nije spreman.
That, in its own way, was a question.	To je, na svoj način, bilo pitanje.
And it wasn't me.	A to nisam bio ja.
But it's okay that you're not.	Ali u redu je što nisi.
I'm the man in the house	Ja sam čovjek u kući
I want to know what you did.	Želim da znam šta si uradio.
I have a real job	Imam pravi posao
I go first.	Ja idem prvi.
He had no idea which.	Nije imao pojma koje.
I wanted to know too	I ja sam htela da znam
More on that here.	Više o tome ovdje.
It's still not enough.	Još uvek nije dovoljno.
I would like to be so sure.	Voleo bih da budem tako siguran.
It's just something that's happening.	To je samo nešto što se dešava.
I should tell you something	Trebao bih ti nešto reći
I have no friends	Nemam prijatelja
I really have to go home	Stvarno moram ići kući
I can do it again	Mogu ponovo
I didn't have to ask	Nisam morao da pitam
And it's that simple.	I to je tako jednostavno.
Apparently, she said yes.	Očigledno, rekla je da.
I do not have it.	Nemam ga.
She was a lot to him.	Ona mu je bila mnogo toga.
I haven't seen anyone	Nisam video nikoga
I mean, it's bad for business	Mislim, loše je za posao
I was so happy to see them both	Bio sam tako sretan što sam ih oboje vidio
I can tell you how much you want me	Mogu reći koliko me jako želiš
There was never enough of it.	Nikada ga nije bilo dovoljno.
I need to know what you're going to do	Moram da znam šta ćeš da uradiš
He didn't like talking about it.	Nije volio da priča o tome.
I'm not here right now.	Trenutno nisam ovdje.
I know you too.	Znam i ti.
The things you said.	Stvari koje si rekao.
I really should have	Stvarno sam trebao
There is nothing they cannot do.	Ne postoji ništa što oni ne mogu učiniti.
Looks like I lost everything.	Izgleda da sam izgubio sve.
She never said that much.	Nikad nije rekla toliko.
I hope you will be there	Nadam se da ćeš biti tamo
That was true.	To je bilo tačno.
It simply is.	Jednostavno jeste.
Maybe he didn't want to say we don't work.	Možda nije htio reći da ne radimo.
I'm not sure what's wrong with that.	Nisam siguran šta nije u redu s tim.
It would be too obvious.	Bilo bi previše očigledno.
That's us.	To smo mi.
What else needs to be said?	Šta još treba reći?
He's seen this before.	Video je ovo ranije.
We know this.	Znamo ovo.
I didn't know there was anyone else here	Nisam znao da postoji još neko ovde
I know you loved that car.	Znam da si volio taj auto.
It really is.	Stvarno je.
I work here.	Ja radim ovde.
She knew who she was.	Znala je ko je ona.
I just didn't see it	Jednostavno nisam vidio
I was sure we could do much better ourselves	Bio sam siguran da i sami možemo mnogo bolje
I really should know better	Stvarno bih trebao znati bolje
I wonder where she was	Pitam se gdje je bila
And there's nothing you can do about it.	I tu ništa ne možete učiniti.
I know you can find her if anyone can	Znam da je možeš naći ako neko može
But you still have it.	Ali još uvek ga imaš.
That was it.	To je bilo.
You will say.	Ti ćeš reći.
I thought no one would know what it was	Mislio sam da niko neće znati šta je to
She was what he needed.	Ona je bila ono što mu je trebalo.
But it doesn't seem to work.	Ali izgleda da ne radi.
I really just wanted to talk to you	Zaista sam samo htio razgovarati s tobom
We really have.	Zaista imamo.
I've never been here before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio ovde.
I couldn't tell.	Ne bih mogao reći.
Yes, you really need that much.	Da, zaista ti treba toliko.
He's really good.	Stvarno je dobar.
Maybe I work for him	Možda radim za njega
This is life.	Ovo je život .
It just works	To jednostavno radi
I don't know the reason.	Ja ne znam razlog.
I thought you just said that	Mislio sam da si to upravo rekao
The question is how to do it exactly.	Pitanje je kako to tačno uraditi.
I did my job well.	Uradio sam svoj posao i to dobro.
But it works.	Ali radi.
But they didn't know it.	Ali oni to nisu znali.
I'm a little better than him	Ja sam malo bolji od njega
So it is for us.	Tako je i za nas.
Just don't tell him you got this from me.	Samo mu nemoj reći da si ovo dobio od mene.
That's not real.	To nije stvarno.
I couldn't find anyone	Nisam mogao naći nikoga
I only know where he is	Znam samo gdje je
Do something.	Uraditi nešto.
I have to go to school	Moram u školu
I think it was him	Mislim da je to bio on
I know what she's going to say	Znam šta će ona reći
That needs to be said.	To treba reći.
Maybe you are.	Možda jesi.
That's not a good idea.	To nije dobra ideja.
I like this one.	Sviđa mi se ovaj.
I would love to go there soon.	Volio bih uskoro otići tamo.
I think they are probably right.	Mislim da su vjerovatno u pravu.
Do what needs to be done.	Radite ono što treba.
I mean, it'll probably help	Mislim, vjerovatno će pomoći
Besides you .	Osim tebe .
I'm the only one who knows.	Ja sam jedini koji zna.
I can always come back	Uvek se mogu vratiti
May not.	Ne mora.
Other than that, I love him.	Osim toga, volim ga.
He was such a good man.	Bio je tako dobar čovjek.
I haven't bought it yet	Nisam još kupio
It has everything.	Ima sve.
I love doing it this way.	Volim to raditi na ovaj način.
He wasn't there.	Nije bio tamo.
I will help.	Ja ću pomoći.
I couldn't believe he said that	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je to rekao
She was not alone.	Nije bila sama.
But in fact, he knows none of that.	Ali u stvari, on ne zna ništa od toga.
I didn't mean to ask	Nisam mislio da pitam
He would think.	Mislio bi.
I told you this was going to happen	Rekao sam ti da će se ovo dogoditi
I have one too.	I ja imam jedan.
I'm really scared for you.	Zaista se bojim za tebe.
I could have helped you	Mogao sam ti pomoći
I think you can help us all	Mislim da nam svima možeš pomoći
I've never seen that before.	Nikad to ranije nisam video.
I didn't know he was there	Nisam znala da je tamo
Live for today.	Živi za danas.
Not who he is.	Ne ko jeste.
I didn't know enough.	Nisam znao dovoljno.
I'll tell everyone the truth, now.	Reći ću svima istinu, odmah.
Or any reason.	Ili bilo koji razlog.
I didn't know how to tell you	Nisam znao kako da ti kažem
I always have a problem with that	Uvek imam problema sa tim
I couldn’t believe it was real	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je stvarno
I hope to see much more from you	Nadam se da ću vidjeti mnogo više od vas
They know when you're there.	Oni znaju kada ste tamo.
I am very, very happy	Ja sam veoma, veoma sretan
In fact, even more.	U stvari, čak i više.
I wasn't sure before.	Ranije nisam bio siguran.
But that is clearly not the case.	Ali to očigledno nije tako.
I think you've had enough for today	Mislim da ti je dosta za danas
But he was glad he said that.	Ali bilo mu je drago što je to rekao.
None of this is true.	Ništa od toga nije istina.
I was tired.	Bio sam umoran.
I've seen it a few times	Video sam to nekoliko puta
Maybe still.	Možda i dalje.
I didn't get there	Nisam stigao tamo
He couldn't find anything.	Nije mogao naći ništa.
It's much better now.	Sada je mnogo bolje.
Maybe you too.	Možda i ti.
I'm back.	Vratio sam se.
About.	O tome.
He can't play anymore.	Ne može više da igra.
I don't want to go.	Ne želim da idem.
Not the way you think.	Ne na način na koji mislite.
I never know what to say	Nikad ne znam šta da kažem
I wish it wasn't so	Voleo bih da nije tako
And I know what he wants.	I ja znam šta on hoće.
I saw them.	Video sam ih.
I should have told you before	Trebao sam ti reći prije toga
This was here, now.	Ovo je bilo ovdje, sada.
That's how it should be.	Tako treba da bude.
I thought it would be more than that	Mislio sam da će biti više od toga
He doesn't need this now.	Ovo mu sada ne treba.
He's not a problem.	On nije problem.
I've seen it before.	Video sam to ranije.
I never expected that	Nikad to nisam očekivao
How can he.	Kako može.
It seemed necessary.	Činilo se da je trebalo.
I don't see it working	Ne vidim da radi
Yes, there is something you can do.	Da, postoji nešto što možete učiniti.
He could still come back.	Još bi se mogao vratiti.
This should be easy.	Ovo bi trebalo biti lako.
Who knows.	Ko zna.
He says no, everything is fine.	Kaže ne, sve je u redu.
Better.	Bolji.
I asked her to come get me	Zamolio sam je da dođe po mene
It's just money.	To je samo novac.
There is so much.	Toliko je toga.
I want to go see what's going on	Želim da idem da vidim šta se dešava
I want it to be fast	Želim da bude brzo
Everything is going as it should.	Sve ide kako treba.
I told you that.	Rekao sam ti to.
I think he already knows	Mislim da već zna
He didn't know how.	Nije znao kako.
I didn't expect much more	Nisam očekivao mnogo više
You people are nobody.	Vi ljudi ste niko.
I didn't know where he lived	Nisam znao gdje živi
I never went to see her	Nikada nisam otišao da je vidim
I could go home	Mogao bih se vratiti kući
It's your life, live it.	To je tvoj život, živi ga.
He was more now.	Sada je bio više.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
You know you can't.	Znaš da ne možeš.
I know how to play	Znam kako se igra
I knew he heard me.	Znao sam da me je čuo.
You didn't do this.	Nisi ovo uradio.
I never was.	Nikad to nisam bio.
I know what he means.	Znam na šta misli.
Nobody said anything.	Niko ništa nije rekao.
I just have to stay here tonight	Samo moram ostati ovdje večeras
I told you.	Rekao sam ti.
I haven't decided what to do next.	Nisam odlučio šta dalje.
That's all we do.	Samo to radimo.
None of us can do anything to help you.	Niko od nas ne može ništa učiniti da vam pomogne.
I had someone to help me	Imao sam nekoga da mi pomogne
But that can no longer be helped.	Ali tome se više ne može pomoći.
But you couldn't.	Ali nisi mogao.
All of this may be true.	Sve ovo može biti istina.
You didn't really mean any of that.	Ti zapravo nisi mislio ništa od toga.
I just saw him last week	Upravo sam ga vidio prošle sedmice
I was good at it.	Bio sam dobar u tome.
I shouldn't have told him it was okay	Nisam mu trebao reći da je u redu
I'm not sure why.	Nisam siguran zašto.
I want to know what it is	Želim da znam šta je to
But not here.	Ali ne ovde.
He had no problems.	Nije imao problema.
The car is not a person	Auto nije osoba
When she is just a.	Kada je ona samo a.
I wonder how long we've been here	Pitam se koliko smo dugo ovdje
I'm sure of this.	Siguran sam u ovo.
Someone is waiting.	Neko čeka.
I hope you can	Nadam se da ćeš moći
It won't be.	Neće biti.
Enough for now.	Dosta toga za sada.
And I did this to us, you know	I ja sam ovo uradio nama, znaš
I asked for that too	I ja sam to tražio
She just wasn’t much.	Ona jednostavno nije bila mnogo.
He fears it and only hopes for it.	On se toga boji i samo tome se nada.
He loved that day.	Voleo je taj dan.
He's already done it.	Već je to radio.
It's something that just .	To je nešto što samo .
But it wasn't that bad.	Ali nije bilo tako loše.
Not bad, just fine.	Nije loše, samo u redu.
It never could.	Nikada nije moglo.
I didn't mean to say that	Nisam to htio reći
I have better things to do	Imam bolje stvari da radim
I should have told him the truth	Trebao sam mu reći istinu
She doesn't have to allow it.	Ona to ne mora dozvoliti.
I can help with that.	Mogu pomoći u tome.
I didn't know that was it	Nisam znao da je to to
I wonder what he was doing there	Pitam se šta je radio tamo
But I'm not sure.	Ali nisam siguran.
And that was hard enough.	I to je bilo dovoljno teško.
Everyone will know that is not true.	Svi će znati da to nije istina.
No one asked.	Niko se nije pitao.
He's here.	On je ovde.
I shouldn't have said those things	Nisam trebao reći te stvari
Yes, there is.	Da, ima.
That's pretty good.	To je prilično dobro.
I'm doing it now.	Sada to radim.
I want what you can give me	Želim ono što mi možeš dati
I guess we all do	Pretpostavljam da svi mi to radimo
I didn't come back in time	Nisam se vratio na vrijeme
That's just not right.	To jednostavno nije u redu.
You should know that by now.	Trebao bi to znati do sada.
I knew exactly how he felt.	Tačno sam znao kako se osjeća.
Not that he was ever my friend.	Nije da mi je ikada bio prijatelj.
I know everything will be fine	Znam da će sve biti u redu
That's what you should have done.	To je ono što si trebao da uradiš.
That's pretty good.	To je prilično dobro.
You can help.	Možete pomoći.
Not that way.	Ne na taj način.
I'm just telling you	Ja ti jednostavno kažem
That was not good enough.	To nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
Maybe he didn't know what he was doing.	Možda nije znao šta radi.
They were there, right there.	Bili su tamo, baš tamo.
No one should live like that.	Niko ne bi trebao tako da živi.
You have money.	Imaš novac.
I know they're home	Znam da su kod kuće
I think there is little of that.	Mislim da ima malo toga.
But there is so much he cannot do.	Ali ima toliko toga što on ne može učiniti.
I still couldn't tell	Još uvijek nisam mogao reći
Only he wasn't there.	Samo što ga nije bilo.
So far.	Do sada.
I wouldn't.	Ne bi.
I have a job.	Imam posao.
I have no doubt about that	Ne sumnjam u to
He's ready.	Spreman je.
I wish it was me	Voleo bih da sam to bio ja
There are few people.	Malo je ljudi.
I've been really good for a while	Zaista sam dobro neko vrijeme
I've probably said too much already	Vjerovatno sam već rekao previše
I haven't seen her yet	Nisam je još vidio
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
He did really well.	Uradio je zaista dobro.
In fact, no.	U stvari, ne.
What was more for me to work.	Šta je više bilo za mene da radim.
Which is like.	Što je kao.
But not this time.	Ali ne ovaj put.
I didn't know anything	Nisam znao ništa
He doesn't really know where she is.	On baš i ne zna gdje je ona.
You work, you work well.	Radiš, radiš dobro.
When.	Kada.
There is something wrong with that.	Nešto nije u redu s tim.
I was sure something bad had happened	Bio sam siguran da se nešto loše dogodilo
I think we need to talk	Mislim da moramo razgovarati
It was pretty bad.	Bilo je prilično loše.
And it really was.	I zaista je to bilo.
To be better.	Da budem bolji.
I probably never will be	Vjerovatno nikad neću biti
We have so many friends.	Imamo toliko prijatelja.
A good life is what works for you.	Dobar život je ono što radi za vas.
Don't say we can't.	Nemoj reći da ne možemo.
You know how you do it? 	Znaš, kako to radiš?
I could tell right away	Mogao bih odmah reći
I'm not sure why.	Nisam siguran zašto.
They didn't even tell us.	Nisu nam ni rekli.
I really need to talk to you	Zaista moram razgovarati s tobom
I needed money too much	Previše mi je trebao novac
I just hope it gives me time	Samo se nadam da će mi dati vremena
It works well.	Dobro radi.
All he had to do was go to school.	Sve što je trebao da uradi je da ide u školu.
I actually like it, a little bit	Zapravo mi se sviđa, malo
And maybe he's right.	I možda je u pravu.
But he didn't do this.	Ali on ovo nije napravio.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.	I upravo će to učiniti.
He is not a person.	Nije osoba.
I need to see you this morning.	Moram da te vidim jutros.
I've seen it many times before	Video sam to mnogo puta ranije
They were all like him to me.	Svi su mi bili kao on.
It's good to go.	Dobro je ići.
That's what he meant.	To je ono što je htio reći.
I heard them, but I didn't really hear them	Čuo sam ih, ali ih zapravo nisam čuo
I just wanted to see how you were	Samo sam htela da vidim kako si
I had to know you could do it right.	Morao sam znati da možeš to učiniti kako treba.
And they were no better.	I nisu bili bolji.
And that's what we do.	I to je ono što mi radimo.
I went with him.	Otišao sam s njim.
He just came at me.	Upravo je došao na mene.
It looks really good.	Izgleda stvarno dobro.
Some may not be able to have them.	Neko možda neće moći da ih ima.
He said I hadn't seen him in three years.	Rekao je da ga nisam vidio tri godine.
I hope it's mine too.	Nadam se da je i moj.
You can't find it again.	Ne možete to ponovo naći.
He is the only one who can do it today.	On je jedini koji to danas može.
She said it had happened before.	Rekla je da se to dogodilo i prije.
I didn't do anything to you	Nisam ti ništa uradio
Absolutely.	Potpuno.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
But none of that.	Ali ništa od toga.
He never tried.	Nikada nije pokušao.
But you know.	Ali znaš.
He's been here before.	Bio je ovdje prije.
Maybe it's money.	Možda je to novac.
I'm going alone, which is fine	Idem sam, što je u redu
I really wish that was true	Zaista bih volio da je to istina
Do your job.	Radi svoj posao.
I've always done my job	Uvek sam završio svoj posao
I still think you're right	I dalje mislim da si u pravu
I can't help what you think	Ne mogu pomoći šta ti misliš
I can't tell you exactly.	Ne mogu vam reći tačno.
I could go home	Mogao sam ići kući
You can't do that now.	Ne možeš to sada.
He couldn't do that.	On to nije mogao.
If not, you won't.	Ako ne, nećeš.
I have it ready for you	Imam ga spreman za tebe
And nothing to ask.	I ništa da pitam.
These thoughts can happen anywhere.	Ove misli se mogu dogoditi bilo gdje.
There were times when.	Bilo je vremena kada.
I know he's telling the truth	Znam da govori istinu
It would be easy.	Bilo bi lako.
I know it can't be me	Znam da to ne mogu biti ja
I hope you will come	Nadam se da ćeš doći
Okay, enough of that.	U redu, dosta toga.
But no one could find him there.	Ali niko ga tamo nije mogao naći.
I shouldn't say that	Ne bih to trebao reći
It was hard to leave.	Bilo je teško otići.
I knew what it looked like	Znao sam kako to izgleda
Not for yourself.	Ne za sebe.
I could tell him everything	Mogao sam mu reći sve
That's okay.	To je u redu.
You probably know more than you think.	Verovatno znate više nego što mislite.
I can't even be sure	Ne mogu ni biti siguran
I mean, it was fast	Mislim, bilo je brzo
He knows it was hard for you.	On zna da ti je bilo teško.
I guess we'll do it again this time	Pretpostavljam da ćemo to učiniti i ovaj put
I can't do more than that	Ne mogu više od toga
I want to know if it works.	Želim da znam da li radi.
He wasn't so sure now.	Sada nije bio tako siguran.
I always wondered what had happened to him	Uvijek sam se pitao šta mu se dogodilo
This is the code.	Ovo je kod.
I didn’t really see that as a problem	Nisam zaista vidio da je to problem
No one could ever be first.	Niko nikada nije mogao biti prvi.
I realized something	Shvatio sam nešto
But he saw it.	Ali on je to video.
I told you about it.	Rekao sam ti o tome.
It was a lot of money.	Bilo je to puno novca.
If not so bad.	Ako nije tako loše.
I was really happy with you when you wanted me	Bio sam zaista sretan s tobom, kad si me htio
But that was not true.	Ali to nije bila istina.
I could tell you	Mogao bih da ti kažem
And I want to see that.	I želim to vidjeti.
The day must come soon.	Uskoro mora doći dan.
That's good for both of us.	To je dobro za oboje.
But he still has no friends.	Ali i dalje nema prijatelja.
I can't find him either	Ni ja ga ne mogu naći
But that may not be enough.	Ali to možda neće biti dovoljno.
Nice to see her	Bilo mi je drago vidjeti je
Maybe a little.	Možda malo.
I wouldn't, you know.	Ne bi, znaš.
It was hard for me to do anything	Teško mi je bilo šta da radim
That is not what we do.	To nije ono što mi radimo.
But we know it's true.	Ali znamo da je to istina.
That was true enough.	To je bilo dovoljno istina.
I thought that might never happen	Mislio sam da se to možda nikada neće dogoditi
Really, that's it.	Zaista, to je to.
This is simply not real.	Ovo jednostavno nije stvarno.
I'm glad you're here now	Drago mi je da si sada ovde
I prefer to love them	Više volim da ih volim
But it's not a job.	Ali to nije posao.
He was so happy.	Bio je tako sretan.
You did really good for yourself.	Uradio si stvarno dobro za sebe.
You can do it anywhere.	Možete to učiniti bilo gdje.
I knew the real reason he came	Znao sam pravi razlog zašto je došao
I knew it and they knew it.	Ja sam to znao i oni su to znali.
He shouldn't do it alone.	On to ne bi trebao raditi sam.
He could go back to see her.	Mogao bi se vratiti da je vidi.
And I really understood that	I ja sam to zaista shvatio
That's not helpful.	To nije od pomoći.
That is too much.	To je previše.
I would do anything for him	Sve bih uradio za njega
What is.	Šta je.
I know what we have is real	Znam da je ono što imamo stvarno
I got a brand new one.	Dobio sam potpuno novi.
I don't even know who could.	Ne znam ni ko bi mogao.
I think it still works	Mislim da još uvijek radi
I wouldn't want to be here without you	Ne bih želio biti ovdje bez tebe
You're actually helpful.	Zapravo si od pomoći.
I have money and stuff	Imam novac i stvari
I didn't think you'd really do that	Nisam mislio da ćeš to zaista uraditi
He was the first to do so.	On je bio prvi koji je to učinio.
Does it work?	Da li to radi?
But there is a better way.	Ali postoji bolji način.
I asked him what it was about	Pitao sam ga o čemu se radi
This looks much better.	Ovo izgleda mnogo bolje.
Not for me yet.	Ne još za mene.
Don't think so hard of me.	Ne misli tako teško na mene.
I can't work that much.	Ne mogu da radim toliko.
Just so you know.	Samo da znaš.
I have to work on it	Moram da radim na tome
I'm still really sorry about that.	I dalje mi je zaista žao zbog toga.
I still want to help you	I dalje ti želim pomoći
I'm glad you told me you knew	Drago mi je što si mi rekao da znaš
This is never easy.	Ovo nikada nije lako.
I just wasn’t into it that much	Jednostavno nisam bio u tome toliko
I would be alone.	Bio bih sam.
I asked him what was going on	Pitao sam ga šta se dešava
I didn't know it was you	Nisam znao da si to ti
I can't reach him.	Ne mogu doći do njega.
I asked him to leave	Zamolio sam ga da ode
The reason for everything	Razlog za sve
I just didn't expect it	Jednostavno nisam to očekivao
I like the way it looks.	Sviđa mi se kako izgleda.
It will do the right thing for you.	To će učiniti pravu stvar za vas.
It was pretty simple.	Bilo je prilično jednostavno.
I don't know if it is or not.	Ne znam da li je ili nije.
I doubt we ever did that	Sumnjam da smo to ikada uradili
I'm sure of it.	Siguran sam u to.
Looks like you didn't.	Izgleda da nisi.
Tried to see everything.	Pokušao da vidim sve.
I just want you away from me and here	Samo te želim dalje od mene i ovdje
It's not right.	Nije u redu.
We know the way.	Znamo put.
You know you would.	Znaš da bi.
And this is a good thing.	I ovo je dobra stvar.
I'm tired.	Umoran sam.
No one has ever made this question.	Niko nikada nije napravio ovo pitanje.
I would be alone	Bio bih sam
You can say, you know.	Možeš reći, znaš.
I have three now.	Sada imam tri.
Not many people.	Nema mnogo ljudi.
I've seen it before	Video sam to i ranije
I can't help myself	Ne mogu si pomoći
He must have help.	Mora da ima pomoć.
But it's not just this.	Ali nije samo ovo.
When there is.	Kada postoji.
Must be.	Mora biti.
I started a lot.	Počeo sam dosta.
The sooner the better.	Što prije to bolje.
Sure, he said.	Sigurno, rekao je.
I loved her too much for that	Voleo sam je previše za to
He knows he will get it.	On zna da će ga dobiti.
I need money.	Treba mi novac.
I think you're right	Mislim da si u pravu
So we didn't say anything.	Tako da nismo ništa rekli.
And we should be.	I mi bi trebali biti.
I knew that.	Znao sam to.
He can come.	Može doći.
I always feel better when she's with me	Uvijek mi je bolje kada je ona sa mnom
I still have a lot to do.	Imam još mnogo toga da uradim.
He couldn't see anything.	Nije mogao ništa da vidi.
This is simply more	Ovo je jednostavno više
We like it.	Sviđa nam se.
I didn't mean to do anything wrong	Nisam mislio da uradim ništa loše
And there was something.	I bilo je nešto.
I think she knew that	Mislim da je to znala
It may never come.	Možda nikada neće doći.
It's not just me.	Nisam samo ja.
It was not enough to do.	Nije bilo dovoljno za uraditi.
He's just too good.	On je jednostavno previše dobar.
That just didn’t happen.	To se jednostavno nije dogodilo.
I hope today was a better day for you	Nadam se da ti je danas bio bolji dan
I've never done that before	Nikada to ranije nisam radio
I want more than that	Želim više od toga
And that is exactly what happened.	I upravo se to dogodilo.
I would love to see him	Voleo bih da ga vidim
But it was so bad.	Ali bilo je tako loše.
Not good, but okay.	Nije dobro, ali u redu.
I don't want money.	Ne želim novac.
Nobody was looking for him.	Niko ga nije tražio.
I knew he still loved me	Znao sam da me i dalje voli
I can't just buy someone	Ne mogu samo kupiti nekoga
I didn't know this was your first date	Nisam znala da je to tvoj prvi sastanak
I can't be what you want me to be	Ne mogu biti ono što želiš da budem
I couldn't say more	Nisam mogao više da kažem
Not that he will be able to for long.	Nije da će moći još dugo.
I hope they are right	Nadam se da su u pravu
Either you are or you are not.	Ili jesi ili nisi.
I want something.	Želim nešto.
He did that for three years.	To je radio tri godine.
I doubt it will be that long	Sumnjam da će biti toliko dugo
I just have to trust you	Samo ti moram vjerovati u tome
Now, you know.	Sada, znaš.
I wouldn't bring him back	Ne bih ga vratio
I said so.	Rekao sam tako.
I have to go to work today	Moram danas na posao
They never were.	Nikada nisu bili.
Maybe nothing at all.	Možda baš ništa.
I was happy, and she wasn't	Ja sam bio sretan, a ona nije
I was sure the job was mine.	Bio sam siguran da je posao moj.
I shouldn't have.	Nisam trebao.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
Just like him.	Baš kao i on.
I need help saying it's enough	Treba mi pomoć da kažem da je dosta
I wondered what the problem was	Pitao sam se u čemu je problem
Maybe you will.	Možda hoćeš.
More than you.	Više od tebe.
No one would see anything.	Niko ništa ne bi video.
It used to be mine.	Nekada je bio moj.
I don't have time for this	Nemam vremena za ovo
That's them.	To su oni.
I would be alone, completely alone	Bio bih sam, potpuno sam
That's a lot.	To je puno.
Which was not true.	Što nije bila istina.
But she didn't know.	Ali nije znala.
But it is not so.	Ali nije tako.
I wasn't sure what to say.	Nisam bio siguran šta da kažem.
They said they weren't sure.	Rekli su da nisu sigurni.
I expected her to see it that way	Očekivao sam da će ona to tako vidjeti
I doubt he needs much help	Sumnjam da mu treba mnogo pomoći
I want to know	Želim da znam
It was a difficult time.	Bilo je to teško vrijeme.
Now you know.	Sada znaš.
I ask what help is actually trying to say.	Pitam šta pomoć zapravo pokušava reći.
I should have stayed on it	Trebao sam ostati na tome
There was really nothing they could do for him	Zaista nisu mogli ništa učiniti za njega
I think this time more than ever before	Mislim to ovaj put više nego ikada prije
I have no idea what this is about.	Nemam pojma o čemu se radi.
That's what he does.	To je ono što on radi.
What no one really knew was why he did it.	Ono što niko zapravo nije znao je zašto je to uradio.
I guess a few more years	Pretpostavljam još nekoliko godina
They are there.	Oni su tamo.
I felt sorry for him.	Bilo mi ga je žao.
Nice to see her	Bilo mi je drago da je vidim
I don't anymore.	Ja više ne.
Just not now.	Samo ne sada.
I was here and I saw everything	Bio sam ovdje i vidio sam sve
It must have been thirty years ago.	Mora da je bilo prije trideset godina.
I know why you say	Znam zašto kažeš
I will always be yours	Uvek ću biti tvoj
He knows that.	On to zna.
I can't see it again	Ne mogu to ponovo da vidim
I love seeing it.	Volim da to vidim.
I know him a little.	Znam ga malo.
Now I'm glad to have him here	Sada mi je drago što ga imam ovdje
I'm not surprised.	Nisam iznenađen.
I think he wants that	Mislim da on to želi
It just wasn't hard.	Jednostavno nije bilo teško.
What did he do?	Šta je uradio.
And it wasn't him.	I to nije bio on.
Was that her?	Da li je to bila ona.
It's not a game.	Nije igra.
They said.	Oni su rekli.
I've said this before.	Rekao sam ovo ranije.
She said this, he said that.	Ona je rekla ovo, on je rekao ono.
Nothing is nothing.	Ništa je ništa.
I'll tell you everything	Reći ću ti sve
I'm not very happy about that	Nisam baš sretan zbog toga
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
They didn't do anything to him.	Ništa mu nisu uradili.
It's just that this is so hard.	Samo što je ovo tako teško.
They're still fine.	I dalje su u redu.
So many years.	Toliko godina.
I have a happy life now	Sada imam sretan život
I haven't seen her yet	Nisam je još vidio
I still have no idea where he went	Još uvijek nemam pojma gdje je otišao
I went to the door.	Otišao sam do vrata.
And now she's telling me about it.	I sada mi ona priča o tome.
I'm not sure how this happens.	Nisam siguran kako se ovo dešava.
I know what this is doing to us	Znam šta nam ovo radi
But I know this.	Ali znam ovo.
She didn't say anything.	Nije rekla ništa.
But it was too much.	Ali bilo je previše.
He was the only one to do so.	On je jedini to učinio.
She works with me.	Ona radi sa mnom.
I knew what had to be done	Znao sam šta se mora učiniti
She told me lots and lots of things.	Rekla mi je puno i puno stvari.
I had no idea what it was about	Nisam imao pojma o čemu se radi
I guess that's true	Pretpostavljam da je to tačno
You work so hard for me here.	Toliko radiš za mene ovdje.
Nobody asked her what she wanted.	Niko je nije pitao šta želi.
He never goes to school.	Nikad ne ide u školu.
I don't want them to know who you are.	Ne želim da znaju ko si ti.
For what he did to you.	Za ono što ti je uradio.
He is never tired.	Nikad nije umoran.
I just want to see that she's fine	Samo želim da vidim da je ona dobro
It's probably the way it should be.	Verovatno je tako kako bi trebalo da bude.
But that wasn’t really it.	Ali to zapravo nije bilo to.
Not sure why it won't work.	Nisam siguran zašto neće raditi.
I still wonder why not	I dalje se pitam zašto nije
There must be something else going on there.	Mora da se tamo još nešto dešava.
I have no problem just saying	Nemam problem da samo kažem
I didn't get anything	Ništa nisam dobio
It's almost good.	Skoro da je dobar.
You are much more than that.	Ti si mnogo više od toga.
I'm not sure, but maybe.	Nisam siguran, ali možda.
But no, he's done.	Ali ne, završio je.
And there you were.	I tu si bio ti.
She was often there alone.	Često je tamo bila sama.
Not so much anymore.	Ne više toliko.
I can't go to school	Ne mogu ići u školu
And I realized that very quickly	I to sam vrlo brzo shvatio
I was glad of that.	To mi je bilo drago.
He wondered if he had anything to live for.	Pitao se da li ima za šta da živi.
I want to believe.	Želim vjerovati.
What she wants is to know that he loves her.	Ono što ona želi je da zna da je on voli.
I wish it could be me	Voleo bih da to mogu biti ja
I just don't know how to proceed.	Samo ne znam kako dalje.
I have seen them many, many times	Vidio sam ih mnogo, mnogo puta
Now he can do what he wants, as he wants.	Sada može da radi šta hoće, kako hoće.
He didn't look well.	Nije izgledao dobro.
And what is, this is it.	A šta je, to je ovo.
I really didn't think he was here	Zaista nisam mislio da je ovdje
Those who do not know, they do not know.	Oni koji ne znaju, oni ne znaju.
I think it will help us	Mislim da će nam pomoći
It's hard to say.	Teško je reći.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
I was just wondering how you were	Samo sam se pitao kako si
I wouldn't be sure about that	Ne bih bio siguran u to
Like now.	Kao i sada.
But obviously it is.	Ali očigledno jeste.
I don't know what to think	Ne znam šta da mislim
He didn't see him there.	Nije ga vidio tamo.
Your life here.	Tvoj život ovde.
I didn't have to say anything	Nisam morao ništa da kažem
I was not feeling well when he left	Nije mi bilo dobro kada je otišao
All you want is.	Sve što želiš je.
I want to make sure it's good	Želim biti siguran da je dobro
But that may not be true.	Ali to ne može biti tačno.
He could never do it again.	Nikad više nije mogao.
I just don't know what to say.	Samo ne znam šta da kažem.
I just want to know everything, now	Samo želim da znam sve, sada
This is going to be a long time.	Ovo će biti dugo.
There is a lot of help here.	Tu ima dosta pomoći.
Better than good.	Bolje nego dobro.
I often do that	Dosta mi je često tako
Maybe he didn't see her.	Možda je nije video.
Not as bad as.	Nije tako loše kao.
And just like that.	I baš tako.
He could tell the truth.	Mogao bi da govori istinu.
They are.	Oni su.
But don't tell me where you are.	Ali nemoj mi reći gdje si.
I would do it again and again and again	Uradio bih to ponovo i ponovo i ponovo
It really wasn't much.	Zaista nije bilo puno.
I never worked with him.	Nikada nisam radio sa njim.
But it was good.	Ali, bilo je dobro.
I thought you were coming to me.	Mislio sam da ćeš doći kod mene.
He would too.	I on bi.
You can do it.	Možeš to učiniti.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I love it that way.	Volim to tako.
That is very likely.	To je vrlo vjerovatno.
I ask him.	pitam ga.
I can't do that to him	Ne mogu mu to učiniti
You can't work.	Ne možeš raditi.
I know, right.	Znam, tačno.
I really mean you	Mislim stvarno na tebe
He wanted everything to be true.	Želeo je da sve bude tačno.
That they are real people.	Da su pravi ljudi.
He knows how.	On zna kako.
I'll say it was him.	Reći ću da je to bio on.
I lost it for a while, I lost myself	Izgubio sam to na neko vrijeme, izgubio sam sebe
Don't think about me.	Ne misli na mene.
I was not surprised.	Nisam bio iznenađen.
It's just you.	Samo si ti.
I didn't know what it was all about	Nisam znao o čemu se sve radi
Indeed, there is none of that.	Zaista, nema ništa od toga.
Not just for me, but for anyone.	Ne samo za mene, nego za bilo koga.
They didn't say much.	Nisu mnogo rekli.
I need to know what's going on	Moram da znam šta se dešava
I won't let you do that to me	Neću ti dozvoliti da mi to uradiš
They all know that.	Svi oni to znaju.
But she also has no idea what happened.	Ali ni ona nema pojma šta se dogodilo.
Yes, he looked like someone with a lot of power.	Da, izgledao je kao neko sa puno moći.
But if you think.	Ali ako misliš.
And that is happening right now.	I to se dešava upravo sada.
I wondered if he would come back	Pitao sam se hoće li se vratiti
Even if it wasn't, it could have been.	Čak i da nije, moglo je i biti.
I don't even know what to say about it.	Ne znam ni šta da kažem o tome.
I thought it would for sure	Mislio sam da će sigurno
But you didn't.	Ali nisi.
It should be simple, but it's not.	Trebalo bi biti jednostavno, ali nije.
I know this now.	Znam ovo sada.
Life loves me.	Život me voli.
I was so happy to see them	Bio sam tako sretan što sam ih vidio
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam uradio ništa loše
While we won't.	Dok mi nećemo.
Yes, it's hard.	Da, teško je.
You want them now.	Želiš ih sada.
I thought it might be difficult for you.	Mislio sam da bi ti moglo biti teško.
I just knew that.	Samo sam to znao.
You may not have to say anything.	Možda nećeš morati ništa da kažeš.
This was good for that.	Ovo je bilo dobro za to.
I knew you would find him	Znao sam da ćeš ga naći
I still couldn’t believe it had happened	Još uvijek nisam mogao vjerovati da se to dogodilo
She can wear herself.	Ona može sama da se nosi.
It's just there, when it wasn't there yesterday.	Jednostavno je tu, kada juče nije bilo.
Everything was there.	Sve je bilo tamo.
Nice to see you.	Drago mi je da ga vidim.
Or he was.	Ili je bio.
He needed to know if I could help.	Morao je znati mogu li pomoći.
I think that will be all for today	Mislim da će to biti sve za danas
I can easily do that for you	Lako to mogu učiniti za tebe
He was everything.	On je bio sve.
You were right.	Bio si u pravu.
And it's not just you.	I nisi samo ti.
I think it looks good	Mislim da izgleda dobro
It has to work.	Mora da radi.
I shouldn't even be here	Ne bih ni trebao biti ovdje
But it's not.	Ali nije.
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
Oh no! 	O ne!
you think.	ti misliš.
There is nothing we can do for him.	Ne možemo ništa učiniti za njega.
He was probably thirty.	Vjerovatno je imao trideset.
No, not like that.	Ne, ne tako.
All so fast.	Sve tako brzo.
can't you	zar ne možeš.
I hope to see you there !.	Nadam se da ću vas vidjeti tamo!.
I won't get it.	Neću ga dobiti.
I wondered what had happened to him.	Pitao sam se šta mu se dogodilo.
I knew this was going to happen.	Znao sam da će se ovo dogoditi.
I know something happened	Znam da se nešto dogodilo
I'm so glad you're here !.	Tako mi je drago što si ovdje!.
I think they are right	Mislim da su u pravu
I was busy this morning too	Bio sam zauzet i jutros
The first time I didn't say anything.	Prvi put nisam ništa rekao.
As much as he could.	Koliko je mogao.
The sooner the better, really.	Što prije to bolje, zaista.
And they are no better for it.	I nisu bolji za to.
U.	U .
I wanted to know exactly what he meant.	Želeo sam da znam šta tačno misli.
It wouldn't be long.	Ne bi bilo dugo.
Which has to be like my real job.	Što mora biti kao moj pravi posao.
I knew he would do it	Znao sam da će to učiniti
They are there right now.	Trenutno su tamo.
I won't say that either	Ni ja to neću reći
You were right.	Bio si u pravu.
Over and over again.	Ponovo i ponovo.
I have no idea why that is.	Nemam pojma zašto je to tako.
Maybe too much.	Možda previše.
We would just never say that.	Jednostavno to nikada ne bismo rekli.
I don't want to do that.	Ne želim to da radim.
I knew what happened	Znao sam šta se dogodilo
I always knew what was going on	Uvek sam znao šta se dešava
I didn't know what you meant	Nisam znao šta misliš
I know what's good for you	Znam šta je dobro za tebe

I'm glad there is	Drago mi je da ima
I wonder where she was last night	Pitam se gdje je bila sinoć
I think you can get this	Mislim da ovo možeš dobiti
I thought he would already be here	Mislio sam da će već biti ovdje
I never had that.	Nikad to nisam imao.
Everything had to be done.	Sve je trebalo uraditi.
You can help me.	Ti mi možeš pomoći.
I haven't heard from you in three months	Nisam ništa čuo od tebe tri mjeseca
It wasn't real.	Nije bilo stvarno.
Now you are.	Sada jesi.
They were gone.	Više ih nije bilo.
And that could be it.	I to bi moglo biti to.
I have no idea how.	Nemam pojma kako to.
Few people do that.	Malo ljudi to radi.
I'm alone.	Sama sam.
I wish that hadn't happened.	Voleo bih da se to nije dogodilo.
We have.	Imamo.
I had it with you	Imao sam to sa tobom
I got back in the car	Vratio sam se u auto
I'm not sure that's a good idea.	Nisam siguran da je to dobra ideja.
This was too much.	Ovo je bilo previše.
What did they do?	Šta su uradili.
He said everything he could.	Rekao je sve što je mogao.
I'll give it to him	Ja ću mu to dati
It's really simple.	Stvarno je jednostavno.
I have to do this for myself	Moram ovo da uradim za sebe

There was no problem.	Nije bilo problema.
One of us has to go	Jedan od nas mora da ide
It happens.	To se dešava.
I should have done more	Trebao sam učiniti više
And we'll know soon enough.	A uskoro ćemo znati.
I saw it all	Sve sam to vidio
He couldn't come back.	Nije se mogao vratiti.
That couldn't be it.	To nije moglo biti to.
I came to you as a friend	Došao sam ti kao prijatelj
But I do not know.	Ali ne znam.
I know what's going on there	Znam šta se tamo dešava
I have to tell everyone something	Moram svima nešto reći
And that is so true.	I to je tako istina.
That could happen.	To bi se moglo dogoditi.
Nobody has to say that.	Niko to ne mora da kaže.
I want you more than you know	Želim te više nego što znaš
You just knew he wanted you.	Znao si samo da te želi.
You all know.	Svi znate.
I think someone did it.	Mislim da je neko to uradio.
It won't be that hard.	Neće biti tako teško.
We have to.	Moramo.
That's what he thought of us.	To je on mislio o nama.
And we have to go back.	I moramo se vratiti.
And never really understood.	I nikad stvarno shvatio.
Everything will come as it should.	Sve će doći kako treba.
It probably won't be.	Verovatno neće biti.
I will go.	Ja ću ići.
I have a question.	Imam pitanje.
I wondered what to do now	Pitao sam se šta da radim sada
I couldn't go back to that	Nisam se mogao vratiti na to
I know you had a bad day too	Znam da si i ti imao loš dan
I'm afraid not	Bojim se da nije
I should probably have seen this	Vjerovatno sam trebao vidjeti ovo
To be nobody.	Da ne budem niko.
I wouldn't hear of it	Ne bih čuo za to
I think it's better that way.	Mislim da je bolje tako.
I'm alone, you know	Samo sam, znaš
You have to come.	Morate doći.
I was really busy	Bio sam zaista zauzet
That's not happening here.	To se ne dešava ovde.
I never even heard him speak really	Nikad ga nisam ni čuo da govori zaista
No, that wasn't it.	Ne, to nije bilo to.
I'm sure we're there	Siguran sam da smo tamo
I just know.	Samo znam.
I didn't know about this	Nisam znao za ovo
I don't know how to work.	Ne znam da radim.
I like that you're there	Sviđa mi se što si tamo
I think you could have done something.	Mislim da si mogao nešto da uradiš.
They were more like people.	Bili su više kao ljudi.
We are not.	Nismo.
I hope you're better now	Nadam se da ti je sada bolje
He wasn't there.	Nije bio tamo.
I saw the problem.	Vidio sam problem.
He was neither happy nor sorry.	Nije mu bilo ni drago ni žao.
I don't know when that happened	Ne znam kada se to dogodilo
He could do anything.	Mogao je sve.
He was absolutely right.	Bio je potpuno u pravu.
I hope you go home soon	Nadam se da ćeš uskoro otići kući
I would like to be better and better.	Voleo bih da budem sve bolji i bolji.
It works pretty well.	Radi prilično dobro.
I didn't mean to tell you	Nisam htela da ti kažem
They will say yes.	Oni će reći da.
I hope my business is going well	Nadam se da mi posao ide dobro
I didn't really hear what he was saying	Nisam baš čuo šta govori
Someone was there.	Neko je bio tamo.
Your father probably heard of him.	Tvoj otac je vjerovatno čuo za njega.
He knew it was wrong.	Znao je da nije u redu.
All she knew was that he was gone.	Sve što je znala je da je otišao.
I think why them	Mislim zašto baš oni
Let's do it ourselves.	Uradimo to sami.
There was something in it.	Bilo je nešto u tome.
It was not what he expected at all.	Uopšte nije bilo ono što je očekivao.
I never want anything to do with him	Nikada ne želim ništa sa njim
Life is for life.	Život je za život.
I guess that was pretty good	Pretpostavljam da je to bilo prilično dobro
I have nothing better to do	Nemam ništa bolje da radim
I think for the first time	Mislim prvi put
I wasn't even sure what was going on	Nisam ni bio siguran šta se dešava
This is fine.	Ovo je u redu.
I hope you can help me	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći
He was a really good man.	On je zaista bio dobar čovjek.
I would love that.	Voleo bi to.
I think we should get back to that	Mislim da bi se trebali vratiti na to
I got lost almost instantly	Izgubio sam se skoro trenutno
But we weren't.	Ali nismo bili.
That's it now.	To je to sada.
I knew how he felt.	Znao sam kako se osjeća.
I did not know.	Nisam znala.
But obviously it is.	Ali očigledno je tako.
He was right !.	Bio je u pravu!.
It's not my job.	Nije moj posao.
Lots of time	Mnogo vremena
For better or worse.	Bilo na dobro ili loše.
There is nothing to talk about.	Nema šta da se priča.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Nisam siguran kako da to uradim.
I'm sure you want to talk	Siguran sam da želiš razgovarati
But he did much more than that.	Ali učinio je mnogo više od toga.
I want to help him.	Želim mu pomoći.
I love talking to you	Volim razgovarati s tobom
I was ready to ask what he was talking about	Bio sam spreman da pitam o čemu priča
It could be nothing.	Moglo bi biti ništa.
I do a job that no one wants to do	Radim posao koji niko ne želi da radi
Not before time.	Ne prije vremena.
I know you have them	Znam da ih imaš
Not on me.	Ne na mene.
Just for yourself.	Samo za sebe.
I lost him this morning	Izgubio sam ga jutros
I told him not to do that	Rekao sam mu da to ne radi
I have to give it to him.	Moram mu to dati.
If it was easy, everyone would do it.	Da je lako, svi bi to uradili.
he thought.	mislio je.
It happens to us too.	I nama se to dešava.
I guess that could happen	Pretpostavljam da bi se to moglo dogoditi
Just like at home.	Baš kao kod kuće.
Or he thought he was.	Ili je mislio da jeste.
I had no idea what was going on	Nisam imao pojma šta se dešava
You don't even know how bad it was.	Čak i ne znaš koliko je bilo loše.
I could do that too	I ja bih to mogao
I should be back this afternoon	Trebao bih se vratiti danas popodne
I came for you	Došao sam po tebe
So it's a bit like here.	Tako da je malo kao ovde.
I just need to work on it, and so will you.	Ja samo treba da radim na tome, a i ti ćeš.
What's happening.	Šta se dešava.
It's just there.	Samo je tamo.
I'm not ready for dinner	Nisam spreman za večeru
And you're back.	I ti si se vratio.
I didn't do this	Nisam ovo uradio
We don't even know they're still there.	Čak ni ne znamo da su još tamo.
I know it must have been hard for you	Znam da ti je sigurno bilo teško
It's hard for me	Teško mi je
Yes, something should be done.	Da, nešto bi trebalo učiniti.
This time I thought so	Ovaj put sam to mislio
We still have a lot here.	Još uvijek imamo puno ovdje.
I just don't have time	Jednostavno nemam vremena
I would be alone.	Bio bih sam.
But my code won't work.	Ali moj kod neće raditi.
That would be true.	To bi bilo tačno.
I have to go to school	Moram u školu
It was so simple.	Bilo je tako jednostavno.
I guess he won't come back	Pretpostavljam da se neće vratiti
I didn't expect to talk to him	Nisam očekivao da ću razgovarati s njim
She didn't want to do that.	Nije htela da to uradi.
I have here.	Imam ovde.
I gave it my all	Dao sam sve
And they are not a problem.	I nisu problem.
There is a good reason for that.	Za to postoji dobar razlog.
And more of us than ever feel that way.	I više nas nego ikada osjeća se tako.
You're still there.	Još si tamo.
And there.	I tamo.
I really don't know what to do	Zaista ne znam šta da radim
I've said that before	Rekao sam to ranije
I heard it here.	Čuo sam to ovde.
It was much more.	Bilo je mnogo više.
He's at my house.	On mi je kod kuće.
I knew exactly how he felt	Tačno sam znao kako se osjeća
I couldn't leave.	Nisam mogao otići.
A lot of it.	Nego mnogo.
I know you better.	Znam te bolje.
I mean, really, it is	Mislim, zaista, jeste
He didn't try.	Nije pokušao.
I never asked why.	Nikada nisam pitao zašto.
I can't believe what you just did for me	Ne mogu vjerovati šta si upravo uradio za mene
I can't say that now	Ne mogu to sada reći
But the door was not there.	Ali vrata nisu bila tamo.
That's so bad.	To je tako loše.
That hasn't happened yet.	To se još nije dogodilo.
The team that was here did their best.	Tim koji je bio ovdje dao je sve od sebe.
No.	Ne.
I didn't mean it.	Nisam ni mislio.
It's still working.	Još uvijek radi.
I know what you did tonight.	Znam šta si uradio večeras.
I always pray for you	Uvek se molim za tebe
I'm not there yet.	Nisam još tamo.
I have to be with you	Moram biti s tobom
And he will have to do that.	I to će morati da uradi.
And I want to go there	I ja želim da idem tamo
I always wanted to know more	Uvek sam želeo da znam više
I mean, nobody's here	Mislim, niko nije ovde
That time was not like today.	To vrijeme nije bilo kao danas.
I actually wanted to go with him	Ja sam zapravo htela da idem sa njim
What does it look like ?.	Kako to izgleda?.
I have one	Ja imam jedan
My friend asked me to do it.	Moj prijatelj me je zamolio da to uradim.
You know better.	Ti znaš bolje.
She just isn't who she is.	Jednostavno nije ko je ona.
I decided	Odlučio sam se
I just didn't expect him to be gone for so long	Samo nisam očekivao da će ga tako dugo nema
When, she didn't know.	Kada, nije znala.
A little more than.	Nešto više od.
I see you tried	Vidim da si pokušao
I told him we would be right back	Rekao sam mu da ćemo se odmah vratiti
I should go home.	Trebao bih ići kući.
This is probably not it.	Ovo vjerovatno nije to.
I started without you	Počeo sam bez tebe
I still want it.	I dalje to želim.
I have to go on a trip.	Moram da idem na put.
Maybe more.	Možda i više.
I need it now.	Treba mi sada.
You are very right.	Veoma ste u pravu.
Now I have decided.	Sada sam odlučio.
I should have known there would be none of that	Trebao sam znati da od toga ništa neće biti
It should have been.	Trebalo je biti.
I have no doubt he will do that.	Ne sumnjam da će to učiniti.
There was something.	Nešto je bilo.
I didn't mean that	Nisam to mislio
I should be sure now	Sada bih trebao biti siguran
It's not as bad as you.	Nije tako loše kao ti.
I just didn't see it.	Samo nisam vidio.
I'll still go if that's what you want	I dalje ću otići ako je to ono što želiš
I could do it myself.	Mogao sam to i sam.
Obviously not obvious.	Očigledno nije očigledno.
I still have it today.	Imam ga i danas.
I know they are here	Znam da su ovde
I should have been ready	Trebao sam biti spreman
I asked him how many there were.	Pitao sam ga koliko ih ima.
I know this is going to be hard, but do this	Znam da će ovo biti teško, ali uradi ovo
I'm not just leaving for a few days	Neću otići samo nekoliko dana
It was actually a pretty simple question.	To je zapravo bilo prilično jednostavno pitanje.
They are not.	Nisu.
I think so	Mislim da je tako
I didn't go back to work	Nisam se vratio na posao
I couldn't bring it back	To nisam mogao vratiti
I had nothing to say	Nisam imao šta da kažem
And we didn't even know.	A nismo ni znali.
I wonder if that's true	Pitam se da li je to istina
It seems to work very well.	Čini se da radi vrlo dobro.
It's not that.	Nije to.
I couldn't help myself.	Nisam si mogao pomoći.
Where it was.	Gdje je to bilo.
I should have stayed with him	Trebao sam ostati s njim
We need to move on quickly.	Moramo brzo dalje.
There is too much to do.	Ima previše toga da se uradi.
I can help you	Mogu ti pomoći
It was as if they had nothing to do with him.	Kao da nisu imali ništa s njim.
Maybe it's so good.	Možda je tako dobro.
He had to make sure no one was home.	Morao je biti siguran da niko nije kod kuće.
I didn't see any of that yesterday	Nisam video ništa od toga juče
He didn't want to be here.	Nije želio biti ovdje.
Nobody knows everything.	Niko ne zna za sve.
That was not good enough.	To nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
And if not.	A ako ne.
He didn't even see her.	Nije je čak ni vidio.
Everyone was right.	Svi su bili u pravu.
You heard me right.	Dobro si me čuo.
I just want to say.	Samo bih želeo da kažem .
I couldn't find anything better.	Nisam mogao naći ništa bolje.
This is hard for me.	Ovo je teško za mene.
She knew nothing.	Nije znala ništa.
Things you can do.	Stvari koje možeš da uradiš.
I know what he's going to do	Znam šta će uraditi
He got life.	Dobio je život.
That wasn't supposed to be either.	Nije ni to trebalo da bude.
There is no way to do that.	Ne postoji način da se to uradi.
He needed money.	Trebao mu je novac.
And he was.	I bio je.
Which should be fast enough.	Što bi trebalo biti dovoljno brzo.
I'm just a little tired	Samo sam malo umoran
That's exactly it.	To je upravo to.
And it should work.	I trebalo bi da radi.
I know about those things.	Znam za te stvari.
I don't think it exists.	Mislim da ne postoji.
You could too.	Mogao bi i ti.
I wonder.	Pitam se.
But he was no longer that man.	Ali on više nije bio taj čovjek.
So do we.	Tako da i mi to radimo.
I used to be, but now they are gone	Nekada sam, ali sada ih nema
No one will come to help you.	Niko neće doći da vam pomogne.
It works for now.	Za sada radi.
I didn't do it well	Nisam dobro uradio to
You either like it or you don't.	Ili ti se sviđa ili ne.
I'll tell him so.	Reći ću mu tako.
But that may not be enough, not even that.	Ali to možda neće biti dovoljno, čak ni tako.
That couldn't be done either.	Ni to se nije moglo uraditi.
I saw nothing and no one	Nisam video ništa i nikoga
Do you.	Da li ti.
Except it isn't.	Osim što nije.
I can't tell you how long	Ne mogu vam reći koliko dugo
You're not happy.	Nisi sretan.
He couldn't now.	Sada nije mogao.
You don't want that.	Ne želiš to.
I was already pretty busy this morning	Jutros sam već bio prilično zauzet
Everything can be bought.	Sve se može kupiti.
That's not the way we usually work.	To nije način na koji obično radimo.
There is something.	Ima nešto.
I've never been there before	Nikada ranije nisam bio tamo
We'll meet from you.	Naći ćemo se od vas.
Except this was real life.	Osim što je ovo bio pravi život.
I didn't expect it	Nisam očekivao
That's it, she said.	To je to, rekla je.
Something could happen.	Nešto bi se moglo dogoditi.
I wouldn't even ask, but you know.	Ne bih ni pitao, ali znaš.
I won't do it again	Neću to više raditi
You can and you must.	Možeš i moraš.
I wondered what she thought	Pitao sam se šta ona misli
This may or may not be true.	Ovo može biti istina, ali i ne mora.
I love you both, so, a lot	Volim vas oboje, tako, puno
I think you like it	Mislim da ti se sviđa
I want everything he just said and more	Želim sve što je upravo rekao i više
I love her too much for that	Previše je volim za to
I will be life for you	Ja ću biti život za tebe
He wants something more.	On želi nešto više.
It's for me.	Za mene je to.
A better way to say no is, you shouldn't	Bolji način da se kaže je ne, ne bi trebao
It was so hard, so hard, so hard.	Bilo je tako teško, tako teško, tako teško.
I don't have to ask	Ne moram da pitam
I'm not sure exactly	Nisam siguran tačno
And now she's not exactly for him.	A sada ona nije baš za njega.
My life could not have been better.	Moj život nije mogao biti bolji.
I have never seen anything like this happen before	Nikada ranije nisam vidio da se tako nešto dogodilo
Look at this and this.	Vidi ovo i ovo.
He must have done something right.	Mora da je uradio nešto kako treba.
I know they are there	Znam da su tamo
I had no one to tell me what was going to happen	Nisam imao ko da mi kaže šta će se dogoditi
Now we have enough money for the trip.	Sada imamo dovoljno novca za put.
He needed it.	Trebao mu je.
From now on.	Od sada.
I told you everything	Sve sam ti rekao
Don't tell me you're not.	Nemoj mi reći da nisi.
I don't want to know	Ne želim da znam
Question.	Pitanje.
I just hope she sees this too	Samo se nadam da će i ona ovo vidjeti
I said that.	Rekao sam to.
I didn't do everything myself	Nisam sve sam uradio
She didn't want this.	Nije htela ovo.
It will come in handy.	Dobro će mu doći.
And it won't.	I neće.
I didn't expect this	Nisam ovo očekivao
I can tell you, it can be yours	Mogu ti reći, i tvoj može biti
I can't find anything about it.	Ne mogu naći ništa o tome.
He will say anything.	Reći će bilo šta.
I think you have to be a team.	Mislim da morate biti tim.
I wasn't sure what happened	Nisam bio siguran šta se dogodilo
I never thought this day would come.	Nikad nisam mislio da će doći ovaj dan.
I could tell he was tired	Mogao sam reći da je umoran
Maybe he didn't really want to.	Možda baš i nije želeo.
That is very difficult.	To je veoma teško.
That's not what she's saying.	To nije ono što ona govori.
Just one problem.	Samo jedan problem.
I still want you to have me	Još sam ti da me imaš
You know my job.	Znaš moj posao.
I think everyone was happy about that	Mislim da je svima bilo drago zbog toga
Something we both know will never happen.	Nešto što oboje znamo da se nikada neće dogoditi.
But she knew it wasn't going to happen.	Ali znala je da se to neće dogoditi.
I gave it all back, you know	Sve sam vratio, znaš
And there was no one for a long, long time.	I nije bilo nikoga dugo, dugo.
He thought more.	Mislio je više.
I didn't know it was happening	Nisam znao da se to dešava
I don't know who she is.	Ne znam ko je ona.
I have no idea what he was doing there	Nemam pojma šta je tamo radio
I told you it would be fine	Rekao sam ti da će biti u redu
I saw it too.	I ja sam to vidio.
It wouldn't be right.	Ne bi bilo u redu.
Everyone seemed to know about it.	Činilo se da svi znaju za to.
I actually want to help him	Ja mu zapravo želim pomoći
And you wouldn't be here now.	A ti sada ne bi bio ovde.
I can't let you do that	Ne mogu ti dozvoliti da to uradiš
It's not that bad.	Nije tako loše.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
I'm ready for that	Spreman sam za to
I lost a friend.	Izgubio sam prijatelja.
You didn't want to.	Nisi htela.
And that's you.	A to si ti.
You can do it too.	I ti to možeš.
I have no idea what's going on	Nemam pojma šta se dešava
But not with me.	Ali ne sa mnom.
He didn't see it.	On to nije video.
We're not sure.	Nismo sigurni.
Times they didn't have.	Vremena koje nisu imali.
It wouldn't be that easy.	Ne bi bilo tako lako.
I know he wouldn't have any of that	Znam da ne bi imao ništa od toga
That's all I do.	Samo to radim.
I am nothing and everything.	Ja sam ništa i sve.
I thought it was okay	Mislio sam da je u redu
He should want to never see her again.	Trebao bi da želi da je nikada više ne vidi.
I couldn't tell him no	Nisam mu mogao reći ne
We can do it quickly, if you want.	Možemo to učiniti brzo, ako želite.
I just hope we can.	Samo se nadam da možemo.
He wants it.	On to želi.
I think they are better now	Mislim da su sada bolji
This is simple and easy.	Ovo je jednostavno i lako.
I don't want him.	Ne želim ga.
I do not know what to say.	Ne znam šta da kažem.
It won't help.	Neće pomoći.
Maybe not even that.	Možda čak ni to.
I've never seen them before.	Nikad ih prije nisam vidio.
But really, I never got there.	Ali zaista, nikad nisam stigao tamo.
I just want the truth.	Ja samo želim istinu.
She was good.	Bila je dobra.
I guess we could already be there	Pretpostavljam da bi već mogli biti tamo
I knew what was coming	Znao sam šta će doći
I wish you were there	Voleo bih da si bio tamo
I guess it would be	Pretpostavljam da bi bilo
I mean, like never before	Mislim to, kao nikad
I'm fine, he said.	Dobro sam, rekao je.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
I think they were pretty right	Mislim da su bili prilično u pravu
It is really obvious that this will happen.	Zaista očigledno da će se to dogoditi.
I know the way	Znam put
She told herself that everything would be fine.	Rekla je sebi da će sve biti u redu.
Which is not.	Što nije.
And that was the problem.	I to je bio problem.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to da uradim.
There are usually more of them.	Obično ih ima više.
That is just a game.	To je samo igra.
I know you already know that	Znam da to već znaš
I didn't ask you that.	Nisam te to pitao.
I do not know.	Ne znam.
It certainly is.	Sigurno jeste.
It would be so easy.	Bilo bi tako lako.
I could never go home	Nikada nisam mogao da idem kući
I'm sorry, but it has to be said.	Žao mi je, ali to se mora reći.
No problem here.	Ovde nema problema.
If you were, you would have left by now.	Da jesi, već bi otišao.
I didn't ask her.	Nisam je pitao.
I decided to tell him	Odlučio sam da mu kažem
Neither can you.	Ne možeš ni ti.
I don't think it will be a problem, but you never know.	Mislim da to neće biti problem, ali nikad se ne zna.
That's how I wanted him.	Tako sam ga htela.
Except they're not.	Osim što nisu.
I See You.	Vidim te.
But other than that, not much.	Ali osim toga, ne mnogo.
I want that.	Želim to.
I have no idea what this is	Nemam pojma šta je ovo
I am a good father.	Ja sam dobar otac.
I thought there would be more	Mislio sam da će biti još
I didn't know what my father was doing	Nisam znao šta mi otac radi
I can bring you back to life	Mogu te vratiti u život
I was fine.	Bio sam u redu.
I see it a lot.	Vidim to puno.
I wanted to be with him	Htela sam da budem sa njim
I shouldn't have been surprised	Nisam trebao biti iznenađen
I didn't tell you.	Nisam ti rekao.
I have no idea yet.	Još nemam pojma.
I was here today.	Bio sam ovdje danas.
I've had this before.	Imao sam ovo ranije.
I have no problem with that	Nemam problem sa tim
But it seems like it could.	Ali čini se kao da bi moglo.
But he knew what was happening.	Ali znao je šta se dešava.
It wouldn't be the first time.	Ne bi bilo prvi put.
Nothing exists by itself.	Ništa ne postoji samo po sebi.
I have money, a lot of money	Imam novca, puno novca
I was not allowed to be there with him	Nije mi bilo dozvoljeno da budem tamo sa njim
I know you're tired	Znam da si umoran
I have.	Imam.
I knew it was you.	Znao sam da si to ti.
I hope you will still believe me	Nadam se da ćeš mi i dalje vjerovati
I have no doubt that this is true.	Ne sumnjam da je to istina.
It works well.	Radi dobro.
Yes, he knows.	Da on zna.
I have all these things	Imam sve ove stvari
I really wish you hadn't said that	Zaista bih volio da to nisi rekao
This is my first time.	Ovo mi je prvi put.
Everything is OK.	Sve je u redu.
I want you to know how to do both	Želim da znaš kako se radi oboje
She works many days.	Ona radi mnogo dana.
He is not allowed to do that.	To mu nije dozvoljeno.
I've never been there	Nikad nisam bio tamo
This is very bad.	Ovo je jako loše.
And they know it.	I oni to znaju.
No problem here.	Ovde nema problema.
Nobody knew where he lived.	Niko nije znao gdje živi.
I already knew the truth	Već sam znao istinu
Not a day more.	Ni dan više.
He was not the only person this way.	On nije bio jedina osoba na ovaj način.
But it was more good than not.	Ali bilo je više dobro nego ne.
You need to know.	Morate znati.
Someone will find a way to do it.	Neko će naći način da to uradi.
I think you got it this time	Mislim da si ga ovaj put dobio
Everything was simple.	Sve je bilo jednostavno.
I want you so much.	Toliko te želim.
I don't want to know.	Ne želim da znam.
I don't want to stay here in the house	Ne želim ostati ovdje u kući
There was no one there.	Nije bilo nikoga.
I asked them what happened	Pitao sam ih šta se dogodilo
I was too busy.	Bio sam previše zauzet.
I never want to be without you again	Nikada više ne želim biti bez tebe
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
Maybe he thought it was you.	Možda je mislio da si ti.
But this was too much.	Ali ovo je bilo previše.
Everything seemed fine and working well.	Činilo se da je sve u redu i da radi dobro.
I thought, just for us	Mislio sam, samo za nas
I just wanted this done	Samo sam htela da se ovo uradi
I don't have time right now	Trenutno nemam vremena
You can work.	Možeš da radiš.
It's hard to say.	Teško je reći.
She actually has those things.	Ona zapravo ima te stvari.
I know, it's life.	Znam, to je život.
Not everyone is like me.	Nisu svi kao ja.
I thought that was what he wanted	Mislio sam da je to ono što želi
I immediately decided to go there	Odmah sam odlučio da idem tamo
I just wonder if that's true	Samo se pitam da li je to istina
I need to be able to see you	Moram te moći vidjeti
He would be such a good father.	Bio bi tako dobar otac.
He's probably right.	Verovatno je u pravu.
I had none of that	Nisam imao ništa od toga
Tired.	Umoran.
It was all just business.	Sve je to bio samo posao.
I have this.	Imam ovo.
It doesn't look right.	Ne izgleda u redu.
He didn't think so.	Nije mislio.
You told us what to do.	Rekao si nam šta da radimo.
Not for me, but.	Nije za mene, ali.
And one more thing.	I još nešto.
I know you want that too	Znam da i ti to želiš
It is everything and nothing.	To je sve i ništa.
That hasn’t happened in a while.	To se nije dogodilo već neko vrijeme.
He did that.	To je uradio.
I'm sure not.	Siguran sam da nije.
But they never did.	Ali nikada nisu.
Everything seems to be getting better.	Čini se da je sve bolje.
That really happened.	To se zaista i dogodilo.
I didn't want to see anyone	Nisam htela nikoga da vidim
Nothing bad.	Ništa loše.
If you don’t like it, it’s simple.	Ako vam se ne sviđa, jednostavno je.
It would be a good game too.	Bila bi to i dobra igra.
I'd like to be sure.	Želeo bih da budem siguran.
No one seemed to know where he was.	Činilo se da niko nije znao gdje je.
When, exactly.	Kada, tačno.
She said we would be back.	Rekla je da ćemo se vratiti.
It was not easy for me	Nije mi to bilo lako
I'm not sure what to think.	Nisam siguran šta da mislim.
But it can be done.	Ali to se može uraditi.
We do things the right way.	Radimo stvari na pravi način.
I know you've seen it all	Znam da si sve video
He went there	Otišao je tamo
You're done.	Završio si.
I hope to tell you everything in time	Nadam se da ću ti sve reći na vrijeme
I have money, a lot of money	Imam novca, mnogo novca
I can't find him.	Ne mogu ga naći.
I wasn't sure what he meant.	Nisam bio siguran na šta je mislio.
Maybe there would never be time.	Možda nikad ne bi bilo vrijeme.
There must be something wrong with me.	Mora da nešto nije u redu sa mnom.
But that, really, is not the case.	Ali to, zaista, nije tako.
I think she always has been	Mislim da je uvek bila
For now, he seems to be doing the right thing.	Za sada se čini da radi pravu stvar.
I had to know that.	Morao sam to znati.
And it goes on and on.	I ide dalje i dalje.
Much, much more.	Mnogo, mnogo više.
You can go home now.	Možete ići kući sada.
That's the way he wants it	To je način na koji on to želi
There is currently no one to talk to.	Trenutno nema s kim razgovarati.
I wish I had seen that	Voleo bih da sam to video
I wondered why that was	Pitao sam se zašto je to tako
He was just doing his job.	On je samo radio svoj posao.
She really is something.	Ona je zaista nešto.
He's trying to talk.	Pokušava da priča.
It works now.	Sada radi.
And that he is not alone.	I da nije sam.
I don't think anything about it	Ne mislim ništa o tome
He didn’t actually do things just to do things.	On zapravo nije radio stvari samo da bi radio stvari.
I am ready to give my life for you	Spreman sam dati svoj život za tebe
I didn't want to do that	Nisam htela to da uradim
I just wanted to see it	Samo sam to htio vidjeti
That may not be easy.	To možda neće biti lako.
She didn't know what was wrong.	Nije znala šta nije u redu.
I had never been so glad to be home before	Nikad mi ranije nije bilo tako drago što sam se vratio kući
Or it used to be.	Ili je to nekada bilo.
And I want to give it	I ja to želim dati
If you need to do it.	Ako treba da to uradite.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
Now we seem to know.	Sada se čini da znamo.
I thought that was what he wanted.	Mislio sam da je to ono što želi.
Maybe he's a little busy today.	Možda je danas malo zauzet.
I should have a little more tomorrow	Trebalo bi da imam malo više sutra
This is not the time.	Ovo nije to vrijeme.
You are a team.	Vi ste tim.
Like the radio.	Kao i radio.
I hope you like this one.	Nadam se da ti se sviđa ovaj.
He doesn't want anything from people.	Ne želi ništa od ljudi.
Good for me.	Dobro za mene.
Why are you so good.	Zašto si tako dobar.
Tell me what it looks like.	Reci mi kako to izgleda.
There was no time to ask.	Nije bilo vrijeme da pitam.
I was really fine	Zaista mi je bilo dobro
I didn't think you wanted that.	Nisam mislio da to želiš.
Really, it's not.	Zaista, nije.
I've seen it many times before.	Video sam to mnogo puta ranije.
Who knows why and I'm asking for help.	Ko zna zašto i molim za pomoć.
We all have.	Svi mi imamo.
I could bring them both back	Mogao sam ih oboje vratiti
None of us work.	Niko od nas ne radi.
I didn't know there was such a thing	Nisam znao da postoji tako nešto
I will not allow that	Neću to dozvoliti
I love you both a lot	Volim vas oboje puno
I just want him to be safe	Samo želim da bude siguran
He may or may not do it.	On to može ili ne mora učiniti.
No, she's good.	Ne, dobra je.
I always wanted to do that	Uvek sam to želeo da uradim
How much, he can't say.	Koliko, ne može reći.
I'm sorry, but it is.	Žao mi je, ali jeste.
It wouldn't take long.	Ne bi trebalo dugo.
It's hard to know what to do.	Teško je znati šta učiniti.
I know exactly what he can do.	Znam tačno šta on može.
Those were good times.	Bila su to dobra vremena.
He has it.	On ga ima.
I came back for it	Vratio sam se po to
I know you know who she is	Znam da znaš ko je ona
I would be very glad	Bilo bi mi veoma drago
I wasn't sure.	Nisam bio siguran.
But maybe it's just me.	Ali to sam možda samo ja.
I heard what's wrong with you.	Čuo sam šta je kod tebe.
He seemed to be doing a job.	Činilo se da radi posao.
Not even me.	Čak ni ja sam.
I didn't know that, actually	Nisam to znao, zapravo
He didn't know how to see it.	Nije znao kako to vidi.
I had no idea what he was talking about.	Nisam imao pojma o čemu priča.
Yes, that's a good thing.	Da, to je dobra stvar.
It wasn't the first time either.	Nije bilo ni prvi put.
He went back to work.	Vratio se na posao.
I better believe it, it wasn't easy.	Bolje mi je vjerovati, nije bilo lako.
Just tell me the truth.	Samo mi reci istinu.
Tell me how you want it.	Reci mi kako to želiš.
I've seen a lot of things here	Vidio sam puno stvari ovdje
She wants to go home again.	Ona želi ponovo da ide kući.
And we can do it.	I mi to možemo.
I came to talk to you	Došao sam razgovarati s tobom
Except I can.	Osim što mogu.
I wasn't ready for this	Nisam bio spreman za ovo
You will, you will.	Hoćeš, hoćeš.
I never went back.	Nikada se nisam vratio.
I knew they knew something.	Znao sam da oni nešto znaju.
But it may not be good for you.	Ali možda neće biti dobro za vas.
I know what you were looking for	Znam šta si tražio
But no one knows.	Ali niko to ne zna.
I can't tell you what to do or not	Ne mogu vam reći šta da radite ili ne
We both know what we're going to do.	Oboje znamo šta ćemo.
Maybe it already is.	Možda već jeste.
It's not just you.	Nisi samo ti.
I knew better than to ask	Znao sam bolje nego da pitam
I still couldn't see her	I dalje je nisam mogao vidjeti
I think it was me	Mislim da sam to bio ja
I told you she knew everything	Rekao sam ti da ona zna sve
I need money.	Treba mi novac.
I thought, this is for me	Mislio sam, ovo je za mene
He will do anything.	Sve će učiniti.
I knew he would do everything he could.	Znao sam da će učiniti sve što može.
I wondered why there were so many	Pitao sam se zašto ih ima toliko
It's just not that easy.	To jednostavno nije tako lako.
Who's with me?	Ko je sa mnom?
You're just saying it's a bad job.	Samo kažeš da je to loš posao.
It works well.	Dobro radi.
I was there to see it	Bio sam tamo da to vidim
There are so many problems.	Ima toliko problema.
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
I couldn't do this without you	Ne bih ovo mogao bez tebe
I will not buy it again	Neću ga ponovo kupiti
They were fine themselves.	I sami su bili u redu.
I wonder how long it takes	Pitam se koliko dugo to radi
I have money.	Imam novac.
It used to be good.	Nekada je bilo dobro.
It really was.	Zaista je bilo.
I just said that.	Upravo sam to rekao.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda ne.
I'm afraid he doesn't always tell the truth	Bojim se da ne govori uvijek istinu
They said it was okay.	Rekli su da je to u redu.
I can tell you the truth.	Mogu ti reći istinu.
I couldn't believe it was you	Nisam mogao vjerovati da si to ti
A lot more money.	Mnogo više novca.
I went too far and I will only go further	Previše sam otišao i ići ću samo dalje
He still has problems today.	I danas ima problema.
But it didn't happen that way.	Ali nije se tako dogodilo.
He didn't see him.	Nije ga vidio.
I was completely surprised	Bio sam potpuno iznenađen
He didn't want this day to come.	Nije želio da dođe ovaj dan.
He came again last week.	Došao je ponovo prošle sedmice.
I think of you a lot	Mislim na tebe puno
I asked for help, but you didn't	Tražio sam pomoć, a ti mi nisi dao
But for how long?	Ali koliko dugo?
I can't go to school	Ne mogu da idem u školu
I can not believe.	Ne mogu vjerovati.
I wonder if anyone knows if that is so	Pitam se da li neko zna da li je to tako
I can't say exactly what it is.	Ne mogu tačno reći šta je to.
He knew little.	Malo je znao.
You have three.	Imaš tri.
It's not that easy.	Nije tako lako.
He knew that.	To je znao.
Is there a way to do that.	Postoji li način da to uradimo.
She told him so much.	Toliko mu je rekla.
She knew now.	Sada je znala.
She was fine.	Bila je dobro.
I'm not sure why exactly.	Nisam siguran zašto tačno.
Maybe I'll never do anything again	Možda više nikad ništa neću uraditi
I can't stay here much longer	Ne mogu još dugo ostati ovdje
She was right.	Bila je u pravu.
That cannot be done.	To se ne može uraditi.
That's what my father did.	To je moj otac uradio.
I saw him here.	Video sam ga ovde.
I've had enough of him.	Dosta mi ga je.
Not even a little	Čak ni malo
We have to be here for three days.	Moramo biti ovdje tri dana.
You would too.	I ti bi.
He would know it was.	Znao bi da jeste.
It is what it is.	To je ono što jeste.
I do what you do.	Ja radim ono što ti radiš.
He's a good guy.	On je dobar momak.
I didn't know what it was about	Nisam znao o čemu se radi
But not now.	Ali ne sada.
I'm telling you, they'll trust you for everything	Kažem ti da će ti vjerovati za sve
I could do that.	Mogao bih to učiniti.
I know it must be hard	Znam da mora da je teško
I certainly don't know.	Ja sigurno ne znam.
I wasn’t sure if he was going to leave or not	Nisam bio siguran da li će otići ili ne
Something is better than nothing.	Nešto je bolje nego ništa.
I think he knows that too	Mislim da i on to zna
I can't do everything for you	Ne mogu sve za tebe
Maybe she's fine.	Možda je ona dobro.
I can't believe what we don't know	Ne mogu vjerovati u ono što ne znamo
He's planning something.	Nešto planira.
But what has happened now is nothing.	Ali ovo što se sada dogodilo je ništa.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
I have everything you need	Imam sve što ti treba
I just can't take it anymore.	Jednostavno ne mogu više.
The day started very well.	Dan je počeo vrlo dobro.
I saw what was happening.	Video sam šta se dešava.
I've never been so happy.	Nikad nisam bio tako sretan.
I'm glad you're with us.	Drago mi je da ste sa nama.
I wasn’t the only one who left	Nisam bio jedini koji je otišao
And it was true.	I bila je istina.
I know that's the reason now	Znam da je to sada razlog
Please if anyone knows a reason to help me.	Molim vas, ako neko zna razlog da mi pomogne.
I just won't tell anyone	Samo nikome ništa neću reći
I didn't know it was so bad	Nisam znao da je tako loše
That could be him.	To bi mogao biti i on.
But no, it's not that simple.	Ali ne, nije to tako jednostavno.
But I doubt you can give me one.	Ali sumnjam da mi možeš dati jedan.
Who, you always are.	Ko, uvek jesi.
But very little.	Ali vrlo malo.
I'm good enough, and I'm busy here.	Ja sam dovoljno dobro, i ovde sam zauzet.
He knew very well what to do, how much to do.	On je vrlo dobro znao šta da radi, koliko da radi.
I need to know everything	Moram da znam sve
I wouldn't do that.	Ne bih to radio.
I don't know what to do about it.	Ne znam šta da radim o tome.
It must be one of you.	Mora biti neko od vas.
I can't do without you	Ne mogu bez tebe
He said so.	On je tako rekao.
Not much could be seen.	Nije se moglo puno vidjeti.
Just not from me.	Samo ne od mene.
It won't be instantaneous.	Neće biti trenutno.
I’m actually better than good.	Zapravo sam bolje nego dobro.
And we do that even when we don’t have to.	I to radimo čak i kada ne moramo.
He's probably still there.	Verovatno je još uvek tamo.
I had no problem with it	Nisam imao problema sa njim
He didn't have time for any of that.	Nije imao vremena ni za šta od toga.
And no one sees that.	I to niko ne vidi.
Nothing can happen.	Ništa se ne može dogoditi.
Which was often the case.	Što je često bilo.
I didn't think you wanted more	Nisam mislio da želiš više
I could never do something like that	Nikad ne bih mogao da uradim tako nešto
I didn't buy anything	Nisam kupio ništa
He told me he wanted to talk to me.	Rekao mi je da želi razgovarati sa mnom.
You should have said that earlier.	Trebao si to ranije reći.
Except to say this.	Osim da ovo kažem.
He had a few things.	Imao je nekoliko stvari.
It was a simple question.	Bilo je to jednostavno pitanje.
Can you do that for me.	Možeš li to učiniti za mene.
That's exactly what they did.	Upravo su to uradili.
I do not see anything wrong with it.	Ne vidim ništa loše u tome.
I have to go to a meeting.	Moram na sastanak.
I need some more time	Treba mi još malo vremena
I didn't hear them all	Nisam ih sve čuo
But, but.	Ali, ali.
A few days, he said	Nekoliko dana, rekao je
He could see why.	Mogao je da vidi zašto.
We had it with me.	Imali smo ga kod mene.
It wasn't like anyone knew either way.	Nije bilo da bilo ko zna na bilo koji način.
I wasn't for it.	Nisam bio za to.
It was just them or me	Bili smo jednostavno oni ili ja
Everything will be.	Sve će biti.
I didn't know what was going on	Nisam znao šta se dešava
He was good.	Bio je dobar.
I never heard anything	Nikad nisam čuo ništa
But it's really, really good to be here.	Ali stvarno, stvarno je dobro biti ovdje.
I guess none of us know what to say	Pretpostavljam da niko od nas ne zna šta da kaže
You always want more.	Uvijek želiš više.
Maybe he could.	Možda bi mogao.
One with.	Jedan sa.
I like that about him	Sviđa mi se to kod njega
And it didn't.	I nije.
I know about those things	Znam za te stvari
He knew exactly how to play this.	Tačno je znao kako se ovo igra.
I just didn’t expect anyone like that.	Jednostavno nisam očekivao nikoga tako.
Neither do you.	Ni ti.
I think maybe you can help me	Mislim da mi možda možeš pomoći
I had to know the truth	Morao sam da znam istinu
There you are.	Tu ste.
I didn't know who he was until today	Nisam znao ko je on do danas
I'm done here.	Završio sam ovdje.
I thought.	Mislio sam.
I'm not as afraid of you as I am	Ne bojim te se toliko koliko toga
It was just something.	Bilo je samo nešto.
And probably would.	I vjerovatno bi.
I would never do that at home	Nikad to ne bih uradio kod kuće
Not only.	Ne samo .
But it should be for everyone.	Ali to treba da bude za sve.
I did it too, but I can't take it anymore	I ja sam to uradio, ali ne mogu više
To see them.	Da ih vidim.
We need to see how it goes.	Moramo vidjeti kako to ide.
That wasn't a problem.	To nije bio problem.
I can't help myself	Ne mogu si pomoći
I think that's for sure	Mislim da je to sigurno
I thought it was you	Mislio sam da si ti
I must have done it myself.	Mora da sam to sam uradio.
I'll tell you things	Reći ću ti stvari
And he was absolutely right.	I bio je potpuno u pravu.
They will never see him again.	Nikad ga više neće vidjeti.
The thing is, it's never enough.	Stvar je u tome da nikad nije dovoljno.
I just didn't get it	Jednostavno nisam shvatio
And it was hard.	I bilo je teško.
If you can't, we will.	Ako ne možete, mi ćemo to učiniti.
He knew exactly what he was doing to me.	Tačno je znao šta mi radi.
But that's not what he wanted now.	Ali to sada nije ono što je želio.
There seems to be nothing I can do today	Čini se da danas ništa ne mogu da uradim
There were many of them.	Bilo ih je mnogo.
I should have been here	Trebao sam biti ovdje
Money seemed like a good thing at the time.	Novac je u to vrijeme izgledao kao dobra stvar.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I'm afraid he would try anything	Bojim se da bi pokušao bilo šta
This can't go on.	Ovo ne može dalje.
I didn't know before	Nisam znao ranije
I didn't ask why.	Nisam pitao zašto.
And this one.	I ovaj.
I don't know how to do this.	Ne znam kako da ovo uradim.
What you look like is true.	Kako izgledaš je tačno.
Tell me what you want from me.	Reci šta hoćeš od mene.
I should have seen that earlier	Trebao sam to vidjeti ranije
He worked on it.	Radio je na tome.
I want something more	Želim nešto više
He may not come.	Možda neće doći.
And she does.	I ona to radi.
Yes, yes, yes.	Da, da, da.
But it's a job.	Ali to je posao.
I didn’t know it could be	Nisam znao da bi to moglo biti
And she was.	I ona je bila.
I'm sure we'll see this again.	Siguran sam da ćemo ovo ponovo vidjeti.
I was sure he would help me	Bio sam siguran da će mi pomoći
That can never be enough.	Toga nikada ne može biti dosta.
I had a few.	Imao sam nekoliko.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
You just have to do it.	Samo moraš to da uradiš.
Everything is fine here except.	Ovde je sve dobro osim.
I want to go home.	Želim ići kući.
I need to know how it is	Moram da znam kako je
I'm sorry I never went to see him	Žao mi je što nikad nisam otišao da ga vidim
Now we can, obviously.	Sada možemo, očigledno.
I have no idea what's wrong with him	Nemam pojma šta je s njim
It was always this or that.	Uvijek je bilo ovo ili ono.
Tell me what you need.	Reci mi šta ti treba.
I can't tell you anything	Ne mogu ti ništa reći
I know how she works	Znam kako ona radi
I can't let anyone do that	Ne mogu to nikome dozvoliti
I never told anyone	Nikad nikome nisam rekao
It's not.	Nije.
Not enough money.	Nema dovoljno novca.
I didn't want this job anymore	Nisam više želio ovaj posao
I think it's helpful.	Mislim da je od pomoći.
I have to say something.	Moram nešto reći.
I had to know where the money went.	Morao sam znati gdje je novac otišao.
We are currently.	Trenutno smo.
We do what we have to.	Radimo ono što moramo.
There were a few more people there.	Tamo je bilo još nekoliko ljudi.
You never know when it will come in handy.	Nikad ne znate kada će vam dobro doći.
It wasn't good at the time.	U to vrijeme nije bilo dobro.
I wondered why he wasn't	Pitao sam se zašto nije bio
What's the problem.	U čemu je problem.
I wonder if anyone else is there	Pitam se da li je neko više tamo
You can stay.	Možeš ostati.
I guess that would be fine	Pretpostavljam da bi to bilo u redu
I have to give it to him	Moram mu to dati
It wasn't like him.	To nije bilo kao on.
What should we do?	Šta treba da uradimo.
I didn't want more power.	Nisam želeo više moći.
But you're right.	Ali u pravu si.
Like now.	Kao sada.
This is my problem.	Ovo je moj problem.
I still can't believe it	Još uvijek ne mogu vjerovati
I love it with you	Volim to kod tebe
This one works fast too.	I ovaj brzo radi.
I bought them.	Kupio sam ih.
They just didn't know it yet.	Samo to još nisu znali.
I'm so sorry.	Mnogo mi je žao.
That's what they did.	Tako su i uradili.
I thought he would come back	Mislio sam da će se vratiti
Maybe you have a good reason.	Možda imaš dobar razlog.
I hope it works for you	Nadam se da radi za vas
I could tell something was wrong.	Mogao sam reći da nešto nije u redu.
It doesn't look right.	Ne izgleda kako treba.
I want to love her.	Želim da je volim.
I came to see you both.	Došao sam da vas vidim oboje.
I didn't want any of that	Nisam htela ništa od toga
I just needed to stay home	Trebao sam samo ostati kod kuće
I knew right away he was right	Odmah sam znala da je u pravu
I just want my money.	Samo želim svoj novac.
From now on.	Od sada.
I have no doubt about it.	Ne sumnjam u to.
But no one did.	Ali niko nije.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu ide.
I am further and further away	Ja sam sve dalje
And now it just isn't.	A sada jednostavno nije.
He went there, but returned quickly.	Otišao je tamo, ali se brzo vratio.
How much he loves me.	Koliko me voli.
I knew it was real	Znao sam da je to stvarno
For nothing, for fun.	Ni za šta, za zabavu.
He is not afraid.	On se ne boji.
I didn't say we never would	Nisam rekao da nikada nećemo
I want to know how well he's doing	Želim da znam koliko mu dobro ide
It would be easy enough.	Bilo bi dovoljno lako.
I know it's going to be bad	Znam da će biti loše
I couldn't say anything	Nisam mogao ništa reći
He still didn't look like a bad man to me.	I dalje mi nije izgledao kao loš čovjek.
No, no, no.	Ne, ne, ne.
I really loved being there	Zaista sam volio da je tamo
But I never did.	Ali nikad nisam.
I wasn't sure about anything	Nisam bio siguran ni u šta
This doesn't look right.	Ovo ne izgleda u redu.
I know about him.	Znam za njega.
I made things	Ja sam napravio stvari
I really, really want to love him	Zaista, stvarno želim da ga volim
This can be done in one day.	Ovo se može uraditi za jedan dan.
I think there is more	Mislim da ima još toga
They just couldn't do it.	Oni to jednostavno nisu mogli.

There is nothing more to say.	Nema se šta više reći.
I don't really.	Ja zapravo ne.
That was always the real me.	To sam uvek bio pravi ja.

There just isn’t enough time to do it.	Jednostavno nema dovoljno vremena da to učini.

I knew it was a good idea	Znao sam da je to dobra ideja

My job is my job.	Moj posao je moj posao.
Nobody can do that.	Niko to ne može.
The problem was the road.	Problem je bio put.
I'm not one.	Ja nisam jedan.
I knew they would never be able to buy it.	Znao sam da ga nikada neće moći kupiti.
I was so happy to get her back	Bio sam tako sretan što sam je vratio
This time I was ready	Ovaj put sam bio spreman
Hope can help.	Nada može pomoći.
I mean, he's nobody.	Mislim, on je niko.
I can do it myself	Mogu i sam
And not just now.	I ne samo sada.
I'm not sure what's going on here.	Nisam siguran šta se ovde dešava.
That was it.	To je bilo tako.

Maybe there's a reason.	Možda postoji razlog.
To stay alone.	Ostati sam.

I didn't, but she can't be alone	Nisam, ali ona ne može biti sama

This will be you.	Ovo ćeš biti ti.
I was happy to see that	Bio sam sretan što sam to vidio
I didn't expect that at all	Nisam to uopšte očekivao
I thought that was it	Mislio sam da je to to
I know how he feels	Znam kako se osjeća
But he wasn't sure.	Ali nije bio siguran.
This is not a job for me.	Ovo za mene nije posao.
I didn’t know it could happen	Nisam znao da se to može dogoditi
I can do more if you want	Mogu više ako želiš
I just want to know who it was	Samo želim da znam ko je to bio
That is too much.	To je previše.
I will say so much about him.	Toliko ću reći za njega.
I want it to be mine	Želim da bude moja
I wasn't sorry about that	Nije mi bilo žao zbog toga
I knew about you, but	Znao sam za tebe, ali

Which was a problem for us.	Što je za nas bio problem.
Not bad really.	Nije loše zaista.

You're gone.	Otišao si.
I knew it would be soon	Znao sam da će uskoro biti

More is better.	Više je bolje.
Nobody really knows.	Niko zaista ne zna.
And they would really say it all.	I zaista bi sve rekli.
This is obviously true.	Ovo je očigledno tačno.
Not that there will be.	Nije da će ga biti.
But we can't stay here anymore.	Ali ne možemo više ostati ovdje.
We never were.	Nikada nismo bili.
I've never seen him before.	Nikad ga prije nisam vidio.
But we both know that's not true.	Ali oboje znamo da to nije istina.
And he was right.	I bio je u pravu.
I'm glad you like it.	Drago mi je da ti se sviđa.
I'll tell you exactly when	Reći ću vam tačno kada
I know who everyone is	Znam ko su svi
Which was never for me.	Što nikad nije bilo za mene.
But you are one too.	Ali i ti si jedan.
I didn't think it would be like that.	Nisam mislio da će biti tako.
He wanted to know if he could help.	Želio je znati može li pomoći.
He could.	Mogao je.
I hope this is okay with you.	Nadam se da ti je ovo u redu.
I couldn't talk to him	Nisam mogao razgovarati s njim
There should be more people here.	Ovdje bi trebalo biti više ljudi.
I thought you said he was a man	Mislio sam da si rekao da je čovjek
I haven't got it yet.	Još ga nisam dobio.
I should have told you before now	Trebao sam ti reći prije sada
I didn't even want to be there	Nisam ni želeo da budem tamo
There is no way to know.	Ne postoji način da se zna.
I love my life.	Volim svoj život.
I can't be sure.	Ne mogu biti siguran.
I wondered if he meant what he said	Pitao sam se da li je mislio ono što je rekao
I have to go back.	Moram se vratiti.
I think you already know the truth about that	Mislim da već znate istinu o tome
I haven't returned it yet	Još ga nisam vratio
I asked if he could stay a few more days.	Pitao sam da li može ostati još nekoliko dana.
None of us were sure of this.	Niko od nas nije bio siguran u ovo.
Nothing was wrong.	Ništa nije bilo u redu.
I just wasn’t sure if that was enough	Samo nisam bio siguran da li je to dovoljno
That's not so bad.	To nije tako loše.
It will make you not alone.	To će učiniti da niste sami.
But it was good for me.	Ali bilo je dobro za mene.
Just day and time.	Samo dan i vrijeme.
I had to be ready	Morao sam biti spreman
He never saw it.	Nikad to nije vidio.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
I would love that.	Voleo bih to.
It's simple.	To je jednostavno .
My father was.	Moj otac je bio .
I know you like it	Znam da ti se to sviđa
And you told me yourself that they are not human in any way.	I sam si mi rekao da oni nisu ni po čemu ljudi.
But that's not the point.	Ali ne radi se o tome.
I want to be happy for you	Želim da budem sretan zbog tebe
I never told anyone.	Nikad nikome nisam rekao.
But everyone is fine.	Ali svi su u redu.
You can do better and you should.	Možeš bolje i trebalo bi.
I haven't been here in many years	Nisam bio ovdje mnogo godina
Tell him.	Reci mu.
If you like someone, you like someone, you can't help yourself.	Ako vam se neko sviđa, neko vam se sviđa, ne možete si pomoći.
I will not be well	Neću biti dobro
The money was from you.	Novac je bio od tebe.
We did that last year.	To smo uradili prošle godine.
Who is he.	Ko je on.
No, it's okay.	Ne, u redu je.
I should have seen that	Trebao sam to vidjeti
But he will.	Ali hoće.
I thought it was just that	Mislio sam da je to samo to
Certainly not.	Sigurno nisu.
It's not.	Nije.
But if it's good for business, he'll do anything.	Ali ako je to dobro za posao, on će učiniti sve.
And about how glad he was to be here.	I o tome kako mu je bilo drago što je ovdje.
But today something happened.	Ali danas se nešto dogodilo.
I would never ask for that.	Nikada to ne bih tražio.
I wish she had told us	Voleo bih da nam je rekla
I want a car.	Želim auto.
I do things, you do things	Ja radim stvari, ti radiš stvari
I wasn't good at it.	Nisam bio dobar u tome.
This time.	Ovaj put.
he asked.	pitao.
I wondered what this was	Pitao sam se šta je ovo
I will stay with you.	Ja ću ostati s tobom.
I was very good at it.	Bio sam jako dobar u tome.
This, he said.	Ovo, rekao je.
I understood that immediately	To sam odmah shvatio
I mean no, they didn't	Mislim ne, nisu
I can already see that	Već sada to vidim
Maybe not that one.	Možda ne baš taj.
I do it for money	Radim to zbog novca
No one seemed safe.	Činilo se da niko nije siguran.
I couldn't see anything	Nisam mogao ništa da vidim
I don't know what to say or what to do.	Ne znam šta da kažem ili šta da radim.
There is none of that.	Nema ništa od toga.
Maybe it's nothing.	Možda nije ništa.
We had a problem.	Imali smo problem.
I didn't even see him	Nisam ga ni vidio
He can't, really.	Ne može, stvarno.
I have to go.	Moram ići.
I can't tell you what	Ne mogu ti reći šta
I should never have said	Nikad nisam trebao reći
It must be so.	Mora da je tako.
It was hard for me to see him	Bilo mi je teško da ga vidim
This is really hard.	Ovo je stvarno teško.
I would never be her	Nikada ne bih bio ona
You know how it was.	Znaš kako je to bilo.
We don't have that.	To kod nas nema.
I need to know they're fine	Moram da znam da su dobro
I should have known better than that	Trebao sam znati bolje od toga
I will from now on.	Ja ću od sada.
Who knows how many people.	Ko zna koliko ljudi.
You did well.	Dobro si napravio.
I can't do enough	Ne mogu dovoljno
I could tell it was something.	Mogao sam reći da je nešto bilo.
I had nothing to do with it	Nisam imao ništa s tim
I'd like some help.	Voleo bih pomoć.
You gotta do what you gotta do.	Morate raditi ono što morate.
That was my only hope.	To je bila moja jedina nada.
She didn't know how she knew that.	Nije znala kako je to znala.
He was who he was.	On je bio ono što jeste.
There are very few of them.	Vrlo malo ih ima.
I should have done those things	Trebao sam uraditi te stvari
I almost did these things	Skoro sam uradio ove stvari
Someone loved me	Neko me je voleo
I'll get more.	Ja ću dobiti još.
Unless, unless, unless.	Osim ako, osim, osim ako.
What could it be, the father asked.	Šta bi to moglo biti, pitao je otac.
And your friend is telling you something	I tvoj prijatelj ti nešto govori
Yes that is correct.	Da, to je tačno.
I shouldn't have known more than that	Nisam trebao znati više od toga
I really didn't want to	Zaista nisam htela
That may not be true.	To ne može biti tačno.
No, not that way.	Ne, ne na taj način.
Life was here and now	Život je bio ovdje i sada
This was a good thing for me.	Ovo je bila dobra stvar za mene.
Maybe you won't.	Možda nećeš.
I have to work here.	Moram da radim ovde.
No they didn't.	Ne nisu.
It is.	To je.
Maybe I'll never be able to	Možda to nikada neću moći
I shouldn't have done that	Nisam to trebao učiniti
I don't think there is such a thing	Mislim da nema tako nešto
It simply cannot be.	To jednostavno ne može biti.
That could easily happen.	To bi se lako moglo dogoditi.
What are you going to do? 	Šta ćeš uraditi?
He knew he would.	Znao je da hoće.
I'm not going.	Ja ne idem.
I haven't done that yet	Nisam to još uradio
Maybe it still exists.	Možda još postoji.
You should do that.	Trebao bi to učiniti.
I just had to get to him on time	Samo sam morao doći do njega na vrijeme
The car ran as it should.	Auto je radio kako treba.
It was really obvious.	Zaista je bilo očigledno.
But today is even better.	Ali danas je još bolje.
But they won't be able to.	Ali oni to neće moći.
Not everyone knew about it.	Nisu svi znali za to.
I can help with that	Mogu pomoći u tome
I never want to see him again	Ne želim ga više nikada vidjeti
But he knew it was time.	Ali znao je da je vrijeme.
I think she's fine right now	Mislim da je ona trenutno dobro
This is pretty good.	Ovo je prilično dobro.
Yes, a car.	Da, auto.
I'm glad you look so good.	Drago mi je što izgledaš tako dobro.
So it looks like it should work well, but it didn't.	Tako da izgleda da bi trebalo da radi dobro, ali nije.
And she will tell you that.	I ona će ti to reći.
I never knew what they were exactly.	Nikad nisam znao šta su tačno.
He knew she would be there.	Znao je da će ona biti tamo.
I'm sure you can help me	Siguran sam da mi mogu pomoći
I hope and pray he is right	Nadam se i molim se da je u pravu
And that is what is happening.	I to je ono što se dešava.
This is my code for now.	Ovo je moj kod za sada.
It's mine now.	Sada je moj.
I know what will happen	Znam šta će se dogoditi
I'm not coming home today	Neću se vratiti kući danas
He doesn't know what he's doing.	On ne zna šta radi.
It should be very simple.	Trebalo bi da je to vrlo jednostavno.
I don't see how it's done.	Ne vidim kako se to radi.
I even bought it	Čak sam i kupio
I didn't know what he was saying.	Nisam znao šta govori.
He liked to talk about himself.	Voleo je da priča o sebi.
I want this.	Želim ovo.
You're welcome.	Nema na čemu.
Tell us the truth.	Reci nam istinu.
Which he did.	Što je i učinio.
I didn't know anything about it.	Nisam znao ništa o tome.
Nobody wanted them.	Niko ih nije želeo.
He would lose himself.	Izgubio bi sebe.
I didn't come back just for the money.	Nisam se vratio samo zbog novca.
We've had enough.	Imali smo dovoljno.
No one needs to know.	Niko ne mora da zna.
You just won't say.	Samo nećeš reći.
He didn't know what awaited him here either.	Ni ovdje nije znao šta ga čeka.
I could never be better than him	Nikad ne bih mogao biti bolji od njega
He didn't expect that.	Nije to očekivao.
I just want to know she's fine	Samo želim da znam da je ona dobro
That's exactly what happened here.	Upravo to se dogodilo ovdje.
And much more.	I još mnogo toga.
He knew he had to tell the truth.	Znao je da mora reći istinu.
He knew he had lost me.	Znao je da me izgubio.
But they will never get it from me.	Ali oni to nikada neće dobiti od mene.
I would never do that.	Ja to nikada ne bih uradio.
He usually was.	Obično je bio.
They were getting better and better.	Bili su sve bolji i bolji.
I am happy to still have them.	Sretan sam što ih još uvijek imam.
It was so simple.	Bilo je tako jednostavno.
I knew this was it for me	Znao sam da je to to za mene
Which does nothing.	Što ne radi ništa.
I was supposed to be me.	Trebao sam da budem ja.
I shouldn't have done that to you	Nisam trebao to da ti uradim
I couldn't go on alone	Nisam mogao dalje sam
And that was fine.	I to je bilo u redu.
They didn't know what.	Nisu znali šta.
I guess that's okay too.	Pretpostavljam da je i to u redu.
Or maybe it was too much.	Ili je možda bilo previše.
And he is.	I on je.
I love you, you have to know that	Volim te, moraš to znati
I'm pretty good.	Prilično sam dobro.
He obviously could never do that	On to očigledno nikada ne bi mogao da uradi
I want the truth.	Želim istinu.
You're done.	Završio si.
I should have been here before that	Trebao sam biti ovdje prije toga
I had no idea it was that good	Nisam imao pojma da je tako dobro
I shouldn't trust him	Ne bih mu trebao vjerovati
He does what he says he will do.	On radi ono što kaže da će učiniti.
He knew.	Znao je.
He's doing well.	Dobro mu ide.
I told him he was absolutely right	Rekao sam mu da je bio potpuno u pravu
I have to go now	Moram da idem odmah
It's true.	To je tačno.
She doesn't know why.	Ona ne zna zašto.
The code is helpful.	Kod je od pomoći.
I really don't know how to do it.	Zaista ne znam kako to da uradim.
I can do it myself	To mogu i sam
I'm ready.	Spreman sam.
I told you and I told you.	Rekao sam ti i rekao sam ti.
It could be better.	Može biti bolje.
I could only go and work and be.	Mogao sam samo ići i raditi i biti.
Maybe.	Možda .
We can do much, much better.	Možemo mnogo, mnogo bolje.
I think that's true	Mislim da je to tačno
People can either believe it or not.	Ljudi mogu ili vjerovati ili ne.
But we couldn't know.	Ali nismo mogli znati.
Except it's not.	Osim što nije.
That's what happened this week.	To se dogodilo ove sedmice.
That's really my father.	To je zaista moj otac.
But who knows.	Ali ko zna.
I can't find it.	Ne mogu to naći.
He couldn't see anymore.	Nije mogao vidjeti više.
If not, they won't.	Ako ne, neće.
I think you came back with me	Mislim, da si se vratio sa mnom
Maybe not for me, but for you.	Možda ne za mene, ali za tebe.
Like all of us.	Kao i svi mi.
I know you're always there for me	Znam da si uvek tu za mene
I wonder if anyone is there	Pitam se da li je neko tamo
I was more than glad	Bilo mi je više nego drago
I can't do it alone.	Ne mogu to sam.
I had nothing to do with it.	Nisam imao ništa s tim.
I didn't know it was this week.	Nisam znao da je to ove sedmice.
He didn't need to carry me	Nije mi trebao da me nosi
And that's almost all.	I to je skoro sve.
It has to be there.	Mora biti tamo.
But that is still not enough.	Ali to još uvijek nije dovoljno.
I wonder how she feels	Pitam se kako se ona osjeća
I often have that problem	Često imam taj problem
There was no one left.	Nikoga više nije bilo.
I didn’t know much more than that	Nisam znao mnogo više od toga
I didn't want money.	Nisam želeo novac.
I have to find them.	Moram ih naći.
I know that really has to be true for me	Znam da to zaista mora biti istina za mene
That's me.	Taj sam ja.
It seemed to be both.	Činilo se da je oboje.
More things to buy.	Još stvari koje treba kupiti.
I had nothing more in me	Nisam imao ništa više u sebi
I think they are both right.	Mislim da su oboje u pravu.
They could be something.	Oni bi mogli biti nešto.
Not for long.	Ne dugo.
I never wanted this for myself	Nikad ovo nisam želeo za sebe
I want to do something for you	Želim nešto učiniti za tebe
That's a good thing for me.	Za mene je to dobra stvar.
And he seemed to be right.	I izgleda da je bio u pravu.
And he didn't come back quickly	I nije se brzo vratio
We knew what was going on.	Znali smo šta se dešava.
It was as he said.	Bilo je kako je rekao.
He asked for help.	Tražio je pomoć.
We just knew we had to do this.	Jednostavno smo znali da ovo moramo uraditi.
I knew it was going to be bad	Znao sam da će biti loše
And why can't he wait.	I zašto ne može da čeka.
He wanted nothing.	Želeo je ni za šta.
If they don't, they won't.	Ako neće, neće.
I had no idea this was going to happen	Nisam imao pojma da će se ovo dogoditi
I know you can help me	Znam da mi možeš pomoći
There will be plenty more soon.	Uskoro će ih biti još dosta.
I'm still not sure what to do.	Još uvijek nisam siguran šta da radim.
There is a problem today.	Danas postoji problem.
I haven't heard of any	Nisam čuo ni za jedan
I've been here so long.	Bio sam ovdje tako dugo.
He did well for himself.	On je dobro uradio za sebe.
I had to be there.	Morao sam da budem tamo.
We don't know what's going on.	Ne znamo šta se dešava.
I haven't seen it yet	Nisam to još vidio
It's something more.	To je nešto više.
No, that's not good.	Ne, to nije dobro.
You said you shouldn't.	Rekao si da ne treba.
I couldn't do this	Nisam mogao ovo da uradim
I just wasn't expecting you	Samo te nisam očekivao
I was more than ready to move on.	Bio sam više nego spreman da idem dalje.
I hope we have time.	Nadam se da imamo vremena.
I only came back a few times	Vratio sam se samo nekoliko puta
I wish I knew more.	Voleo bih da znam više.
Not in one day.	Ne za jedan dan.
It is OK.	U redu je.
That's really hard.	To je stvarno teško.
Not from you, please.	Ne od tebe, molim te.
I'm not good enough.	Nisam dovoljno dobar.
I guess no one wants to do something bad	Pretpostavljam da niko ne želi da uradi nešto loše
It wasn't before time.	Nije bilo prije vremena.
Works well anywhere.	Dobro radi bilo gdje.
I thought it might be.	Mislio sam da bi mogao biti.
I didn't see anything	Nisam video ništa
But it's hard.	Ali teško je.
I'm still working for it.	Još uvijek radim za to.
This man was his friend.	Ovaj čovjek mu je bio prijatelj.
Usually it was me.	Obično sam to bio ja.
We need to work harder.	Treba raditi više.
He tried three times.	Pokušao je tri puta.
And you could see them.	I mogli ste ih vidjeti.
But he said nothing.	Ali nije rekao ništa.
He knew better.	Znao je bolje.
That would never happen again.	To se više ne bi dogodilo.
I wondered, but heard nothing	Pitao sam se, ali ništa nisam čuo
Not for me.	Ne za mene.
I don't have that problem.	Ja nemam taj problem.
I know he needs to talk to you	Znam da mora razgovarati s tobom
I wondered where he was	Pitao sam se gdje je
You don't have to believe it.	Ne morate vjerovati.
I want to work for you	Želim da radim za tebe
Ought.	Trebalo bi.
I didn't say anything.	Nisam ništa rekao.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
You can leave now.	Možete otići sada.
That's the story.	To je priča.
But no, it was still there.	Ali ne, još uvijek je bilo tamo.
They will never find us.	Nikada nas neće naći.
I want everything and more to come	Želim sve i još više da dođe
We need to talk again tomorrow.	Moramo ponovo razgovarati sutra.
A lot of people are working on it.	Mnogo ljudi radi na tome.
I thought as you want to know.	Mislio sam kao što želiš da znaš.
I haven't been in a long time	Nisam bio dugo vremena
I pretty much know who it was	Prilično znam ko je to bio
Not a lot of time, but enough to do something.	Nije puno vremena, ali dovoljno da se nešto uradi.
I really think we should talk	Zaista mislim da bi trebali razgovarati
And he has to do it now.	I on to mora učiniti odmah.
He had never seen her before.	Nikada je ranije nije video.
I don't know if you can do that.	Ne znam da li to možeš.
You didn't do anything wrong.	Niste uradili ništa loše.
But there is a problem here too.	Ali i tu postoji problem.
He says he wants to talk to you.	Kaže da želi razgovarati s tobom.
It's just never.	Samo nikad nije.
I couldn't see you properly	Nisam te mogao vidjeti kako treba
I haven't done anything wrong yet.	Još nisam uradio ništa loše.
Maybe he's right.	Možda je u pravu.
But you're obviously not for me.	Ali ti očigledno nisi za mene.
I want to see how they would be now.	Želim da vidim kako bi sada bili.
This is easy to do.	Lako je ovo uraditi.
I will never believe in these things	Nikad neću vjerovati u ove stvari
Does not work.	Ne radi.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
It's really you.	To si zaista ti.
It's not real.	Nije stvarno.
I want to do it.	Želim to učiniti.
I don't think so	Mislim da to nije tako
I knew something bad was going to happen	Znao sam da će se nešto loše dogoditi
She knew who he meant.	Znala je na koga misli.
We're glad you're here.	Drago nam je što ste ovdje.
I do it for all of us	Radim to za sve nas
Maybe that was the reason.	Možda je to bio razlog.
I mean, it just wasn't me	Mislim, to jednostavno nisam bio ja
It was.	Bilo je to.
I think he knew that	Mislim da je to znao
It was so easy.	Bilo je tako lako.
I had to see you again	Morao sam da te vidim ponovo
That's it.	To je to.
That will not happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
I hope this works.	Nadam se da ovo radi.
I want to be there when you do.	Želim da budem tamo kada to uradiš.
But there may not be much time.	Ali možda neće biti puno vremena.
It's probably for the better.	Verovatno je na bolje.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
I can do what you asked	Mogu da uradim šta si tražio
Maybe we should.	Možda bi trebali.
He was tired.	Bio je umoran.
I think you should know	Mislim da bi trebao znati
It's really that simple.	Zaista je tako jednostavno.
He is the one and only.	On je jedan i jedini.
It would be very difficult.	Bilo bi veoma teško.
I shouldn't have seen it now	Nisam trebao to sada da vidim
And no one has ever done that before.	I to niko nikada ranije nije uradio.
I can't do this alone	Ne mogu ovo sam
He knew he wasn't.	Znao je da nije.
He never did anything alone.	Nikada ništa nije radio sam.
It does not exist.	Ne postoji.
You can go back to work.	Možete se vratiti na posao.
I couldn't say anything.	Nisam mogao ništa reći.
Just for me.	Samo za mene.
I am very happy to be here	Veoma sam sretan što sam ovdje
I didn't buy him anything	Nisam mu ništa kupio
You should know this.	Trebalo bi da znate ovo.
He thought he knew what it was about.	Mislio je da zna o čemu se radi.
.	.
I'm not sure if this is true.	Nisam siguran da li je ovo tačno.
How can you say.	Kako možeš reći.
He didn't want me here.	Nije me želio ovdje.
It's a game.	To je igra.
Not all together.	Ne svi zajedno.
I didn't work that way	Nisam radio na taj način
Yes, that's the way.	Da, to je način.
This man doesn't.	Ovaj čovjek ne.
We did it.	Uradili smo to.
I just couldn’t believe it	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati
No, you don't have to tell me.	Ne, ne moraš mi reći.
That's not what he has to do.	To nije ono što mora učiniti.
To be done.	Da se uradi.
I knew he wasn’t that good for me	Znala sam da on nije tako dobar za mene
I want to know what he's doing	Želim da znam šta radi
I never thought you'd come	Nikad nisam mislio da ćeš doći
Not good enough.	Nije dovoljno dobro.
I don't mean that.	Ne mislim to.
I started doing it again	Počeo sam to da radim ponovo
I can't seem to help	Čini se da ne mogu pomoći
She doesn't know what that would be.	Ona ne zna šta bi to bilo.
Nobody can do that.	Niko to ne može.
So I wanted to see them again	Tako sam htela da ih ponovo vidim
I'm ready when you are	Ja sam spreman kad si ti
He thought it wasn't real.	Mislio je da to nije stvarno.
It was fast.	Bilo je brzo.
No one knows that better than you.	Niko to ne zna bolje od vas.
I really didn’t know I was doing it	Zaista nisam znao da to radim
If we all could.	Kad bismo svi mogli.
I just want to be your friend	Samo želim da ti budem prijatelj
I was fine with that	Bio sam u redu sa tim
It is very difficult.	Veoma je teško.
We can't stay long tonight.	Ne možemo ostati dugo večeras.
He is very good.	On je veoma dobar.
But she wasn't.	Ali nije bila.
It's your money, you can do whatever you want with it.	To je tvoj novac, sa njim možeš da radiš šta hoćeš.
I didn't start dinner either	Nisam ni ja počeo večeru
I was very happy for him	Bio sam veoma sretan zbog njega
He would lose it.	Izgubio bi ga.
I never thought he would get it.	Nikad nisam mislio da će to dobiti.
No one has a life like you.	Niko nema život kao ti.
He does the work for you	On radi posao za vas
I have no idea what that could be	Nemam pojma šta bi to moglo biti
He just knew it.	On je to jednostavno znao.
You never know when it might happen to you.	Nikad ne znaš kada ti se to može dogoditi.
He told me that.	To mi je rekao.
He just can't do it.	On to jednostavno ne može.
He was there.	Tu je bio.
I couldn't believe it either	Ni ja nisam mogao vjerovati
He is better now.	Sada mu je bolje.
I'm sure he'll be fine.	Siguran sam da će biti dobro.
Your father doesn't know that.	Tvoj otac to ne zna.
And it works well.	I dobro radi.
So it was really hard.	Tako da je bilo zaista teško.
Maybe you are.	Možda jesi.
I've seen it before.	Video sam to ranije.
I'm going to see him now	Idem da ga vidim sada
Either he will come or he will go.	Ili će doći ili će otići.
He tells me he's not sure.	Kaže mi da nije siguran.
I really hope he likes it	Zaista se nadam da mu se sviđa
That's really, really good.	To je stvarno, stvarno dobro.
I probably shouldn't	Vjerovatno ne bih trebao
What would they do.	Šta bi oni uradili.
I wonder why this is happening.	Pitam se zašto se to dešava.
He lost it this time.	Ovaj put ga je izgubio.
It will not return to what it once was.	Neće se vratiti na ono što je nekada bilo.
He didn't know how much.	Nije znao koliko.
Where are we going next.	Gdje ćemo dalje.
Not quite right with him today.	Nije baš u redu sa njim danas.
Do the right thing.	Uradi pravu stvar.
She's just.	Ona je samo.
She was right this morning.	Bila je u pravu jutros.
I could give you everything you ever wanted	Mogao sam ti dati sve što si ikada želio
There are obviously several problems.	Očigledno je nekoliko problema.
And he still wasn't sure what I was thinking.	I još uvijek nije bio siguran šta sam misli.
These are obviously not all.	Ovo očigledno nisu svi.
Better than good, really.	Bolje nego dobro, zaista.
I didn't even finish it	Nisam ga ni završio
I'll know where you are	Ja ću znati gdje si
Which is not certain.	Šta nije sigurno.
I wouldn't get anything.	Ništa ne bih dobio.
She's really good.	Ona je stvarno dobra.
I knew something was going to happen	Znao sam da će se nešto dogoditi
I think he's still waiting	Mislim da još čeka
I go to work.	Idem na posao.
It was real life.	Bio je to pravi život.
It's a meeting for that.	Za to je sastanak.
I mean, not like that	Mislim, ne tako
I was just wondering if	Samo sam se pitao da li
Maybe more.	Možda i više.
I have everything you need	Imam sve što ti treba
I ask why.	Pitam zašto.
Who will know for sure.	Ko će sigurno znati.
It works pretty well.	Radi prilično dobro.
If you didn't, you certainly would.	Da niste, sigurno bi.
I still think the story was good	I dalje mislim da je priča bila dobra
I'm a little lost here	Malo sam se izgubio ovde
I should have done it many years ago	Trebao sam to učiniti prije mnogo godina
I think this will have to for now	Mislim da će ovo morati za sada
This was not.	Ovo nije bilo.
I'm fine and I'm happy.	Dobro sam i sretan sam.
She wasn't.	Nije bila.
I couldn't do it alone	Ne bih to mogao sam
I thought you were here	Mislio sam da si ti ovdje
I was all that stuff	Bio sam sve te stvari
I couldn't believe what was happening to me	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta mi se dešava
All this.	Sve ovo.
This is just one.	Ovo je samo jedan.
They will always be after me.	Oni će uvek biti za mnom.
No one said that, but he was sure of it.	Niko to nije rekao, ali on je bio siguran u to.
I didn't know what was going to happen to me	Nisam znao šta će mi se dogoditi
He was sure of it.	Bio je siguran u to.
But you don’t have to do without it.	Ali ne morate bez toga.
But it won't be.	Ali to neće biti.
I do not know what to do.	Ne znam šta da radim.
Not just you.	Ne samo ti.
I knew that was not true	Znao sam da to nije istina
They must have done enough.	Sigurno su uradili dovoljno.
I didn’t know he was going to do it	Nisam znao da će to učiniti
It just takes time.	Samo treba vremena.
I still have a hard time beating him	Još ga moram teško pobijediti
I asked him what he did	Pitao sam ga šta je uradio
Not another one.	Ne još jedan.
I still didn’t know if it was okay	Još uvijek nisam znao da li je dobro
I shouldn't have said that.	Nisam trebao to da kažem.
I will definitely be back	Sigurno ću se vratiti
I knew something was wrong now	Znao sam da sada nešto nije u redu
The only question is when.	Pitanje je samo kada.
I want it for myself	Želim ga za sebe
He told me that himself.	On mi je to sam rekao.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
That was always the problem.	To je uvijek bio problem.
I just wasn’t together	Jednostavno nisam bio zajedno
And he did it well.	I dobro je to uradio.
I’ve seen enough of them to know that’s true.	Video sam ih dovoljno da znam da je to istina.
You can do it.	Možeš ti to.
I'll tell you when	Reći ću ti kada
That's your job.	To je tvoj posao.
That will say.	To će reći.
It's enough	Dosta mi je
They can't see me here	Ne mogu me vidjeti ovdje
I would do this.	Ja bih ovo uradio.
He's fine.	On je dobro.
I had to know what just happened	Morao sam znati šta se upravo dogodilo
You just have to believe.	Samo treba vjerovati.
You know, he lives life.	Znaš, on živi život.
I was there with you	Bio sam tamo sa tobom
It's always what you want.	Uvek je ono što želiš.
I had it.	Imao sam ga.
Sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga.
I knew it had to happen	Znao sam da se to mora dogoditi
This is life.	Ovo je život.
He wasn't so sure of himself.	Nije bio tako siguran u sebe.
You don't even have to return it.	Ne morate ga ni vratiti.
That's not what it is.	To nije ono što je.
It's not long.	Nije još dugo.
She thinks well.	Ona misli dobro.
I need a little help	Treba mi malo pomoći
He knew what she was.	Znao je šta je ona.
I didn’t know why it was so hard for me	Nisam znao zašto mi je to tako teško
I was sure it was real	Bio sam siguran da je stvarno
What was supposed to be.	Šta je trebalo da bude.
Few people live.	Malo ljudi živi.
And not for anything they did.	I ne za bilo šta što su uradili.
This could be bought.	Ovo bi se moglo kupiti.
And she would.	I htela bi.
I just have to be sure	Samo moram biti siguran
You are what you do.	Ti si ono što radiš.
None of that was real.	Ništa od toga nije bilo stvarno.
But you did it earlier.	Ali uradio si to ranije.
That was your life.	To je bio tvoj život.
That's actually a good question.	To je zapravo dobro pitanje.
I know how she can be	Znam kako ona može biti
And they don't know it.	A oni to ne znaju.
I seemed to do this often	Činilo se da ovo često radim
Not for many years, actually.	Ne već mnogo godina, zapravo.
I didn't do this for the money.	Nisam ovo uradio zbog novca.
But how long, how long.	Ali koliko dugo, koliko dugo.
It is.	To je.
But it is more than that.	Ali, to je više od toga.
I'm glad I did	Drago mi je što sam to učinio
I don't need to talk to him.	Ne moram razgovarati s njim.
I can not now	Ne mogu sada
I certainly didn't.	Ja sigurno nisam.
I don't know what the problem will be.	Ne znam šta će biti problem.
Like, now.	Kao, sada.
I didn't really mean that	Nisam to zapravo mislio
He had a lot of friends.	Imao je puno prijatelja.
I was just wondering something	Samo sam se nešto pitao
He is so happy to be here.	On je tako sretan što je ovdje.
I think he meant it	Mislim da je to mislio
He is now ready for work.	Sada je spreman za posao.
I wonder where they are	Pitam se gdje su
I didn't know it was so bad	Nisam znala da je tako loše
I do all these things alone now.	Sve te stvari sada radim sam.
I haven't had anyone in a long time.	Dugo nisam imao nikoga.
They did it for themselves.	Uradili su to za sebe.
I have to tell you something	Moram ti nešto reći
I'm glad he's my father	Drago mi je da je on moj otac
When she wasn't with him.	Kad nije bila s njim.
It was safe.	Bilo je sigurno.
I heard something about that	Čuo sam nešto o tome
It's true.	To je istina.
But that would not be difficult.	Ali to ne bi bilo teško.
How would I do that?	Kako bih to uradio?
And let me tell you, there aren't many.	I da vam kažem, nema ih mnogo.
She's there now.	Ona je sada tamo.
I thought you were happy for me	Mislio sam da si sretan zbog mene
You know this now.	Znaš ovo sada.
I'm doing it again.	Ja to radim ponovo.
I'm actually much better.	Ja sam zapravo mnogo bolji.
I would probably be safe there	Verovatno bih tamo bio siguran
To.	Da bi.
And you would be so good at it.	I ti bi bio tako dobar u tome.
You can come back here.	Možete se vratiti ovdje.
I only know about him	Znam samo za njega
Nobody says anything.	Niko ništa ne govori.
I never saw her again.	Više je nisam video.
He doesn't seem to have done anything.	Čini se da nije ništa uradio.
A lot more.	Mnogo više.
I almost knew he would	Skoro sam znao da hoće
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
He never asked me about it again.	Nikada me više o tome nije pitao.
It was a door.	Bila su to vrata.
If only.	Kad bi samo.
I'm not sure how to do that.	Nisam siguran kako to da uradim.
I guess there's a little bit in that	Pretpostavljam da ima malo u tome
And I thought you were doing it	I ja sam mislio da to radiš
I have no idea what he would say.	Nemam pojma šta bi rekao.
I thought you meant it	Mislio sam da si to mislio
I was pretty happy.	Bio sam prilično sretan.
It's just a matter of time.	Samo je pitanje vremena.
I wouldn't say that.	Ne bih to rekao.
I couldn't say those things	Nisam mogao reći te stvari
Not much.	Nije puno.
This should be no.	Ovo bi trebalo biti ne.
Don't go home yet.	Nemoj još ići kući.
And neither are you.	A nisi ni ti.
I want you to tell me all about it	Želim da mi kažeš sve o tome
I didn't need it.	Nije mi trebao.
I'm sorry we didn't have more time	Žao mi je što nismo imali više vremena
That's what we should do.	To bismo trebali i uraditi.
That was an easy question.	To je bilo lako pitanje.
It may be difficult.	Možda će biti teško.
And we don't need him.	I on nam ne treba.
I can't stay home today	Ne mogu ostati kod kuće danas
You can never be.	Nikad ne možeš biti.
I didn't ask anything from him, I didn't expect anything from him	Ništa nisam tražio od njega, ništa nisam očekivao od njega
It took me a long time	Trebalo mi je dovoljno vremena
I came before the house.	Došao sam prije kuće.
You were alone.	Bio si sam.
I like how it looks!.	Sviđa mi se kako izgleda!.
I want something simple	Želim nešto jednostavno
Which is pretty long.	Što je prilično dugo.
It was me.	Bio sam ja.
I knew what happened	Znao sam šta se dogodilo
But not at the time.	Ali ne u to vrijeme.
I never wanted any of that	Nikad nisam želeo ništa od toga
I haven't decided yet	Nisam još odlučio
He wanted me home.	Želio me je kući.
I didn't see her that way	Nisam je baš tako vidio
Nobody saw her.	Niko je nije video.
You've done enough.	Uradili ste dovoljno.
We need to get back to this.	Moramo se vratiti na ovo.
I thought they knew it	Mislio sam da oni to znaju
He said he was afraid for his life.	Rekao je da se boji za svoj život.
If not, no.	Ako ne, ne.
And he had to several times.	I morao je nekoliko puta.
You know how this is done.	Znate kako se ovo radi.
I never work.	Ja nikad ne radim.
I should go.	Trebalo bi da idem.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
I needed that.	To mi je trebalo.
It's just .	To je samo .
I thought it was.	Mislio sam da jeste.
That was not good.	To nije bilo dobro.
They are with us.	Oni su sa nama.
Do you think? 	Misliš li?
Another, and another.	Još jedan, i još jedan.
Like mine.	Kao i moj.
I couldn't see well	Nisam mogao dobro da vidim
I asked him not to do that, but he did	Zamolio sam ga da to ne radi, ali on jeste
He said he didn't like it.	Rekao je da mu se to ne sviđa.
I hope all is well with you.	Nadam se da je sve u redu s tobom.
I thought it was a good idea.	Mislio sam da je to dobra ideja.
I've never heard her speak before	Nikada je ranije nisam čuo da govori
I will never say that	Nikad to neću reći
That he wants more for himself.	Da želi više za sebe.
I have to do this alone	Moram ovo da uradim sam
You know why we're here.	Znaš zašto smo ovde.
That's what it is.	To je ono što je to.
I can get you anytime	Mogu te dobiti bilo kada
I know that very well.	Znam to vrlo dobro.
But man it is much more.	Ali čovjek je to mnogo više.
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is	Žao mi je, ali to je tako
I do not know either.	Ne znam ni ja.
I just wanted to be alone	Samo sam htela da budem sama
There was no one here who shouldn't be.	Niko nije bio ovdje ko nije trebao biti.
I hope you feel better.	Nadam se da ti je bolje.
I mean, it wasn't bad at all	Mislim, uopšte nije bilo loše
I can't believe he just told me that	Ne mogu vjerovati da mi je to upravo rekao
I think he's trying to reach me	Mislim da pokušava doći do mene
I did it for the money	Uradio sam to zbog novca
But just a little.	Ali samo malo.
But the problem is us.	Ali problem smo mi.
I tried, you have to trust me	Pokušao sam, morate mi vjerovati
I mean, he's nobody.	Mislim, on je niko.
Now I knew who he was	Sada sam znao ko je on
I was glad he was there.	Bilo mi je drago što je tamo.
We are the only ones who can do that.	Mi smo jedini koji to mogu.
I mean, that's all there was	Mislim, to je sve što je bilo
But no, they won't.	Ali, ne, neće.
I should probably go	Verovatno bi trebalo da idem
I mean, you've already done too much	Mislim, već si uradio previše
But you know it was.	Ali znaš da je bilo.
I almost want him	Skoro da ga želim
Nothing happened to us.	Ništa nam se nije dogodilo.
But maybe it's not so bad.	Ali možda i nije tako loš.
You know who you are.	Znaš ko si.
I'll tell you this	Reći ću ti ovo
I never say never.	Nikad ne kažem nikad.
But it was good.	Ali bilo je dobro.
She knows that.	Ona to zna.
I guess he's one of us now	Pretpostavljam da je sada jedan od nas
And maybe she can't do that.	A možda ona to ne može.
I'm totally fine.	Potpuno sam dobro.
A better way to say it is no, you shouldn’t.	Bolji način da se kaže je ne, ne bi trebao.
Now he knew why.	Sada je znao zašto.
I just won't tell you which ones.	Samo vam neću reći koje.
But she wants more.	Ali ona želi više.
I hope everything is fine	Nadam se da je sve u redu
You can do it !!.	Ti to možeš!!.
I have no more money	Nemam više novca
Now, to work.	Sada, na posao.
I didn't expect it to be	Nisam očekivao da će biti
And it wouldn't.	I ne bi.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
I have to work on it	Moram da radim na tome
I really haven't figured that out yet	Zaista to nisam shvatio do sada
Can anyone help.	Može li neko pomoći.
Just too much.	Samo previše.
But that is exactly what happened.	Ali upravo se to dogodilo.
We don’t need it for those things.	Ne treba nam za te stvari.
He didn't want to talk about it either.	Ni on o tome nije želeo da priča.
Where there used to be one, there are now three.	Gdje je nekada bio jedan, sada su tri.
I never wanted anything	Nikad ništa nisam želeo
But we can do much better.	Ali možemo mnogo bolje.
Again, please don't do that	Ponovo vas molim da to ne radite
She didn't know what to do with him.	Nije znala šta da radi s njim.
I just want to be alone, today	Samo želim da budem sama, danas
It wouldn't take long.	Ne bih trebao dugo.
In fact, it's right here.	U stvari je upravo ovdje.
he thought.	mislio je.
That is a good job.	To je dobar posao.
I shouldn't have left	Nisam trebao otići
I've already lost enough time here	Već sam izgubio dovoljno vremena ovdje
I just can’t believe all this, that’s all	Jednostavno ne mogu vjerovati u sve ovo, to je sve
I hope this helps you.	Nadam se da će vam ovo pomoći.
I do not have much time	Nemam puno vremena
I was happy to be here.	Bio sam sretan što sam ovdje.
And he looked just like me.	I izgledao je baš kao ja.
I really should go home	Stvarno bih se trebao vratiti kući
I know you know that.	Znam da to znaš.
And that has been a long time.	I to je bilo dugo vremena.
It's going well.	Dobro ide.
I'm not saying which one.	Ne kažem koji.
I've seen it before.	Video sam to ranije.
I would know that anywhere	Znao bih to bilo gdje
The job is good.	Posao je dobar.
I don't need this job.	Ne treba mi ovaj posao.
And that's all, you know.	I to je sve, znaš.
They were together.	Bili su zajedno.
I'm asking about you	Pitam za tebe
They had no money.	Nisu imali novca.
He was ready.	Bio je spreman.
I would love to see her	Voleo bih da je vidim
They may not be sure how to do it.	Možda nisu sigurni kako to učiniti.
I can't find her.	Ne mogu je naći.
How can I.	Kako mogu.
I can not tell you.	Ne mogu ti reći.
I just can't do this	Jednostavno ne mogu ovo da uradim
I did it to myself	Uradio sam to sebi
I should know better than to doubt myself.	Trebalo bi da znam bolje nego da sumnjam u sebe.
Probably so long.	Sigurno toliko dugo.
I think your team is your team	Mislim da je tvoj tim tvoj tim
He understood well.	Dobro je shvatio.
And tomorrow it will be thirty.	A sutra će biti trideset.
And much more !!.	I još mnogo toga!!.
When he was sorry.	Kad mu je bilo žao.
If you only knew what you were doing.	Kad bi znao šta radiš.
But tell me more about it.	Ali reci mi više o tome.
I asked to know if he loved me	Tražio sam da znam da li me voli
It was like home.	Bilo je kao kod kuće.
I said too much	Rekao sam previše
I haven't decided yet.	Nisam još odlučio.
You are with me.	Ti si sa mnom.
And you can be !.	I možete biti!.
And not just years.	I ne samo godine.
This is helpful.	Ovo je od pomoći.
That's how it should be, he told himself.	Tako bi trebalo da bude, rekao je sebi.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Nisam baš siguran kako da to uradim.
He wouldn't want that.	On to ne bi želeo.
I didn't think you'd ever come back.	Nisam mislio da ćeš se ikada vratiti.
Like tonight.	Kao i večeras.
I wonder what we're doing tomorrow	Pitam se šta radimo sutra
She really didn't know.	Ona zaista nije znala.
Maybe he'll leave.	Možda će otići.
I can't believe this is happening	Ne mogu vjerovati da se ovo dešava
I know you loved her	Znam da si je volio
I did everything	Sve sam uradio
I know there is.	Znam da ima.
We just didn't do it right.	Jednostavno nismo to uradili kako treba.
I know how busy you are.	Znam koliko si zauzet.
No one could find him.	Niko ga ne bi mogao naći.
I don't think this was a good idea	Mislim da ovo nije bila dobra ideja
I can't let you do that to yourself	Ne mogu ti dozvoliti da to uradiš sebi
Now he started.	Sada je počeo.
I worked for him for a while	Radio sam za njega neko vrijeme
I want to see him	Želim da ga vidim
On, and on, and on.	Na, i dalje, i dalje.
That should be fine.	To bi trebalo biti u redu.
I could.	Ja bih mogao.
I knew what was going to happen	Znao sam šta će se dogoditi
There was nothing wrong.	Nije bilo ništa loše.
He looked like me.	Izgledao je kao ja.
Neither did my father.	Kao ni moj otac.
Almost everyone.	Skoro svi.
I'm not sure what the problem is, here.	Nisam siguran u čemu je problem, ovdje.
I didn't even know about it	Nisam ni znao za to
They were not helpful.	Nisu bili od pomoći.
He would like you to have him.	On bi želio da ga imaš.
I had no idea	Nisam imao pojma
And why.	I zašto.
I have a lot	Imam dosta toga
I was glad he didn't	Bilo mi je drago da nije
He made his way.	Uradio put.
But certainly not now.	Ali sigurno ne sada.
I never knew he could do this	Nikad nisam znao da može ovo da uradi
It can be quite difficult.	Može biti prilično teško.
He had to know what was going on.	Morao je znati šta se dešava.
That must be something.	To mora da je nešto.
Everything seems to be working well.	Čini se da sve radi dobro.
There was nothing I could do to see anyone.	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim, da vidim nikoga.
He can do whatever he wants.	Može da radi šta hoće.
But there are enough of them.	Ali dovoljno ih je.
I'm not sure what that was either.  	Ni ja nisam siguran šta je to bilo.  
a.	a.
I knew what he was thinking	Znao sam šta misli
I'm not sure how and why.	Nisam siguran kako i zašto.
I'm not sure why.	Nisam siguran zašto.
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
He didn't ask him now.	Sada ga nije pitao.
He doesn't like to talk about it.	Ne voli da priča o tome.
But it still doesn't work.	Ali još uvijek ne radi.
I've known him for several years.	Znam ga nekoliko godina.
I hope so.	Nadam se da je tako.
So it will probably stay where it is.	Tako da će vjerovatno ostati gdje jeste.
To be more and more of us	Da bude sve više od nas
Nothing for that.	Ništa za to.
I can't trust anyone anymore	Ne mogu više nikome vjerovati
You shouldn't see it there.	Ne biste to trebali vidjeti tamo.
But it could happen.	Ali moglo bi se dogoditi.
But it was true.	Ali to je bilo istina.
I knew this was going to come a long time	Znao sam da će ovo doći dugo vremena
They will not leave.	Oni neće otići.
I was like oh, that's all	Bio sam kao o, to je sve
He wanted the truth.	Želeo je istinu.
I just needed to be alone	Samo sam trebao biti sam
It can't be that they don't exist.	Ne može biti da ih nema.
I wasn't entirely sure	Nisam bio potpuno siguran
But that's it for now.	Ali to je to za sada.
I want to see what he can do.	Želim da vidim šta može da uradi.
I was sure it was her	Bio sam siguran da je to ona
That makes three more.	To čini još tri.
This is probably the right path.	Ovo je vjerovatno pravi put.
I do this from time to time.	Radim to s vremena na vrijeme.
But that's exactly what he meant.	Ali je i on mislio upravo na to.
They knew she knew too.	Znali su da i ona zna.
He always knew.	Uvek je znao.
Everyone knows what's going on.	Svi znaju šta se dešava.
And maybe not.	A možda i nije.
I just wanted to talk	Samo sam htio razgovarati
I have this for myself	Moram ovo za sebe
I thought it was a good idea	Mislio sam da je to dobra ideja
Everything works well.	Sve radi dobro.
I think so	Mislim da jeste
Nothing happens by itself.	Ništa se ne dešava samo od sebe.
I'll be fine now.	Sada ću biti dobro.
That was fine with me.	To mi je bilo u redu.
I wonder how long they've been here	Pitam se koliko su dugo ovdje
I can't tell you how long.	Ne mogu vam reći koliko dugo.
I think he could help	Mislim da bi mogao pomoći
It can only do so much.	To može samo toliko.
he will say.	on će reći.
I will go there too.	Ići ću i tamo.
I knew he would.	Znao sam da hoće.
I'm a little tired today	Danas sam malo umoran
I've been doing this for a long time.	Dugo radim ovo.
But there may be more to it than that.	Ali možda ima i više od toga.
It was very difficult for everyone.	Svima je to bilo veoma teško.
It will come in handy.	Dobro će doći.
I have no idea how much	Nemam pojma koliko
A little too much.	Malo previše.
And he's wrong.	I nije u pravu.
There was nothing that I could do	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim
It was likely he would never see it again.	Bilo je vjerovatno da to više nikada neće vidjeti.
I guess we can talk to him about it	Pretpostavljam da možemo razgovarati s njim o tome
I got it.	Imam ga.
What do we have.	Šta imamo.
I want to know what's going on	Želim da znam šta se dešava
I lost quite a bit	Prilično sam izgubio
You can't know.	Ne možete znati.
He never told anyone about it.	Nikad nikome o tome nije rekao.
I thought the game was hard to get	Mislio sam da se igra teško dobiti
I'm not sure about that.	Nisam siguran u to.
This doesn't work anymore.	Ovo više ne radi.
I needed money.	Trebao mi je novac.
It's not right.	Nije u redu.
I would love you, I did everything for you	Voleo bih te, uradio sve za tebe
I'm telling you the truth	Istinu ti kažem
Nobody left.	Niko nije otišao.
Something that is just him.	Nešto što je samo on.
I got lost many years ago	Izgubio sam se prije mnogo godina
I was supposed to be the one	Ja sam trebao biti taj
Never with us.	Nikad kod nas.
I knew it was because of me	Znao sam da je to zbog mene
I had no idea what it was about	Nisam imao pojma o čemu se radi
I didn't know what was going on	Nisam znao šta se dešava
I need to talk to you.	Moram razgovarati s tobom.
I can tell you now.	Mogu vam reći i sada.
I simply.	Ja jednostavno.
What do you think will happen?	Šta mislite da će se dogoditi?
I want to know the truth about myself	Želim da znam istinu o sebi
I don't think that's true anymore	Mislim da to više nije istina
Maybe so.	Možda je tako.
She told me things.	Rekla mi je stvari.
I can't believe what you just told me	Ne mogu vjerovati šta si mi upravo rekao
It was obvious to me that it was not.	Bilo mi je očigledno da nije.
I had no idea	Nisam imao pojma
I started to love being me	Počeo sam da volim da sam ja
I can't really say.	Ne mogu stvarno reći.
Yes, he knew.	Da, znao je.
This is not true.	Ovo nije tačno.
She had never been in it before.	Nikada ranije nije bila u tome.
he asked himself.	pitao je sebe.
I wonder if this is happening here	Pitam se da li se to ovde dešava
What will happen?	Šta će se dogoditi?
I'm not completely surprised.	Nisam potpuno iznenađen.
What is your job?	Šta je tvoj posao.
I had no idea what to tell him	Nisam imao pojma šta da mu kažem
I shouldn't be here	Ne bih trebao biti ovdje
Not like before, but.	Ne kao prije, ali.
It really works.	Zaista radi.
I can't tell you who	Ne mogu vam reći ko
He was good with it.	Bio je dobar sa tim.
I have nothing more to say.	Nemam više šta da kažem.
It seems like many years ago.	Čini se kao prije mnogo godina.
I haven't seen him yet	Još ga nisam vidio
He started right away.	Odmah je počeo.
He talks as much as he doesn't talk.	Govori koliko i ne govori.
I can give it to you	Mogu ti to dati
I still haven't.	I dalje nisam.
I shouldn't go there	Ne bih trebao ići tamo
See that he does it.	Vidi da on to uradi.
They are not so good.	Nisu tako dobro.
I had to go to dinner	Morao sam otići na večeru
Sorry, we can't give you more.	Žao nam je, ne možemo vam dati više.
And we had.	I imali smo.
Except they're not.	Osim što nisu.
I got to him on time	Stigao sam do njega na vrijeme
We could say you did.	Mogli bismo reći da si to uradio.
He will give them to you now.	On će ti ih dati sada.
No one saw him again.	Niko ga više nije video.
And better about yourself.	I bolje o sebi.
It works very fast.	Radi veoma brzo.
If they ever are.	Ako su ikada.
I didn't know what happened	Nisam znao šta se dogodilo
You can't believe it.	Ne možete vjerovati.
I hope so much that this is true	Toliko se nadam da je to istina
And we had that problem for a while.	I mi smo imali taj problem neko vrijeme.
I went to see him.	Otišao sam da ga vidim.
He doesn't know what he's doing.	On ne zna šta radi.
He is always there.	On je uvek tu.
He didn't say he was waiting for someone.	Nije rekao da čeka nekoga.
I still want to see what happens.	Još uvijek želim vidjeti šta će se dogoditi.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
Everything is going as it should.	Sve ide kako treba.
I have no idea what just happened	Nemam pojma šta se upravo dogodilo
Now we work too.	Sada radimo i mi.
I didn't know about you	Nisam znao za tebe
I have no idea how that just happened	Nemam pojma kako se to upravo dogodilo
And it should be.	I trebao bi biti.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
It's hard to believe.	Teško je vjerovati.
I still think we can do it	I dalje mislim da to možemo
They always have been	Uvek su bili
Things will be there.	Stvari će biti tamo.
I did exactly as he said	Uradio sam tačno kako je rekao
I should just go home.	Trebao bih samo ići kući.
I should have been there for you	Trebao sam biti tu za tebe
It doesn't look like that.	Ne izgleda baš tako.
I'm glad you're here.	Drago mi je da si ovdje.
Not even there.	Ni tamo.
You can do anything.	Možeš da uradiš sve.
I knew it was him	Znao sam da je to on
We can't do without it.	Ne možemo bez toga.
All these things.	Sve ove stvari.
It seems that money can conquer everything.	Čini se da novac može pobijediti sve.
I didn't have that either	Ni ja to nisam imao
Not that he knew.	Nije da bi znao.
I had to be more at home	Morao sam više biti kod kuće
This could be it.	Ovo bi moglo biti to.
I never gave him a reason for it	Nikad mu nisam dao razlog za to
I know what it is.	Znam šta je to.
I didn't know this was hard for him.	Nisam znao da mu je ovo bilo teško.
You said.	Ti si rekao.
I should go there tomorrow	Trebalo bi da idem tamo sutra
I hope so.	Nadam se.
I've been here a few times	Bio sam tu nekoliko puta
I think it's her.	Mislim da je to ona.
You did this very well.	Vrlo ste dobro uradili ovo.
Just to be sure.	Samo da budem siguran.
We shouldn't be here.	Ne bismo trebali biti ovdje.
He can wait, he has time.	Može da čeka, ima vremena.
It can never be said.	Nikad se ne može reći.
I don't see who she is	Ne vidim ko je ona
I didn't have to go alone	Nisam morao sam da idem
I see the video there.	Vidim video tamo.
I've said that before.	Rekao sam to ranije.
I knew you would be better off without me	Znao sam da bi ti bilo bolje bez mene
I don't see how he could live	Ne vidim kako je mogao da živi
It usually works better.	Obično radi bolje.
Mine wasn't the only one.	Moj nije bio jedini.
I don't see anything here	Ne vidim ništa ovde
It's not like that.	Nije baš tako.
I knew what he was thinking	Znao sam šta misli
He could go home.	Mogao bi se vratiti kući.
I knew how much he loved me	Znao sam koliko me voli
I can talk without too much trouble	Mogu razgovarati bez previše problema
Let me tell you.	Da ti kažem.
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam uradio ništa loše
I thought he came to us earlier	Mislio sam da je došao ranije kod nas
I have no idea what it is	Nemam pojma šta je to
I didn't know what to do with you	Nisam znao šta da radim s tobom
He'll tell us when the time is right.	Reći će nam kada bude vrijeme.
But this in itself is not enough.	Ali ovo samo po sebi nije dovoljno.
I thought you'd be ready sooner	Mislio sam da ćeš biti spreman ranije
We often don’t do that.	Često to ne radimo.
You know exactly what he did.	Ti tačno znaš šta je uradio.
Say it as it is.	Reci to kako jeste.
I wish you were more here	Voleo bih da si više ovde
I'm happy to be here.	Sretan sam što sam ovdje.
If she's there.	Ako je ona tamo.
They couldn't do that.	Oni to nisu mogli.
That was in itself.	To je bilo samo po sebi.
It is better.	Bolje je.
All of this is true.	Sve je ovo tačno.
It was as if they had never been there.	Kao da nikada nisu bili tamo.
It's that she was at home.	To je da je bila kod kuće.
I just arrived.	Upravo sam stigao.
And not only that.	I ne samo to.
I heard little, I saw nothing	Malo sam čuo, ništa nisam vidio
I'm very well.	Ja sam jako dobro.
I didn't know it was going to be a problem	Nisam znao da će to biti problem
Easy, maybe.	Lako, možda.
I've been doing this for a very long time	Ovo radim jako dugo
He is much better now.	Sada mu je mnogo bolje.
I just finished.	Upravo sam završio.
It can be seen, but it cannot be reached.	Može se vidjeti, ali se ne može doći.
I have to see things	Mora da vidim stvari
The weather is bad.	Vrijeme je loše.
I certainly didn't want to	Ja sigurno nisam htela
I'm like you.	Ja sam kao ti.
He is good.	On je dobar.
For my job.	Za moj posao.
I wonder how he could have gotten it right	Pitam se kako je to mogao dobiti kako treba
He should be there.	Trebao bi biti tamo.
I didn't ask him to come	Nisam ga pitao da dođe
I do not see, as a man sees	Ne vidim, kao što vidi čovjek
I doubt that is the case.	Sumnjam da je to tako.
We had a really good life together.	Imali smo jako dobar život zajedno.
I'm always too busy for anything	Uvek sam previše zauzet, za bilo šta
It was difficult for him.	Bilo mu je teško.
I'm not right.	Nisam u pravu.
It looks very good.	Izgleda veoma dobro.
I could see everything	Mogao sam sve vidjeti
I don't know where it is.	Ne znam gdje je.
What did any of us have.	Šta je bilo ko od nas imao.
And this is fine.	I ovo je u redu.
He only got one.	Samo jedan je dobio.
I don't think he knows.	Mislim da ne zna.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo dobro.
I don't think that's a good idea at the moment	Mislim da to trenutno nije dobra ideja
No one seemed to be home.	Činilo se da nikoga nije bilo kod kuće.
I knew what he was thinking.	Znao sam šta misli.
That she is fine.	Da je ona dobro.
He knew so much.	Toliko je znao.
I know what you did	Znam šta si uradio
You have to tell me how you know.	Moraš mi reći kako znaš.
It's going well.	Ide na dobro.
Even tonight, if you want.	Čak i večeras, ako želiš.
I was more than ready for her to do it	Bio sam više nego spreman da ona to uradi
It was good.	Bilo je to dobro.
I had to see here	Morao sam da vidim ovde
And she was.	I ona je bila.
That is hard.	To je teško.
And so it goes.	I tako to ide.
I knew you were there	Znao sam da si tamo
That could be the following.	To bi moglo biti sljedeće.
He wondered what it could be.	Pitao se šta bi to moglo biti.
I didn't know the reason	Nisam znao razlog
I know you were there	Znam da si bio tamo
That's none of my business.	To nije moja stvar.
I never heard that.	Nikad to nisam čuo.
That he knew.	Da je znao.
And no one should know that better than you.	I to niko ne bi trebao znati bolje od vas.
He does not know.	On ne zna.
I have seen this happen many times	Video sam da se to dešava mnogo puta
This really happened to me	Ovo mi se zaista dogodilo
I wish I had seen them	Voleo bih da sam ih video
I just want to stay here for a while	Samo želim ostati ovdje neko vrijeme
He had so much.	Imao je toliko toga.
Yes, we are still here.	Da, još smo tu.
I'm glad you did	Drago mi je da jesi
He does the work.	On radi posao.
I will never, ever believe	Nikada, nikad neću vjerovati
I wish you could see that	Volio bih da si to mogao vidjeti
I knew he wouldn't	Znao sam da neće
He wanted life.	Želeo je život.
I'm not sure why that is	Nisam siguran zašto je to tako
That's what she said.	Tako je rekla.
I had to tell him that	Morao sam mu to reći
Not just for the day.	Ne samo za dan.
It was hard to beat him.	Bilo ga je teško pobijediti.
There was nothing they could not do for us.	Nije bilo ništa što nisu mogli učiniti za nas.
And maybe it's true.	I možda je tačno.
I was glad he came back	Bilo mi je drago što se vratio
I was tired of looking like me	Bio sam umoran od izgleda kao ja
I want that for you and me.	Želim to za tebe i mene.
I had a job.	Imao sam posao.
They weren't here tonight.	Nisu bili ovdje večeras.
I just had to say it	Samo sam to morao reći
Obviously I can't be friends with him	Očigledno ne mogu biti prijatelj s njim
I think you all know about that	Mislim da svi znate o tome
There seem to be a lot of them, no one wants to.	Čini se da ih ima puno, niko ne želi.
This works.	Ovo radi.
I still love her very much	I dalje je mnogo volim
And that can still happen.	A to se još može dogoditi.
But that's not really a problem.	Ali to zapravo i nije problem.
I really hope you can	Zaista se nadam da možeš
Maybe I haven't heard of it.	Možda nisam čuo za to.
They're just there.	Samo su tamo.
He could see he was doing it.	Mogao je vidjeti da to radi.
I just wanted to see how you were.	Samo sam htio vidjeti kako si.
You are them.	Vi ste oni.
As it was for me.	Kao što je bilo za mene.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda ne.
We were better off than we were.	Bilo nam je bolje kao što je bilo.
I wouldn't know what happened	Ne bih znao šta se dogodilo
It took time.	Trebalo je vremena.
I thought that was what you wanted	Mislio sam da je to ono što želiš
That was the first.	To je bio prvi.
I guess he really loves me	Pretpostavljam da me stvarno voli
I know the truth.	Znam istinu.
I mean, you seem to be fine	Mislim, izgleda da ti je dobro
Everything looks fine to me.	Sve mi izgleda u redu.
I tried, but there was no time	Pokušao sam, ali nije bilo vremena
I mean more than anyone in the house.	Mislim više od bilo koga u kući.
That never happened.	To se nikada nije dogodilo.
What is s.	Šta je s.
I know what they are.	Znam šta su.
This is the day.	Ovo je dan.
He's gone right now.	Otišao je upravo sada.
I did whatever it took.	Uradio sam sve što je trebalo.
Maybe even more.	Možda čak i više.
You said it well.	Dobro si to rekao.
Nothing can be done there anymore.	Više se tu ništa ne može učiniti.
He has to move on.	Mora ići dalje.
It's not just that.	Nije samo to.
I'm sorry it happened.	Žao mi je što se to dogodilo.
I didn't do the right thing	Nisam uradio pravu stvar
And he knew.	I znao je.
But he didn't know that.	Ali on to nije znao.
Maybe that's just it.	Možda je to upravo to.
Maybe he can.	Možda može.
Like the radio.	Kao i radio.
He has no idea what he's saying.	On nema pojma šta govori.
I can't find him now.	Ne mogu ga sada naći.
I could go with that	Mogao bih ići s tim
I know someone.	Znam nekoga.
I haven't seen him in a while	Nisam ga vidio neko vrijeme
I wasn't ready for that	Nisam bio spreman za to
And I was happy to see him	I ja sam bio sretan što sam ga vidio
No, not a car.	Ne, ne auto.
I know this is not good for him.	Znam da ovo nije dobro za njega.
I wasn't sure if he really had it	Nisam bio siguran da li ga je zaista imao
I told you what would happen	Rekao sam ti šta će se dogoditi
I think he did something more today	Mislim da je danas uradio nešto više
I know you're not lost.	Znam da se nisi izgubio.
He just wanted to talk.	Samo je htio razgovarati.
Say what you want.	Reci šta hoćeš.
I knew exactly what was being said	Tačno sam znao šta se govori
She can do whatever she wants with him.	Može da radi sa njim šta hoće.
Not from me.	Ne od mene.
If we knew, if everyone knew, we would do something.	Da smo znali, da su svi znali, uradili bismo nešto.
I didn't ask if it was you	Nisam pitao da li si to ti
I like this about you	Sviđa mi se ovo kod tebe
I actually started tonight	Ja sam zapravo počeo večeras
You look.	Izgledaš.
There wasn't much.	Mnogo toga nije bilo.
I did as he did	Uradio sam kao i on
I pray, in my own way, but not often	Ja se molim, na svoj način, ali ne često
I have to see him too	I ja moram da ga vidim
Really, we can get in my car.	Zaista, možemo u moj auto.
I didn't want him to drive	Nisam želeo da on vozi
She always says and does the right thing.	Ona uvek kaže i uradi pravu stvar.
But he will know about it.	Ali on će znati za njega.
This is as good as it can get	Ovo je dobro koliko može
I wouldn't even know what to do there.	Ne bih ni znao šta da radim tamo.
I have no idea who has me	Nemam pojma ko me ima
There's nothing I can do for you.	Ne mogu ništa učiniti za tebe.
Maybe even earlier.	Možda je i ranije.
But it can be done.	Ali, to se može uraditi.
We can buy things.	Možemo kupiti stvari,.
I started asking her how she was there	Počeo sam da je pitam kako je tamo
All you want, all you need is someone to help.	Sve što želiš, sve što ti treba je neko da pomogne.
But it doesn't seem to work.	Ali izgleda da ne radi.
That's so fast.	To je tako brzo.
It was hard for him.	Bilo mu je teško.
I wouldn't do that	Ne bih to uradio
I probably didn't hear you	Verovatno te nisam čuo
But you need to know.	Ali treba da znaš.
I want to go alone.	Želim da idem sam.
But that's my problem.	Ali to je moj problem.
I have one of my own.	Imam jedan svoj.
You want him.	Želiš ga.
There was a little more money.	Bilo je nešto više novca.
I shouldn't have come to school	Nisam trebao doći u školu
And it was a good thing he did.	I bila je dobra stvar što je uradio.
Or maybe a lot.	Ili možda mnogo.
I'm working right now.	Upravo radim sada.
I guess all the things are there.	Pretpostavljam da su sve stvari tamo.
I can do it now for a better job	Mogu to da uradim sada za bolji posao
It's actually good.	Zapravo je dobro.
I hope we will see each other soon.	Nadam se da ćemo se uskoro vidjeti.
I saw little of that.	Video sam malo toga.
We don't know it's him.	Ne znamo da je to on.
I can work with that	Mogu raditi s tim
This is not so easy.	Ovo nije baš tako lako.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
I didn't mean to see you	Nisam mislio da te vidim
I think we need money.	Mislim da nam treba novac.
He left when he decided.	Otišao je kada je odlučio.
He did not come.	Nije došao.
You are right.	Tako ste.
I knew it would be good	Znao sam da će biti dobro
You know both of them.	Znaš ih oboje.
I shouldn't have done that, he thought to himself	Nisam to trebao učiniti, misli u sebi
I really want that job.	Ja zaista želim taj posao.
The code is here.	Kod je ovdje.
This is very difficult.	Ovo je veoma teško.
I thought it was just for one life	Mislio sam da je to samo za jedan život
I can't tell you the truth yet	Ne mogu vam još reći istinu
But that is not certain.	Ali to nije sigurno.
He seemed glad to talk about it.	Činilo se da mu je drago da govori o tome.
I had to see things	Morao sam da vidim stvari
I could have left.	Mogao sam otići.
I knew he would.	Znao sam da hoće.
He could be anywhere.	Mogao bi biti bilo gdje.
I would like to see them.	Voleo bih da ih vidim.
It makes a lot more of them than ever before	Mnogo više ih čini nego ikada prije
I'm not your father.	Ja nisam tvoj otac.
I did this.	Uradio sam ovo.
And that must be fine.	I to mora biti u redu.
I wasn't sure what it was	Nisam bio siguran šta je to
I know the way.	Znam način.
And this is the story here.	A ovo je priča ovdje.
He was something.	Bio je nešto.
But he can still see her.	Ali on je još uvijek može vidjeti.
We have so much to do.	Imamo toliko toga da uradimo.
I have so many problems.	Imam toliko problema.
I wondered if it worked a lot	Pitao sam se da li puno radi
Looks like I got lost	Izgleda da sam se izgubio
I thought that was good	Mislio sam da je to dobro
I wondered if he knew that	Pitao sam se da li on to zna
We won't be here that long.	Nećemo biti ovdje tako dugo.
But it is not easy for everyone.	Ali nije svima lako.
But not much.	Ali ne i puno.
I can't do this with you anymore	Ne mogu više ovo sa tobom
He wants to know it's real.	Želi da zna da je to stvarno.
They were probably right.	Vjerovatno su bili u pravu.
Still very good.	I dalje jako dobro.
I can do this for him	Mogu ovo da uradim za njega
I can go back to one tomorrow	Mogu se vratiti sutra u jedan
He was sick.	Bilo mu je loše.
This was not enough.	Ovo nije bilo dovoljno.
It couldn't have been better.	Nije moglo biti bolje.
I wasn't very good	Nisam bio baš dobar
Three by three.	Tri po tri.
I won't tell them.	Neću ih reći.
I never realized how it happened	Nikad nisam shvatio kako se to dogodilo
Whether you knew it or not.	Znali vi za to ili ne.
And you were right to think of those things.	I bio si u pravu što si mislio na te stvari.
I'm glad he's coming with me	Drago mi je što ide sa mnom
He always was.	Uvek je bio.
I can't say exactly when.	Ne mogu tačno reći kada.
Sorry about that	Žao mi je zbog toga
It doesn't work now.	To sada ne radi.
More on that here.	Više o tome ovdje.
She won't be gone long now.	Ona sada neće dugo otići.
Long, long.	Dugo, dugo.
It just takes time to see that.	Samo treba vremena da se to vidi.
There must have been a door there once.	Mora da su tamo nekada bila vrata.
Something is happening.	Nešto se dešava.
But there is still the issue of too much money, perhaps.	Ali još uvijek postoji pitanje previše novca, možda.
I asked for three.	Tražio sam tri.
It was already difficult.	Već je bilo teško.
It's okay not to know.	U redu je ne znati.
I like the way it works	Sviđa mi se kako to radi
Just deal with it.	Samo se nosi sa tim.
I know this is hard for you	Znam da ti je ovo teško
I already told you when	Već sam ti rekao kada
I think you're right	Mislim da si u pravu
Maybe tonight.	Možda večeras.
I know what you mean	Znam šta misliš
I need something for myself	Treba mi nešto za sebe
So simple.	Tako jednostavno.
People here.	Ljudi ovdje.
It was no more.	Više nije bilo.
I thought that was a pretty good way to do it.	Mislio sam da je to prilično dobar način da se to uradi.
It's just her.	To je samo ona.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
I couldn't tell you	Nisam ti mogao reći
I just love her.	Jednostavno je volim.
We're not sure here.	Nismo sigurni ovdje.
I've never seen that	Nikada to nisam video
It's none of that.	To nije ništa od toga.
A lot of people do that	Mnogo ljudi to radi
I asked him what it was about	Pitao sam ga o čemu se radi
I had nothing more to say	Nisam imao šta više da kažem
Looks like you're not happy.	Izgleda da ti nije drago.
It is.	Da jeste.
I can't be sure for how long	Ne mogu biti siguran koliko dugo
Everything should have been done now, if not sooner.	Sve je trebalo uraditi sada, ako ne i ranije.
The car has arrived.	Auto je stigao.
I can't tell you anything you don't know	Ne mogu vam reći ništa što ne znate
I didn’t mean to say that, but it’s all true	Nisam to htio reći, ali sve je istina
They didn't say much.	Nisu mnogo rekli.
I just knew it was.	Samo sam znala da jeste.
I'm fine with that.	Dobro sam s tim.
This was certainly not what he expected me to say.	Ovo sigurno nije bilo ono što je očekivao da ću reći.
No one tells me what to do.	Niko mi ne govori šta da radim.
Just to be sure.	Samo da budem siguran.
I did exactly as you said	Uradio sam tačno kako si rekao
You should be able to see it.	Trebao bi to moći vidjeti.
They are just, they are just people.	Oni su samo, oni su samo ljudi.
In fact, I've never seen him before.	U stvari, nikad ga prije nisam vidio.
I'm a bad friend.	Ja sam loš prijatelj.
He would be sure of that.	Bio bi siguran u to.
I want you to know something	Želim da znaš nešto
It was a question of when	Bilo je pitanje kada
We have a problem.	Imamo problem.
It wants the truth.	Ono želi istinu.
I know right away who did it	Odmah znam ko je to uradio
She knew what he would do.	Znala je šta bi on uradio.
And she said it well.	I dobro je rekla.
Just people do it.	Samo ljudi to.
I know how you did it	Znam kako si to uradio
I've never seen him look like that before.	Nikada ga prije nisam vidio tako da izgleda.
You can too.	Možeš i ti.
I don't work there anymore	Više ne radim tamo
They never did that again.	Nikada to više nisu uradili.
I thought today was yesterday	Mislio sam da je danas juče
What do you want from me?.	Šta hoćeš od mene?.
Obviously I can't do this properly either	Očigledno ne mogu ni ovo da uradim kako treba
He had no idea what to say to him.	Nije imao pojma šta da mu kaže.
I think that's a good thing	Mislim da je to dobra stvar
It will not be easy.	To neće biti lako.
But you have to go back to school.	Ali morate se vratiti u školu.
You weren't there.	Nisi bio tamo.
I think he loves you.	Mislim da te voli.
You can never get that time back.	Nikada ne možeš vratiti to vrijeme.
It just took me a while	Samo mi je trebalo malo vremena
We don't know anything for sure.	Ne znamo ništa sigurno.
I can't be this for you	Ne mogu biti ovo za tebe
We should be there.	Trebali bismo biti tamo.
There is nothing for you.	Nema ništa za tebe.
I'm a little tired, but I'm not bad	Malo sam umoran, ali nisam loš
I know what this is about	Znam o čemu se radi
What is the problem ?.	Šta je problem ?.
He just wants to.	Samo hoće.
Something is simply wrong.	Nešto jednostavno nije u redu.
He means you no harm.	Ne misli ti ništa loše.
It's not easy.	Nije baš lako.
I couldn't see.	Nisam mogao da vidim.
Which it was, but not in that way.	Što je i bilo, ali ne na taj način.
I've never been here alone	Nikada nisam sam ovdje
He lives at home.	Živi kod kuće.
He will always stay with me.	Uvek će ostati sa mnom.
I can't bring her back	Ne mogu je vratiti
Or maybe he doesn't think.	Ili možda ne misli.
He doesn't know why he thinks that.	On ne zna zašto to misli.
Maybe you could tell me.	Možda biste mi mogli reći.
He is not and you know he is not there.	Nije i znate da ga nema.
Maybe even better.	Možda čak i bolje.
She said we would be back.	Rekla je da ćemo se vratiti.
Yes.	Da.
That's not good enough.	To nije dovoljno dobro.
I didn't expect much either	Ni ja nisam očekivao mnogo
In fact, much further.	U stvari, dosta dalje.
It will not be easy, nor fast.	Neće biti lako, a ni brzo.
And a good thing.	I dobra stvar.
I could see it, and it was probably safe	Mogao sam to vidjeti, i to je vjerovatno bilo sigurno
Only she didn't say that.	Samo ona to nije tako rekla.
I wish it wasn't so	Voleo bih da nije tako
She doesn't know what to say.	Ona ne zna šta će reći.
I know, you look like one.	Znam, izgledaš kao jedan.
I saw that he was not good enough to play.	Vidio sam da nije dovoljno dobro da igra.
I should be good now.	Sada bih trebao biti dobar.
Something must be wrong.	Nešto mora da nije u redu.
I knew exactly what he was going to do	Tačno sam znao šta će uraditi
And neither do you.	A ni ti.
You have to be fast.	Moraš brzo.
I can't tell you everything	Ne mogu ti sve reći
That's your problem.	To je tvoj problem.
We only have three.	Imamo samo tri.
The man had no idea.	Čovjek nije imao pojma.
I'm not saying that.	Ne kažem to.
They would be fine.	Bili bi u redu.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
Not today.	Ne danas.
Tell him when it's too much.	Reci mu kada je previše.
We have to.	Imamo do.
It's fast.	To je brzo.
Which can be difficult.	Što može biti teško.
I was everything to him	Bio sam mu sve
Except they were.	Osim što su bili.
I could never do that	Nikada ne bih mogao tako da radim
They said they wouldn't get much.	Rekli su da neće dobiti mnogo.
You can't do that.	Ne možeš to da uradiš.
She didn't know.	Nije znala.
I thought you could be better than that	Mislio sam da znaš biti bolji od toga
I didn't tell anyone	Nisam nikome ništa rekao
Someone was there.	Neko je bio tamo.
Just for a few days.	Samo na nekoliko dana.
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
Maybe right now they will believe they will.	Možda će upravo sada vjerovati da će to učiniti.
I didn't see that one	Taj nisam vidio
Like last day.	Kao prošlog dana.
If that happens, we'll definitely talk.	Ako dođe do toga, sigurno ćemo razgovarati.
This was too much for him tonight.	Ovo je bilo previše za njega večeras.
I saw what you did to him	Video sam šta si mu uradio
That they can do it themselves.	Da to mogu sami.
But not just one.	Ali ne samo jedan.
He's obviously coming at you.	Očigledno će doći na tebe.
I wondered why he was here	Pitao sam se zašto je ovdje
You can go bad.	Možeš ići na loše.
But something was wrong.	Ali nešto nije bilo u redu.
There is something you should know.	Postoji nešto što biste trebali znati.
It's not about color.	Ne radi se o boji.
It was, like.	Bilo je, kao.
You know who they are.	Znate ko su oni.
I know this can be a difficult time	Znam da ovo može biti teško vrijeme
All work now.	Sve posao sada.
You had to get it right away.	Morao si ga odmah dobiti.
It will be you.	To ćeš biti ti.
And, doc.	I, dok .
You always were.	Uvek si bio.
I knew you saw or heard me there	Znao sam da si me vidio ili čuo tamo
We should be better than that.	Trebali bismo biti bolji od toga.
I had nothing in me.	U sebi nisam imao ništa.
That was last week.	To je bilo prošle sedmice.
Don't do that to him.	Ne radi mu to.
He will never do anything again.	Nikad više ništa neće uraditi.
I have something here that he said.	Imam nešto ovde što je rekao.
I should have been happy here	Trebao sam biti sretan ovdje
I think he's the one	Mislim da je on taj
Just this.	Samo ovo.
I think something is wrong with me	Mislim da sa mnom nešto nije u redu
I asked why he thought that	Pitao sam zašto to misli
I can't do it alone	Ne mogu to učiniti sam
I'm doing the right thing	Radim pravu stvar
I told him about it.	Rekao sam mu za to.
I think there is a reason for that	Mislim da postoji razlog za to
I like to know he's there	Volim da znam da je tamo
That's good to know.	To je dobro znati.
I thought you were still here	Mislio sam da si još uvijek ovdje
I have to go to Tom's job	Moram da idem na posao Tome
No one could have done more than you.	Niko nije mogao učiniti više od tebe.
It wouldn't be right.	Ne bi bilo u redu.
You got it.	Shvatio si.
But he knows his job.	Ali on zna svoj posao.
We should have stayed.	Trebali smo ostati.
I came to say something, but it was not	Došao sam da kažem nešto, ali toga nije bilo
As if that would really happen.	Kao da će se to zaista dogoditi.
I had to tell him about this	Morao sam mu reći za ovo
I needed this this morning.	Trebalo mi je ovo jutros.
He was ready for it.	Bio je spreman na to.
It just won’t happen.	To se jednostavno neće dogoditi.
I got it from you	Dobio sam od tebe
I just wish someone would come	Samo bih volio da neko dođe
You're pretty sure.	Prilično si siguran.
As they should be.	Kao što bi trebali biti.
I didn't know what was going to happen	Nisam znao šta će se dogoditi
It really works	Zaista radi
But not really.	Ali ne baš.
I haven't even seen them all yet	Nisam ih još ni vidio sve
I have to tell you what it is.	Moram ti reći šta je to.
Please tell me it's good.	Molim te reci mi da je dobro.
We are too.	I mi smo.
I have both.	Imam oboje.
I think you could do him good	Mislim da bi mu mogao učiniti dobro
I'm not afraid of them anymore	Više ih se ne bojim
I've seen it before	Video sam to ranije
But we won't know for a while.	Ali nećemo znati još neko vrijeme.
I haven't seen him in years	Nisam ga vidio nekoliko godina
And tomorrow we will leave.	I sutra ćemo otići.
I'll go first.	Ja ću prvi.
I couldn’t believe it all happened	Nisam mogao vjerovati da se sve dogodilo
I can't give you a reason for that.	Ne mogu vam dati razlog za to.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
That was obvious.	To je bilo očigledno.
Nothing good for now.	Za sada ništa dobro.
At the party.	Na zabavi.
I should be the one carrying you	Ja bih trebao biti taj koji te nosi
a.	a.
I was just asking to go home	Samo sam tražio da idem kući
I love having them here.	Volim da ih imam ovde.
That this is it.	Da je ovo.
You have to go.	Moraš ići.
I already know how to do it.	Ja već znam kako se to radi.
Which are just that.	Koji su jednostavno to.
They are in a.	Oni su u a.
Maybe not today.	Možda ne danas.
I was sure he was right	Bio sam siguran da je u pravu
Maybe there is no one.	Možda nema nikoga.
I have a lot of friends	Imam puno prijatelja
I never heard him play.	Nikad ga nisam čuo da svira.
But it happens.	Ali to se dešava.
I was really fine	Stvarno mi je bilo dobro
We can do it.	Možemo to učiniti.
And don't talk please.	I ne govori molim te.
I've decided that before	Odlučio sam to i prije
It's not about us.	Ne radi se o nama.
He says so much and says nothing.	Toliko toga govori, a ne govori ništa.
You don't look well.	Ne izgledaš dobro.
No one has ever seen him.	Niko ga nikada nije video.
I have a lot of friends	Imam puno prijatelja
I love it with him.	Volim to kod njega.
But no, not at all.	Ali ne, ni malo toga.
And we knew they knew, and they knew we knew.	I mi smo znali da oni znaju, i oni su znali da mi znamo.
But it wasn't good.	Ali nije bilo dobro.
I had no idea what could happen	Nisam imao pojma šta bi se moglo dogoditi
It's people's business.	To je posao ljudi.
I just didn't see it.	Jednostavno nisam vidio.
I have done this many times.	Napravio sam to mnogo puta.
Please never tell anyone	Molim te da nikada nikome ne kažeš
I can't say whether it's good or not	Ne mogu reći da li je to dobro ili ne
Nothing is easy.	Ništa nije jednostavno.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
That’s what we really do.	To je ono što mi zaista radimo.
I needed a job.	Trebao mi je posao.
I couldn't go home yet	Nisam još mogao kući
I haven't seen them in a while	Nisam ih vidio neko vrijeme
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to istina.
Not true.	Nije istina.
I can't stay with you	Ne mogu ostati s tobom
I can't stay here alone	Ne mogu ostati ovdje sama
You can't be everything to everyone.	Ne možete svima biti sve.
I had no one and nothing	Nisam imao nikoga i ništa
I had no idea what was going to happen	Nisam imao pojma šta će se dogoditi
I know her very much	Znam je jako puno
You know what he means.	Znaš šta misli.
I think we can do this	Mislim da možemo ovo
This is simply not true.	Ovo jednostavno nije istina.
I'm just not who I am.	Jednostavno nisam ko sam.
He won't do it.	Neće to učiniti.
I have no idea what will happen next	Nemam pojma šta će dalje
There was nothing he could do.	Nije mogao ništa da uradi.
I just wanted him to be better	Samo sam htela da mu bude bolje
He will be.	On će biti.
I just want to see him.	Samo želim da ga vidim.
Maybe not.	Možda nisu.
You need to know this.	Moraš ovo znati.
I think this says it all	Mislim da ovo govori sve
I would like to say that you are right	Želeo bih da kažem da ste u pravu
No help.	Nema pomoći.
But he wouldn't.	Ali on ne bi.
It's hard to know what really happened.	Teško je znati šta se zaista dogodilo.
We just need some time right now.	Samo nam treba malo vremena upravo sada.
I can't know what they are	Ne mogu da znam šta su
I do not have to.	Ne moram.
I couldn't do that	Nisam to mogao uraditi
I needed them, but I didn't get them	Trebali su mi, ali ih nisam dobio
Nobody heard.	Niko nije čuo.
You should do this.	Ovo bi trebalo da uradite.
I went there	Otišao sam tamo
I'm sorry.	Žao mi je.
And so, you have to do something.	I tako, morate nešto učiniti.
I had to know what was going on	Morao sam da znam šta se dešava
I can do the right thing.	Mogu da uradim pravu stvar.
So far, everyone likes the idea.	Do sada, svima se sviđa ideja.
I like .	Sviđa mi se .
That's it.	To je to.
I think he's had enough	Mislim da mu je dosta
You can do what works for you.	Možete raditi ono što radi za vas.
There is nothing more than that.	Ne postoji ništa više od toga.
That would be fine.	To bi bilo u redu.
Now he understood.	Sada je shvatio.
I could go.	Mogao bih ići.
I think he is very right	Mislim da je veoma u pravu
I have a pretty good life	Imam prilično dobar život
I had no idea what he was doing	Nisam imao pojma šta radi
That's very good of you.	To je jako dobro od tebe.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
I just wish we could do more	Samo bih volio da možemo više
If he knew more, he didn't say.	Ako je znao više, nije rekao.
We don't do that.	Ne radimo to.
I know you didn't mean anything	Znam da nisi ništa mislio
It can't be like that.	To ne može biti tako.
There are several.	Ima ih nekoliko.
No, he can't win.	Ne, on ne može pobijediti.
I still have problems.	I dalje imam problema.
But that was not good.	Ali to nije bilo dobro.
But that is not enough.	Ali to nije dovoljno.
He is not one of us.	On nije jedan od nas.
And very, very quickly.	I to veoma, veoma brzo.
It was hard to say.	Bilo je teško reći.
I didn't work much longer, for a long time	Nisam radio mnogo više, dugo vremena
He didn't tell me much.	Nije mi rekao mnogo.
Today it was a job.	Danas je to bio posao.
Hard to say.	Teško za reći.
Nothing can be gained from that.	Od toga se ništa ne može dobiti.
That will be enough for now.	To će biti dovoljno za sada.
But they should.	Ali trebali su.
I immediately understood what he meant.	Odmah sam shvatio šta je mislio.
But I didn't say anything	Ali nisam ništa rekao
I know you can do it	Znam da ti to možeš
I'm done here.	Završio sam ovdje.
I didn't, maybe he's right	Nisam dao, možda je u pravu
He's not there.	On nije tamo.
I couldn't do that.	Nisam mogao to da uradim.
Obviously not enough.	Očigledno nije dovoljno.
I think that's enough for today	Mislim da je to dovoljno za danas
No one could come back to him	Niko mu se nije mogao vratiti
Next year.	Sljedeće godine.
And further.	I dalje.
I won't talk to you anymore	Neću više razgovarati s tobom
I wish he wasn't the one who won	Voleo bih da on nije taj koji je dobio
And for me it's work.	A za mene je to posao.
The reason you're there	Razlog zašto ste tamo
This is my life.	Ovo je moj život.
He does it easily.	Lako to radi.
Which is not easy.	Što nije lako.
I will help you	Ja ću ti pomoći
I can't be that anymore	Ne mogu to više biti
I didn't need anything more than that	Nije mi trebalo ništa više od toga
Or he thought he had.	Ili je mislio da ga ima.
I will never do that again.	Nikad to više neću uraditi.
Which they still aren't.	Što još uvijek nisu.
I have nothing but time	Nemam ništa osim vremena
And it was so good.	I bilo je tako dobro.
I want to go now.	Želim da idem sada.
She probably said something.	Vjerovatno je nešto rekla.
He will come.	On će doći.
I asked him to come right away.	Zamolio sam ga da odmah dođe.
I just have things to do	Samo imam stvari da radim
This wasn't real.	Ovo nije bilo stvarno.
That was good for me.	To je bilo dobro za mene.
But you have to.	Ali morate.
I know that's not what you want to do	Znam da to nije ono što želiš da uradiš
There must be more people.	Mora biti više ljudi.
That may not be true.	To ne može biti tačno.
Not even very long.	Čak ni jako dugo.
All that.	Sve to.
And it's hard.	I teško je.
But that was okay.	Ali to je bilo u redu.
You can't go on.	Ne možeš dalje.
I never knew what to say	Nikad nisam znao šta da kažem
I often wondered why	Često sam se pitao zašto
he thought.	mislio je.
That's my problem.	To je moj problem.
I guess we'll for a while	Pretpostavljam da ćemo još neko vrijeme
I was never happy	Nikad nisam bio sretan
There will be no more of that.	Neće biti više toga.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
I want to go with you	Želim da idem sa tobom
That could be true.	To bi moglo biti istina.
I promised you would	Obećao sam da hoćeš
I wondered about that	Pitao sam se o tome
I started again	Počeo sam ponovo
I was always happy to see him	Uvijek sam bio sretan što sam ga vidio
It doesn't look real anymore.	Više ne izgleda stvarno.
He could no longer see me as me.	Ne bi više mogao da me vidi kao mene.
I heard something	Čuo sam nešto
I just like it	Jednostavno mi se sviđa
I knew my way	Znao sam svoj put
It was all her.	Sve je to bila ona.
It looks very.	Izgleda veoma.
That's what I thought	To sam i mislio
The question now is, will she?	Pitanje je sada, hoće li ona?
But he was here.	Ali on je bio ovde.
He told me not to go.	Rekao mi je da ne idem.
I know who you think looks good	Znam za koga misliš da dobro izgleda
I see it all in that.	Vidim sve u tome.
But that is what we do.	Ali to je ono što mi radimo.
To say we can do better.	Da kažem da možemo bolje.
It was like that.	Bilo je tako.
I wish I thought he would.	Voleo bih da mislim da hoće.
That would not be right.	To ne bi bilo u redu.
I just really want to go back	Samo bih se zaista volio vratiti
Or there were.	Ili ih je bilo.
Help will come.	Pomoć će doći.
Maybe we have.	Možda imamo.
I can not see anything	Ne vidim ništa
I should have known better than that.	Trebao sam znati bolje od toga.
I'm not sure when exactly	Nisam siguran kada tačno
He didn’t want to leave, and that was it.	Nije htio otići, i to je bilo to.
It was mine now.	Sada je bio moj.
That's the only way to play.	To je jedini način na koji se igra.
This is for sure.	Ovo je sigurno.
Either you want it or you don't.	Ili to želiš ili ne želiš.
I really needed that	To mi je jako trebalo
She wasn't at home.	Nije bila kod kuće.
I know what you really are	Znam šta si ti zaista
That's why you're here.	Zbog toga si ovde.
There are too many.	Ima previše.
I see what he's doing to you	Vidim šta ti radi
I just want my money	Želim samo svoj novac
I hope you find someone to help you.	Nadam se da ćeš naći nekoga da ti pomogne.
I didn't think he would.	Nisam mislio da hoće.
I couldn't believe this	Nisam mogao vjerovati u ovo
It wasn't that bad.	Nije bilo tako loše.
You can't say what he was.	Ne možete reći šta je on bio.
I didn't know what he was doing	Nisam znao šta radi
This is my job.	Ovo je moj posao.
I ask again.	Pitam ponovo.
But here's the problem.	Ali ovdje je problem.
I had to do this	Morao sam ovo da uradim
I didn't even see her	Nisam je ni vidio
That's so good.	To je tako dobro.
I hope this is my problem	Nadam se da je to moj problem
There you are.	Tu si.
I couldn't get to him in time	Ne bih mogao doći do njega na vrijeme
I didn't know that either	Ni ja to nisam znao
Or it was.	Ili je bilo.
So it should be good.	Tako da bi trebalo biti dobro.
I needed.	Trebao sam.
Yes, she told him.	Da, rekla mu je.
We know we have to be better and be better.	Znamo da moramo biti bolji i biti bolji.
Nothing is just what it is.	Ništa nije samo ono što jeste.
I know what you did	Znam šta si uradio
But no one ever asked me.	Ali niko me nikada nije pitao.
So that will be good in that.	Tako da će to biti dobro u tome.
I wasn't sure it was real	Nisam bio siguran da je stvarno
I'm afraid you're right	Bojim se da ste u pravu
It is hard.	Teško je.
Never, never again.	Nikad, nikad više.
And you can see why	I može se vidjeti zašto
That is why you are here today.	To je razlog zašto ste danas ovdje.
He will come.	On će doći.
I just wasn’t good enough	Jednostavno nisam bio dovoljno dobar
I would say many things.	Rekla bi mnogo stvari.
Many days are hard	Mnogo dana je teško
You've had enough without me.	Dosta ti je i bez mene.
I know you're not for that.	Znam da nisi za to.
I shouldn't have been there	Nisam ni trebao biti tamo
I like to be surprised.	Volim biti iznenađen.
I guess you are.	Pretpostavljam da jesi.
People who are strong.	Ljudi koji su jako.
I knew something was going on here.	Znao sam da se ovdje nešto dešava.
But we are nothing.	Ali mi smo ništa.
I didn't think he would do that.	Nisam mislio da će to uraditi.
That is the only reason.	To je jedini razlog.
She said yes.	Rekla je da.
He would never do that.	Nikad to ne bi uradio.
I'm not going to do it tonight	Neću to učiniti večeras
I was with him when he got them	Bio sam s njim kad ih je dobio
Maybe if we would.	Možda ako bismo.
I'm just happy.	Samo sam sretan.
I could tell he was feeling better	Mogao sam reći da se osjeća bolje
Your code works for me.	Tvoj kod mi radi.
It takes time.	Treba vremena.
I don't know myself.	Ne znam ni sam.
Nice to see you all here.	Drago mi je da vas sve vidim ovdje.
That wasn't good either.	Ni to nije bilo dobro.
But not him.	Ali ne on.
I didn't think so	Nisam tako mislio
I can't tell you how	Ne mogu ti reći kako
I know what you mean	Znam kako misliš
I wasn't sure.	Nisam bio siguran.
And now we know what it looks like.	A sada znamo kako to izgleda.
We both knew better.	Oboje smo znali bolje.
But right now it’s hard.	Ali trenutno je to teško.
I work on it and it works.	Radim na tome i radi.
I couldn't do it alone.	Ne bih to mogao sam.
And he did just that.	I uradio je upravo to.
There is nothing that I can do about it	Ne mogu ništa da uradim kako treba
I work too hard.	Previše radim.
You must leave immediately.	Morate otići odmah.
I heard about you, you know	Čuo sam za tebe, znaš
I was glad.	Bilo mi je drago.
I can't be sure	Ne mogu biti siguran u to
This is not true.	To nije istina.
I figured out what could happen	Shvatio sam šta bi se moglo dogoditi
I don't have time for this	Nemam vremena za ovo
This was the only way.	Ovo je bio jedini način.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I want to know what the real problem is here	Želim da znam šta je ovde pravi problem
They will come.	Doći će.
I could tell him why	Mogao sam mu reći zašto
I'm not really ready.	Nisam baš spreman.
It was a difficult time for everyone.	Bilo je to teško vrijeme za sve.
And that's where your father can help you.	I tu ti otac može pomoći.
No one would know.	Niko ne bi znao.
Just like that.	Samo tako.
I have something for you too.	Imam nešto i za tebe.
Yes, but this is very difficult	Da, ali ovo je veoma teško
And is it ever hard.	I da li je ikada teško.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
I decided now was not the time	Odlučio sam da sada nije vrijeme
None of us should be here today.	Niko od nas ne bi trebao biti ovdje danas.
I can tell you this.	Mogu ti reći ovo.
I'm not afraid anymore	Više se ne bojim
I did it without telling anyone	Uradio sam to bez da sam nikome rekao
,.	, .
But that is not what is happening.	Ali to nije ono što se dešava.
I never had a problem with him	Nikad nisam imao problema sa njim
That is not true.	To nije tačno.
I wouldn't, except if you came	Ne bih, osim da si ti došao
I don't know what the problem is.	Ne znam u čemu je problem.
I just came to tell you what happened.	Samo sam došao da ti kažem šta se dogodilo.
I knew it was because of the money	Znao sam da je u tome zbog novca
And I saw it.	I video sam to.
Everything is fine so far.	Sve je u redu do ovde.
I'm just not good	Ja sam sve samo ne dobro
He just told me what he wanted me to do.	Samo mi je rekao šta želi da uradim.
I shouldn't have come to work today	Nisam trebao doći na posao danas
She wanted to go.	Htela je da ide.
Not really.	Ne stvarno.
You should all go together.	Trebali biste svi zajedno otići.
He thought it was pretty good.	Mislio je da je prilično dobro.
But it was much more than that.	Ali to je bilo mnogo više od toga.
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
I've never seen them before	Nikad ih prije nisam vidio
And it looks like it never will.	I izgleda nikad neće.
That will help.	To će pomoći.
It wasn't hard.	Nije bilo teško.
They could leave.	Mogli bi otići.
I knew exactly what was going on	Tačno sam znao šta se dešava
In fact, he may not be back with it until tomorrow.	U stvari, možda se neće vratiti s tim do sutra.
There is, there really is.	Ima, zaista ima.
You can do it here, now.	Možete to učiniti ovdje, sada.
It took me a while	Trebalo mi je vremena za sebe
I knew they were here	Znao sam da su bili ovdje
I wanted to see that.	Htio sam to vidjeti.
I would go	Ja bih otišao
He wasn't sure why.	Nije bio siguran zašto.
I knew you weren't either	Znao sam da niste ni vi
I hope all is well.	Nadam se da je sve dobro.
I could say anything	Mogao bih reći bilo šta
I should have told you	Trebao sam ti reći
What needed to be said.	Ono što je trebalo reći.
I wasn't sure which one.	Nisam bio baš siguran koji.
I will never do that again, you know that	Nikad to više neću uraditi, znaš to
It will work well now.	Sada će raditi dobro.
I don't know what could be wrong anymore.	Ne znam više šta bi moglo biti loše.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
I see no reason why not	Ne vidim razlog zašto ne bi
But not anything.	Ali ne bilo šta.
I was as bad as I could be	Bio sam loš koliko mogu
And we were on time.	I bili smo na vrijeme.
That can't happen now.	To se sada ne može dogoditi.
I had no idea what he was saying.	Nisam imao pojma šta govori.
He just goes for it.	On jednostavno ide na to.
It works now.	Sada radi.
But that's okay.	Ali to je u redu.
I think it's too much.	Mislim da je previše.
No.	Nema.
The problem is that it is still not working properly.	Problem je što još uvijek ne radi kako treba.
It can't be that hard.	Ne može biti tako teško.
I have it now.	Imam ga sada.
I won't, she told herself.	Neću, rekla je sebi.
I didn't have a life before you	Nisam imao život prije tebe
It still works.	I dalje radi.
I need some time for myself	Treba mi malo vremena za sebe
I think it could be more than that.	Mislim da bi moglo biti više od toga.
I can't for long	Ne mogu još dugo
I see.	Vidim.
He was no longer sure of anything.	Više nije bio siguran ni u šta.
We know her pretty well.	Znamo je prilično dobro.
I can't say exactly why	Ne mogu tačno reći zašto
It's true.	To je tačno.
This seems simple enough to me.	Ovo mi izgleda dovoljno jednostavno.
I couldn't say exactly how many there were	Nisam mogao tačno reći koliko ih je bilo
I just didn't know what it was	Samo nisam znao šta je to
He will be fine.	On će biti dobro.
I'll buy it.	Ja ću ga kupiti.
He didn't know what was going on.	Nije znao šta se dešava.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
You did what you could.	Uradili ste šta ste mogli.
So much has happened.	Toliko se toga dogodilo.
I wondered what he would do	Pitao sam se šta bi on uradio
I know you very well	Znam te jako dobro
It was so hard to know what to tell him.	Bilo je tako teško znati šta da mu kažem.
I should just tell him	Samo bih mu trebao reći
I didn't want to guess anything	Nisam htela ništa da pretpostavljam
He had never heard it before.	Nikad ga ranije nije čuo.
I was tired, so very, very tired	Bio sam umoran, tako jako, veoma umoran
Nobody ever told me that.	Niko mi to nikada nije rekao.
Why did you tell me all that?	Što si mi sve to rekao.
I didn't know what to tell him.	Nisam znao šta da mu kažem.
That it could only be him.	Da to može biti samo on.
He won't leave without me.	Neće otići bez mene.
He wouldn't say it like that.	On to ne bi tako rekao.
I hope you are fine	Nadam se da ste dobro
I can do it already	Ja to već mogu
I just can't do this anymore	Jednostavno ne mogu ovo više
I want to know that it will be good	Želim da znam da će biti dobro
Not bad.	Nije loše.
But that's what she said.	Ali to je ona rekla.
He himself was fine.	On sam je bio dobro.
I would never have done this without you	Nikad ovo ne bih uradio bez tebe
And look what we have.	I vidi šta imamo.
It's just that something.	To je samo to nešto.
I haven't been back in thirty years	Nisam se vratio trideset godina
She's anything but that.	Ona je sve samo ne to.
I know it must be hard	Znam da mora da je teško
I would love to see him try	Voleo bih da ga vidim kako pokušava
It won't work.	Neće raditi.
Yes, we said.	Da, rekli smo.
I can do everything together for good	Mogu raditi sve zajedno za dobro
I didn't know how good you were going to be.	Nisam znao koliko ćeš biti dobar.
I wasn't a good friend of yours	Nisam ti bio dobar prijatelj
That's exactly what we need.	To je upravo ono što nam treba.
Too much has happened.	Previše toga se dogodilo.
This could be me.	Ovo bih mogao biti ja.
I was sure they were gone	Bio sam siguran da ih više nema
He asked for a reason.	Pitao je za razlog.
She didn't want to wait.	Nije htela da čeka.
I really can't help it	Zaista ne mogu pomoći
I know how bad that car was	Znam koliko je taj auto bio loš
If I can.	Ako mogu.
But here we could win.	Ali ovdje bismo mogli pobijediti.
Not last night.	Ne sinoć.
We have those things.	Imamo te stvari.
It's so simple and easy.	To je tako jednostavno i lako.
I haven't been there that long	Nisam bio tamo tako dugo
I think everything will come back to me soon.	Mislim da će mi se sve brzo vratiti.
I wondered what he was doing, what he was thinking	Pitao sam se šta radi, šta misli
I want to tell him something.	Želim nešto da mu kažem.
We have to get back to work.	Moramo se vratiti na posao.
You shouldn't do that.	Ne bi trebalo to da radiš.
I don't know yet.	Ne znam još.
They were gone again.	Ponovo ih nije bilo.
I wouldn't bring them back	Ne bih ih vratio
She says no.	Ona kaže da nema.
I know it was.	Znam da je bilo.
I'd rather it wasn't	Ja bih to više volio da nije
I wondered where everyone was	Pitao sam se gdje su svi
Tell me no.	Reci mi ne.
Do it now.	Uradi to sada.
That's all she knows.	To je sve što ona zna.
I'm with a friend.	Ja sam kod prijatelja.
He would never get better.	Nikada ne bi dobio bolji.
I was there too.	I ja sam bio tamo.
There are a lot of us.	Ima nas puno.
I didn't know how many years.	Nisam znao koliko godina.
I don't think they know yet what happened.	Mislim da još ne znaju šta se dogodilo.
I would love that.	Voleo bih to.
He won.	Dobio je.
Nobody wants to talk about it.	Niko ne želi da priča o tome.
He said that.	On je to rekao.
He went to get me.	Otišao je po mene.
You.	Vi.
This is real life.	Ovo je pravi život.
If you have to.	Ako moraš.
Everything you want.	Sve što želite.
I just couldn't tell.	Jednostavno nisam mogao reći.
What could be the reason.	Šta bi mogao biti razlog.
I can't talk to anyone about it	Ne mogu ni sa kim razgovarati o tome
I really know, you know.	Zaista znam, znaš.
We could.	Mogli smo.
And tell the truth.	I reci istinu.
I will not buy it again.	Neću ga ponovo kupiti.
She said it made her feel good.	Rekla je da se zbog toga osjeća dobro.
I know this is hard for you.	Znam da ti je ovo teško.
I need to know what's going on	Moram da znam šta se dešava
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I guess so.	Pretpostavljam da jeste.
If so, say so.	Ako jesi, reci.
I love the job you did	Volim posao koji si uradio
He didn't do it.	On to nije radio.
I thought everything was fine	Mislio sam da je sve u redu
There's a new one.	Tu je novi.
I should have won today	Trebao sam danas pobijediti
You can tell yourself it’s just a story.	Možete sami sebi reći da je to samo priča.
I didn't know about it.	Nisam znao o tome.
But I can't do anything.	Ali ne mogu ništa.
No, that's not true.	Ne, to nije tačno.
He will come at any time.	Doći će u bilo koje vrijeme.
We told the truth.	Rekli smo istinu.
He told me that.	Rekao mi je to.
I knew something was there	Znao sam da je nešto tamo
i love everything.	ja volim sve.
So easy.	Tako lako.
That's right.	Tako je.
Maybe that will be enough.	Možda će biti dovoljno.
Yes.	Da.
Or him and me.	Ili on i ja.
As your father must be.	Kao što tvoj otac mora biti.
That will really help.	To će zaista pomoći.
I ask her if she's okay	Pitam je da li je dobro
I mean this.	Mislim ovo.
Maybe someone was there.	Možda je neko bio tamo.
I couldn't tell him that	Nisam mu to mogao reći
He told me about you.	Rekao mi je za tebe.
Maybe he's better at it than even me.	Možda je bolji u tome čak i od mene.
Like, a lot more.	Kao, puno više.
But even if it is true, it is only one life.	Ali čak i da je to istina, to je samo jedan život.
And maybe that was true.	A možda je to bila istina.
I haven't seen him yet	Još uvek ga nisam video
And it would be and it is.	I bilo bi i jeste.
I don't need anyone	Ne bi mi trebao niko
I can't be the only one who knows	Ne mogu biti jedini koji zna
I preferred that he would	Više sam volio da hoće
There are a lot of problems.	Mnogo je problema.
When he returned to.	Kada se vratio u .
And it wasn't exactly a good day.	A to baš i nije bio dobar dan.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
I really want to be that one	Zaista želim da budem taj
I love everything at home	Volim sve kod kuće
Would anyone tell me what to do.	Da li bi mi neko rekao šta da radim.
I know you better than that	Znam te bolje od toga
I wonder who he was	Pitam se ko je on bio
I'm not much better	Nije mi mnogo bolje
I expected him to say no	Očekivao sam da će reći ne
She almost was.	Skoro je bila.
Which obviously we didn't.	Što očigledno nismo.
It was very fast and fast	Bilo je vrlo brzo i brzo
But that's the only one we have.	Ali to je jedini koji imamo.
He had no money.	Nije imao novca.
Probably a long time.	Vjerovatno dugo.
He left the day before.	Otišao je dan ranije.
This is not happening.	Ovo se ne dešava.
In fact, this is not quite true.	Zapravo, ovo nije baš tačno.
Nothing easy in that.	Ništa lako u tome.
I decided to tell the truth	Odlučio sam da kažem istinu
That's not helpful.	To nije od pomoći.
It's always better together.	Zajedno je uvek bolje.
Please don't see me.	Molim te nemoj me vidjeti.
This will tell you where this is happening.	Ovo će vam reći gdje se to dešava.
The game itself is really good.	Sama igra je zaista dobra.
I can't be sure.	Ne mogu biti siguran.
This never happened.	Ovo se nikada nije dogodilo.
The houses are much more.	Kuće su mnogo više.
I hope we can stay, he says	Nadam se da možemo ostati, kaže
I can't do this alone	Ne mogu ovo sam
I haven't heard of it either	Ni ja nisam čuo za to
I can't help myself, he's so bad.	Ne mogu si pomoći, tako je loš.
I can't do this anymore	Ne mogu ovo više
I had no idea what that might be	Nisam imao pojma šta bi to moglo biti
We are all here.	Svi smo mi ovde.
I was only here to do work	Bio sam ovdje samo da radim posao
But for us, it’s just too good a thing.	Ali za nas je to jednostavno previše dobra stvar.
She works for him.	Ona radi za njega.
To.	Da bi.
I haven't heard this yet	Ovo još nisam čuo
I don't know why this is happening	Ne znam zašto se to dešava
You could do this, you know.	Mogao bi ovo da uradiš, znaš.
I'm always with you	Ja sam uvek sa tobom
But he thought that might help.	Ali mislio je da bi to moglo pomoći.
That's both.	To je oboje.
I can't believe you're not	Ne mogu vjerovati da nisi
This is so easy.	Ovo je tako lako.
I can't do it alone	Ne mogu sam
I guess you wouldn't know that	Pretpostavljam da to ne biste znali
I know what could happen and will probably happen	Znam šta bi se moglo dogoditi i vjerovatno će se dogoditi
Why? 	Zašto?
I don't work much here.	Ne radim puno ovdje.
I didn't give him time.	Nisam mu dao vremena.
Or it should be.	Ili bi trebao biti.
I knew what they did	Znao sam šta su uradili
Not just me, but you too.	Ne samo ja, nego i ti.
I see it a little more now.	Vidim to kako je sada malo više.
I knew we could see it now	Znao sam da to sada možemo vidjeti
You have to go.	Moraš ići.
I just need it this week	Samo mi treba ove sedmice
This time I have to do something	Ovaj put moram nešto da uradim
It won't get any better here.	Neće biti bolje ovdje.
It just doesn't work.	Jednostavno ne radi.
I probably shouldn't have said that	Vjerovatno nisam trebao to tako reći
He can do whatever he wants.	Može da radi šta hoće.
I wasn't expecting you for a few more days	Nisam te očekivao još nekoliko dana
But so it is, so it must be.	Ali tako je, tako mora biti.
He worked for me for three years.	Radio je za mene tri godine.
I've never seen that.	Nikad to nisam vidio.
Just nothing for us.	Samo ništa za nas.
I often thought of you	Često sam mislio na tebe
I asked you earlier.	Pitao sam te ranije.
I know very little.	Znam vrlo malo.
He is so good.	On je tako dobar.
I had to do that too	I ja sam to morao da uradim
But there can be many or more.	Ali može biti mnogo toga ili više od toga.
He's not sorry.	Nije mu žao.
And they should.	I trebali bi.
You really can't win.	Zaista ne možeš pobijediti.
She's nothing to me.	Ona mi nije ništa.
I didn't know any better	Nisam znao ništa bolje
I don't know what will happen, but something has to happen.	Ne znam šta će biti, ali nešto mora biti.
Or he saw.	Ili je vidio.
Maybe that was true.	Možda je to bila istina.
I see what's happening to me	Vidim šta mi se dešava
It's a bit like that.	To je pomalo tako.
That was it.	To je bilo.
I know there's more	Znam da ima još toga
I know the way so it shouldn’t be a problem	Znam put tako da to ne bi trebao biti problem
First time for him.	Prvi put za njega.
Which is really good.	Što je zaista dobro.
I heard you're home	Čuo sam da si kod kuće
I don't see it anymore.	Ne vidim to više.
I never got back to him.	Nikad mu se nisam vratio.
I should be happy.	Trebao bih biti sretan.
Rain can do that.	Kiša to može.
I have no idea how to do that	Nemam pojma kako to da radim
He would do it.	On bi to uradio.
I know what she wants to do	Znam šta ona želi da radi
I still know that.	Još uvek to znam.
And it was there.	I bilo je tamo.
I couldn't find anyone	Nisam mogao nikoga naći
He can't do both.	Ne može oboje.
There must be one.	Jedan mora biti.
And there must be.	I mora da ima.
Much more that he gave to help him.	Mnogo više da mu je dao da mu pomogne.
Actually enough.	Zapravo dosta.
I almost started praying	Skoro sam počeo da se molim
I didn't have time for anything	Nisam imao vremena ni za šta
And we know that.	I mi to znamo.
I saw them, you know	Vidio sam ih, znate
She shouldn't be doing that.	Ona to ne bi trebalo da radi.
They couldn't do this.	Ovo nisu mogli.
But you can never be like us.	Ali nikad ne možeš biti kao mi.
We are on it.	Mi smo na tome.
I did it all myself	Sve sam to uradio i sam
I wondered how much he knew	Pitao sam se koliko on zna
It's pretty simple.	Prilično je jednostavno.
I told him what happened	Rekao sam mu šta se dogodilo
I saw him, but he didn't see me	Vidio sam njega, ali on nije vidio mene
I had no idea he felt that way	Nisam imao pojma da se tako osjeća
I guess he saw it	Pretpostavljam da je to vidio
It didn't take that long.	Nije trebalo tako dugo.
It took me so long to be okay with that.	Trebalo mi je toliko vremena da budem u redu s tim.
He wasn't sure why, but he was.	Nije bio siguran zašto, ali jeste.
We'll tell you how it is.	Reći ćemo vam kako jeste.
It must be you, yourself.	Morate biti vi, vi sami.
But he was obviously wondering.	Ali on se očigledno pitao.
We know better now.	Sada znamo bolje.
Yes, he was alone.	Da, bio je sam.
I went to the door	Otišao sam do vrata
I'm sure this should work for you.	Siguran sam da bi ovo trebalo da radi za vas.
I knew something bad was going to happen this morning	Znao sam da će se nešto loše dogoditi jutros
I actually have that as a problem	Ja to zapravo imam kao problem
Unless you had a good reason for it.	Osim ako niste imali dobar razlog za to.
Maybe they will help.	Možda će oni pomoći.
But no one seems to be talking about it.	Ali izgleda da niko o tome ne priča.
I never wanted to do that	Nikad to nisam želeo da uradim
I have to go to a meeting now	Moram da idem na sastanak sada
He is talking about us.	On govori o nama.
He is still a friend.	On je još uvek prijatelj.
So many things happened.	Toliko stvari se dogodilo.
But there is nothing to do	Ali nema šta da se uradi
I loved that he could go with me	Voleo sam da može da ide sa mnom
The problem is people.	Problem su ljudi.
I wanted it too	Želeo sam to previše
I don't like them.	Ne volim ih.
It is very.	Veoma je.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
I would never see him again	Nikad ga više ne bih vidio
We just have it.	Samo ga imamo.
But it wasn't hard.	Ali nije bilo teško.
I guess it's there.	Pretpostavljam da je tu.
He didn't seem to know what to say.	Činilo se da nije znao šta da kaže.
There must be more to it than that.	Mora da ima više od toga.
I did it last night	Uradio sam to sinoć
He could only hope.	Mogao je samo da se nada.
He couldn't believe what he heard.	Nije mogao vjerovati šta je čuo.
I think you just said that	Mislim da si to upravo rekao
I don't know how it happened	Ne znam kako se to dogodilo
It wasn't like that.	Nije bilo tako.
I could help you with that	Mogao bih ti pomoći u tome
It's never good.	Nikad nije dobro.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
All he asked was if he could stay for a while.	Sve što je pitao je da li može ostati neko vrijeme.
I never wanted to do that.	Nikad to nisam želeo da uradim.
I did not know.	Nisam znao.
And it was.	I bilo je.
I knew it wasn’t going to happen right away	Znao sam da se to neće dogoditi odmah
I didn't say anything more	Nisam rekao ništa više
I'm ready for .	Spreman sam za .
It worked as before.	Djelovao je kao i prije.
But nothing can be done.	Ali ništa se ne može učiniti.
It is.	Da, jeste.
I didn't tell anyone	Nisam nikome ništa rekao
And it seems to be doing nothing.	I čini se da ništa ne radi.
I told him it could happen anywhere	Rekao sam mu da se to može dogoditi bilo gdje
I mean, we didn't do anything wrong.	Mislim, nismo uradili ništa loše.
She knows it and she doesn't know it.	Ona to zna i ne zna.
I still think he likes it	I dalje mislim da mu se sviđa
It really works.	Zaista radi.
I didn't know what to say or think	Nisam znao šta da kažem ili da mislim
We have them.	Imamo ih.
We do this in.	Ovo radimo u.
If he wanted to, he would have said.	Da je želio, rekao bi.
You never were.	Nikada nisi bio.
And you are not.	A ti nisi.
Oh, but he never left	O, ali on nikada nije otišao
It never will be.	Nikada neće biti.
It is who we are and what we are.	To je ko smo i šta smo.
It's not about you, it really isn't.	Nije zbog tebe, zaista nije.
You could too.	Mogao bi i ti.
I figured out how to do it.	Shvatio sam kako da to uradim.
I just want to see him play.	Samo želim da ga vidim kako igra.
I should probably go home	Vjerovatno bih trebao ići kući
None of that was true.	Ništa od toga nije bilo istina.
I never saw the things he did	Nikad nisam vidio stvari koje je radio
I have no idea who it was	Nemam pojma ko je to bio
I want you to tell me the truth	Želim da mi kažeš istinu
No, no, it's not.	Ne, ne, nije.
It's not easy, that's for sure.	Nije lako, to je sigurno.
I doubt my father ever knew	Sumnjam da je moj otac ikada znao
I just thought you should know	Samo sam mislio da bi trebao znati
Nobody says anything.	Niko ništa ne govori.
But nothing happened.	Ali ništa se nije dogodilo.
But they were there now.	Ali oni su sada bili tamo.
He said he didn't know.	Rekao je da ne zna.
Now he heard it.	Sada je to čuo.
I couldn't see what he looked like	Nisam mogao da vidim kako je izgledao
He had to help me.	Morao je da mi pomogne.
More.	Više.
I was so very happy	Bio sam tako veoma sretan
And, in fact, they probably won't.	A, u stvari, vjerovatno i neće.
They are not here.	Oni nisu ovde.
But now we have to move on.	Ali sada moramo ići dalje.
I always wanted to do more than that	Uvek sam želeo da radim više od toga
Yes, it could happen.	Da, moglo bi se dogoditi.
I love those things.	Volim te stvari.
I'm not sure why.	Nisam siguran zašto.
It's not just one day.	Nije samo jedan dan.
Everything we said.	Sve što smo rekli.
It's okay with me.	U redu je sa mnom.
He just looked like a happy guy.	Samo je izgledao kao sretan momak.
I know you still have a problem with me	Znam da još uvek imaš problem sa mnom
I wasn't really sure what to do with it	Nisam bio baš siguran šta da radim s tim
I know what it looks like very well.	Znam kako to izgleda jako dobro.
A lot of people.	Puno ljudi.
Except not really.	Osim ne baš.
I hope he never will	Nadam se da nikad neće
That's bad enough.	To je dovoljno loše.
Life life life.	Život život život.
As before.	Kao i ranije.
I can't believe you are	Ne mogu vjerovati da jesi
He had nothing.	Nije imao ništa.
That would be it.	To bi bilo to.
I don't know why, but that's how it was	Ne znam zašto, ali tako je bilo
This is not so.	Ovo nije tako.
I mean, you look good to me	Mislim, izgledaš mi dobro
I know he wants to play	Znam da želi da igra
And you know which one.	I znaš koji.
I've never told anyone before	Nikad to nikome ranije nisam rekao
There's more here.	Ovdje ima više.
This is really good.	Ovo je zaista dobro.
He is a really good person.	On je stvarno dobra osoba.
It still can be.	Još uvijek može biti.
Not from me.	Ne od mene.
I could probably get there and come back in a day	Vjerovatno bih mogao doći tamo i vratiti se za jedan dan
I still love you so much	I dalje te toliko volim
I really love you.	Stvarno te volim.
I thought there would be time	Mislio sam da će biti vremena
You said it.	Ti si to rekao.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati.
He is not happy.	Sretan nije.
There were a few more.	Bilo je još nekoliko.
I just wanted you to know, we're here for you	Samo sam htela da znaš, mi smo tu za tebe
I need to talk to you	Moram razgovarati s tobom
That would be obvious.	To bi bilo očigledno.
I asked him for a while.	Pitao sam ga za neko vrijeme.
It just has to do.	To jednostavno mora učiniti.
I wish there was something we could do	Voleo bih da postoji nešto što možemo da uradimo
Or they can be both.	Ili mogu biti oboje.
He doesn't want it.	On ga ne želi.
I want to do the right thing	Želim da uradim pravu stvar
No, this can't be right.	Ne, ovo ne može biti u redu.
No, no, really.	Ne, ne, stvarno.
I wasn't sure if he was done	Nisam bio siguran da li je završio
And better.	I bolje.
He came and worked well.	Došao je i dobro radio.
How good those times were.	Kako su to bila dobra vremena.
No you're not.	Ne, nisi.
I asked where he was.	Pitao sam gdje je.
That was one of the problems.	To je bio jedan od problema.
I just thought you should know, that's all	Samo sam mislio da treba da znaš, to je sve
I always wanted to be alone	Uvek sam želeo da budem sam
I couldn't see her.	Nisam je mogao vidjeti.
I was glad to see him	Bilo mi je drago što sam ga vidio
But I can't do that.	Ali ja to ne mogu.
We said, obviously, no.	Rekli smo, očigledno, ne.
This is all he needs.	Ovo je sve što mu treba.
I probably won't go	Vjerovatno neću ići
Yes, something is wrong with you.	Da, nešto nije u redu s tobom.
I just wish I knew	Samo bih volio da sam znao
And you have to be	I to moraš biti
No, it is.	Ne, jeste.
I can't let you do that	Ne mogu ti dozvoliti da to uradiš
I know he has to.	Znam da mora.
I wouldn't want that either	Ni ja to ne bih želio
But she didn't want to.	Ali nije htela.
It really was.	Zaista je bilo.
Not little by little this time.	Ovaj put ne malo po malo.
I didn't ask for him	Nisam ga tražio
That is not happening.	To se ne dešava.
He couldn't see much.	Nije mogao mnogo da vidi.
It's easy to say, so hard to do.	Lako je reći, tako teško uraditi.
I haven't seen her today	Nisam je još vidio danas
I hope to see more	Nadam se da ćemo vidjeti više
I'll tell him soon, she told herself.	Reći ću mu uskoro, rekla je sebi.
This is like we're home.	Ovo je kao da smo kod kuće.
I saw you last night	Video sam vas sinoć
I should have come earlier	Trebao sam doći ranije
All right.	Sve u redu.
It must be if.	Mora biti ako.
People there.	Ljudi tamo.
I went and went home	Otišao sam i otišao kući
You said you would.	Rekao si da hoćeš.
Neither can they.	Ne mogu ni oni.
Today that someone is me.	Danas sam taj neko ja.
Even one came back to me.	Čak mi se jedan vratio.
I didn't want to hope.	Nisam želeo da se nadam.
I must go now.	Moram sada ići.
He couldn't believe it.	Nije mogao vjerovati.
I know you really like it	Znam da ti se stvarno sviđa
I have no idea how long	Nemam pojma koliko dugo
Can you.	Možete li.
So far, so good.	Do sada je sve bilo dobro do sada.
We didn't know he was coming.	Nismo znali da će doći.
I think she was right	Mislim da je bila u pravu
I am very glad about that	Veoma mi je drago zbog toga
I hope he comes soon	Nadam se da će uskoro doći
I can do it alone, you know	Mogu sama, znaš
I just want to be with you	samo želim biti s tobom
I know you don't know.	Znam da ne znaš.
You did well.	Dobro si uradio.
I never said that	Nikad nisam to rekao
Only we never did.	Samo mi to nikad nismo.
I couldn't believe what he just said	Nisam mogao vjerovati šta je upravo rekao
I've heard a lot to tell you	Čuo sam dosta toga, da vam kažem
I'm not sorry about that.	Nije mi žao zbog toga.
He didn't ask about my day anymore.	Više nije pitao za moj dan.
And much more than you need.	I mnogo više nego što vam treba.
I arrived at work today.	Danas sam stigao na posao.
I just wasn’t sure if that was true or not	Samo nisam bio siguran da li je to istina ili ne
It just has to.	Jednostavno mora.
I didn't see it, but it was obvious it was	Nisam to vidio, ali bilo je očigledno da jeste
I'm not sure why anymore	Nisam više siguran zašto
I heard someone say.	Čuo sam da neko kaže.
I hope you feel better	Nadam se da ti je bolje
That is not so.	To nije tako.
I am surprised when someone loves me.	Iznenađen sam kada me neko voli.
I'm just not ready for that yet	Samo još nisam spreman za to
Do those things next.	Uradite te stvari sljedeće.
I've been doing this for a long time	To sam radio dugo vremena
I want to be her.	Želim da budem ona.
We had a job.	Imali smo posao.
He didn't say much.	Nije baš mnogo rekao.
Probably, probably.	Verovatno je, verovatno.
I had no idea what was wrong with me	Nisam imao pojma šta je sa mnom
Everything but you.	Sve osim tebe.
But it doesn't work.	Ali ne radi.
And this guy will be.	I ovaj momak će biti.
I'm not even sure what exactly	Nisam ni siguran šta tačno
But that was three weeks ago.	Ali to je bilo prije tri sedmice.
Yes, you are right.	Da, u pravu ste.
I like that even more	To mi se još više sviđa
Like you.	Kao i ti.
I haven't heard that before	Nisam to ranije čuo
I know about these things	Znam za ove stvari
He doesn't like it.	Ne sviđa mu se.
But no one said you couldn't do this.	Ali niko nije rekao da ovo ne možete.
I would never understand how	Nikad ne bih shvatio kako
The sooner the better.	Što prije to bolje.
I never needed it.	Nikad mi nije trebao.
I knew they would find him there.	Znao sam da će ga tamo naći.
I know this would not be enough	Znam da ovo ne bi bilo dovoljno
People know that.	To ljudi znaju.
I may not be ready, but he is	Ja možda nisam spreman, ali on jeste
I've seen you before, and you've seen me	Vidio sam te ranije, i ti si vidio mene
He may or may not do it	On to može ili ne mora učiniti
I was first at the party.	Bio sam prvi na zabavi.
That was the one.	To je bio taj.
And maybe not.	A možda i ne.
Maybe that was it.	Možda je to bilo to.
No one but me.	Niko osim mene.
I just want to talk to you.	Samo želim razgovarati s tobom.
I saw everything.	Video sam sve.
I didn't know what it was	Nisam znao šta je to
It's been a long time.	Bilo je dugo.
I never thought this would happen	Nikad nisam mislio da će se ovo dogoditi
I didn't see that.	Nisam to vidio.
So they are right together.	Tako su u pravu zajedno.
I must have just heard things	Mora da sam upravo čuo stvari
I've never heard of it	Nikad nisam čuo za to
You can be sure of that.	Možete biti sigurni u to.
He was not alone in that.	U tome nije bio sam.
But there is something wrong with him too.	Ali i s njim nešto nije u redu.
There were many of them.	Bilo ih je mnogo.
It must have been.	Mora da je bilo.
I didn't have to work	Nisam morao da radim
I didn't know what to do or say	Nisam znao šta da radim ili kažem
I love you so much !.	Volim te mnogo!.
It's really hard.	Zaista je teško.
You haven't told me anything in a long time.	Dugo mi ništa nisi rekao.
I didn't see where	Nisam vidio gdje
Working fast, he came to the day when he said on time.	Radi brzo, došao je na dan kada je rekao na vrijeme.
That should be good enough for now.	To bi za sada trebalo biti dovoljno dobro.
Where next.	Gdje dalje.
I didn't see her do that.	Nisam je vidio da to radi.
It seemed to work well.	Činilo se da radi dobro.
Not to.	Da ne bi.
It all happened.	Sve se to dogodilo.
And a little more besides.	I još malo osim toga.
And you will see much more from us.	I od nas ćete vidjeti još mnogo toga.
You are doing a good job.	Radite dobar posao.
I know you'll be fine	Znam da ćeš biti dobro
I just know these things	Ja samo znam ove stvari
We were the only people here.	Bili smo jedini ljudi ovdje.
I've never been here before	Nikada prije nisam bio ovdje
I'm always first.	Ja sam uvek prvi.
Almost everything he wanted.	Skoro sve što je želeo.
And he would be right.	I bio bi u pravu.
You do it.	Ti to radiš.
I saw him do it.	Video sam ga kako to radi.
I know what you are.	Znam šta si ti.
Maybe three times.	Možda tri puta.
Everything works well.	Sve radi dobro.
I'm so sorry to say	Tako mi je žao što moram reći
I was a little sorry	Bilo mi je malo žao
For the first time for everyone	Prvi put za sve
Now I am about myself.	Sada sam o sebi.
I'm not sure, really	Nisam siguran, zaista
He loved being there.	Voleo je da bude tamo.
That's all I wanted	Samo sam to želeo
I know you want everything from me	Znam da želiš sve od mene
He'll be home tomorrow.	Doći će kući sutra.
He's never been better.	Nikad mu nije bolje.
He already loved it.	On je to već voleo.
I tried to do the right thing	Pokušao sam da uradim pravu stvar
You should be safe here.	Trebao bi biti siguran ovdje.
It took time.	Za to je trebalo vremena.
I love you so, so, so much	Volim te tako, tako, toliko
I know you were just a good friend	Znam da si samo bio dobar prijatelj
But they will come.	Ali oni će doći.
That is being said for the truth.	To se kaže za istinu.
I hope you can do something about it.	Nadam se da možeš učiniti nešto s tim.
I was right too.	I ja sam bio u pravu.
It happens to you.	Dešava ti se.
That and time.	To i vrijeme.
They will come.	Oni će doći.
But he's not trying.	Ali on ne pokušava.
No problem.	Nije problem.
And many times.	I to mnogo puta.
I wish you knew.	Voleo bi da znaš.
I guess it wasn't easy	Pretpostavljam da to nije bilo lako
I can only talk to him, but nothing more.	Mogu samo razgovarati s njim, ali ništa više.
I am and will always be yours	Ja sam i uvek ću biti tvoj
You know he'll be there.	Znaš da će biti tamo.
So it was now.	Tako je bilo i sada.
Usually a lot.	Obično mnogo.
Just don't.	Samo nemoj.
I knew you wanted me	Znao sam da me želiš
It was good that someone wanted you so much.	Bilo je dobro da te neko toliko želi.
I thought he was doing really well	Mislio sam da mu ide jako dobro
I'm so sorry about that.	Tako mi je žao zbog toga.
I just didn't want to know about it.	Samo nisam htela da znam za to.
One will be for you.	Jedan će biti za tebe.
He did it many times.	Uradio je to mnogo puta.
I could never tell you before	Nikad ti prije nisam mogao reći
I hope so.	Nadam se.
Maybe that's what happened.	Možda se to i dogodilo.
You could say.	Moglo bi se reći.
I should have bought them all	Trebao sam ih sve kupiti
I was as good as I left	Bio sam dobar kao da sam otišao
We have a problem here	Imamo problem ovdje
We'll do that here.	To ćemo raditi ovdje.
I knew right away you were going there	Odmah sam znao da ćeš otići tamo
This was it.	Ovo je bilo to.
I'll tell him soon	Reći ću mu uskoro
But one is.	Ali jedan jeste.
So simple and accurate.	Tako jednostavno i tačno.
I think we better do it now	Mislim da je bolje da to uradimo odmah
My job .	Moj posao .
I didn't know what would happen to him.	Nisam znao šta će mu se dogoditi.
Maybe like you.	Možda kao ti.
He didn't say no, but he didn't say yes.	Nije rekao ne, ali nije ni rekao da.
Things are not bad.	Stvari nisu loše.
They couldn't see me.	Nisu me mogli vidjeti.
It is unlikely that anyone will do that.	Malo je vjerovatno da će neko to učiniti.
I never expected him to do that.	Nikada nisam očekivao da će to uraditi.
Don't tell me what to do.	Ne govori mi šta da radim.
Yes, it's true.	Da, to je istina.
I never knew who they were	Nikad nisam znao ko su oni
She knows she has to go.	Ona zna da mora ići.
But now he can't.	Ali sada ne može.
But he said that.	Ali on je to rekao.
But he doesn't know anything.	Ali on ne zna ništa.
He is my only friend.	On je moj jedini prijatelj.
A little more could have been done here.	Ovdje se malo više moglo raditi.
Something no one has ever told you.	Nešto što ti niko nikad nije rekao.
He's too good.	Previše je dobar.
I can't say what it was.	Ne mogu reći šta je to bilo.
He will work.	On će raditi.
But today he had.	Ali danas je imao.
He can't do this.	On ne može ovo da uradi.
I told him he could have done better.	Rekao sam mu kako je mogao bolje.
I mean, how is she?	Mislim, kako je ona
Say it like it was.	Reci to kao da je bilo.
She was here.	Bila je ovdje.
He's really good.	On je stvarno dobar.
I feel better today than yesterday.	Danas mi je više nego juče.
It shouldn't be too hard, she said.	Ne bi trebalo biti previše teško, rekla je.
He makes the car do what he loves.	On čini da auto radi ono što on voli.
I didn't even ask for this	Nisam ni tražio ovo
He just didn't know what it was.	Samo nije znao šta je to.
I was here three years ago	Bio sam ovdje prije tri godine
I thought it might help you	Mislio sam da bi ti moglo pomoći
I'm not afraid of you.	Ne bojim te se.
I know this wasn't easy for you	Znam da ti ovo nije bilo lako
Or if you would.	Ili ako bi.
I'm none of that	Ja nisam ništa od toga
We know you can do much better.	Znamo da možete mnogo bolje.
I like mine.	Sviđa mi se moj.
She didn't know what to say or do.	Nije znala šta da kaže ili uradi.
You need to know what you are doing and why.	Morate znati šta radite i zašto.
There is nothing we can do at the moment.	Trenutno ništa ne možemo da uradimo.
I want to know who she is	Želim da znam ko je ona
But simply no one loved him.	Ali jednostavno ga niko nije volio.
It just took me a while	Samo mi je trebalo malo vremena za sebe
And we won't.	I nećemo.
I didn't know anyone saw me	Nisam znao da me neko vidi
But he knew enough.	Ali znao je dovoljno.
He doesn't love her.	On je ne voli.
I'm so glad for you.	Tako mi je drago zbog tebe.
I know you all.	Znam vas sve.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.	Ne mogu vam reći ništa što ne znate.
That's how we work.	Tako mi radimo.
Say it and think it.	Reci to i misli to.
He wasn't even sure he could.	Nije čak ni bio siguran da može.
You don't think so.	Ne misliš tako.
It took us a long time.	Trebalo nam je dosta vremena.
I just want to do my job	Samo želim da radim svoj posao
And he will never return.	I nikad se neće vratiti.
I was completely happy	Bio sam potpuno sretan
I've never seen him before	Nikada ga ranije nisam vidio
Is it.	Je li.
I just can't.	Jednostavno ne mogu.
We couldn't trust anyone anymore.	Nikome više nismo mogli vjerovati.
He won't be home until three.	Neće biti kući do tri.
I should never have told you about that	Nikada ti nisam trebao reći o tome
Dan, no problem	Dan, bez problema
We had a job.	Imali smo posao.
I like to be busy.	Volim biti zauzet.
He was so good.	Bio je tako dobar.
I don't know anyone who knows.	Ne znam nikoga ko zna.
He hadn’t really done it before, and that was a little difficult.	Nije to stvarno radio ranije, a to je bilo malo teško.
I can't talk to you right now	Ne mogu razgovarati s tobom sada
Now we know you know everything.	Sada znamo da znate sve.
It was so hard to believe anything he said.	Bilo je tako teško vjerovati bilo čemu što je rekao.
I'll find a way.	Naći ću način.
But she is not the only one.	Ali ona nije jedina.
Good for me.	Dobro za mene.
I knew he would when he could	Znao sam da hoće kad bude mogao
I can do much better	Mogu mnogo bolje
I'm like him.	Ja sam kao on.
Who knows why.	Ko zna zašto.
He must go, he must go, he said.	Mora ići, mora ići, rekao je.
He could do anything.	Mogao je sve.
I can not anymore	Ne mogu više
He told me last night.	Sinoć mi je rekao.
I have nothing to do	Nemam šta da radim
He had another reason for that.	Imao je još jedan razlog za to.
I really like the game	Mnogo mi se sviđa igra
I have a lot more to say	Imam još mnogo toga da kažem
I guess there really isn’t that much to know	Pretpostavljam da zaista nema toliko toga da se zna
No, that's not enough.	Ne, to nije dovoljno.
I want this as much as you do	Želim ovo kao i ti
That's life.	To je život.
It shouldn't take long, but who knows.	Ne bi trebalo dugo, ali ko zna.
They never were.	Nikada ih nije bilo.
It was a story.	Bila je to priča.
I always thought this	Uvek sam ovo mislio
I wasn't so sure anymore	Nisam više bio tako siguran
It was really really good.	Bilo je stvarno jako dobro.
I could tell him the truth	Mogao bih mu reći istinu
It can't be done.	Ne može se uraditi.
You should be ready.	Trebalo bi da si spreman.
You did it to yourself.	Uradili ste to sebi.
In that time.	U to vrijeme.
I don't know about that.	Ne znam za to.
It's true.	To je istina.
But there is.	Ali postoji.
And I'm both.	I oboje sam ja.
He was obviously right.	Očigledno je bio u pravu.
I never thought that would happen	Nikad nisam mislio da će do toga doći
That was it.	To je bilo to.
I thought you knew that by now	Mislio sam da si to do sada znao
That's what I really wanted	To sam jako htela
There were more of them.	Bilo ih je više.
I was here alone	Bio sam ovde sam
I bought.	Ja sam kupio.
I came without a problem	Došao sam bez problema
Now we know why.	Sada znamo zašto.
And he had me there.	I imao me je tamo.
That was better for you and better for me.	To je bilo bolje za tebe i bolje za mene.
I think you did the right thing.	Mislim da si uradio pravu stvar.
I know that can't happen.	Znam da se to ne može dogoditi.
It was the first time he had been one.	Bio je to prvi put da je bio jedan.
I want you with me.	Želim te sa mnom.
It could have been much better.	Moglo je mnogo bolje.
There was a lot of that.	Bilo je puno toga.
I certainly didn't ask	Ja sigurno nisam pitao
That's bad for business.	To je loše za posao.
I can't go on, you know.	Ne mogu dalje, znaš.
He knew it well.	On je to dobro znao.
She will know what to do.	Ona će znati šta da radi.
I just needed the money	Samo mi je trebao novac
He could have stayed with me for sure.	Sigurno je mogao ostati sa mnom.
I didn't mean to say that.	Nisam to mislio reći.
But you don't.	Ali ti ne.
I didn't want to love him.	Nisam htela da ga volim.
And it's just me.	I to sam samo ja.
I have a lot of things	Imam puno stvari
This happens quite often.	To se dešava prilično često.
He couldn't see anything else.	Više ništa nije mogao vidjeti.
He was sure he would see her.	Bio je siguran da će je vidjeti.
This works a lot with very little.	Ovo radi puno sa vrlo malo.
I told you, it's not him.	Rekao sam ti, nije on.
He's really sorry.	Zaista mu je žao.
He thinks of everything.	Misli mu na sve.
I was sure you saw that	Bio sam siguran da si to vidio
I'm sure you know which one	Siguran sam da znaš koji
As for now.	Kao i za sada.
Love me a little, love me a long time.	Voli me malo, voli me dugo.
What he says is what he does.	Ono što kaže se i radi.
At the moment, I was really alone	Trenutno sam stvarno bila sama
No, he told himself.	Neću, rekao je sebi.
I wish you were here with me now	Voleo bih da si sada ovde sa mnom
I just have nothing to say to him.	Jednostavno nemam šta da mu kažem.
This looks good, but it doesn't work.	Ovo izgleda dobro, ali ne radi.
Over and over again.	Ponovo i ponovo.
I don't want to see anything.	Ne želim ništa da vidim.
Maybe it really happened.	Možda se to zaista dogodilo.
I think that is the question.	Mislim da je to pitanje.
I knew it had to be, many years ago.	Znao sam da mora biti, prije mnogo godina.
What is true today is true last week.	Ono što je istina danas, istina je i prošle sedmice.
I wouldn't do anything good.	Ne bih ništa dobro.
I mean, we can say everything	Mislim, možemo reći sve
I should have done it	Trebao sam to da uradim
And we need to talk about what we need to do.	I moramo razgovarati o tome šta treba da radimo.
He was there to do the job.	On je bio tu da radi taj posao.
He is at home.	On je kao kod kuće.
I'm not someone you want to know.	Nisam neko koga želiš da znaš.
I was happy here with you	Bio sam sretan ovdje sa tobom
And that's what they did.	I to su oni uradili.
That's how it should be.	Tako treba da bude.
I've never been here before	Nikada prije nisam bio ovdje
I'll tell you what to do.	Reći ću ti šta da radimo.
He couldn't do that.	To nije moglo učiniti.
I could have helped him	Mogao sam mu pomoći
I had no idea what it was	Nisam imao pojma šta je to
But this is too much for you.	Ali ovo je previše za tebe.
I hope you will too.	Nadam se da ćeš i ti.
You can trust me.	Možeš mi vjerovati.
I see him a little better	Vidim ga malo bolje
He said more than she said.	Rekao je više nego što je ona rekla.
I wonder if this will help me.	Pitam se hoće li mi ovo pomoći.
I was often very tired	Često sam bio veoma umoran
They know it will happen.	Oni znaju da će se to dogoditi.
But life must go on.	Ali život mora ići dalje.
And they won't.	I neće.
I know what you're doing	Znam šta radiš
I should know more in a few days	Trebalo bi da znam više za nekoliko dana
I've seen this before.	Video sam ovo ranije.
But not like that.	Ali ne tako.
I didn't want to go there	Nisam htela da idem tamo
I think it will be good now	Mislim da će sada biti dobro
I came to say just that.	Došao sam da kažem samo to.
I was happy to see her	Bio sam sretan što sam je vidio
I just hope she's okay	Samo se nadam da je ona dobro
Not much is being done anymore.	Više se ne radi mnogo.
We can't help ourselves.	Ne možemo si pomoći.
I didn't know you might be busy	Nisam znao da si možda zauzet
But for tonight.	Ali za večeras.
It's none of that.	Nije ništa od toga.
I'm not saying it's easy.	Ne kažem da je lako.
I didn't do anything	Nisam uradio ništa
Not sure how to proceed.	Nisam siguran kako dalje.
Just us.	Samo mi.
He didn't have to talk.	Nije morao da priča.
I mean, nobody.	Mislim, niko.
I just tried not to think about him.	Samo sam pokušao da ne mislim na njega.
I think someone knows	Mislim da neko zna
And that was the only thing they could never do.	I to je bila jedina stvar koju nikada nisu mogli učiniti.
Me, a good friend.	Ja, dobar prijatelj.
I thought you couldn't	Mislio sam da ne možeš
I will leave and I will never see you again	Otići ću i nikada te više neću vidjeti
There could be more.	Moglo bi biti i više.
I am one too.	I ja sam jedan.
As it really is.	Kao što, zaista, jeste.
And what he did.	I šta je uradio.
Not for him.	Ne za njega.
I had to come.	Morao sam doći.
I went to work.	Otišao sam na posao.
He could go on.	Mogao bi dalje.
And it was very, very difficult.	I bilo je veoma, veoma teško.
I didn't know anything.	Nisam znao ništa.
He came back into my life.	Vratio se u moj život.
I have done this many times.	To sam uradio mnogo puta.
I saw what was happening	Video sam šta se dešava
And she's right.	I ona je u pravu.
I told you about that earlier	Rekao sam ti o tome ranije
She knew things.	Znala je stvari.
I can't go there with you	Ne mogu ići tamo s tobom
I saw you didn't understand	Vidio sam da nisi shvatio
I am a father myself.	I sam sam otac.
They won't be here.	Oni neće biti ovdje.
They had a reason.	Imali su razlog.
I didn't really ask	Nisam zapravo pitao
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
But it's so hard here.	Ali ovde je tako teško.
You'll be with him soon.	Uskoro ćeš biti s njim.
I love my life.	Volim svoj život.
I know you think so	Znam da ti se to čini
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.	Nemoj mi reći da nije tako mislio.
As a friend.	Kao prijatelj.
Not even that.	Čak ni to.
Yes, there is more.	Da, ima još.
I don't have it.	Ja ga nemam.
I thought he didn't hear me	Mislio sam da me nije čuo
But please don't.	Ali molim te nemoj.
But this is what the story is.	Ali ovo je ono što je priča.
I guess he doesn't love me	Pretpostavljam da me ne voli
I think it will be safe there for now	Mislim da će tamo biti sigurno za sada
You needed it.	Trebao ti je.
I was fine with that	Bio sam u redu sa tim
I wondered if it was okay	Pitao sam se da li je dobro
But he will never come.	Ali on nikada neće doći.
I've never done that	Nikada to nisam radio
I don't really see	Ne vidim baš
It never seemed to be enough.	Činilo se da nikad nije bilo dovoljno.
I just knew he wouldn't	Samo sam znao da neće
I think that's the only way	Mislim da je to jedini način
He was not surprised.	Nije bio iznenađen.
You may or may not get it.	Možda ćete ga dobiti, a možda i ne.
I don't even know what it was.	Ne znam ni šta je to bilo.
I don't want you to think of me	Ne želim da misliš na mene
I can never go home now	Nikada ne mogu ići kući sada
No one knows how long.	Niko ne zna koliko dugo.
I would love to know where he is	Jako bih volio da znam gdje je
You are not yet completely one of us.	Još nisi potpuno jedan od nas.
I really don't see it.	Ja to stvarno ne vidim.
Maybe he knew.	Možda je znao.
Not quite alone.	Ne baš sama.
Oh my.	O moj.
You couldn't know.	Nisi mogao znati.
I thought it was a code or something	Mislio sam da je kod ili tako nešto
Maybe so.	Možda je tako.
I'm not busy at all.	Nisam uopšte zauzet.
He had heard this before.	Čuo je ovo ranije.
I never knew why	Nikad nisam znao zašto
I think you can help me.	Mislim da mi možeš pomoći.
She said nothing.	Nije rekla ništa.
I am nothing and everything	Ja sam ništa i sve
I think you mean what you say	Mislim da misliš ono što kažeš
But everyone knows.	Ali svi znaju.
I love them too	I ja ih volim
And you lost that.	I to si izgubio.
Or me.	Ili na mene.
I didn't know what he was talking about	Nisam znao o čemu priča
We knew that.	Znali smo to.
Yes a lot.	Da, mnogo.
I see what you did there.	Vidim šta si tamo uradio.
I thought to myself that this was going to be very, very easy.	Mislio sam u sebi da će ovo biti vrlo, vrlo lako.
I know what she says	Znam šta ona kaže
And give you back.	I vratiti mu te.
But they did none of that.	Ali ništa od toga nisu uradili.
I shouldn't have done that.	Nisam to trebao učiniti.
I love this job	Volim ovaj posao
She doesn't know either.	Ne zna ni ona.
It doesn't seem to be working.	Čini se da ne radi.
No one would know.	Niko ne bi znao.
They were the only ones.	Oni su bili jedini.
It was time.	Bilo je vrijeme.
But one can never be sure.	Ali nikada se ne može biti siguran.
We won't be working together for long.	Nećemo još dugo raditi zajedno.
But there was little they could do.	Ali malo toga su mogli učiniti.
I had nothing further	Nisam imao šta dalje
I’m not sure how the team could have done better.	Nisam siguran kako je tim mogao bolje.
It was like.	Bilo je kao.
I do that often.	Često to radim.
It wasn't my job.	To nije bio moj posao.
I wonder where that might be	Pitam se gdje to može biti
We have a lot more to see.	Moramo vidjeti još mnogo toga.
It's always like that.	Uvek je tako.
That is what we have to do now.	To je ono što sada moramo da uradimo.
You can say the same for me.	To možete reći i za mene.
What can you give?	Šta možeš dati?
I guess that's a little better.	Pretpostavljam da je to malo bolje.
I couldn't see anything.	Nisam mogao ništa da vidim.
And it looks, and that's a good thing.	I izgleda, i to je dobra stvar.
I have something you need to do for me	Imam nešto što treba da uradiš za mene
Whether it will be or not, no one knows.	Da li će biti ili ne, niko ne zna.
I understood completely	Shvatio sam potpuno
I would expect better.	Očekivao bih bolje.
He doesn't see anything.	Ne vidi ništa.
I love being here	Volim da je ovde
I saw it right away.	Video sam to odmah.
But that was in a few years.	Ali to je bilo za nekoliko godina.
I can't help it.	Ne mogu pomoći.
I asked a friend what was going on.	Pitao sam prijatelja šta se dešava.
I didn't do much.	Nisam puno toga uradio.
I guess you were right	Pretpostavljam da si bio u pravu
I'm sure someone will come up with it.	Siguran sam da će neko doći do toga.
I may or may not.	Mogu možda ne.
I had to do what was better for me	Morao sam da uradim ono što je bolje za mene
I asked her what year it was	Pitao sam je koja je to godina
I didn't think of myself.	Nisam mislio na sebe.
How fast he didn't know.	Koliko brzo nije znao.
If he's up for it, that is.	Ako je on za to, to je.
There were a lot of us.	Bilo nas je puno.
Nothing was easy for him.	Ništa mu nije bilo lako.
He just said tonight.	Upravo je rekao večeras.
He just wasn't right.	On jednostavno nije bio pravi.
And, as always, we did what was needed.	I, kao i uvijek, uradili smo ono što je trebalo.
I just can't stay here	Jednostavno ne mogu ostati ovdje
Yes you are.	Da jesi.
Tomorrow is a new day.	Sutra je novi dan.
What is it?' 	Šta je to?'
You didn't really tell me anything.	Nisi mi stvarno ništa rekao.
I was glad to see him again.	Bilo mi je drago da ga ponovo vidim.
I was good for nothing	Bio sam dobar ni za šta
Or maybe not.	Ili možda i nije.
I knew that, and so did she	Ja sam to znao, a i ona
I haven't been here for more than three weeks	Nije me bilo više od tri sedmice
There is still a long way to go.	Do toga je još dosta vremena.
I didn't do it.	Nisam to uradio.
He and I.	On i ja.
I guess that's what's happening	Pretpostavljam da se to dešava
It's my business to see it.	Moja je stvar da to vidim.
I really shouldn't.	Zaista ne bih trebao.
I asked him what day it was	Pitao sam ga koji je dan
It had to be him.	Morao je biti on.
But you know who knows.	Ali znate, ko zna.
That won't happen tomorrow.	To se neće dogoditi sutra.
They both knew it.	Oboje su to znali.
You can go.	Možeš ići.
It's time to go.	Vrijeme je da ode.
Very little, actually.	Vrlo malo, zapravo.
I can't do this now	Ne mogu ovo sada
But it couldn't be.	Ali to nije moglo biti.
I wish we had time	Voleo bih da smo imali vremena
Which he couldn't.	Što nije mogao.
That’s the way he lives.	To je način na koji on živi.
I knew what was wrong with me now	Znao sam šta sada nije u redu sa mnom
Just that and nothing else.	Samo to i ništa više.
Nothing is there and no one is there to see anything there.	Ništa nije tamo i niko nije tu da vidi ništa tamo.
I wonder what will happen next	Pitam se šta će se dalje dogoditi
But it happens.	Ali to se dešava.
He's just a guy.	On je samo momak.
Not just something right now	Ne samo nešto trenutno
It could be good, it could be not good.	Moglo bi biti dobro, moglo bi biti ne dobro.
That's all that happens.	To je sve što se dešava.
The team has arrived.	Tim je stigao.
You work or you don't.	Radiš ili ne.
I can't trust myself	Ne mogu vjerovati sebi
Many, many years.	Mnogo, mnogo godina.
And he wanted to know why.	I želio je znati zašto.
I just wish I knew why	Samo bih volio da znam zašto
I just want to see him	Samo želim da ga vidim
You better be here.	Bolje da si tu.
I am very happy if it can be helpful	Veoma sam sretan ako može biti od pomoći
And it is.	I jeste.
I didn't have to ask why	Nisam morao da pitam zašto
This is usually the case.	Obično je tako.
I think everyone should	Mislim da bi svi trebali
I can't go on.	Ne mogu dalje.
But he knew how he felt.	Ali znao je kako se osjeća.
I never asked for anything	Nikada ništa nisam tražio
I didn't ask her tonight	Nisam je pitao večeras
I'm sorry about that too.	Žao mi je i zbog toga.
I don't know anything about that	Ne znam ništa o tome
It doesn't just happen by itself.	To se ne dešava samo od sebe.
I could do a lot for you.	Mogao bih mnogo da uradim za tebe.
He didn't even want to see anyone.	Nije ni želio nikoga vidjeti.
Very, very happy.	Veoma, veoma sretan.
I should have come earlier	Trebao sam doći ranije
I probably won't see him again.	Vjerovatno ga više neću vidjeti.
Next week.	Sljedeće sedmice.
It's still good.	I dalje je dobro.
A lot goes into these things	Mnogo toga ide u ove stvari
I just can't give it to him	Jednostavno mu ih ne mogu dati
I think this will be good for you	Mislim da će ovo biti dobro za tebe
I asked him what he was doing	Pitao sam ga šta radi
But it wasn't mine.	Ali nije bio moj.
Nobody knows who she really is.	Niko ne zna ko je ona zapravo.
I asked him how he did it	Pitao sam ga kako je to uradio
I love her like she's mine	Volim je kao da je moja
For now, I'm tired.	Za sada sam umoran.
That's exactly how it's played.	Upravo se tako igra.
So it took so long now.	Tako da je sada trebalo toliko vremena.
I made it for myself.	Napravio sam ga za sebe.
And we'll talk about that.	I o tome ćemo razgovarati.
He had none of that.	Nije imao ništa od toga.
Everyone but you could see it.	Svi osim vas su to mogli vidjeti.
I can't give it to you	Ne mogu ti to dati
I shouldn't have told you	Nisam ti trebao reći
I don't know who he is.	Ne znam ko je on.
I don't see much.	Ne vidim mnogo.
Right now it always does.	Trenutno to uvek radi.
You are really something.	Ti si stvarno nešto.
Not today, never.	Ne danas, nikad.
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno si u pravu.
I saw it.	Video sam to.
It may have been a lot, but it wasn’t.	Možda je bio mnogo toga, ali to nije bio.
It's not what we need.	Nije ono što nam treba.
You don't even know where he is.	Ne znaš ni gdje je.
It wasn't even a radio.	To čak nije bio ni radio.
I gave him everything	Dao sam mu sve
I returned them.	Vratio sam ih.
Maybe we don't work anymore.	Možda više ne radimo.
Nobody thinks anything of it.	Niko ništa ne misli o tome.
I certainly can't.	Ja sigurno ne mogu.
He loves me very much.	On me mnogo voli.
But this was much more than a few.	Ali ovo je bilo mnogo više od nekoliko.
This is really you.	Ovo si ti zaista.
And like they're fine.	I kao da su u redu.
I came to see her.	Došao sam da je vidim.
Maybe we are doing something right?	Možda radimo nešto kako treba?
I thought you had it.	Mislio sam da ga imaš.
I've never seen so many	Nikada ih nisam vidio toliko
I can't talk about that tonight.	Ne mogu o tome večeras.
I wish you could stay too	Voleo bih da i ti možeš ostati
I didn't hear anything.	Nisam čuo ništa.
Or if he saw or heard nothing.	Ili ako ništa nije vidio ili čuo.
Maybe not likely.	Možda nije vjerovatno.
I didn't think so long	Nisam mislio tako dugo
He wants to be there.	On želi biti tamo.
What would.	Ono što bi.
I don't see it.	Ja to ne vidim.
It needs to be seen.	Treba je vidjeti.
I made up my mind and that was it	Odlučio sam se i to je bilo to
I can't do much more	Ne mogu mnogo više da radim
I know how to play	Znam kako se igra
And it won't get any better than itself.	I neće biti bolje samo od sebe.
I like it here	Sviđa mi se ovdje
So good, no one came back.	Tako dobro, niko se nije vratio.
I think this could help	Mislim da bi ovo moglo pomoći
Not for any of us.	Ne za bilo koga od nas.
I had no idea what had happened to him	Nisam imao pojma šta mu se dogodilo
Not even him.	Čak ni on.
Or it can be.	Ili može biti.
I certainly wasn't happy	Sigurno nisam bio sretan
I’ve done it multiple times and it doesn’t work.	Uradio sam to više puta i ne radi.
He'll know what you mean.	On će znati na šta misliš.
Even if he never came back, he was glad to be here.	Čak i ako se nikada nije vratio, bilo mu je drago što je ovdje.
I doubt anyone said that	Sumnjam da je to neko rekao
I'd be happy to do that.	Bilo bi mi drago da to uradim.
A lot is wrong with that.	Mnogo toga nije u redu s tim.
And it never would.	I nikada ne bi.
It works.	To radi.
A lot happened so fast	Mnogo toga se dogodilo tako brzo
People can tell.	Ljudi mogu reći.
And how they did it.	I kako su to uradili.
You'll be fine here.	Ovdje će ti sve biti u redu.
Someone should say what it is	Neko bi trebao reći šta je to
I have to go tonight	Moram ići večeras
I knew it was going to be hard, really, really hard.	Znao sam da će sve biti teško, stvarno, jako teško.
I know how it happened	Znam kako se to dogodilo
It was always true.	Uvek je bila istina.
I got there the day before.	Došao sam tamo dan ranije.
We are all human here.	Svi smo mi ovde ljudi.
She still didn't say anything.	I dalje ništa nije rekla.
I have to do this alone	Moram ovo da uradim sam
I haven't seen him in over three years	Nisam ga vidio više od tri godine
But not fast enough.	Ali ne dovoljno brzo.
But it is not easy.	Ali nije lako.
I thought it would be me	Mislio sam da ću to biti ja
He had it all.	Imao je sve.
So far so good, no time.	Za sada dobro, bez puno vremena.
I couldn't find my car	Nisam mogao naći svoj auto
I didn't buy anything	Nisam ništa kupio
And for me, that was it.	I za mene je to bilo to.
I know he's there.	Znam da je tamo.
This is not the way it should be.	Ovo nije način na koji treba da bude.
I think of him.	Mislim na njega.
I think she means this	Mislim da ona misli ovo
I need him to do it again.	Treba mi da to ponovo uradi.
And not only that, he knew where she worked.	I ne samo to, on je znao gdje ona radi.
From so many people.	Od toliko ljudi.
You know what happens next.	Znaš šta se dalje dešava.
But they may not know it well.	Ali oni to možda ne znaju dobro.
You should go home.	Trebao bi se vratiti kući.
He'll tell me.	Reći će mi.
But even if it did, it might not be much.	Ali čak i da jeste, možda od toga ne bi bilo ništa mnogo.
I'll talk to him right away	Odmah ću razgovarati s njim
I actually work for a living.	Ja zapravo radim za život.
But there is still time.	Ali još ima vremena.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
People well there.	Ljudi dobro tamo.
I couldn't do it anymore	Nisam to više mogao
I can't find him.	Ne mogu ga naći.
I know what you would do with it	Znam šta bi uradio s tim
He is a good person.	On je dobra osoba.
He wants to be happy.	Želi biti sretan.
This is not the first time he has done so.	Nije prvi put da to radi.
No one worked more than us.	Niko nije radio više od nas.
I'm really happy for you.	Zaista sam sretan zbog tebe.
I could never go home	Nikad se nisam mogao vratiti kući
I know you need it now	Znam da ti treba odmah
Not so now.	Sada nije tako.
I had that time.	Imao sam tako vrijeme.
Or maybe it's both.	Ili je možda oboje.
Nobody knew about it.	Niko nije znao za to.
I never was	Nikada nisam bio
And I love working with you	I ja volim da radim sa tobom
But that was no longer true.	Ali to više nije bila istina.
This is not a problem.	Ovo nije problem.
I won't see him.	Neću ga vidjeti.
I wanted a lot more	Želeo sam mnogo više
I wondered how old he was.	Pitao sam se koliko ima godina.
What else is there?	Šta još ima?
I knew he had done it many times before.	Znao sam da je to uradio mnogo puta ranije.
I just want you home	Samo te želim kući
You know, just to be sure.	Znaš, samo da budem siguran.
I don't know what's going on here.	Ne znam šta se ovde dešava.
Not good.	Nije dobro.
There is.	Postoji.
Usually.	Obično.
It just takes time.	Samo treba vremena.
I saw you.	Video sam te.
He's there.	On je tamo.
Work on it.	Raditi na tome.
I just wasn’t ready to tell him that.	Jednostavno nisam bio spreman da mu to kažem.
He knows better.	On zna bolje.
I just know you are	Ja jednostavno znam da jesi
We could.	Mogli bismo.
He can do it alone.	On to može sam.
I have no idea what to do	Nemam pojma šta da radim
It's a little hard to find	Malo je teško naći
I didn't just want more	Nisam samo želeo više
This was when.	Ovo je bilo kada.
But this is not what is happening.	Ali ovo nije ono što se dešava.
They just didn't do it for me.	Samo nisu to uradili za mene.
This does several things.	Ovo radi nekoliko stvari.
I was too tired to do anything	Bio sam previše umoran da bih bilo šta uradio
Now it's more.	Sada je to više.
I have time.	Imam vremena.
I worked a lot for him	Radio sam puno za njega
I'm ready to do, to do whatever you want.	Spreman sam da radim, da radim sve što želiš.
I don't know anymore.	Ne znam više.
It can't come fast enough !.	Ne može doći dovoljno brzo!.
I just want to help	Samo želim pomoći
Yes, it's not me.	Da, to nisam ja.
Now we know much more.	Sada znamo mnogo više.
I hope it will.	Nadam se da hoće.
I can't help it yet, and neither can you	Ja još ne mogu pomoći, a ne možete ni vi
That's exactly what they said.	Upravo su to rekli.
I can't see this	Ne mogu ovo da vidim
They just didn't know what.	Samo nisu znali šta.
I need to see a friend	Moram da vidim prijatelja
That is not life.	To nije život.
Either tonight or tomorrow.	Ili večeras ili sutra.
I was right, that was bad	Bio sam u pravu, to je bilo loše
I didn't want any of that.	Nisam htela ništa od toga.
In fact, he was.	U stvari, bio je.
I can't see.	Ne mogu vidjeti.
I could hardly see	Skoro da nisam mogao da vidim
I could never trust you	Nikad ti nisam mogao vjerovati
He knew exactly who he wanted.	Tačno je znao koga želi.
Is it that bad.	Zar je tako loše.
Not bad, not good, nothing.	Nije loše, nije dobro, ništa.
If you hadn't done that, none of us would have been here.	Da to niste uradili, niko od nas ne bi bio ovde.
I had nothing to do with it	Nisam imao ništa s tim
I guess you had to be there	Pretpostavljam da si morao biti tamo
Yes yes yes.	Da da da.
I was for it	Bio sam za to
I did everything myself	Sve sam radio sam
I didn't really want to go there	Nisam baš želio da idem tamo
They don't know they're wrong.	Ne znaju da nisu u pravu.
He just knew he couldn't leave yet.	Znao je samo da još ne može otići.
I will not be surprised anymore, not like before	Neću više biti iznenađen, ne kao prije
And he does it.	I pravi to.
I didn't know what to say, what to ask	Nisam znao šta da kažem, šta da pitam
I hope you all like it	Nadam se da vam se svima sviđa
I won't be back until tomorrow	Neću se vratiti do sutra
That was all.	Sve je to bilo.
I think no.	Mislim da ne.
It is, rather, something that needs to be done.	To je, prije, nešto što treba učiniti.
I think you should know	Mislim da bi trebao znati
I don't see anyone.	Ne vidim nikoga.
He should have.	Trebao je.
This may be the first time.	Ovo je možda prvi put.
I see what you want.	Vidim šta želiš.
I didn't know enough	Nisam znao dovoljno
I ask what the problem was.	Pitam šta je bio problem.
That should be enough.	To bi trebalo biti dovoljno.
You won't be sorry.	Neće vam biti žao.
A little while ago.	Malo prije.
But this is really good.	Ali ovo je stvarno dobro.
I wasn't looking for her at the time	Nisam je tražio u to vrijeme
That's what he loves.	To je ono što on voli.
I did exactly what he told me.	Uradio sam tačno ono što mi je rekao.
I wish she knew	Voleo bih da je znala
She didn't want to tell me.	Nije htela da mi kaže.
But they don't know it yet.	Ali oni to još ne znaju.
I have to do it alone	Moram to sama
That is a difficult question.	To je teško pitanje.
I wondered what he was doing there anyway	Pitao sam se šta on tamo uopšte radi
Dude, do what he has to do	Prijatelj, radi ono što je morao
He saw you.	Video te je.
They will find you.	Naći će te.
And with him.	I sa njim.
Not here.	Ne ovde.
It was a good thing.	Bila je to dobra stvar.
I wondered what she was saying	Pitao sam se šta ona govori
You look good.	Izgledaš dobro.
We are never here.	Nikad nismo ovdje.
I saw all this happening	Video sam da se sve ovo dešava
I'll say you were with him.	Reći ću da si bila s njim.
I couldn't tell who he was	Nisam mogao reći ko je on
And really, what could be better than that?	I zaista, šta može biti bolje od toga?
This is not.	Ovo nije.
I never expected her to be here	Nikad nisam očekivao da će ona biti ovdje
We can't help ourselves.	Ne možemo si pomoći.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay	Samo sam htio biti siguran da si dobro
It could have been so.	Moglo je biti tako.
I didn't want anything	Nisam htela ništa
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
I guess we would both	Pretpostavljam da bismo oboje
Not even that.	Ne ni to.
I didn't really do anything	Nisam stvarno ništa uradio
You need to know more.	Morate znati više.
I wanted something from him.	Želeo sam nešto od njega.
It was mine too.	Bio je i moj.
I didn’t expect that to happen	Nisam očekivao da će se to dogoditi
That in itself is not a problem.	To samo po sebi nije problem.
I wondered what he expected	Pitao sam se šta je očekivao
It's not right.	Nije u redu.
I just didn't want to	Jednostavno nisam htela
I never saw him again	Nikad ga više nisam video
I was with him, but I wasn't there	Bio sam s njim, ali nisam bio tamo
I told him something today	Rekao sam mu nešto danas
Not so fast.	Ne baš brzo.
You can't do it alone.	Ne možeš to sam.
It just won’t happen.	To se jednostavno neće dogoditi.
I've already done that.	Već sam to uradio.
I was nothing to you	Nisam bio ništa za tebe
I will be gone from tomorrow.	Neću više biti od sutra.
And she said nothing more.	I ništa više nije rekla.
I didn't know what you expected	Nisam znao šta si očekivao
But we work.	Ali mi radimo.
Or like.	Ili kao.
And he said yes.	I on je rekao da.
It wasn't that.	Nije bilo da.
I wish you would tell me.	Voleo bih da mi kažeš.
Simple and easy.	Jednostavno i jednostavno.
I should talk to you	Ja bih trebao razgovarati s tobom
And she didn't tell me about it.	I nije mi rekla za to.
He was not surprised.	Nije bio iznenađen.
Certainly not this.	Ovo sigurno ne.
I'm not good at it.	Nisam dobar u tome.
I came to see if you were okay	Došao sam da vidim da li si dobro
It was real.	Bilo je stvarno.
I wonder how long we have to stay here	Pitam se koliko dugo moramo ostati ovdje
As always, he is ready for work.	Kao i uvijek, spreman je za posao.
I don't even know.	Čak ni ne znam.
But now they are much better.	Ali sada su mnogo bolji.
But we know better.	Ali mi znamo bolje.
I didn't know why until now	Nisam znao zašto do sada
Nothing, probably.	Ništa, vjerovatno.
And she knew what she wanted to look like.	I znala je kako želi da izgleda.
I have to be home for dinner	Moram biti kući na večeru
Live your life.	Živi svoj život.
And we are not alone.	I nismo sami.
It shouldn't work.	Ne bi trebalo da radi.
It never works.	To nikad ne radi.
I knew he was telling the truth	Znao sam da govori istinu
He knew a lot of things.	Znao je dosta stvari.
So it can't be that bad.	Tako da ne može biti tako loše.
They are always with us.	Oni su uvek sa nama.
But I came back.	Ali, vratio sam se.
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to tačno.
This must be a lot for you.	Ovo mora da je mnogo za vas.
I want to tell you something	Želim ti nešto reći
But she knew the truth.	Ali znala je istinu.
I thought you'd like to know	Mislio sam da bi voleo da znaš
I wanted that.	Ja sam to želeo.
We will come next year.	Doći ćemo sljedeće godine.
I thought that was obvious	Mislio sam da je to očigledno
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
He's too busy right now.	Trenutno je previše zauzet.
But it happens.	Ali, to se dešava.
But he didn't just ask.	Ali nije samo pitao.
I immediately understood what he meant	Odmah sam shvatio na šta je mislio
I won't tell you where they are.	Neću vam reći gdje su.
And he meant it at the time.	I mislio je to u to vrijeme.
And did something else.	I uradio još nešto.
I needed something really fast	Trebalo mi je nešto jako brzo
It's been a few years.	To je nekoliko godina.
I think more than anyone in the house	Mislim više od bilo koga u kući
He never asked.	Nikada nije pitao.
I would know.	Ja bih znao.
I know better than that.	Znam bolje od toga.
I'm pretty sure more will be bought.	Prilično sam siguran da će se kupiti više.
It won't be.	Neće biti.
I've never seen this	Nikada nisam vidio ovo
It's not about that.	Ne radi se o tome.
I can't do these things alone	Ne mogu sam da radim ove stvari
They were the first to be here.	Oni su prvi bili ovdje.
That is not a problem now.	To sada nije problem.
I should have done something earlier, anything	Trebalo je da uradim nešto ranije, bilo šta
But it was a better time.	Ali to je bilo bolje vrijeme.
I came to say just that	Došao sam da kažem samo to
I very much doubt it.	Veoma sumnjam.
I'd like to tell him that.	Voleo bih da mu to kažem.
It was pretty simple.	Bilo je prilično jednostavno.
I thought so.	Mislio sam da jeste.
I was first with him	Bio sam prvi sa njim
I never wanted her to know	Nikada nisam želeo da ona zna
I need to know what's going on	Moram da znam šta se dešava
It happens.	Dešava se.
I prefer that	Ja to više volim
I know my father would never do such a thing	Znam da moj otac nikada ne bi uradio tako nešto
Yes, he really said that.	Da, zaista je to rekao.
I asked him about it	Pitao sam ga o tome
I knew it was true	Znao sam da je to istina
But that was not a problem.	Ali to nije bio problem.
Either way.	Na bilo koji način.
Do what you want, it's okay.	Radi šta hoćeš, u redu je.
No, she didn't want to.	Ne, nije htela.
I just don't think so	Ja jednostavno ne mislim tako
People will come.	Ljudi će doći.
That's how it was and she knows it.	Tako je bilo i ona to zna.
I knew he would leave	Znao sam da će otići
Maybe not.	Možda nije tako.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
I wonder what's wrong	Pitam se šta nije u redu
I mean, they could, anytime.	Mislim, mogli bi, bilo kada.
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam učinio ništa loše
It will probably happen.	Vjerovatno će se to dogoditi.
I always wondered what was wrong with me	Uvijek sam se pitao šta nije u redu sa mnom
There was a lot of money.	Bilo je puno novca.
The thing is.	Stvar je u tome.
I didn't see anything about what was true about him.	Nisam video ništa o tome šta je tačno s njim.
I couldn't think of a better way to say it.	Nisam mogao naći bolji način da to kažem.
I was sorry for him	Bilo mi je žao zbog njega
Probably not.	Vjerovatno ne bi.
I won't say anything about us	Neću ništa reći o nama
I didn't have one for him	Nisam imao za njega
I shouldn't say that	Ne bih to trebao tako reći
He’s gone, and we don’t know more than that.	Otišao je, a mi ne znamo više od toga.
I needed to see what he would do	Trebalo je da vidim šta će uraditi
You don't like it.	Ne sviđa ti se.
Someone has to do something with him now.	Neko sada mora nešto da uradi sa njim.
He is happy.	On je sretan.
I have to go back	Moram se vratiti
More time than we need, really.	Više vremena nego što nam treba, zaista.
I would wonder what else he is doing	Pitao bih se šta još radi
I was never good at it	Nikada nisam bio dobar u tome
I wonder if anyone knows if that is so.	Pitam se da li neko zna da li je to tako.
I no longer knew what to say or do	Više nisam znao šta da kažem ili uradim
Probably never was.	Vjerovatno nikad nije bilo.
I have never seen this problem before.	Nikada prije nisam vidio ovaj problem.
I didn't mean anything like that.	Nisam mislio ništa tako.
I wasn't	Nisam bio
They should be something.	Oni bi trebali biti nešto.
I just know she's good at it	Samo znam da je dobra u tome
And she wouldn't be here.	A ona ne bi ovdje.
And now she's gone.	A sada je nema.
We know what we need to do.	Znamo šta treba da radimo.
I was both alone and alone.	Bio sam i sam i sam.
No problem.	Nema problema.
He's not here right now.	On trenutno nije ovdje.
Or maybe too much.	Ili možda previše.
A lot may not happen.	Mnogo toga se možda neće dogoditi.
He wanted me there.	Želio me je tamo.
But even that didn't seem to be enough.	Ali činilo se da ni to nije dovoljno.
I couldn’t believe it when they told me.	Nisam mogao vjerovati kada su mi rekli.
I can't believe he didn't see me	Ne mogu vjerovati da me nije vidio
Who knows what might help.	Ko zna šta bi moglo pomoći.
But it was that simple	Ali bilo je tako jednostavno
Still bad, but not so bad.	Još uvijek loše, ali ne baš tako loše.
I never want to leave!	Nikad ne želim otići!
But now is the day.	Ali sada je dan.
I had nothing better to do	Nisam imao ništa bolje da radim
To work.	Na posao.
And only there.	I samo tamo.
I'm happy.	Ja sam sretan.
But this is not happening.	Ali ovo se ne dešava.
More than ever will, perhaps.	Više nego što će ikada više, možda.
What used to be easy is hard now.	Ono što je nekada bilo lako sada je teško.
He knows about me.	On zna za mene.
Let's work together.	Da radimo zajedno.
I said that.	Rekao sam to.
He decided.	Odlučio se.
There were people here.	Bilo je ljudi ovdje.
You can't know how it is.	Ne možeš znati kako je.
Nobody wants that !.	Niko to ne želi!.
Maybe not.	Možda i nisu.
I need help.	Treba mi pomoć.
I wish he had just given it to me	Voleo bih da mi ga je upravo dao
I do this from time to time	Radim to s vremena na vrijeme
We know what we're doing.	Znamo šta radimo.
If it's as bad as last week, she is.	Ako bude tako loše kao prošle sedmice, ona.
I didn't want him to do that	Nisam htela da to uradi
You couldn't tell.	Nisi mogao reći.
It took him a few days.	Trebalo mu je nekoliko dana.
That's for you.	To je za tebe.
I preferred this one	Više sam volio ovaj
I could do that much.	Mogao bih toliko.
I didn't mean anything	Nisam ništa mislio
I knew this one would get me.	Znao sam da će me ovaj dobiti.
I still love him.	I dalje ga volim.
You can't bring him back when he's gone.	Ne možete ga vratiti kada ga više nema.
He didn't try.	Nije pokušao.
I was a little like you	Bio sam pomalo kao ti
I thought he was in the house	Mislio sam da je u kući
I wondered what had happened to him	Pitao sam se šta mu se dogodilo
I mean, they're still there	Mislim, još uvijek su tamo
He was a good guy.	Bio je dobar momak.
Tell me what you don't know.	Reci mi šta ne znaš.
Nobody says anything about that	O tome niko ništa ne govori
You won't be sorry.	Neće vam biti žao.
I didn't mean anything	Nisam ništa mislio
It could only be a few days.	Moglo bi biti samo nekoliko dana.
I'm sure you can do it	Siguran sam da ti to možeš
He heard everything you said so far today.	Čuo je sve što ste do sada rekli danas.
And that's a good job.	I to je dobar posao.
I had to come see you	Morao sam doći da te vidim
I often wouldn't.	Često ne bi.
I'll stay here.	Ja ću ostati ovdje.
I've never seen them before.	Nikad ih prije nisam vidio.
He wondered if she would ever be what she was.	Pitao se hoće li ikada biti ono što je bila.
He had no idea where that man lived.	Nije imao pojma gdje taj čovjek živi.
It's not.	Nije.
I asked him for a while	Pitao sam ga za neko vrijeme
He couldn't do anything good.	Nije mogao ništa dobro da uradi.
He feels better.	Osjeća se bolje.
Which did not come.	Koji nije došao.
I know you have something to say	Znam da imaš nešto da kažeš
He would never say if it was good or bad.	Nikad ne bi rekao da li je to dobro ili loše.
I shouldn't have left	Nisam trebao otići
I think we all would	Mislim da bismo svi
I did this to you.	Ja sam ti ovo uradio.
And maybe that's a good thing.	A možda je to i dobro.
Please tell me what you can do.	Molim te, reci mi šta možeš.
I know, but the question is why	Znam, ali pitanje je zašto
I decided it might be both	Odlučio sam da je možda oboje
Tell me there's a better way.	Reci mi da postoji bolji način.
They won't even see me.	Neće me ni vidjeti.
He was who he was now.	Bio je to ko je sada bio.
We don't do that anymore.	To više ne radimo.
I hope you like it here	Nadam se da vam se sviđa ovdje
For now, it cannot be done.	Za sada, to se ne može uraditi.
That is not what will really happen.	To nije ono što će se zaista dogoditi.
I hope we do the right thing, that's all	Nadam se da radimo pravu stvar, to je sve
You work like you don't need money.	Radite kao da vam ne treba novac.
He got it all by himself.	Sve je dobio sam.
They were always there.	Uvek su bili tu.
I have to work as usual	Moram da radim kao i obično
He knew he would never see it again.	Znao je da to više nikada neće vidjeti.
I wondered what was going on	Pitao sam se šta se dešava
They never are.	Nikad nisu.
I'm not doing anything to you	Ne radim ti ništa
I don’t want to do it that way.	Ne želim to da uradim na taj način.
I want to go home as much as you do	Želim ići kući koliko i ti
Everything we can find.	Sve što možemo naći.
Or a thing.	Ili stvar.
That's what it looks like.	Tako to izgleda.
I was the one who said it	Ja sam bio taj koji je rekla
He's gone and he's never coming back.	Otišao je i nikada se neće vratiti.
He must have gotten them that way.	Mora da ih je tako dobio.
And it's probably true.	I vjerovatno je istina.
It might even help.	Možda čak i pomogne.
They really did it.	Zaista su to uradili.
I could help you, you know	Mogao bih ti pomoći, znaš
I have no idea how to do that.	Nemam pojma kako to da uradim.
I know how much he wants it	Znam koliko on to želi
I could see you.	Mogao sam da te vidim.
He left quickly.	Otišao je brzo.
I can not see anything	Ne vidim ništa
We have a lot to do here.	Moramo dosta toga uraditi ovdje.
I know it’s not enough to just be there.	Znam da nije dovoljno samo biti tamo.
It's just good.	Jednostavno je dobro.
I wasn't sure what to say	Nisam bio siguran šta da kažem
I knew it wouldn't be	Znao sam da neće biti
I want to talk to him	Želim razgovarati s njim
There is something wrong with him.	Nešto nije u redu s njim.
He didn't finish his job.	Nije završio svoj posao.
I wish he was here now	Voleo bih da je sada ovde
They are always there.	Uvek ih ima tamo.
And no one really knows how it happens.	A kako se to dešava, niko zapravo ne zna.
I can't do without you	Ne mogu bez tebe
Yes, this could be done.	Da, ovo bi se moglo uraditi.
I was just his friend	Bio sam mu samo prijatelj
I have to stay here with you	Moram ostati ovdje sa tobom
I can't do all this alone	Ne mogu sve ovo sam
He never did.	Nikad nije.
I know it is.	Znam da jeste.
I probably won't be able to stay long	Vjerovatno neću moći dugo ostati
And they are.	I oni su.
I'll be quick.	Brzo ću.
He's just.	On je samo.
This is a job.	Ovo je posao.
I'm afraid there's a lot more	Bojim se da ima još mnogo toga
I asked her to come with me to help	Zamolio sam je da dođe sa mnom da pomogne
There was nothing he could do.	Nije mogao ništa da uradi.
I know what she thinks	Znam šta ona misli
The truth is that no one knows.	Istina je da niko ne zna.
There weren't many people to see.	Nije bilo mnogo ljudi da se vidi.
But he himself knew nothing about it.	Ali on sam nije znao ništa o tome.
I didn't know what, but something was wrong	Nisam znao šta, ali tu nešto nije bilo kako treba
That's not the way.	To nije način.
I was sure it had happened	Bio sam siguran da se to dogodilo
Yes very well.	Da veoma dobro.
He works a lot.	On puno radi.
He wanted more, and she probably didn’t.	On je želio više, a ona vjerovatno nije.
I wasn't ready to do that yet	Nisam još bio spreman da to uradim
And he did this.	I ovo je uradio.
I knew he never would.	Znao sam da nikad neće.
But it looks really good.	Ali izgleda stvarno dobro.
I want to know you'll be back	Želim da znam da ćeš se vratiti
But there was no time.	Ali nije bilo vrijeme.
I am the only self that exists.	Ja sam jedini ja koji postoji.
Anyone but me.	Bilo ko osim mene.
I just thought.	Samo sam mislio.
I wasn't even thirty yet.	Nisam još imao ni trideset.
He does it a lot tonight.	On to radi mnogo večeras.
I wonder what's going on with him	Pitam se šta se dešava sa njim
But no one had anything bad to say.	Ali niko nije imao ništa loše da kaže.
I didn't even tell you about it	Nisam ti ni rekao o tome
You could work.	Mogao bi da radiš.
Besides, he didn't like being told what to do.	Osim toga, nije volio da mu se govori šta da radi.
And that has been a problem so far.	I to je bio problem do sada.
And everyone knew it.	I svi su to znali.
I wondered what he said	Pitao sam se šta je rekao
That cannot be done.	To se ne može uraditi.
But you didn't.	Ali nisi.
I really didn't do anything wrong	Zaista nisam radio ništa loše
But in fact, you are right.	Ali u stvari, u pravu ste.
I had to tell you	Morao sam da ti kažem
Except she wasn't.	Osim što nije bila.
I know you like it.	Znam da ti se sviđa.
I know this won't be a problem.	Znam da ovo neće biti problem.
It's a few, but good	Nekoliko je, ali dobro
Maybe he knew.	Možda je znao.
Or when he was, what was.	Ili kada je on, šta je bilo.
I never said that.	Nikad to nisam rekao.
Probably too much.	Vjerovatno previše.
In fact, we can see that happening today.	Zapravo, možemo vidjeti da se to dešava danas.
I mean, you know.	Mislim, znaš.
This is neither here nor there.	Ovo nije ni ovdje ni tamo.
Nobody can do anything.	Niko ništa ne može da uradi.
I couldn't do without you.	Ne bih mogao bez tebe.
And he will be with us.	I on će biti sa nama.
I see something there	Vidim nešto tamo
I have an appointment with him.	Imam sastanak sa njim.
I did a good job too	I ja sam uradio dobar posao
I have to say it was good.	Moram reći da je bilo dobro.
He will know what to do.	On će znati šta da radi.
We'll find you something to do.	Naći ćemo vam nešto da radite.
He is no longer here.	Sada više nije ovdje.
It can't be helped.	Ne može se pomoći.
I didn't want that at all	Nisam to uopšte želeo
I do not have time for that	Nemam vremena za to
I wonder when that will be.	Pitam se kada će to biti.
They are for you.	Oni su za vas.
We should work together	Trebalo bi da radimo zajedno
It must be so.	Mora biti tako.
And that's the real me.	I to sam pravi ja.
He was looking for me.	Tražio me je.
I think that's all we can do tonight	Mislim da je to sve što možemo večeras
She never said when she would return.	Nikad nije rekla kada će se vratiti.
I didn't even make it	Nisam ni stigao
I'm so happy you're back.	Tako sam sretan što si se vratio.
I hope to get it soon	Nadam se da ću ga uskoro dobiti
You'll be able to go home.	Moći ćeš ići kući.
I thought you had it	Mislio sam da ga imaš
I know what he told you	Znam šta ti je rekao
I can do it alone for a while	Neko vrijeme mogu sam
He seems to be the only one.	Izgleda da je on jedini.
It was still me, but not really	I dalje sam bio ja, ali ne baš
I didn't know how he felt	Nisam znala kako se osjeća
Maybe something happened.	Možda se nešto dogodilo.
He will never do that.	On to nikada neće uraditi.
I can't, I can't, I can't	Ne mogu, ne mogu, ne mogu
I know you want me to be happy	Znam da želiš da budem sretan
I have no idea why he's here	Nemam pojma zašto je ovdje
I would never be allowed to	Nikad mi ne bi bilo dozvoljeno
You really aren't like her.	Ti zaista nisi kao ona.
This one is mine.	Ovaj je moj.
There was no help.	Nije se moglo pomoći.
She is really scared.	Ona se zaista boji.
But in a good way.	Ali na dobar način.
I couldn’t believe this was happening	Nisam mogao vjerovati da se ovo dešava
She has to.	Ona mora.
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno si u pravu.
I heard a.	Čuo sam a.
They were people.	Bili su ljudi.
As you must know.	Kao što morate znati.
Something needs to be done.	Nešto treba učiniti.
I know this is it.	Znam da je ovo.
Do not speak!.	Ne govori!.
It wasn't hard.	Nije bilo teško.
Probably still the case.	Vjerovatno je još uvijek tako.
They told the truth.	Rekli su istinu.
I do not see anything wrong with it.	Ne vidim ništa loše u tome.
I know you didn't mean me	Znam da nisi mislio na mene
The problem is who to buy.	Problem je koga kupiti.
It really has to be.	To zaista mora biti.
He had money.	Imao je novac.
I want him to feel like he's doing well	Želim da se osjeća kao da mu ide dobro
If there.	Ako ima.
I want to know more here	Želim znati više ovdje
I think we can help you	Mislim da ti možemo pomoći
I never saw them again.	Nikad ih više nisam video.
I'm here.	Ovdje sam.
But no one knew much.	Ali niko nije znao mnogo.
Now he has done it.	Sada je to uradio.
I just need more time	Samo mi treba više vremena
There is only one.	Postoji samo jedan.
I wondered if you saw her.	Pitao sam se da li si je video.
That you could see each other that week.	Da ste se mogli vidjeti te sedmice.
I should probably go to school	Verovatno bi trebalo da idem u školu
He didn't want that.	To nije želio.
I still didn't know what to do	I dalje nisam znao šta da radim
Yes that is correct.	Da, to je tačno.
I was looking for them all	Sve sam ih tražio
Only.	Samo.
I doubt that's true.	Sumnjam da je to istina.
He was gone for three years.	Nije ga bilo tri godine.
She says she is.	Ona kaže da jeste.
Now I can do it alone	Sada to mogu sam
Very good person.	Vrlo dobra osoba.
You know something.	Znaš nešto.
I like that about you, yes	Sviđa mi se to kod tebe, da
I won't say more now	Neću više reći sada
No one was there.	Niko nije bio tamo.
Everything is known here.	Ovdje se sve zna.
I like what you can buy	Sviđa mi se što možete kupiti
I have so much to do, and so little time	Imam toliko toga da uradim, a tako malo vremena
It was obvious to him now that she didn't know.	Sada mu je bilo očigledno da ona ne zna.
time.	vrijeme.
I haven't done that in a long time	Nisam to radio dugo vremena
You have something good.	Imaš nešto dobro.
I hope you get better soon	Nadam se da ćeš uskoro biti bolje
We need to talk about it.	Moramo razgovarati o tome.
I can never go back there	Nikad se ne mogu vratiti tamo
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
He didn't know where we were.	Nije znao gdje smo.
I know the way we can do that	Znam način na koji to možemo učiniti
But I'm not sure how to do it.	Ali nisam siguran kako da to uradim.
She wanted to.	Htela je.
Maybe he's right.	Možda je u pravu.
I have to bring her home.	Moram je vratiti kući.
She knew everything.	Znala je sve.
I got that from you.	To sam dobio od tebe.
.	.
I know it's for me.	Znam da je za mene.
That's exactly what you're doing.	Upravo to radite.
I know why he had to leave	Znam zašto je morao da ode
I had it too.	I ja sam ga imao.
I thought everyone knew that.	Mislio sam da svi to znaju.
I could do it myself	Mogao bih i sam
I never did anything wrong	Nikada nisam uradio ništa loše
Looks like he won't be coming.	Čini se da neće doći.
He said that.	On je to rekao.
But he heard nothing about it.	Ali on ništa nije čuo o tome.
I hope you find something that works	Nadam se da ćeš naći nešto što radi
They wouldn't say more.	Ne bi rekli više.
It doesn't wait.	To ne čeka.
I just want to be sure	Samo želim da budem siguran
Or maybe she just knew.	Ili je možda samo znala.
I want people to know about me.	Želim da ljudi znaju za mene.
He will find his way home.	Naći će put kući.
And how often.	I koliko često.
He won't tell you.	Neće ti reći.
Tonight is for us.	Večeras je za nas.
That was simply not true.	To jednostavno nije bila istina.
I think there was a little bit of that.	Mislim da je bilo malo toga.
It's just you.	Ti si samo.
I'm not done yet	Nisam još završio
I can't tell you about that	Ne mogu vam reći o tome
It certainly is.	Sigurno jeste.
He wondered if that was the case.	Pitao se da li je tako.
What he knows.	Šta on zna.
I love him now	Volim ga odmah
I said too much.	Rekao sam previše.
I just wouldn't be a good friend of yours	Jednostavno ti ne bih bio dobar prijatelj
I've never had a problem	Nikad nisam imao problema
I should probably go back	Verovatno bih se trebao vratiti
I know you have it.	Znam da ga imaš.
Was.	Bilo je.
And good.	I dobar.
But he wanted to do more.	Ali želio je učiniti više.
They will not be able to do it alone.	Oni to neće moći sami.
I'm very busy.	Veoma sam zauzet.
You tell me what to do.	Ti mi reci šta da radim.
And this one.	I ovaj.
I was there when it happened	Bio sam tamo kada se to dogodilo
Now tell me the truth.	Sada mi reci istinu.
I hope it will be good	Nadam se da će biti dobro
But that is not so.	Ali to nije baš tako.
I think we have	Mislim da imamo
I didn't want to do this	Nisam htela ovo da uradim
I can't do this to you	Ne mogu ti to učiniti
I thought you could.	Mislio sam da si mogao.
I know this can't be right	Znam da ovo ne može biti u redu
But that is of no help to us now.	Ali to nam sada nije od pomoći.
But he didn't want to stay there.	Ali nije želio ostati tamo.
That was not good.	To nije bilo dobro.
If they don't, you won't.	Ako oni neće, nećeš ti.
But now we have to buy it.	Ali sada ga moramo kupiti.
I heard this a few years ago	Čuo sam ovo prije nekoliko godina
I probably won't be back.	Verovatno se neću vratiti.
I think it took time	Mislim da je trebalo vremena
I didn't know why at the time	U to vrijeme nisam znao zašto
But he did not return.	Ali nije se vratio.
But this.	Ali ovo.
And where she was now.	I gdje je sada bila.
I wish it didn't work.	Voleo bih da to ne radi.
That was not good for us.	To nije bilo dobro za nas.
You don't like it.	Ne sviđa ti se.
There seems to be little to it.	Čini se da je malo za to.
I just want to know the truth	Samo želim da znam istinu
He knows more.	On zna više.
It doesn't seem to work.	Ne izgleda kao da radi.
But she didn't know it.	Ali ona to nije znala.
I'm much better than that	Ja sam mnogo bolji od toga
This was now.	Ovo je bilo sada.
She is not the only one.	Ona nije jedina.
I wanted him to love me.	Htela sam da me voli.
Not now.	Ne sada.
I think you could have done better	Mislim da si mogao bolje
I won't talk much about it here.	Neću puno o tome ovdje.
I was happy to see him.	Bio sam sretan što sam ga vidio.
I didn't want to think about what he saw	Nisam htela da mislim na ono što je video
There is nothing we can do about it now.	Sada tu ništa ne možemo učiniti.
I really have no idea	Zaista nemam pojma
I can do something she can't	Mogu da uradim nešto što ona ne može
and all that.	i sve to.
I haven't had this in so long	Nisam ovo imao tako dugo
It would be simple, really.	Bilo bi jednostavno, zaista.
And more than that really.	I više od toga zaista.
I know how she feels, she told herself.	Znam kako se osjeća, rekla je sebi.
I know that better than anyone	Znam to bolje od bilo koga
I actually finished it	Zapravo sam ga završio
I didn't know what he meant	Nisam znao šta je mislio
Live as you do.	Živi kao što radiš.
Tell me more about yourself.	Reci mi više o sebi.
Maybe someone is not doing their job properly.	Možda neko ne radi svoj posao kako treba.
Or live here.	Ili živi ovdje.
I love you, you say.	Volim te, kažeš.
I just can't do it alone	Jednostavno ne mogu sama
They are not here.	Oni nisu ovde.
He was.	On je bio.
Like them, he didn't look so good.	Kao i oni, nije izgledao tako dobro.
If we can please.	Ako možemo molim vas.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
And he will.	I hoće.
It was helpful.	Bilo je od pomoći.
So that's fine.	Tako da je u redu.
I don't think any of us can.	Mislim da niko od nas ne može.
I never want to see them again	Nikada ih više ne želim vidjeti
And it won't be good.	I neće biti dobro.
I love those things.	Volim te stvari.
I didn't say more	Nisam više rekao
Just do what you have to do.	Samo radi ono što moraš.
I went to see him last night	Otišao sam da ga vidim sinoć
And he was good.	I bio je dobar.
I didn't want to see anything	Nisam htela ništa da vidim
But he's not here.	Ali nije ovde.
In fact, he didn't hear.	Zapravo, nije čuo.
That's what they told me.	To su mi rekli.
I shouldn't be here	Ne bih trebao biti ovdje
Your friend is completely safe.	Tvoj prijatelj je potpuno siguran.
I can't say yet, but for now, this looks good.	Ne mogu još reći, ali za sada, ovo izgleda dobro.
I can't say much more than that now	Ne mogu sada reći mnogo više od toga
I want to, but not here	Želim, ali ne ovdje
It seemed like years.	Činilo se kao godine.
And that's the thing.	I to je stvar.
I can do it, he told himself	Ja to mogu, rekao je sebi
That's what we do.	To je ono što mi radimo.
It's simple.	Jednostavno je.
It was a difficult time for us.	Bilo je to teško vrijeme za nas.
I would really love you there	Stvarno bih te volio tamo
I shouldn't do this	Ne bih trebao ovo da radim
I couldn't believe you did that	Nisam mogao vjerovati da si to uradio
I know he's not telling us anything	Znam da nam nešto ne govori
I didn't think of anything more than that	Nisam mislio ni na šta više od toga
I couldn’t find much about it	Nisam mogao naći mnogo o tome
I'm not sure where.	Nisam siguran gdje.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
I can't say more.	Ne mogu reći više.
You didn't ask for this, none of that.	Nisi tražio ovo, ništa od toga.
It just happened.	Jednostavno se dogodilo.
Maybe she knows something.	Možda ona zna nešto.
And we will do it.	I mi ćemo to uraditi.
Really, really easy.	Zaista, stvarno lako.
You never know what you don't know.	Nikad ne znaš šta ne znaš.
Not to be sure.	Da ne budem siguran.
I mean, really good money	Mislim, stvarno dobar novac
I'll tell you what to do.	Reći ću ti šta da radiš.
He plays the right way.	On igra na pravi način.
We were here.	Bili smo ovde.
This is really so.	Ovo je zaista tako.
Really not so much.	Zaista ne toliko.
I can buy you some time	Mogu ti kupiti malo vremena
That is what is actually happening.	To je ono što se zapravo dešava.
I just never see him	Samo ga nikad ne vidim
Now I was sure of it.	Sada sam bio siguran u to.
I wanted to love him.	Htela sam da ga volim.
Maybe he could.	Možda bi mogao.
I think that's it for me	Mislim da je to to za mene
I just wanted to see what would happen	Samo sam htio vidjeti šta će se dogoditi
I want you to do this right	Želim da ovo uradiš kako treba
I need more than that	Moram više od toga
I don't know how to say that.	Ne znam kako da to kažem.
Maybe I won't be.	Možda neću biti.
Maybe you can stay for a while longer.	Možda možete ostati još neko vrijeme.
I just want more from you	Samo želim više od tebe
I had to do it myself.	Morao sam to sam.
This is probably not what you want.	Ovo vjerovatno nije ono što želite.
He was a very good friend of mine.	Bio mi je veoma dobar prijatelj.
I won't be here long	Ovdje neću dugo
That's it, and much more.	To je to, i mnogo više.
He makes it look so easy.	On čini da izgleda tako lako.
He was just doing his job.	Samo je radio svoj posao.
Because of me.	Zbog mene.
I haven't been there in over thirty years	Nisam bio tamo više od trideset godina
I would be that for you	Ja bih to bio za tebe
And don't say 'we'.	I ne reci 'mi'.
I tried it for the first time	Pokušao sam prvi put s njim
I wouldn't have a problem with that.	Ne bih imao problema sa tim.
A little, but not so much.	Malo, ali ne toliko.
We were not us.	Mi nismo bili mi.
I have one too.	I ja imam jedan.
I mean, all this seems too easy	Mislim, sve ovo izgleda previše lako
He's too good.	Previše je dobar.
There is not enough time.	Nema dovoljno vremena.
I came to do it.	Došao sam da to uradim.
I can give you anything, anything	Mogu ti dati bilo šta, bilo šta
I wouldn't be a lot of things.	Ne bih bio puno stvari.
One was thirty.	Jedan je imao trideset.
Everything is going well with me.	Sve ide dobro sa mnom.
I certainly never would	Ja sigurno nikad ne bih
It works as before.	Radi kao i prije.
I hope he comes to his senses soon	Nadam se da će uskoro doći sebi
I have a lot of friends there	Imam puno prijatelja tamo
I never want to see them again.	Nikada ih više ne želim vidjeti.
I never want to be alone	Nikad ne želim da budem sama
It obviously doesn't work.	Očigledno ne radi.
He's not really there, she told herself.	On zapravo nije tamo, rekla je sebi.
I don't know exactly why that would be.	Ne znam tačno zašto bi to bilo.
We had a pretty good time.	Bilo nam je prilično dobro.
I brought you back to life	Vratio sam te u život
I saw it too.	I ja sam to vidio.
We just know what they did.	Samo znamo šta su uradili.
We can do it again.	Možemo ponovo.
I don't know how he could have done this	Ne znam kako je mogao ovo da uradi
It could help.	Moglo bi pomoći.
I know what she's doing	Znam šta ona radi
Only with you.	Samo s tobom.
Actually, it's true.	U stvari, istina je.
I hope it's good.	Nadam se da je dobro.
Please don't.	Molim te nemoj.
Even more than me.	Čak i više nego ja.
I didn't even hear what he said	Nisam ni čuo šta je rekao
He couldn't be.	Nije mogao biti.
It never was.	Nikada nije bilo.
I can trust him.	Mogu mu vjerovati.
Maybe a little more.	Možda još malo.
Not anywhere.	Ne bilo gdje.
What they had now was good for both of them.	Ono što su sada imali, bilo je dobro za oboje.
I thought he was saying that.	Mislio sam da to govori.
It's just a story.	To je samo priča.
I was ready to do my best	Bio sam spreman dati sve od sebe
I wouldn't want that anymore	Ne bih to više želio
Much better without it.	Mnogo bolje bez toga.
You can't win.	Ne možete pobijediti.
Everything you needed to know was already there.	Sve što ste trebali znati je već bilo tamo.
I still want a job	Još uvijek želim posao
It just seems like something needs to be done.	Samo izgleda kao da bi trebalo nešto učiniti.
They would be.	Bili bi.
I thought he would say no, but he said yes.	Mislio sam da će reći ne, ali on je rekao da.
I was sure it was	Bio sam siguran da je to bilo
That would make me feel better.	Tako bi mi bilo bolje.
I would say that too.	I ja bih to rekao.
In fact, pretty good.	U stvari, prilično dobro.
I think that's all we can do	Mislim da je to sve što možemo
A little here, a little there	Malo ovde, malo tamo
I could work with that	Mogao sam raditi s tim
Or maybe not.	Ili možda neće.
But he's here.	Ali on je ovdje.
I never saw her again	Više je nisam video
He lives a few doors away.	Živi nekoliko vrata dalje.
I'm not him.	Ja ne on.
Maybe you can tell me.	Možda ćeš mi moći reći.
I wish we could talk	Voleo bih da možemo razgovarati
And he's sorry.	I žao mu je.
I wish I was that	Voleo bih da sam to
A matter of time	Pitanje vremena
It simply isn't.	Jednostavno, nije.
He was fine.	Bio je u redu.
He worked on it.	Radio je na tome.
We couldn't believe it.	Nismo mogli vjerovati.
We'll find her.	Naći ćemo je.
Even more than last year.	Čak i više nego prošle godine.
That's the question.	To je pitanje.
I couldn't do it alone	Ne bih to mogao sam
Just a little.	Samo malo.
There is much more.	Ima još mnogo toga.
I wish he wasn't there	Voleo bih da nije tamo
I'm so happy to see you	Tako sam sretan što te vidim
I can not now.	Ne mogu sada.
That was very real.	To je bilo vrlo stvarno.
They didn't say no.	Nisu rekli ne.
I never do, not really.	Nikad ne radim, ne baš.
I see it.	Vidim to.
Not in the way he meant it.	Ne na način na koji je to mislio.
Everything for work.	Sve za posao.
I just want to love you	Ja jednostavno želim da te volim
It's one thing.	Jedan je to.
Maybe you think so.	Možda tako mislite.
But he will be without things for a while.	Ali on će neko vrijeme biti bez stvari.
Maybe I'll do it too.	Možda ću i ja to učiniti.
Not really.	Ne stvarno.
There was so little.	Bilo je tako malo toga.
He loves his new life.	On voli svoj novi život.
He said he loves us all.	Rekao je da nas sve voli.
It has never been like that.	Nikada nije bilo tako.
What could be the problem.	Šta može biti problem.
It was more than good.	Bilo je više nego dobro.
she said.	ona je rekla.
Not for long now.	Sada ne dugo.
I never wanted to go back	Nikada se nisam htio vratiti
Nobody knows what they are.	Niko ne zna šta su oni.
And I want to know everything	I ja želim sve da znam
She can give him as much money as she wants.	Može mu dati novca koliko želi.
You are one.	Ti si jedan.
I knew right away what was wrong	Odmah sam znao šta nije u redu
I didn't do anything either	Ni ja nisam ništa uradio
There wasn't much.	Nije bilo puno toga.
Which is exactly what happened.	Što se upravo i dogodilo.
I wish it was that easy	Voleo bih da je tako lako
I asked him what he was doing there	Pitao sam ga šta radi tamo
I loved them both	Voleo sam ih oboje
Not good enough today.	Danas nije dovoljno dobro.
All that stuff.	Sve te stvari.
I don't think she wanted to go	Mislim da nije htela da ide
I didn't mean to tell you	Nisam htela da ti ne kažem
I know exactly what you mean	Znam tačno na šta misliš
I had a little, but it wasn’t enough	Imao sam malo, ali nije bilo dovoljno
He never thought she would really do that.	Nikad nije mislio da će ona to zaista učiniti.
I knew you would do it again	Znao sam da ćeš to učiniti ponovo
Nice to meet you friends.	Drago mi je zbog prijatelja.
I was not allowed to go	Nije mi bilo dozvoljeno da idem
They are for him.	Oni su za njega.
I mean, he wanted to know why	Mislim, htio je znati zašto
Just, really.	Samo, stvarno.
I told him what it was.	Rekao sam mu šta je to bilo.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikome nije rekao.
She told herself that.	Rekla je to sebi.
But the time was not now.	Ali vrijeme nije bilo sada.
He was so happy.	Bio je tako sretan.
And there is a reason for that.	I postoji razlog za to.
I haven't seen them together, but you did	Nisam ih vidio zajedno, ali ti jesi
She plays three more.	Ona igra još tri.
I would like to know if it will be better	Voleo bih da znam da li će biti bolje
I won't be able to see anything	Neću moći ništa vidjeti
I still wasn’t sure this was a good idea	Još uvijek nisam bio siguran da je ovo dobra ideja
The only thing to do.	Jedina stvar koju treba uraditi.
I tried to help him, but he wouldn't	Pokušao sam mu pomoći, ali nije htio
You never have to give me a reason.	Nikad mi ne moraš dati razlog.
I couldn't believe it, and neither could she	Nisam mogao vjerovati, a ni ona
No one seemed to.	Činilo se da niko nije.
I'm glad for that.	Drago mi je zbog toga.
It took a while, but it happened.	Trebalo je neko vrijeme, ali to se dogodilo.
I think we could do this	Mislim da bismo mogli ovo da uradimo
This is usually not true.	Obično to nije tačno.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow.	Možda ne danas, možda ne sutra.
Actually, he didn't do that.	U stvari, on to nije uradio.
So far so good, this works.	Za sada dobro, ovo radi.
That's it.	To je ono.
I had to see him again	Morao sam da ga ponovo vidim
Lots of people love this.	Mnogo ljudi voli ovo.
He's still talking.	On i dalje priča.
I asked them to know what it was	Pitao sam da znaju šta je to
I know you wanted to talk	Znam da si htio razgovarati
This looks like now.	Ovo ti izgleda kao sada.
But do it your way.	Ali uradi to na svoj način.
I heard about this.	Čuo sam za ovo.
That would be something.	To bi bilo nešto.
Not so good.	Ne tako dobro.
It never, never, never did.	Nikad, nikad, nikad nije.
He didn't want to leave.	Nije želio otići.
But he is there.	Ali on je tamo.
But maybe that was a good thing.	Ali možda je to bila dobra stvar.
Yes, it is true.	Da, istina je.
I had to be ready.	Morao sam biti spreman.
I would love that.	Voleo bih to.
I'm just not sure about this	Samo nisam siguran za ovo
I will definitely do it	Ja ću to sigurno učiniti
Yes that is correct.	Da, to je tačno.
Yes he can.	Da može.
We like it that way too.	I nama se tako sviđa.
And there is time.	I ima vremena.
I knew he was gone, but you didn't say that	Znao sam da je otišao, ali ti to nisi rekao
I almost didn't.	Skoro da nisam.
I haven't seen this before.	Nisam ovo ranije video.
I did it right away	Uradio sam to odmah
But not tonight.	Ali ne večeras.
I would never know.	Nikad ne bih znao.
Right away, please.	Odmah, molim.
I would never say that.	Nikad to ne bih rekao.
You'll never be able to do that again.	Nikada ti to više neće moći.
She would be here now.	Ona bi sada bila ovde.
You have everything.	Imaš sve.
I need to talk to you	Moram razgovarati s tobom
These people had nothing, as we know.	Ništa ti ljudi nisu imali, što mi znamo.
So he can stay where he is.	Tako da može ostati gdje je.
She knew what to do.	Znala je šta da radi.
It's really my life.	To je stvarno moj život.
I see it happening again	Vidim da se to ponovo dešava
But she doesn't speak.	Ali ona ne govori.
Not so far.	Ne do sada.
I am a man who has nowhere to go	Ja sam čovjek koji nema gdje otići
I just can’t work on it anymore today.	Jednostavno ne mogu više raditi na tome danas.
Maybe you did, maybe you didn't.	Možda jesi, možda nisi.
I am so glad that all this is happening	Tako mi je drago što se sve ovo dešava
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
Or maybe he didn't leave.	Ili možda nije otišao.
I hope we are fine here	Nadam se da ćemo ovdje biti dobro
This is just this.	Ovde je samo ovo.
I don't know about him	Ne znam za njega
I said so much.	Toliko sam rekao.
I can get it.	Mogu to dobiti.
Something he saw.	Nešto što je video.
I wonder how she does it	Pitam se kako ona to radi
He had a pretty good life.	Imao je prilično dobar život.
I just can't.	Jednostavno ne mogu.
He loves her.	On je voli.
All of him.	Svi on.
He even prefers it.	Čak i više voli.
I was just happy	Bio sam jednostavno sretan
That's what you told me yesterday.	To si mi rekao juče.
I wonder where he lives	Pitam se gdje živi
Let me tell you, it works well.	Da vam kažem, radi dobro.
I want you to do something for me.	Želim da uradiš nešto za mene.
Not everything you think it would be.	Nije sve ono što mislite da bi bilo.
They didn't have the right thing.	Nisu imali pravu stvar.
Maybe that was the right path.     	Možda je to bio pravi put.     
I don't think about it at all	Ne mislim na to uopšte
I really didn't have to.	Zaista nisam morao.
We are not the only ones now.	Sada nismo jedini.
I was supposed to be a friend	Trebao sam biti prijatelj
I didn’t think it all happened already	Nisam mislio da se sve to već dogodilo
We'll do that here.	To ćemo raditi ovdje.
For him, for both.	Za njega, za oboje.
I needed it so much.	Toliko mi je trebalo.
I wonder what it looks like.	Pitam se kako to izgleda.
This is easy.	Ovo je lako.
Everything just happens.	Sve se jednostavno dešava.
I know he's telling the truth	Znam da govori istinu
I thought he went to see you	Mislio sam da je otišao da te vidi
I can't believe we're the only ones	Ne mogu vjerovati da smo mi jedini
Maybe it wasn't right here.	Možda nije bilo baš ovdje.
I was ready not to know	Bio sam spreman da ne znam
I know it doesn't look that way now	Znam da sada ne izgleda tako
I want to be me.	Želim biti mi.
I really didn't know what to do	Zaista nisam znao šta da radim
I can meet you tonight	Mogu se naći sa tobom večeras
I like it really well.	Sviđa mi se stvarno dobro.
For this time.	Za ovaj put.
I love you and I'm with you	Volim te i sa tobom sam
And, that’s exactly what happened.	I, upravo se to dogodilo.
I saw him last night	Video sam ga sinoć
It's just a little more.	To je samo malo više.
I haven't decided yet	Nisam još odlučio
He would know.	On bi znao.
I hope he tells us soon	Nadam se da će nam uskoro reći
I was so happy to see you again	Bio sam tako sretan što te ponovo vidim
She will know what to do.	Ona će znati šta da radi.
Something was wrong.	Nešto nije bilo u redu.
I probably knew before him	Vjerovatno sam znao prije njega
I had no problem with that.	Nisam imao problema sa tim.
I know exactly what he means and what he means.	Znam tačno šta misli i šta misli.
But I'm not sure.	Ali nisam siguran.
I mean, probably not	Mislim, vjerovatno nije
I knew he had me.	Znao sam da me ima.
Please tell me how to do it, if you know.	Molim te reci mi kako da to uradim, ako znaš.
You have to believe in it.	Morate vjerovati u to.
There is nothing.	Ne postoji ništa.
I wish he could.	Voleo bih da može.
I think she may have been right	Mislim da je možda bila u pravu
I couldn’t believe this had happened to me	Nisam mogao vjerovati da mi se ovo dogodilo
And he was busy.	I bio je zauzet.
I can't see you, she says	Ne mogu da te vidim, kaže ona
What did you think, you thought.	Šta si mislio, mislio si.
I just want to be her	Samo želim da budem ja
He did his job.	Uradio je svoj posao.
Not that he ever knew that.	Nije da je to ikada znao.
I knew my father wouldn't say anything	Znao sam da moj otac neće ništa reći
I had a lot of time alone	Imao sam mnogo vremena sam
I must be back	Sigurno sam se vratio
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
This is what is usually done.	To je ono što se obično radi.
We won't be able to.	Nećemo moći.
I knew it could be won	Znao sam da se može dobiti
He seemed to want to talk.	Činilo se da želi razgovarati.
I hope you had a good one	Nadam se da si imao dobar
I don't want that.	Ne želim to.
It wasn't like that before.	Prije nije bilo tako.
He was so right.	Bio je tako u pravu.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
I wasn't happy either	Ni ja nisam bio sretan
I did all this	Ja sam sve ovo napravio
It really could.	Zaista bi moglo.
I asked to see.	Tražio sam da vidim.
I mean, everything he said was true	Mislim, sve što je rekao je bila istina
And neither can she.	A ne može ni ona.
It is.	Ono jeste.
I just have to.	Jednostavno moram.
I just wanted to be with you	Samo sam htela da budem sa tobom
I could see what he meant	Mogao sam vidjeti na šta misli
I wanted more than that	Želeo sam više od toga
Maybe there were only a few	Možda ih je bilo samo nekoliko
That was the problem here.	To je bio problem ovdje.
I just need to be alone	Samo treba da budem sam
I just didn’t expect to find anyone here.	Jednostavno nisam očekivao da ću nekoga naći ovdje.
Maybe I don't like it.	Možda mi se ne sviđa.
But none of us could help him.	Ali niko od nas mu nije mogao pomoći.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
I never worked	Nikada nisam radio
Or it wouldn't.	Ili ne bi.
That's what we need.	To je ono što nam treba.
Too much time and money.	Previše vremena i novca.
I've known that for a long time.	Znam to dugo vremena.
It could have been anyone.	Mogao je biti bilo ko.
We like it.	Sviđa nam se.
There were too many of us.	Bilo nas je previše.
He's been there before.	Bio je tamo ranije.
I have enough money.	Imam dovoljno novca.
I can't do things anymore	Ne mogu više raditi stvari
You don't know much.	Mnogo toga ne znate.
I really like what we’re doing this year.	Mnogo mi se sviđa ono što radimo ove godine.
It will never be.	To nikad neće biti.
This works well enough for me.	Ovo mi radi dovoljno dobro.
People just don’t know about it.	Ljudi jednostavno ne znaju za to.
I pray that doesn't happen	Molim se da do toga ne dođe
You can't just do anything.	Ne možete jednostavno ništa.
Yes, it must be.	Da, mora biti.
I said you could stay here for a few days	Rekao sam da možeš ostati ovdje nekoliko dana
You have to be together.	Morate biti zajedno.
I think this is just for him	Mislim da je ovo samo za njega
It was hard not to.	Bilo je teško ne.
It seems to be.	Čini se da jeste.
So many things.	Toliko stvari.
Do the job you want.	Radi posao koji želite.
That would be the first.	To bi bio prvi.
I didn't want to either	Ni ja nisam htela
But they could.	Ali mogli su.
That could happen.	To bi se moglo dogoditi.
I wonder if he feels that too	Pitam se da li i on to osjeća
It was just too much.	Bilo je to jednostavno previše.
I didn't know what we were going to do	Nisam znao šta ćemo da radimo
But just knowing he could do it wasn't enough.	Ali samo znati da on to može nije bilo dovoljno.
He was my friend.	Bio mi je prijatelj.
Something we have to do.	Nešto što moramo da uradimo.
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
She would be at home.	Bila bi kod kuće.
They couldn't know.	Nisu mogli znati.
I never wanted to be that	Nikad nisam želeo da to budem
And she’s right that she does.	I ona je u pravu što to čini.
There are many things we can do here.	Postoji mnogo stvari koje možemo učiniti ovdje.
I still do all those things.	I dalje radim sve te stvari.
I shouldn't say that.	Ne bih to trebao reći.
I don't see exactly how that is true.	Ne vidim baš kako je to istina.
I never meant that	Nikad to nisam mislio
I had nothing to say	Nisam imao šta da kažem
I didn't tell him anything.	Nisam mu ništa rekao.
I love houses.	Volim kuće.
I know you want me too	Znam da i ti mene želiš
Something bad happened.	Nešto loše se dogodilo.
I still feel sorry for him	I dalje mi ga je žao
I told you how it would be	Rekao sam ti kako će biti
I won't be here long	Neću dugo biti ovdje
He knows what he does and what he doesn't.	On zna šta radi, a šta ne.
I have no idea why, how or anything.	Nemam pojma zašto, kako ili bilo šta.
I can't tell you how much.	Ne mogu vam reći koliko.
He didn't have to wait long.	Nije morao dugo da čeka.
You don't have to know now.	Ne morate znati sada.
I haven't been long enough	Nisam bio dosta dugo
I was the first to see this	Bio sam prvi koji je ovo vidio
That was true enough, but it wasn’t enough.	To je bilo dovoljno istina, ali nije bilo dovoljno.
Do as you please.	Uradi kako hoćeš.
I just want to go home.	Samo želim da idem kući.
I've never seen it.	Nikada nisam video.
It is the same today.	I danas je tako.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
She tries not to.	Ona pokušava da ne.
I never saw you before this happened	Nikada te nisam vidio prije nego što se ovo dogodilo
It's all true, you know.	Sve je to istina, znaš.
I'm sure he didn't go there	Siguran sam da nije otišao tamo
I was really happy.	Bio sam zaista sretan.
I will not buy it again.	Neću ga ponovo kupiti.
They don't know they're wrong.	Ne znaju da nisu u pravu.
I love it too much	Previše volim to
I think it was him	Mislim da je to bio on
It seems like many years ago.	Čini se kao prije mnogo godina.
We both know he did it and why he left.	Oboje znamo da je to uradio i zašto je otišao.
I know you've started enough for me.	Znam da si dovoljno počeo i za mene.
The only one.	Jedini.
I was there last week as well.	Bio sam tamo i prošle sedmice.
I was yours for the question	Bio sam tvoj za pitanje
A car is a car.	Auto je auto.
I didn't know what to do next	Nisam znala šta dalje
I think we have time for that	Mislim da imamo vremena za to
I did it for that.	Uradio sam to zbog toga.
What he needed was to eat.	Ono što mu je trebalo je da jede.
I have no idea what that was.	Nemam pojma šta je to bilo.
I know who you are.	Znam ko si ti.
That's what you told us.	To si nam rekao.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Možda, možda, možda.
Maybe this will help.	Možda će ovo pomoći.
I wish it wasn't so, but it's true	Voleo bih da nije tako, ali je istina
The reason she said she didn't tell anyone.	Razlog zašto je rekla da nikome nije rekla.
But we didn't know.	Ali nismo znali.
I didn't tell him anything, but he knew.	Nisam mu ništa rekao, ali on je znao.
I had to do anything myself	Morao sam bilo šta da uradim sam
I should do something	Trebao bih nešto učiniti
He just wasn't ready.	Jednostavno nije bio spreman.
And there are a lot of them.	A ima ih puno.
He wondered what those things were.	Pitao se šta su to stvari.
I've had enough of you today.	Dosta mi te je danas.
The truth was that they had nothing.	Istina je bila da nisu imali ništa.
I'm happy to be back.	Sretan sam što sam se vratio.
But he was obviously wondering.	Ali on se očigledno pitao.
I hope you can help.	Nadam se da možete pomoći.
I can't say more	Ne mogu više reći
Obviously, we will not do that.	Očigledno, mi to nećemo učiniti.
That may not be true.	To ne može biti tačno.
That was for sure.	To je bilo sigurno.
It would be good for him.	Bilo bi dobro za njega.
I had to say something	Morao sam nešto reći
He even told us it would happen.	Čak nam je rekao da će se to dogoditi.
No one had to know about it.	Niko nije morao da zna za to.
He has to be first.	Mora biti prvi.
This is the first time he has done this.	Ovo je prvi put da je ovo uradio.
This just takes time.	Za ovo samo treba vremena.
It was so small.	Bilo je tako malo.
Or it couldn't.	Ili nije moglo.
So much to do.	Toliko toga za uraditi.
There were still plenty of them.	Još uvijek ih je bilo dosta.
I never wanted you here	Nikad te nisam želeo ovde
I think that would be good.	Mislim da bi to bilo dobro.
I know you want to see my code	Znam da želiš vidjeti moj kod
I just didn't have it	Jednostavno to nisam imao
It's you.	To si ti.
I would love to do something like that	Voleo bih da uradim tako nešto
He saw nothing and no one.	Nije vidio ništa i nikoga.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
But he heard me.	Ali me je čuo.
I really dont know.	Ne znam stvarno.
You can go there.	Možeš otići tamo.
But keep going.	Ali dalje.
I don't know how long she was there.	Ne znam koliko je dugo bila tamo.
This is all.	To je sve.
I didn't want to be without him	Nisam htela da budem bez njega
I didn't know you and your friend would be there	Nisam znao da ćeš ti i tvoj prijatelj biti tamo
There is no more.	Ne postoji više.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
I'm working, I'm working on it.	Radim, radim na tome.
I just couldn't see anything	Jednostavno nisam mogao ništa vidjeti
I can't believe what just happened	Ne mogu vjerovati šta se upravo dogodilo
It seemed to be.	Činilo se da jeste.
It can work.	Može raditi.
I wonder how much she knows	Pitam se koliko ona zna
Three for sure.	Tri sigurno.
There and there.	Tamo i tamo.
I hope no one heard.	Nadam se da niko nije čuo.
It must.	Mora.
I started again.	Počeo sam ponovo.
I wondered how he felt	Pitao sam se kako se osjeća
Or maybe it is.	Ili možda jeste.
I just need to do these things alone	Samo treba da radim ove stvari sam
If you want to talk about it.	Ako želiš razgovarati o tome.
I thought he was gone	Mislio sam da je otišao
And she was there.	I ona je bila tamo.
We do it.	Mi to radimo.
I can't talk to him yet.	Ne mogu još razgovarati s njim.
So far it's working fine.	Za sada radi dobro.
I hope everything will be fine	Nadam se da će sve biti u redu
I wasn't sure myself.	Ni sam nisam bio siguran.
There must be someone.	Mora da postoji neko.
For me, for you.	Za mene, za tebe.
That is not true here.	To ovdje nije istina.
You don't need more.	Ne treba više.
He needs more.	Treba mu više.
I should have told you earlier	Trebao sam ti reći ranije
But he was not and is not.	Ali nije bio i nije.
I work long hours.	Radim dugo.
I had to do something	Morao sam nešto da uradim
Now we are pretty sure we will never come back.	Sada smo prilično sigurni da se nikada nećemo vratiti.
I couldn't see anything.	Nisam mogao ništa da vidim.
Exactly as it will ever be.	Potpuno kao što će ikada biti.
Maybe we have more.	Možda imamo više.
I would expect to be with you	Očekivao bih da budem s tobom
But you didn't.	Ali ti nisi.
As a friend.	Kao prijatelj.
He wants to know if it was real.	Želi da zna da li je bilo stvarno.
I knew the way.	Znao sam put.
There, he said.	Tamo, rekao je.
He says he'll be fine, but he knows.	Kaže da će biti dobro, ali zna.
I just didn't expect it	Jednostavno nisam očekivao
Someone has to.	Neko mora.
I think he's planning to talk to you	Mislim da planira razgovarati s tobom
And much more.	I još mnogo toga.
You had to be there.	Morao si biti tamo.
We knew right away.	Odmah smo znali.
She didn't want to go any further.	Nije htela da ide dalje.
I am not myself.	Ja nisam svoj.
I hope it gets better.	Nadam se da će i dalje biti bolje.
It won't work.	Neće raditi.
It couldn't be.	Nije moglo biti.
I wonder who it could be	Pitam se ko bi to mogao biti
He had few friends there.	Imao je malo prijatelja tamo.
I know a lot of things, you know	Znam puno stvari, znaš
In addition, much more is being done.	Osim toga, radi se na mnogo više.
She's nothing to me.	Ona mi nije ništa.
I can't tell you now	Ne mogu ti sada reći
She's planning something.	Ona nešto planira.
He could.	Mogao je.
The car is there.	Auto je tamo.
As if it doesn't really exist.	Kao da zapravo ne postoji.
I couldn't be alone.	Nisam mogao biti sam.
They were right.	Bili su u pravu.
I'm afraid that happens often.	Bojim se da se to često dešava.
I will never say that again.	Nikad to više neću reći.
Don't tell anyone.	Ne govori nikome ništa.
And we had a lot of that.	I imali smo dosta toga.
I was quite surprised	Bio sam prilično iznenađen
Does anyone else have this problem?	Ima li još neko ovaj problem?
As he will do again.	Kao što će to učiniti ponovo.
I didn't know where he was	Nisam znao gdje je
We won't talk about it.	Nećemo o tome.
It seems so obvious now.	Sada izgleda tako očigledno.
What is happening is.	Ono što se dešava je.
I really hope so.	Zaista se nadam.
I'm your new friend	Ja sam tvoj novi prijatelj
I haven't done that in a long time	Nisam to radio dugo vremena
How accurate it is, it's hard to say.	Koliko je tačno, teško je reći.
She sees things.	Ona vidi stvari.
He was a pretty good man.	Bio je prilično dobar čovjek.
I guess he didn't do something like that.	Pretpostavljam da nije uradio tako nešto.
But it’s more than that and we both know it.	Ali to je više od toga i oboje to znamo.
I think we need to get them back	Mislim da ih moramo vratiti
She still works here.	Ona i dalje radi ovdje.
And it probably should be.	A vjerovatno bi i trebao biti.
And you shouldn't either.	A ni ti ne bi trebao.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
This is not real.	Ovo nije stvarno.
I doubt he will give it	Sumnjam da će to dati
He just couldn't.	Jednostavno nije mogao.
I mean, please.	Mislim, molim te.
I loved her completely	Voleo sam je potpuno
Nobody had to say anything.	Niko nije morao ništa da kaže.
That's what he should do.	To bi trebalo da uradi.
I can't see you, just me	Ne mogu da te vidim, samo ja
I told you last night	Rekao sam ti sinoć
Maybe they are right.	Možda su u pravu.
I really didn't want to go home	Zaista nisam htio ići kući
I didn't tell anyone	Nisam nikome rekao
I have no idea how that happens.	Nemam pojma kako se to dešava.
I'm sure you know.	Siguran sam da znaš.
I'm not sure he knows	Nisam siguran da zna
I didn’t know it was going to happen	Nisam znao da će se to dogoditi
And they know it.	I oni to znaju.
And I did it well	I ja sam to dobro radio
I wonder how long she's been here alone	Pitam se koliko je dugo ovdje sama
But he never does.	Ali on to nikad ne čini.
No, it wasn't.	Ne, nije bilo.
I tried.	Pokušao sam.
That happened just a few days ago.	To se dogodilo prije samo nekoliko dana.
I can help you with that.	Mogu ti pomoći u tome.
But not him.	Ali ne on.
I guess that's it	Pretpostavljam da je to to
They weren't home yet.	Još uvijek nisu bili kod kuće.
I know how much you wanted that job	Znam koliko si želeo taj posao
I'm sorry, that was my idea	Žao mi je, to je bila moja ideja
It doesn't look like that.	Ne izgleda tako.
I wasn't sure what exactly was going on	Nisam bio siguran šta se tačno dešava
I really want to know	Zaista želim da znam
And that was a really good thing.	I to je zaista bila dobra stvar.
But now it looks too bad.	Ali sada izgleda previše loše.
You don't want it that way.	Ne želiš to tako.
I heard almost everything	Čuo sam skoro sve
No one had any idea what and how.	Niko nije imao pojma šta i kako.
He did it only a few times, many years ago.	Učinio je to samo nekoliko puta, prije mnogo godina.
I know this works.	Znam da ovo radi.
I have a lot of time.	Imam dosta vremena.
What did he do?	Šta je uradio.
I think that will be enough	Mislim da će to biti dovoljno
I was still surprised	I dalje sam bio iznenađen
But it doesn't work.	Ali ne radi.
This was not supposed to go.	Ovo nije trebalo da ide.
I asked her if she could find me a job	Pitao sam je može li mi naći posao
You look completely like her.	Izgledaš potpuno kao ona.
Nothing, so to speak.	Ništa, da tako kažem.
It won't be much.	Neće biti puno.
I had none of that.	Nisam imao ništa od toga.
And there are many.	I ima mnogo toga.
I shouldn't have left	Nisam trebao otići
Besides, he was fine.	Osim toga, bio je dobro.
I did not expect this question	Nisam očekivao ovo pitanje
Too good, maybe.	Previše u redu, možda.
I just wasn't for it tonight	Večeras jednostavno nisam bio za to
Work.	Posao.
I really worked on it	Zaista sam radio na tome
We were safe there.	Tamo smo bili sigurni.
And she knew he knew.	I znala je da on zna.
And because of that.	I zbog toga.
It may not work.	Možda neće raditi.
I know all about it	Znam sve o tome
As if she never wanted to.	Kao da nikada nije htela.
I just didn't want it to come on you.	Samo nisam htela da dođe na tebe.
I guess I’ve done it by now	Pretpostavljam da sam do sada to već učinio
We know what he's doing.	Znamo šta radi.
I think it will work for a long time to come	Mislim da će to raditi još dugo vremena
I didn't know why	Nisam znao zašto
I can't say anything further.	Ne mogu reći ništa dalje.
I didn't expect it.	Nisam očekivao.
I think this happens to a lot of people	Mislim da se ovo dešava sa mnogo ljudi
But this one.	Ali ovaj.
I can't be sure.	Ne mogu biti siguran.
I'm so glad you came back to me	Tako mi je drago što si mi se vratio
I didn't know how many people.	Nisam znao koliko ljudi.
And you knew he would.	I znao si da hoće.
I need help	Treba mi pomoć
I can't believe he would do this to me	Ne mogu vjerovati da bi mi to uradio
I told him he could trust me	Rekao sam mu da mi može vjerovati
I could go home	Mogao sam ići kući
She is, she is.	Ona je, ona je.
He is alone.	On je sam.
I won't say everything.	Neću reći baš sve.
Do this, do that.	Uradi ovo, uradi ono.
She was right.	Bila je u pravu.
None of us are.	Niko od nas nije.
I may not find anything, but that's okay	Možda neću naći ništa, ali to je u redu
But you didn't and you can't.	Ali nisi i ne možeš.
I bought them both.	Kupio sam ih oboje.
I know her better than you	Znam je bolje od tebe
I haven't seen them there before.	Nisam ih tamo ranije vidio.
This was not for me.	Ovo nije bilo za mene.
I think there are several.	Mislim da ih ima nekoliko.
It won't be like that with you.	Sa tobom neće biti tako.
You must be here.	Mora da ste ovde.
I knew something was going on with him	Znao sam da se nešto dešava s njim
I can't do this.	Ne mogu ovo da uradim.
This is a problem.	Ovo je problem.
I know now.	Znam sada.
I think he knew better	Mislim da je znao bolje
I guess it wasn't that bad	Pretpostavljam da to nije bilo tako loše
Three.	Tri.
I was a person	Bio sam osoba
I always will.	Ja ću uvijek.
Or as my father would say.	Ili kako bi rekao moj otac.
Like who you are.	Kao ko si.
It's very simple.	Vrlo je jednostavno.
I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not.	Nisam siguran da li je ovo dobra stvar ili ne.
I should have said that.	Trebao sam to reći.
Someone must have told him what happened.	Mora da mu je neko rekao šta se dogodilo.
Not this way.	Ne na ovaj način.
I promised	Obećao sam
It just exists.	Samo postoji.
You think it's real.	Misliš da je stvarno.
I see yes.	Vidim da.
That's how the road worked for you.	Tako je put radio na tebe.
I don't know enough to say that's not the case.	Ne znam dovoljno da kažem da nije tako.
I know he was your friend	Znam da ti je bio prijatelj
I knew he would come.	Znao sam da će doći.
But much more can and should be done.	Ali mnogo više se može i treba učiniti.
It works without problems.	Radi bez problema.
I did not know what to say	Nisam znao šta da kažem
I should never have left	Nikada nisam trebao otići
I just can't find a job	Jednostavno ne mogu naći posao
He loves me, he doesn't love me.	Voli me, ne voli me.
He can't do that.	On to ne može.
It was simple, nothing more.	Jednostavno je bilo, ništa više.
I can not see anything.	Ne vidim ništa.
All work now.	Sve posao sada.
I could see myself doing this a lot	Mogao sam vidjeti sebe kako ovo radim mnogo
And you got it.	I shvatio si.
We have enough.	Imamo dovoljno.
You want to do something.	Želiš nešto da uradiš.
I really want to do that.	Zaista želim to da uradim.
But that did not happen to us.	Ali to se nama nije dogodilo.
When something is done, there is only that.	Kada se nešto radi, postoji samo to.
I can't tell you anything more than that	Ne mogu vam reći ništa više od toga
I've never done that	Nikada to nisam radio
He knows, and so should you.	On zna, a i ti bi trebao.
I'll tell you if something's wrong	Reći ću ti ako nešto nije u redu
I didn't mean to say you didn't	Nisam htela da kažem da nisi
I could say for you	Mogao bih reći za tebe
I can't do that here	Ne mogu to da uradim ovde
But let me tell you what.	Ali da ti kažem šta.
I think you really need it	Mislim da ti zaista treba
I wish it was.	Voleo bih da je.
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
Not really.	Zapravo nije.
I didn't really want to live	Nisam zaista želeo da živi
I can't say more	Ne mogu više reći
She doesn't work anymore.	Ona više ne radi.
He just left.	Upravo je otišao.
I mean, we can help now	Mislim, sada možemo pomoći
They wouldn't tell me anything, but.	Ne bi mi ništa rekli, ali.
Several are not.	Nekoliko nije.
Someone has already done it.	Neko je to već uradio.
She is not the only one.	Ona nije jedina.
I'm sure you can.	Siguran sam da možeš.
He says he is.	Kaže da jeste.
I can't tell you what it is	Ne mogu vam reći šta je to
I'm glad I'm helpful.	Drago mi je da sam od pomoći.
There is no way to say ‘maybe tomorrow’.	Ne postoji način da se kaže 'možda sutra'.
Maybe they are right.	Možda su u pravu.
That's exactly what's happening.	To je upravo ono što se dešava.
Me too, she says.	I ja, kaže ona.
I have a lot at the moment	Trenutno imam mnogo toga
But he would have none of that.	Ali on ne bi imao ništa od toga.
I know you must be better	Znam da ti mora biti bolje
I don't think that was my idea	Ne mislim da je to bila moja ideja
It doesn't get any better.	Ne ide na bolje.
You can't say.	Ne možeš reći.
I loved it being long	Voleo sam da bude dugo
A little about that.	Malo o tome.
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije.
I love everything here	Volim sve ovde
But there is much more to it than that.	Ali ima mnogo više od toga.
I have to do this.	Moram ovo da uradim.
This.	Ovo.
I just wish you'd told us earlier	Samo bih volio da si nam rekao ranije
I guess both are true	Pretpostavljam da je oboje istina
I just want it to be day	Samo želim da bude dan
I knew right away what just happened	Odmah sam znao šta se upravo dogodilo
But something is happening.	Ali nešto se dešava.
We are working on it now.	Sada radimo na tome.
I didn't see that one.	Taj nisam vidio.
I wanna Be With You.	Želim biti s tobom.
I mean, she's here	Mislim, ona je ovde
He wants anything.	On želi bilo šta.
That's what they told us.	Tako su nam rekli.
To work!!!.	Na posao!!!.
Not only that, but it is what it is.	Nije samo, nego je ono što jeste.
But it won't work.	Ali to neće ići.
It shouldn’t be that hard.	To ne bi trebalo biti tako teško.
She can't be.	Ona ne može biti.
I love you, you are my life	Volim te, ti si moj život
The day will go on.	Dan će ići dalje.
You can do it too.	I ti to možeš.
I had to know the reason.	Morao sam da znam razlog.
I never realized how good a person you are	Nikad nisam shvatio koliko si dobra osoba
It's not a game.	To nije igra.
It wasn't always like that.	To nije uvek bilo tako.
I told you earlier	Rekao sam ti ranije
I don't see why that would be.	Ne vidim zašto bi to bilo.
I think he knows something	Mislim da on zna nešto
I'll say it.	Ja ću to reći.
I have a good job	Imam dobar posao
He never did.	Nikad nije.
I guess that's my problem	Pretpostavljam da je to moj problem
It wasn't usually difficult.	Obično nije bilo teško.
Thirty years.	Trideset godina.
They could, but they didn't.	Mogli su, ali nisu.
But now that path no longer exists.	Ali sada taj put više ne postoji.
I haven't heard that before.	Nisam to ranije čuo.
Maybe you're one of us.	Možda si jedan od nas.
That will help a lot.	To će puno pomoći.
In fact, very good.	U stvari, vrlo dobro.
But we don't know what.	Ali ne znamo šta.
I just couldn't do it to him.	Jednostavno mu to nisam mogao učiniti.
He's the one who didn't want you here.	On je taj koji te nije želio ovdje.
A lot can happen.	Mnogo toga se može dogoditi.
It wouldn't take long.	Ne bi trebalo dugo.
I know what you told me	Znam šta si mi rekao
I like to work for myself.	Volim da radim za sebe.
I knew what he was doing	Znao sam šta radi
I was a little tired	Bio sam malo umoran
I could probably get it.	Verovatno bih ga mogao dobiti.
We could do this.	Mogli bismo ovo da uradimo.
They won't get you a job.	Neće te dobiti na posao.
I must be lost	Mora da sam se izgubio
I was really alone	Zaista sam bio sam
So it was helpful.	Tako da je bilo od pomoći.
And he certainly was.	I sigurno je bio.
You have to know what to do.	Morate znati šta da radite.
If we know what we're doing.	Ako znamo šta radimo.
I won't have to do this alone.	Neću morati ovo da radim sam.
So far it hasn't.	Do sada nije.
I know it's been a long time.	Znam da je jako dugo.
I always wanted you	Uvek sam te želeo
That's right.	Tako je.
That's good to know.	To je dobro znati.
I need to know if that's true	Moram da znam da li je to istina
It's so hard.	Tako je teško.
I was good.	Ja sam bio dobar.
I would do it again.	Uradio bih to ponovo.
What did I do? 	Šta sam uradio?
'nothing'.	'ništa'.
She is her and I am me.	Ona je ona a ja sam ja.
I thought.	Mislio sam.
I want him to go home	Želim da ide kući
It's good.	To je dobro.
That is still happening today.	To se dešava i danas.
And we couldn't say anything.	I nismo mogli ništa reći.
I know what you mean now	Znam na šta sada misliš
I was sure he would be fine	Bio sam siguran da će biti dobro
This is the way to do it.	Ovo je način da se to uradi.
I really have to go	Stvarno moram da idem
Maybe you know something, and maybe you don't.	Možda nešto znaš, a možda i ne znaš.
I guess you really could	Pretpostavljam da bi zaista mogao
I don't think he knew anything.	Mislim da on ništa nije znao.
You could have done anything.	Mogao si sve.
I told you so much.	Toliko sam ti rekao.
I didn't know anything.	Nisam znao ništa.
I'm sure he would.	Siguran sam da bi.
But that never happened.	Ali to se nikada nije dogodilo.
But there is more here.	Ali ovdje ima više.
I didn't know where, how, she lived.	Nisam znao gdje, kako, ona živi.
I want to live with you	Želim život sa tobom
I told you exactly what happened	Rekao sam ti šta se tačno dogodilo
That was none of my business.	To nije bila moja stvar.
I'm glad he's back.	Drago mi je da se vratio.
I lost so much	Toliko sam izgubio
I know it's not always like that	Znam da nije uvek tako
They did a good job.	Uradili su dobar posao.
I'm better off without it	Bolje mi je i bez toga
I couldn't see anything better than him	Nisam mogao vidjeti ništa bolje od njega
I can't go back yet	Ne mogu se još vratiti
It could be done at any time.	To se moglo učiniti u bilo koje vrijeme.
I did everything they told me to do	Uradio sam sve što su mi rekli
She was still with him.	I dalje je bila s njim.
I would love to do that job	Voleo bih da radim taj posao
When she's here.	Kada je ona ovde.
And we have it in us.	I mi to imamo u sebi.
Maybe he wants to see, maybe not.	Možda želi da vidi, a možda i ne.
I already told him nothing happened	Već sam mu rekao da se ništa nije dogodilo
There's just one problem.	Postoji samo jedan problem.
There just wasn't time.	Jednostavno nije bilo vremena.
All of him.	Svi on.
I don't know how they did it.	Ne znam kako su to uradili.
I heard about it.	Čuo sam za to.
I heard that.	Čuo sam to.
I think we did it today.	Mislim da smo to danas uradili.
We just don't know.	Samo ne znamo.
We said no.	Rekli smo ne.
That's more.	To više.
Everyone knew, but no one saw.	Svi su znali, ali niko nije video.
She is not alone.	Ona nije sama.
It wouldn't be easy.	Ne bi bilo lako.
Why are you.	Zašto si.
She wouldn't tell me.	Ne bi mi rekla.
There is a way.	Postoji način.
I will do it.	Ja ću uraditi.
I could talk to anyone.	Mogao sam razgovarati sa bilo kim.
That certainly hasn't happened yet.	To se sigurno još nije dogodilo.
He really is.	On zaista jeste.
They both knew he meant yes.	Oboje su znali da je mislio da.
I'm sorry it wasn't sooner.	Žao mi je što nije bilo ranije.
I doubt it's the only one	Sumnjam da je to jedini
And this is no longer as difficult as it used to be.	I ovo više nije tako teško kao što je nekada bilo.
It is not easy to get a job today.	Danas nije lako dobiti posao.
I think he knows more than he says	Mislim da zna više nego što govori
It does not work.	Ne ide.
I knew everything I needed to know	Znao sam sve što sam trebao znati
In fact, it is.	U stvari jeste.
I had no idea what was going on	Nisam imao pojma šta se dešava
I didn't know what was going on	Nisam znao šta se dešava
I pray we don't need that much	Molim se da nam ne treba toliko
Maybe it's not you.	Možda nisi ti.
I think it will be.	Mislim da će biti.
They are absolutely right.	Oni su potpuno u pravu.
He is not his own.	On nije svoj.
For both of us.	Za oboje.
In fact, maybe not.	Zapravo, možda i ne.
I just saw everything you did	Upravo sam vidio sve što si uradio
But you did your best.	Ali dao si sve od sebe.
I saw what happened to him	Video sam šta mu se dogodilo
I really like how hard it is	Zaista mi se sviđa koliko je teško
I didn't do my job	Nisam uradio svoj posao
Not so long.	Ne tako dugo.
I don't see anything in that.	Ne vidim ništa u tome.
This is the first time I've seen it.	Ovo je prvi put da sam to vidio.
I immediately went for it	Odmah sam otišao na to
He already knew that.	On je to već znao.
I've always been here.	Uvek sam bio ovde.
This is all.	To je sve.
I have a job for you	Imam posao za tebe
You like her.	Ona ti se sviđa.
But she loves him.	Ali ona ga voli.
It took me a little longer	Trebalo mi je malo više vremena
I guess you're not, or you wouldn't be here	Pretpostavljam da nisi, ili ne bi bio ovdje
I should have come earlier	Trebao sam doći ranije
It seemed simple enough.	Činilo se dovoljno jednostavno.
I didn't hear him come home.	Nisam ga čuo da je došao kući.
I didn’t know how many people it really was	Nisam znao koliko je to ljudi zaista
She doesn't want to talk to you.	Ona ne želi da priča sa tobom.
I think you are, actually	Mislim da jesi, zapravo
if yes how?	ako da kako?
It could be.	Moglo bi biti.
I bought it for myself	Kupio sam to sebi
I thought nothing could help me.	Mislio sam da mi ništa ne može pomoći.
I'm really sorry.	Zaista mi je žao.
I didn't come back just for the money	Nisam se vratio samo zbog novca
And yes, there seemed to be one.	I da, činilo se da postoji jedan.
And that's me.	A to sam ja.
And I was right.	I ja sam bio u pravu.
I know you weren't your own	Znam da nisi bio svoj
It's already three.	Već je tri.
I just need some time	Samo mi treba malo vremena
I knew we would never see him again	Znao sam da ga više nikada nećemo vidjeti
Looks like someone really lives here now.	Izgleda da neko zaista živi ovde sada.
He could also work in a.	Mogao je i da radi u a.
It was there right away.	Odmah je bilo tamo.
Good idea.	Dobra ideja.
I can do it for you	Mogu to uraditi za tebe
I want him to love me.	Želim da me voli.
Either way.	Na bilo koji način.
I didn't think it would be that hard	Nisam mislio da će zaista biti tako teško
I won't be long	Neću dugo otići
One is not.	Jedan nije.
But you did a good job.	Ali uradio si dobar posao.
He is with us.	On je sa nama.
I'm sorry you'll have to return it	Žao mi je što ćete ga morati vratiti
She is who she is.	Ona je ono što jeste.
It's very simple.	Veoma je jednostavno.
It didn't take him long to feel at home.	Nije mu trebalo dugo da se osjeća kao kod kuće.
Maybe that was bad enough.	Možda je to bilo dovoljno loše.
I just knew he would	Samo sam znao da hoće
He knows that, but he doesn't know how he knows it.	Zna to, ali ne zna kako to zna.
I wonder why it is now.	Pitam se zašto je to sada.
Something you have to do for me.	Nešto što moraš učiniti za mene.
There is so much, even without it.	Ima toliko toga, čak i bez toga.
I don’t see that anything could be done now.	Ne vidim da bi se sada moglo nešto učiniti.
But that may not be true.	Ali to ne može biti tačno.
I told you the truth	Rekao sam ti istinu
I didn't want to like what he was doing	Nisam htela da mi se sviđa to što radi
But this is never true.	Ali ovo nikada nije istina.
That's a good question.	To je dobro pitanje.
I knew he knew more.	Znao sam da on zna više.
I guess you have something to say	Pretpostavljam da imaš nešto da kažeš
I know that too.	Znam i to.
I didn't want to see that	Nisam to htio vidjeti
Yes you can.	Da, možeš.
I think he saw something he didn't tell me	Mislim da je video nešto što mi nije rekao
I'm not going there again.	Ne idem tamo ponovo.
He lost it.	Izgubio ga je.
They both knew their way around.	Oboje su znali svoj put.
He knew what was going to happen.	Znao je šta će se dogoditi.
But no one knew what was true.	Ali niko nije znao šta je tačno.
I have to tell you this.	Moram ti ovo reći.
He was a very good guy to work for.	Bio je veoma dobar momak za koga je trebalo raditi.
I can't go back.	Ne mogu se vratiti.
So she wants to work with me.	Tako ona želi da radi sa mnom.
I knew what was going on.	Znao sam šta se dešava.
I want to be your friend for now	Želim da ti budem prijatelj za sada
I can't believe you haven't seen her here	Ne mogu vjerovati da je nisi vidio ovdje
I did something right	Uradio sam nešto kako treba
Nobody said anything.	Niko ništa nije rekao.
I would have to do this	Morao bih ovo da uradim
She does a very good job.	Ona radi veoma dobar posao.
Now you have to help me see her again.	Sada mi morate pomoći da je ponovo vidim.
I want to know everything that's going on	Želim da znam sve što se dešava
It was the same last night.	Tako je bilo i sinoć.
I know he's here	Znam da je tu
That was too much for us.	To je bilo previše za nas.
That's it.	To je to.
In fact, you can.	U stvari, možete.
I would love to see something very soon.	Voleo bih da vidim nešto vrlo brzo.
I know he's gone, but it can be done	Znam da ga nema, ali to se može uraditi
Several times actually	Nekoliko puta zapravo
Here’s a thing he’s never seen before	Ovdje je stvar koju nikada prije nije vidio
I couldn't do any better.	Ne bih ništa bolje.
I'm not sure what to do	Nisam baš siguran šta da radim
There is nothing more we can do.	Ne možemo više ništa da uradimo.
That was easy.	To je bilo lako.
In fact, no one really does.	U stvari, niko zaista ne radi.
He knows what you look like.	On zna kako izgledaš.
I told you what happened	Rekao sam ti šta je bilo
I didn't mean you	Nisam mislio na tebe
He could have been a man.	Mogao je biti i čovjek.
There just wasn't enough time.	Jednostavno nije bilo dovoljno vremena.
I have so much to tell him	Imam toliko toga da mu kažem
I don't really know.	Ja zapravo ne znam.
Not by itself.	Ne samo po sebi.
He can't be found.	On se ne može naći.
This can't be right.	Ovo ne može biti u redu.
I didn't think of him often	Nisam često mislio na njega
I didn't think he said something like that before	Nisam mislio da je tako nešto ranije rekao
She would never say something like that	Nikada ne bi rekla tako nešto
I have too much money	Imam previše novca
I want to tell you those things	Želim da ti kažem te stvari
And it never is.	I nikad nije.
I never wanted to do that either	Ni ja to nikada nisam želio da uradim
I've been for a while	Bio sam već neko vrijeme
I'm telling you it's not.	Kažem ti da nije.
I will never have enough	Nikada mi neće biti dosta
Someone said something.	Neko je nešto rekao.
Nobody knows that.	Niko to ne zna.
There is, there is enough for everyone.	Ima, ima dovoljno za sve.
That's all I can tell you	Toliko ti mogu reći
I'm pretty tired of it.	Prilično sam umoran od toga.
You are a man.	Ti si čovjek.
I don't have to know.	Ne moram da znam.
I asked her where and she told me	Pitao sam je gdje i ona mi je rekla
It's like I'm there again.	Kao da sam ponovo tamo.
He said he wanted to talk.	Rekao je da želi razgovarati.
I see a lot of things.	Vidim mnogo stvari.
He won't.	Neće.
I don't think it ever will be	Ne mislim da će ikada biti
To be right.	Da budem u pravu.
I’m not doing it just for myself.	Ne radim to samo za sebe.
You must be the first.	Ti mora da si prvi.
I think that could happen	Mislim da bi se to moglo dogoditi
That is the reason for the problem.	To je razlog problema.
I haven't seen her in years	Nisam je vidio mnogo godina
So we didn't know what was wrong.	Tako da nismo znali šta nije u redu.
This is all .	To je sve .
You have to do it for yourself.	To morate učiniti za sebe.
It took him a while.	Trebalo mu je vremena.
Why is this happening? 	Zašto se ovo dešava?
he thought.	mislio je.
You are helpful.	Vi ste od pomoći.
I mean nothing happened.	Mislim ništa se nije dogodilo.
He knew that.	On je to znao.
I didn't know what to say	Nisam znao šta tačno da kažem
I think that's pretty good.	Mislim da je to prilično dobro.
I'm not home yet.	Još uvek nisam kod kuće.
But it happened.	Ali to se dogodilo.
Everything happens so fast.	Sve se dešava tako brzo.
What if.	Šta ako.
That's not my money.	To nije moj novac.
Aren't we just.	Zar nismo samo.
It could actually.	To bi zapravo moglo.
I really didn't want that	Zaista to nisam ni htela
I always think of him	Uvek mislim na njega
They're still here.	Još su tu.
In that time.	U to vrijeme.
They would not do it without money.	Oni to ne bi uradili bez novca.
I really needed that	To mi je zaista trebalo
And that's what you need to do.	I to je ono što treba da uradite.
I guess that's a good thing	Pretpostavljam da je to dobra stvar
He's not right for you.	On nije pravi za tebe.
I just didn't say anything	Samo nisam ništa rekao
In fact, it was.	U stvari, bilo je.
You got the job.	Dobio si posao.
All right, fine.	U redu, dobro.
I just know you would	Samo znam da bi
I love you and I want to be with you	Volim te i želim da budem sa tobom
I said he was fine, and he was	Rekao sam da je dobro, i bio je
I know this about myself	Znam ovo o sebi
I did the right thing	Uradio sam pravu stvar
You brought him back.	Vratio si ga.
I know you can do this	Znam da možeš ovo
But she was there.	Ali tamo je bila.
How does she know that.	Kako ona to zna.
We said that there.	To smo rekli tamo.
That's what I expected.	Toliko sam i očekivao.
Good and bad.	Dobro i loše.
It can be very bad, it can be good.	Može biti jako loše, može biti dobro.
I guess we should be here soon	Pretpostavljam da bi uskoro trebali biti ovdje
And that's okay.	I to je u redu.
I mean really.	Mislim stvarno.
But you did what you had to do.	Ali uradio si ono što si morao.
He probably won't even come back.	Vjerovatno se ni neće vratiti.
They are the reason we are here.	Oni su razlog zašto smo ovdje.
I can't say more about it	Ne mogu više reći o tome
!! 	!
I'll tell you what happened to me.	Reći ću ti šta mi se dogodilo.
He's gone now.	Sada ga nema.
No one is sure.	Niko nije siguran.
I was so happy to see him	Bio sam tako sretan što sam ga vidio
I just didn't know how to do it	Samo nisam znala kako bi to uradio
I didn't want to say that much	Nisam htela da kažem toliko
Something like.	Nešto kao.
I hope you can help me.	Nadam se da mi možete pomoći.
He did not return.	Nije se vratio.
I am very happy.	Ja sam vrlo sretan.
I know we're the only ones here	Znam da smo jedini ovde
She never told me that much.	Nikad mi nije rekla toliko.
I knew we would never see him again.	Znao sam da ga više nikada nećemo vidjeti.
This is really so.	Ovo je zaista tako.
Maybe I'm working tonight	Možda radim večeras
The weather looks good.	Vrijeme izgleda dobro.
I am and always will be your friend	Ja sam i uvek ću biti tvoj prijatelj
You're doing something.	Radiš nešto.
I could see he was having a hard time	Mogao sam vidjeti da mu je teško
There seemed to be more people.	Činilo se da ima više ljudi.
And no one wants that.	A to niko ne želi.
I hope it will.	Nadam se da hoće.
But this is not true.	Ali ovo nije tačno.
I asked what was wrong	Pitao sam šta nije u redu
I don't know that.	Ne znam to.
It took me longer than that	Trebalo mi je više vremena od toga
I said yes, we knew about it	Rekao sam da, znali smo za to
And you.	I ti si.
That is not always true.	To nije uvijek tačno.
It is so.	To je tako.
I shouldn't have done that.	Nisam to trebao učiniti.
I just want to talk about it.	Samo želim razgovarati o tome.
Or just, you know, here.	Ili samo, znate, ovdje.
I just want to do this	Samo želim da ovo uradim
You must know.	Sigurno morate znati.
I need something more	Treba mi nešto više
It's not what it is.	Nije to što jeste.
There was something I could do.	Mogao sam nešto da uradim.
I don't know exactly why.	Ne znam tačno zašto.
It’s just what you do.	To je samo ono što radite.
We like the idea.	Sviđa nam se ideja.
He wanted it for me.	Želio je to za mene.
I'm not afraid of you either	Ni ja se tebe ne bojim
I've seen you many times	Vidio sam te mnogo puta
And there is no money for that.	I nema novca za to.
I should know by tomorrow	Trebalo bi da znam do sutra
It wasn't the first time.	Nije bilo prvi put.
I really wasn't too sure about this	Zaista nisam bio previše siguran u ovo
Maybe that's true.	Možda je to tačno.
They could do anything.	Mogli su sve.
I love you.	Volim vas.
But he knew it couldn't be.	Ali znao je da to ne može biti.
It's good.	To je dobro.
Right now,.	Upravo sada,.
I didn't even know that	Nisam to ni znao
This team is good.	Ovaj tim je dobar.
That's it.	To je to.
You never know.	Nikad ne znaš.
I can't do this anymore	Ne mogu ovo više
He is my friend.	On je moj prijatelj.
I can't even say it's not	Ne mogu reći ni da nije
I didn't have enough time	Nisam imao dovoljno vremena
But you.	Ali ti.
Does anyone know if this still exists?	Da li neko zna da li to još uvek postoji?
He saw me.	Video me je.
I want to talk to him	Želim razgovarati s njim
That's what you say.	To ti kažeš.
I would give you some.	Dao bih ti malo.
But it is not so.	Ali nije tako.
I just hope there aren’t too many of them	Samo se nadam da ih nije previše
It's mine too.	I moj je.
She loves going there.	Ona voli da ide tamo.
He shouldn't have been there.	Nije ni trebao biti tamo.
But this is a fairly simple question.	Ali ovo je prilično jednostavno pitanje.
This is not working for me.	Ovo mi ne ide.
If not.	Da nije.
There is something wrong with him.	Nešto nije u redu s njim.
But there is no money here.	Ali ovde nema novca.
That's how it happens.	Tako se to dešava.
I don't think that's true	Mislim da to nije istina
I didn't know he would do it	Nisam znao da će to uraditi
I thought I'd talk to him.	Mislio sam razgovarati s njim.
I know what you need	Znam šta ti treba
They know it, and he knows it.	Oni to znaju, i on to zna.
You can come to me for now.	Za sada možete doći kod mene.
I want to go with it	Želim da idem sa tim
I started to like my new job.	Počeo sam da mi se sviđa moj novi posao.
I'd like to go.	Voleo bih da idem.
I can't believe it's true	Ne mogu vjerovati da je to istina
She didn't know he was there.	Nije znala da je on tamo.
But only there.	Ali samo tamo.
I'm a little sorry about that	Malo mi je žao zbog toga
I went home	Otišao sam do kuće
This simply needs to be done.	Ovo jednostavno treba uraditi.
I had to do better.	Morao sam bolje.
I hope it works well	Nadam se da radi dobro
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
I should have known this was going to happen	Trebao sam znati da će se ovo dogoditi
I should be back soon	Trebao bih se vratiti uskoro
I don't know why that is.	Ne znam zašto je to tako.
And there is no money in that.	I nema novca u tome.
I wasn't sure what he meant	Nisam bio siguran na šta je mislio
Something can happen.	Nešto se može dogoditi.
I can't both be right.	Ne mogu oboje biti u pravu.
He is them.	On je oni.
I know it's good for me	Znam da je dobro za mene
I never do that.	Ja to nikad ne radim.
But that was not it.	Ali to nije bilo to.
I'm not scared anymore.	Više se ne bojim.
This is not going to happen.	Ovo se neće dogoditi.
But maybe it should be.	Ali možda bi trebalo da bude.
I know you better than anyone	Znam te bolje od bilo koga
I don't know when that will be.	Ne znam kada će to biti.
I'm sure you'll find your way.	Siguran sam da ćeš naći svoj put.
I know what it looks like	Znam kako to izgleda
But that may not be true.	Ali to ne može biti tačno.
I wondered where the problem was.	Pitao sam se gdje je problem.
I still have you for tonight	Još te imam za večeras
One by one.	Jedan po jedan.
I lost everything	Izgubio sam sve
I think you could say yes	Mislim da biste mogli reći da
I want to see what's on	Želim da vidim šta ima na sebi
But he's with me again tonight.	Ali večeras je ponovo sa mnom.
I hope that's okay with you.	Nadam se da ti je to u redu.
I can't stay here anymore	Ne mogu više ostati ovdje
I knew what happened there	Znao sam šta se tamo dogodilo
I was so tired.	Bio sam tako umoran.
It's not that hard.	Nije tako teško.
I didn’t know until he said he needed the money	Nisam znao dok nije rekao da treba novac
I won't say anything more	Neću reći ništa više
This is actually a good thing.	Ovo je zapravo dobra stvar.
Where he was supposed to be.	Gdje je trebao biti.
I didn't say anything more about it	Nisam rekao ništa više o tome
I didn't know what to think.	Nisam znao šta da mislim.
I wouldn't be here if I didn't know what I wanted.	Ne bih bio ovdje da ne znam šta želim.
That she might not love him anymore, yes.	Da ga možda više ne voli, da.
But he went as far as he could.	Ali otišao je koliko je mogao.
What did you do.	Šta si uradio.
I can't go back there	Ne mogu se vratiti tamo
Like with me.	Kao sa mnom.
I wasn't very happy about that	Nisam bio baš sretan zbog toga
He knows everything that has happened and will happen.	On zna sve što se dogodilo i što će se dogoditi.
That's okay with us !.	To je u redu sa nama!.
We were there together.	Bili smo tamo zajedno.
I'm sure you'll find him	Siguran sam da ćeš ga naći
Something needed to be given.	Nešto je trebalo dati.
And no one thinks there is anything wrong with that.	I niko ne misli da je u tome nešto loše.
That's better.	To je bolje.
None of us knew what to do.	Niko od nas nije znao šta da radi.
You can.	Možeš .
I shouldn't have done it that way	Nisam trebao to da uradim na taj način
In fact, you can see it right now.	U stvari, možete to vidjeti upravo sada.
He told me.	On mi je rekao.
I couldn't do that to him	Nisam mogao to da mu uradim
Maybe you could too.	Možda bi i ti mogao.
I can't say you will	Ne mogu reći da hoćeš
Just what we need.	Baš ono što nam treba.
I don't think any of that happened.	Mislim da ništa od toga nije bilo.
And it has been for a long time.	I bila je to dugo vremena.
I didn't want to go to school	Nisam htela da idem u školu
But from time to time.	Ali s vremena na vrijeme.
They were people before you.	Oni su bili ljudi prije tebe.
Yes, he would.	Da, on bi.
That was not true.	To nije bila istina.
But obviously not.	Ali očigledno nije.
I'm afraid to go home	Bojim se ići kući
I couldn't go on	Nisam mogao ići dalje
There is another reason.	Postoji još jedan razlog.
I hope yours is as good as mine	Nadam se da je tvoj dobar kao moj
I'm not in the house.	Nisam u kući.
Anything is better than doing nothing.	Bilo šta je bolje nego ne raditi ništa.
I would know it is	Znao bih da jeste
It's because of you.	To je zbog tebe.
But she was none of those things.	Ali ona nije bila ništa od toga.
Just for us.	Samo za nas.
And it can go any way.	A može ići na bilo koji način.
I'm going alone, which is fine.	Idem sam, što je u redu.
It will be better that way.	Tako će biti bolje.
She knew, well enough.	Znala je, dovoljno dobro.
They had more money, true.	Imali su više novca, istina.
I know he won't.	Znam da neće.
I wasn't sure what to do	Nisam bio siguran šta bi uradio
I thought you understood that.	Mislio sam da si to shvatio.
It's not what you think.	Nije ono što misliš.
But that's enough.	Ali dosta je bilo.
That's not much.	To nije puno.
Don't tell anyone.	Ne reci nikome.
I haven't seen her here yet	Nisam je još vidio ovdje
No one had.	Niko nije imao.
I felt sorry for him, in a way	Bilo mi ga je žao, na jedan način
I had to tell him.	Morao sam mu reći.
He was right about that.	U tome je bio u pravu.
I am today	I danas sam
I don't know what she's doing either.	Ni ja ne znam šta radi.
Right now, it's just not there yet.	Trenutno, jednostavno još nije tu.
I would make it myself.	Napravio bih ga sam.
I saw it very real	Vidio sam to vrlo stvarno
It's easy to see why.	Lako je vidjeti zašto.
I know you're not happy here	Znam da nisi sretan ovdje
I want to know all that	Želim da znam sve to
I don't know much.	Ne znam mnogo.
And maybe we never will.	A možda nikada nećemo.
I love you much more than you know	Volim te mnogo više nego što znaš
Not everyone is like you.	Nisu svi kao ti.
Me and my father.	Ja i otac.
You never know.	Nikad se ne zna.
My problem is to do it.	Moj problem je da to uradim.
Who knows, but it seems like a lot.	Ko zna, ali to se čini mnogo.
It still works today.	Radi i danas.
Tomorrow if you want.	Sutra ako želiš.
I hope this could help you	Nadam se da bi vam ovo moglo pomoći
There was still no house to be seen.	I dalje nije bilo kuće da se vidi.
If you want to do it, do it.	Ako želiš to da uradiš, uradi to.
But it wasn't up to him.	Ali to nije bilo do njega.
We did it first.	Prvi smo uradili.
If you don't want to, don't.	Ako ne želiš, nemoj.
I neither heard nor saw anything	Nisam ni čuo ni vidio ništa
We were the first there.	Bili smo prvi tamo.
As you know, I haven't been here often	Kao što znate, nisam često bio ovde
I wondered how he really was	Pitao sam se kako mu je zaista
Isn't that true.	Nije li to istina.
I really don’t know why that happened	Zaista ne znam zašto se to dogodilo
Even more.	Čak i više.
I wasn't looking for you at all	Nisam te uopšte tražio
Everything you want.	Sve što želiš.
It wasn't this.	To nije bilo ovo.
I really wanted to see you today	Zaista sam te htio vidjeti danas
Too much, really.	Previše, zaista.
But better see things.	Ali bolje vidjeti stvari.
I think that's what they say	Mislim da se tako kaže
I heard you came last night	Čuo sam da si došao sinoć
I want you very much, but it wouldn't be right	Želim te jako, ali ne bi bilo u redu
I wasn't sure about this	Nisam bio siguran u ovo
And that it just wasn't good.	I da jednostavno nije bilo dobro.
I should have left earlier	Trebao sam ranije otići
This was a good thing.	Ovo je bila dobra stvar.
I still wouldn't.	I dalje ne bi.
Yes, maybe it is.	Da, možda jeste.
I think that's it.	Mislim da je to sve.
Lots of time.	Puno vremena.
I know it won't be easy	Znam da neće biti lako
It's better than okay.	Bolje je nego u redu.
We know where he lives.	Znamo gdje živi.
But I don't know why	Ali ne znam zašto
There's nothing there for you.	Nema tu ništa za tebe.
I want to believe we can trust him	Želim vjerovati da mu možemo vjerovati
But now it was only a few more days.	Ali sada je bilo još samo nekoliko dana.
We have a lot of time.	Imamo puno vremena.
It should, but it isn't.	Trebalo bi, ali nije.
Maybe not.	Možda i ne bi.
I knew all about not being my own	Znao sam sve o tome da nisam svoj
I need more time	Treba mi još vremena
I am for.	Ja sam za.
And that one.	I taj.
Which is not bad.	Što nije loše.
We have to do this.	Moramo ovo uraditi.
I just finished it earlier	Samo sam to ranije završio
But it will do more.	Ali to će učiniti više.
We did well.	Uradili smo dobro.
I should have been there for him	Trebao sam biti tu za njega
But that's not right.	Ali to nije u redu.
I was happy there.	Bio sam sretan tamo.
I mean, it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough	Mislim, nije bilo dovoljno, nije bilo dovoljno
They will really come.	Oni će zaista doći.
He loved working here.	Voleo je da radi ovde.
As if that never happened.	Kao da se to nikada nije dogodilo.
I wish you were there	Voleo bih da si bio tamo
They are gone.	Nema ih više.
I really should see someone	Stvarno bih trebao vidjeti nekoga
I always thought it was me.	Uvek sam mislio da sam to ja.
So I hope there is	Tako se nadam da ima
You are right.	U pravu ste.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
I'm going home now.	Idem sada kući.
This was not the way to live.	Ovo nije bio način da se živi.
You're doing so well.	Tako ti dobro ide.
We have to do something.	Moramo nešto učiniti.
But you were too.	Ali i ti si bio.
I can't be what he wants	Ne mogu biti ono što on želi
I couldn't believe it.	Nisam mogao vjerovati.
Not even that long.	Čak ni tako dugo.
I don’t want it to be the first time.	Ne želim da bude prvi put.
It shouldn't take long.	Ne bi trebao dugo.
I love this job.	Volim ovaj posao.
I'm not sure what's going to happen.	Nisam baš siguran šta će se dogoditi.
Maybe they are right	Možda su u pravu
I thought it was much more	Mislio sam da je mnogo više
You need to know more.	Morate znati više.
How does it work.	Kako radi.
I lost.	Izgubio sam.
I haven't lost anyone before	Nisam nikoga ranije izgubio
Maybe you're the one.	Možda si ti pravi.
For all of us.	Za sve nas.
They were like us.	Bili su kao mi.
It does a lot of things well.	Radi puno stvari dobro.
I never had a life here.	Nikada nisam imao život ovdje.
I didn't want to see anyone now	Nisam htela nikoga da vidim sada
I didn't know anyone was here	Nisam znala da je neko ovde
I can't help myself, really	Ne mogu si pomoći, stvarno
But please don't.	Ali molim te nemoj.
Everything was fine with me.	Sve je bilo u redu sa mnom.
And it sure is.	I sigurno jeste.
It’s hard to know what it’s all about.	Teško je znati o čemu se radi.
He wasn't there either.	Ni on nije bio tamo.
I am very, very happy for you.	Veoma, veoma sam sretan zbog tebe.
This is very	Ovo je veoma.
If he didn’t have them, you have to buy him.	Ako ih nije imao, morate ga kupiti.
You're not the only one, you know.	Nisi jedini, znaš.
He gave one life.	Dao je jedan život.
It was so simple	Bilo je tako jednostavno
I didn't say that.	Nisam to rekao.
I asked him if that was true	Pitao sam ga da li je to istina
I still don't know how it happened.	Još uvijek ne znam kako se to dogodilo.
I can't go on like you	Ne mogu dalje kao ti
I knew what needed to be done	Znao sam šta treba da se uradi
I think that's all you can say	Mislim da je to sve što možeš reći
They never knew about you.	Nikada nisu znali za tebe.
I want to know.	Želim znati.
Me, me too.	Ja, i ja sam.
There are three of them now.	Sada ih ima tri.
We need to know something that tells us who did it.	Moramo znati nešto što nam govori ko je to uradio.
I know a lot of people.	Znam puno ljudi.
I knew he wouldn't come again	Znao sam da više neće doći
He shouldn't have seen this.	Nije trebao ovo da vidi.
I will really do everything for you	Zaista ću učiniti sve za tebe
That's right.	Tako je tačno.
It seemed to work.	Činilo se da radi.
I couldn’t believe all this was happening	Nisam mogao vjerovati da se sve ovo dešava
He came to me.	Došao je do mene.
It is something he will give his life for.	To je nešto za šta će dati život.
I want it to work for us	Želim da radi za nas
I won't be able to help anyone.	Neću moći nikome pomoći.
I'll find you and you'll help me	Naći ću te i ti ćeš mi pomoći
It's there.	Tamo je.
I want to know what's going on	Želim da znam šta se ovo dešava
He was right.	Bio je u pravu.
We'll see.	Ćemo vidjeti.
We were together for a long time.	Bili smo zajedno dugo vremena.
I told him to leave	Rekao sam mu da ode
I don't see anything here	Ne vidim ništa ovdje
Everything should be fine	Trebalo bi da sve bude u redu
My friend is here.	Moj prijatelj je ovde.
I mean, he's a really good guy	Mislim, on je stvarno dobar momak
Maybe they should.	Možda su trebali.
He just needed time, he decided.	Samo mu je trebalo vremena, odlučio je.
I was just wondering if she was here	Samo sam se pitao da li je ona ovdje
I want to be something more for you	Želim da budem nešto više za tebe
I'm sure of it.	Siguran sam u to.
I just wasn’t ready for it	Jednostavno nisam bio spreman za to
She didn't know where she lived.	Nije znala gdje živi.
He didn't say that.	On to nije rekao.
I haven't seen her in years, you know	Nisam je vidio mnogo godina, znaš
Just a little more than nothing.	Samo malo više nego ništa.
He couldn't believe what he saw.	Nije mogao vjerovati šta vidi.
I'm fine for now.	Za sada sam dobro.
And that.	I to.
There are many more.	Ima ih još mnogo.
People are people.	Ljudi su ljudi.
I had a lot.	Imao sam mnogo.
I know about everything	Znam za sve
But he didn't want to say that.	Ali on to nije htio reći.
You didn't do anything.	Niste uradili ništa.
He is with us now.	On je sada sa nama.
You're here, and you're not here.	Ovdje si, a nisi ovdje.
I just wanted to see him	Samo sam htela da ga vidim
Does anyone know if there is a way to do this.	Da li neko zna da li postoji način da se to uradi.
Nice to see him.	Bilo mi je drago da ga vidim.
You are here now.	Tu si sada.
I want to do it here	Želim to učiniti ovdje
I can't do this alone.	Ne mogu ovo sam.
You didn't say anything.	Nisi ništa rekao.
I mean, hard.	Mislim, teško.
I knew right away what it was	Odmah sam znao šta je
It really shows.	Zaista se vidi.
I wouldn't admit it	Ne bih to priznao
It should stay the way it is now.	Trebalo bi ostati kako je sada.
We've been doing this for a while.	Radimo to već neko vrijeme.
They must have done it to themselves.	Mora da su to uradili sami sebi.
You can be your own.	Možeš biti svoj.
And she wants it.	I ona to želi.
I've never had that before	Nikad to ranije nisam imao
I wish we could, but we can't	Voleo bih da možemo, ali ne možemo
Neither do you.	Ni ti.
I never wanted this for you	Nikad ti ovo nisam želeo
I wonder what he wants from him	Pitam se šta hoće od njega
I do it with everyone	Ja to radim sa svima
I've never seen him do that before	Nikad ga prije nisam vidio da to radi
But not really.	Ali ne baš.
No, not a problem.	Ne, nije problem.
A problem at home.	Problem kod kuće.
I had no idea what had happened	Nisam imao pojma šta se dogodilo
I thought that was good	Mislio sam da je to dobro
I know what you mean.	Znam šta misliš.
She doesn't speak.	Ona ne govori.
We know so much.	Toliko znamo.
I really love being here	Zaista volim biti ovdje
The more who works, the better.	Što više ko radi, to bolje.
That's how it happened.	Tako se dogodilo.
Yes, we were.	Da, bili smo.
I wouldn't have to do anything	Ne bih morao ništa da radim
It's not easy.	Nije jednostavno.
I think it's me	Mislim da sam ja
He didn't have much time.	Nije imao mnogo vremena.
Something just happened.	Nešto se upravo dogodilo.
He just couldn't help himself.	Jednostavno nije mogao sebi pomoći.
He was here, but not now.	Bio je ovdje, ali sada nije.
I didn't mean anything bad	Nisam mislio ništa loše
Too easy.	Previše lako.
Not so good.	Ne tako dobro.
I have no doubt he will come alone	Ne sumnjam da će doći sam
That's bad.	To je loše.
She knows it's true.	Ona zna da je to istina.
Yes, he is my friend.	Da, on je moj prijatelj.
He doesn't say that at all	On to uopšte ne govori
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
Do it today.	Uradi to danas.
I had to give him something	Morao sam mu nešto dati
He loved what he saw.	Voleo je ono što je video.
This is not you.	Ovo nisi ti.
I didn't know what he meant.	Nisam znao šta je mislio.
This was never a problem.	Ovo nikada nije bio problem.
We were together, but we weren't.	Bili smo zajedno, ali nismo.
He can go home now.	Sada može ići kući.
I have it, and so can you	Imam ga, a možeš i ti
Maybe I didn't say it very well	Možda nisam baš dobro rekao
It's more like you said it.	Više je kao da si to rekao.
He's probably right.	Verovatno je u pravu.
Maybe this isn’t even a question of money.	Možda ovo čak i nije pitanje novca.
I mean .	Mislim na .
That was correct.	To je bilo tačno.
I've never heard from you.	Nikad se nisam čuo.
I should have said so	Trebao sam tako reći
It's always better to be prepared.	Uvek je bolje biti spreman.
Just to say something.	Samo da kažem nešto.
I was no longer sure if any of that was real	Više nisam bio siguran da li je nešto od toga stvarno
He couldn't help it.	Nije mogao pomoći.
I should have been home	Trebao sam biti kod kuće
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno si u pravu.
I know exactly what's going on	Znam tačno šta se dešava
I just got a new job	Upravo sam dobio novi posao
I'm happy for you.	Drago mi je zbog tebe.
I can give you one	Mogu ti dati jedan
I felt sorry for him.	Bilo mi ga je žao.
Maybe he had a problem here himself.	Možda je i sam imao problem ovdje.
I never want to see you again	Nikada te više ne želim vidjeti
More, perhaps, than he would be if it were not so.	Više, možda, nego što bi on bio da nije tako.
And I could very easily	I ja sam vrlo lako mogao
I hope that will be long enough	Nadam se da će to biti dovoljno dugo
It's just me now.	Sada sam samo ja.
I will help you.	Ja ću ti pomoći.
I gave him something.	Dao sam mu nešto.
They just don't know it yet.	Samo to još ne znaju.
For a while no one said anything.	Neko vrijeme niko ništa nije rekao.
I'm not doing anything	Ne radim ništa
I have to tell him.	Moram mu reći.
It wasn't, and still isn't.	Nije, a nije i dalje.
I'm not going.	Ja ne idem.
I would say yes	Rekao bih da
I had no idea this was going to happen	Nisam imao pojma da će se ovo dogoditi
Surely something needed to be given.	Sigurno je nešto trebalo dati.
We pretty much know who it is.	Prilično sigurno znamo ko je to.
I am many things	Ja sam mnogo stvari
He just wanted to go home.	Samo je želio da ide kući.
It never is and never will be.	Nikad nije i nikada neće.
Maybe not.	Možda neće.
They probably don't even know how.	Verovatno ni ne znaju kako.
Apparently, this is real.	Očigledno, ovo je stvarno.
You know, someone lost their life.	Znate, neko je izgubio život.
But these people don't.	Ali ti ljudi ne.
I gave it back to you	Vratio sam ti ga
You have to believe it from me.	Morate vjerovati u to od mene.
And just be with me.	I samo biti sa mnom.
I didn't work on it	Nisam radio na tome
Not for sure.	Ne sigurno.
I thought maybe he was right	Mislio sam da je možda u pravu
He loved me too.	I on je mene volio.
I'm not sure about that yet.	Nisam još siguran u to.
He was looking for something.	Tražio je nešto.
I thought he would	Mislio sam da hoće
I didn't want to know	Nisam htela da znam
But he got there on time.	Ali stigao je tamo na vrijeme.
I love them both so much	Toliko ih volim oboje
I'm done for now.	Za sada sam završio.
It’s so hard to see.	To je tako teško vidjeti.
I just was.	Upravo sam bio.
How could they know? 	Kako su mogli znati?
But we knew nothing.	Ali mi ništa nismo znali.
We are not your problem.	Mi nismo tvoj problem.
U.	U.
I really hope you will	Zaista se nadam da hoćeš
Maybe it's hope.	Možda je to nada.
It is not true that he could see.	Nije tačno da je mogao da vidi.
I didn't do it.	Nisam to uradio.
I didn't have any at all.	Uopšte nisam imao.
They did everything right	Sve su uradili kako treba
My new job.	Moj novi posao.
I knew what this was	Znao sam šta je ovo
You work for me.	Radiš za mene.
I expected it to be bad	Očekivao sam da će biti loše
Okay, that looks really bad.	U redu, to izgleda jako loše.
He knows what to do.	On zna šta da radi.
I thought it would be	Mislio sam da će biti
I'm sorry if it is	Žao mi je ako jeste
Maybe just in time.	Možda samo na vrijeme.
You know he will.	Znaš da hoće.
He always looked like that.	Uvek je tako izgledao.
But another and.	Ali još jedan i.
It seemed so simple.	Činilo se tako jednostavno.
So they wouldn't want me to work for you.	Tako da ne bi želeo da radim za tebe.
I can't say how and when	Ne mogu reći kako i kada
There is a good reason to think so.	Postoji dobar razlog da se tako misli.
I thought we had it in us.	Mislio sam da imamo to u sebi.
I know you didn't love her	Znam da je nisi voleo
So far so good.	Do sada vrlo dobro.
Which is.	Koji je.
I mean, you can go	Mislim, možeš otići
We do it.	Mi to radimo.
We are working on it.	Radimo na tome.
But here.	Ali ovdje.
A person who always has more to give	Osoba koja uvijek ima više za dati
I was there for over a few years.	Bio sam više od nekoliko godina.
That if.	To ako.
I won't know until tomorrow	Neću znati do sutra
I really think this will help	Zaista mislim da će ovo pomoći
They are real people.	Oni su pravi ljudi.
I do things like her	Ja radim stvari kao i ona
I could tell he didn’t want to tell me.	Mogao sam reći da mi ne želi reći.
I said everything and he left.	Rekao sam sve i on je otišao.
The day has come.	Došao je dan.
I didn't hear what he said	Nisam čuo šta je rekao
I really don't know.	Zaista ne znam.
He could see it, but he couldn't get to it.	Mogao je to vidjeti, ali nije mogao doći do toga.
I had a lot of friends	Imao sam puno prijatelja
See what he does.	Vidi šta radi.
This one is.	Ovaj je.
If so, she would be without him.	Da je tako, ona bi bez njega.
That's what it looks like.	Tako izgleda.
Obviously I didn't want to	Očigledno nisam htela
He's there, here.	On je tamo, ovde.
Just what it is.	Samo ono što jeste.
I'm really glad you're all here	Zaista mi je drago što ste svi ovdje
I don't need much	Ne treba mi mnogo
He would surely have it.	Sigurno bi ga imao.
We all knew that.	Svi smo to znali.
I really couldn't believe it.	Zaista nisam mogao vjerovati.
As far as I know, there is only one.	Koliko ja znam, postoji samo jedan.
I don't know any better.	Ne znam ništa bolje.
I just can't tell you why yet	Samo još ne mogu da vam kažem zašto
Can be.	Može biti.
See what's going on.	Vidi šta se dešava.
Maybe he will and he won't say.	Možda hoće i neće reći.
There is a problem.	Tu je problem.
Yes, there it is.	Da, tu je.
For the first time, he feels safe.	Po prvi put se osjeća sigurno.
But now it is even more.	Ali sada je to još više.
I don't see why they didn't do it.	Ne vidim zašto to nisu uradili.
I didn't do it to be bad	Nisam to uradio da bih bio loš
It's always so good with you.	Sa tobom je uvek tako dobro.
That can't be helped.	To se ne može pomoći.
I only know what it is	Znam samo ono što jeste
I really didn't know	Zaista nisam znao
A lot.	Puno.
I never said it would be easy	Nikad nisam rekao da će biti lako
A game that is life itself	Igra koja je sam život
I had nothing better to do	Nisam imao ništa bolje da radim
I had a really bad day	Imao sam jako loš dan
No, three times.	Ne, tri puta.
We shouldn't have.	Nismo trebali.
I know that well enough	Znam to dovoljno dobro
I wasn't good enough for this	Nisam bio dovoljno dobar za ovo
I love it with him	Volim to kod njega
I certainly didn't ask for him	Ja ga sigurno nisam tražio
You never know.	Nikad se ne zna.
I loved that this was not happening	Voleo sam da se ovo ne dešava
But this was not supposed to be.	Ali ovo nije trebalo biti.
You really should go see.	Zaista bi trebao otići vidjeti.
I have to say she's not doing badly	Moram reći da ona ne radi loše
It's hard for everyone.	Teško je svima.
She will know that.	Ona će to znati.
It was like that, but it wasn't much.	Bilo je tako, ali nije bilo puno.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
We are good.	Dobro smo.
I was right.	Bio sam u pravu.
I have everything today.	Imam sve danas.
I know more than a few.	Znam više od nekoliko.
I had no idea what to say.	Nisam imao pojma šta da kažem.
I know too many things	Znam previše stvari
I knew that well enough	Znao sam to dovoljno dobro
Just as she knew it would be.	Baš kao što je i znala da će biti.
I heard what you said.	Čuo sam šta si rekao.
But she has to.	Ali ona mora.
I never knew that	Nikada to nisam znao
We were together.	Bili smo zajedno.
I just want to be here	Samo želim biti ovdje
I really want to go home	Stvarno želim ići kući
And so it is.	I tako je.
Or, not really.	Ili, ne baš.
Your life is yours, you can do whatever you want.	Tvoj život je tvoj, možeš da radiš šta hoćeš.
I could do it easily	Mogao bih to lako
I know her better than anyone	Znam je bolje od bilo koga
Nothing happened.	Ništa se nije dogodilo.
This one would be good.	Ovaj bi bio dobar.
We know that's true.	Znamo da je to istina.
I am safe and secure	Ja sam siguran i siguran
I need to know right away	Moram da znam odmah
You mean to do it.	Misliš to učiniti.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
For me, it never happens that way.	Za mene se to nikada ne dešava na taj način.
And he thinks that's a good thing.	I on misli da je to dobra stvar.
I'm sure it will be.	Siguran sam da će biti.
You saw it too.	I ti si to video.
Someone needs to see them.	Neko treba da ih vidi.
Must be.	Mora biti.
You must be here.	Ovdje morate biti.
But that was not the case a few years ago.	Ali, to nije bilo prije nekoliko godina.
But we have to be sure.	Ali moramo biti sigurni.
I mean, until.	Mislim, do.
But she knew, for sure, that there was nothing more.	Ali znala je, sigurno, da nema ništa više.
I wasn't ready for that	Nisam bio spreman za to
It doesn't look right.	Ne izgleda u redu.
I had another problem	Imao sam još jedan problem
I never left.	Nikad nisam otišao.
Someone can't do anything for themselves.	Neko ne može ni za sebe da uradi ništa.
This is actually quite difficult.	Ovo je zapravo prilično teško.
This year he was alone.	Ove godine je bio sam.
I want to see a little more	Želim da vidim još malo toga
Not a good idea.	Nije dobra ideja.
We can go back.	Možemo se vratiti.
I really love being with you	Zaista volim biti s tobom
Sure.	Sigurno.
But something happened.	Ali nešto se dogodilo.
I like it a lot	Sviđa mi se dosta
Very good indeed.	Zaista jako dobro.
That's until tonight.	To je do večeras.
In fact, more and more people are saying just that.	Zapravo, sve više ljudi govori upravo to.
But is that really true.	Ali, da li je to zaista istina.
I knew it right away.	Znao sam to odmah.
I knew what he was going to say	Znao sam šta će reći
That alone was not enough.	Samo po sebi to nije bilo dovoljno.
He wasn't sure which one.	Nije bio siguran koji.
No one knew where he was now.	Niko nije znao gdje je sada.
I know it's not that simple	Znam da nije tako jednostavno
I think we can see it here this way.	Mislim da to ovdje možemo vidjeti na ovaj način.
I just want your money	Samo želim tvoj novac
Besides, you don't know.	Osim toga, ti ne znaš.
He's really sorry.	Zaista mu je žao.
He couldn't live without me for long.	Nije mogao dugo da živi bez mene.
This one will be a little more.	Ovaj će biti malo više.
I didn’t think I could get to him this way	Nisam mislio da mogu doći do njega na ovaj način
But it doesn't work.	Ali to ne radi.
I know what I want and I'm going for it	Znam šta želim i idem na to
I know she wants me to do it	Znam da ona to želi da uradim
It's still you.	I dalje si ti.
And you didn't know.	A ti nisi znao.
I wonder how that makes him feel	Pitam se kako se zbog toga osjeća
How old can it be.	Koliko godina može biti.
I won't talk to you about it tonight	Neću o tome razgovarati s tobom večeras
I was happy about that.	Bio sam sretan zbog toga.
I thought they told you	Mislio sam da su ti rekli
It's not going well for you.	Ne ide vam na dobro.
I'm not good.	Nisam dobar.
I never did.	Nikad nisam.
I will always find you	Uvek ću te naći
As in a good way.	Kao na dobar način.
That few people have a job.	To nekoliko ljudi ima posao.
I'm not good.	Nisam dobro.
I could see everything.	Mogao sam vidjeti sve.
He's still doing this.	Još radi ovo.
This was a good team.	Ovo je bio dobar tim.
I don't know what to do with it	Ne znam šta da radim s tim
I would do it that way	Ja bih to uradio na taj način
I would too	I ja bih bio
I have a question for you	imam pitanje za tebe
It must.	Mora.
I think we are alone	Mislim da smo sami
Work.	Posao.
But it didn't start that way.	Ali nije tako počeo.
I told you this	Rekao sam ti ovo
He really lives.	Zaista živi.
At that time we didn't have any.	U to vrijeme nismo imali.
Someone will come for me.	Neko će doći po mene.
I'm glad he sees it now.	Drago mi je da to sada vidi.
And so it should have been.	I tako je trebalo biti.
It was too good for that.	Bilo je previše dobro za to.
I immediately told him what had happened	Odmah sam mu rekao šta se dogodilo
That's not.	To nije.
That cannot be so.	To ne može biti tako.
But I also have a lot in me.	Ali i mene ima dosta u sebi.
Nobody knew how to pick him up.	Niko nije znao da dođe po njega.
I'm going there soon.	Uskoro idem tamo.
And in us.	I u nama.
I have everything.	Imam sve.
I'm not doing this to make me feel better.	Ne radim to da bi mi bilo bolje.
It could be better.	Može biti bolje.
I have a little and I want a lot	Imam malo i želim mnogo
I can't tell him what to do	Ne mogu mu reći šta da radi
They were never when he needed them.	Nikada nisu bili kada su mu trebali.
I've never been there	Nikada nisam bio tamo
There was no need to stay.	Nije trebalo ostati.
Everything she knew was here and now, here and now.	Sve što je znala bilo je ovdje i sada, ovdje i sada.
You will come tomorrow and meet me.	Doći ćeš sutra i naći se sa mnom.
That's how you do it.	Tako to radite.
No one should know he's there.	Niko ne bi trebao znati da je tamo.
I didn't know what was happening to me	Nisam znala šta se dešava sa mnom
I wasn't expecting anyone today	Nisam očekivao nikoga danas
You know enough, too much.	Znaš dovoljno, previše.
He thought he should say something, but he didn't know what.	Mislio je da bi trebao nešto reći, ali nije znao šta.
Now is.	Sada je.
I have known him for many years	Znam ga mnogo godina
I wasn't sure which one	Nisam bio siguran koji
She wants to see me.	Ona želi da me vidi.
How far? 	Koliko dalje?
It certainly could be.	Sigurno bi moglo biti.
But there is no such thing.	Ali nema tako nešto.
It wasn't like now.	Nije bilo kao sada.
I don't know.	Ne znam baš.
But he could not eat.	Ali nije mogao da jede.
I wish he would.	Voleo bih da hoće.
They were very easy to get.	Bilo ih je vrlo lako dobiti.
He said you were right.	Rekao je da si u pravu.
I still couldn't see anything	I dalje nisam mogao ništa da vidim
It was so hard to say.	Bilo je tako teško reći.
I didn't know what was wrong	Nisam znao šta nije u redu
I never do that.	Ja to nikad ne radim.
I couldn't see anything.	Nisam mogao ništa da vidim.
Again, and again, and again.	Ponovo, i ponovo, i ponovo.
Everything seemed easy to me.	Sve mi se činilo lako.
That's how we work.	Tako mi radimo.
I didn't do it right	Nisam to uradio kako treba
I couldn’t believe it was really working	Nisam mogao vjerovati da to stvarno radi
We never know what will happen next.	Nikada ne znamo šta će dalje.
I didn't mean it that way.	Nisam tako mislio.
I see exactly who you are now	Tačno vidim ko si sada
That is not true.	To nije tačno.
But you have to give.	Ali morate dati.
I never said we would be alone	Nikad nisam rekao da ćemo biti sami
I didn't know if this was a game for him	Nisam znao da li je ovo za njega igra
I really shouldn't be with anyone right now	Zaista ne bih trebao biti ni sa kim sada
I see why he lives for this.	Vidim zašto živi za ovo.
But not this year.	Ali ne ove godine.
I hope you find this helpful.	Nadam se da će vam ovo biti od pomoći.
I wondered who exactly he was	Pitao sam se ko je tačno on
I thought he couldn't be trusted anymore	Mislio sam da mu se više ne može vjerovati
He must have just arrived here.	Mora da je upravo stigao ovde.
That would not be good.	To ne bi bilo dobro.
They can help us.	Oni nam mogu pomoći.
You should already know this.	Ovo bi već trebao znati.
I have enough problems	Imam dovoljno problema
We have time for more.	Imamo vremena za više.
I like it to be simple	Volim da bude jednostavno
I have to do it.	Moram to da uradim.
As long as she.	Sve dok ona.
I haven't heard from you in a while	Nisam te čuo neko vrijeme
I just want you to know something	Samo želim da znaš nešto
What is happening is this.	Ono što se dešava je ovo.
I think we have a lot of power	Mislim da imamo mnogo moći
Maybe you can do it.	Možda to možete učiniti.
I know you're not lost	Znam da se nisi izgubio
But nothing seems to happen.	Ali izgleda da se ništa ne dešava.
I think that's enough for now	Mislim da je to dovoljno za sada
I always knew he was waiting for me	Uvek sam znao da me čeka
I have a friend who works there	Imam prijatelja koji tamo radi
I was very surprised	Bio sam jako iznenađen
I know you know this	Znam da znaš ovo
I'd say it's okay.	Rekao bih da je u redu.
I should have it	Trebalo bi da ga imam
I see you know what you need	Vidim da znaš šta ti treba
But it's not.	Ali nije.
That's right now.	Tako je sada.
I should be there, and you know it	Trebao bih biti tamo, i ti to znaš
Now we have a car.	Sada imamo auto.
But he had to know.	Ali morao je znati.
I had my job.	Imao sam svoj posao.
He wants to play badly.	On želi da igra loše.
I want to see you there	Želim te vidjeti tamo
I had no idea what he was thinking	Nisam imao pojma šta misli
It will never be without problems.	Nikada neće biti bez problema.
This was better.	Ovo je bilo bolje.
I've never seen him before	Nikad ga prije nisam vidio
It's a bad job.	To je loš posao.
And that is very difficult.	A to je veoma teško.
And that will never happen.	A to se nikada neće dogoditi.
I wondered if they had ever had it before	Pitao sam se da li su ga ikada ranije imali
I felt sorry for him	Bilo mi ga je žao
I was there just for help	Bio sam tamo samo po pomoć
Which he didn't do.	Što on nije uradio.
I didn't ask for this	Nisam tražio ovo
I didn't know how to do it	Nisam znao kako to da uradim
I'm not sorry I bought it	Nije mi žao što sam kupio
I think they know that	Mislim da oni to znaju
I asked him what happened.	Pitao sam ga šta se dogodilo.
Now I see you did it	Sada vidim da ste to uradili
Obviously I wasn’t the first to tell him that.	Očigledno nisam bio prvi koji mu je to rekao.
I guess you never know	Pretpostavljam da nikad ne znaš
It was for everyone.	Bilo je za sve.
Yes, there were a few problems.	Da, bilo je nekoliko problema.
I know he didn't recognize me	Znam da me nije priznao
I can give you anything and everything you want	Mogu ti dati sve i sve što želiš
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
I hope you won't either	Nadam se da nećeš ni ti
Will you see that?	Hoćeš li to vidjeti?
No one ever wanted to be here.	Niko nikada nije želeo da bude ovde.
He worked for a long time.	Radio je dugo vremena.
It must be hard.	Mora da je teško.
It's probably true.	Verovatno je tačno.
But you know it doesn't work that way, she said.	Ali znaš da to tako ne ide, rekla je.
I didn't know what to do for him.	Nisam znala šta da uradim za njega.
I think we'll stay here	Mislim da ćemo ostati ovdje
And it can't be like that anymore.	I ne može više tako.
I think we have something here	Mislim da imamo nešto ovde

I want to be a person again.	Želim ponovo biti osoba.
You have decided so many things.	Odlučio si toliko stvari.
I can't come today.	Ne mogu doći danas.
I can give it to you.	Mogu ti ga dati.
Please tell me.	Molim te reci mi.
But there is more.	Ali ima još toga.
I want you to have this	Želim da imaš ovo
There is no way it looks good.	Ne postoji način da izgleda dobro.
I was not a good person	Nisam bila dobra osoba
Nothing could be done.	Ništa se nije moglo učiniti.

It’s not as hard as you think.	Nije tako teško kao što mislite.
Nothing works.	Ništa ne radi.
We have to do it this way.	Moramo to uraditi na ovaj način.
I had to ask him this.	Morao sam da ga pitam ovo.

No one knew she was here.	Niko nije znao da je ona ovde.
I didn't have much to say	Nisam imao puno toga za reći
On to the next one.	Na sljedeće.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
He would have to be here soon or he could never leave.	Morao bi uskoro biti ovdje ili nikada ne bi mogao otići.
But we can't.	Ali ne možemo.
These are things we have to do for ourselves.	To su stvari koje moramo učiniti za sebe.
You never know what you'll get.	Nikad ne znaš šta ćeš dobiti.
Because of so many things.	Zbog toliko mnogo stvari.
I know exactly what's going on	Znam tačno šta se dešava
I had no idea something like that existed.	Nisam imao pojma da tako nešto postoji.
I can't say.	Ne mogu reći.
But it was probably nothing.	Ali vjerovatno nije bilo ništa.
And he knew the truth.	I on je znao istinu.
I had enough for both	Imao sam dovoljno za oboje
I saw him here.	Video sam ga ovde.
I expected that	Očekivao sam to
Besides, it wasn't just him.	Osim toga, nije bio samo on.
I don't think that's true.	Mislim da to nije istina.
I never, ever wanted that car	Nikad, nikad nisam želeo taj auto
I was glad he came	Bilo mi je drago što je došao
I mean, he wasn't like him	Mislim, nije bio kao on
I have no idea what's here	Nemam pojma šta je ovde
I always knew the truth	Uvek sam znao istinu
I am going home.	Idem kući.
And they did it well.	I oni su to dobro uradili.
Here now.	Ovde sada.
She didn't know what to think.	Nije znala šta da misli.
No one would hear.	Niko ne bi čuo.
You can go back there	Možeš se vratiti tamo
I think it will help us	Mislim da će nam pomoći
I saw it.	Video sam to.
I think you're really ready	Mislim da li si zaista spreman
He did exactly what he had to do	Uradio je tačno ono što je morao
All this exists.	Sve ovo postoji.
Just for tonight.	Samo za večeras.
I know that's it	Znam da je to to
But he won't leave.	Ali on neće otići.
It seems to be the same here.	Čini se da je tako i ovdje.
I could work with him	Mogao bih raditi s njim
I know you did this for me	Znam da si ovo uradio za mene
I should have gone	Ja sam trebao ići
I know that's a lot more	Znam da je to još mnogo
The problem is it doesn't work.	Problem je što ne radi.
This is so true.	Ovo je tako istina.
It's up to us.	Na nama je.
I knew it wouldn't be	Znao sam da neće biti
And everyone would know why.	I svi bi znali zašto.
I just hope he's still here	Nadam se samo da je još ovdje
I think the question is when, not whether	Mislim da je pitanje kada, a ne da li
Nothing will happen here.	Ovdje se ništa neće dogoditi.
I already have it together	Već ga imam zajedno
Do it now.	Uradi to sada.
I guess he will.	Pretpostavljam da hoće.
Do what you want.	Radi šta želiš.
I have everything you asked for	Imam sve što si tražio
I was just asking you for time	Samo sam te pitao za vrijeme
I can't be your friend now either	Sada ne mogu biti ni tvoj prijatelj
I like it, but there are so many problems with it.	Sviđa mi se, ali ima toliko problema s njim.
I can't do anything with him	Ne mogu ništa s njim
But they are not sure.	Ali nisu sigurni.
I was completely, utterly surprised	Bio sam potpuno i potpuno iznenađen
I even have a job.	Čak imam i posao.
As if they knew so much.	Kao da su znali toliko toga.
Just say.	Samo reci.
You are not your own.	Ti nisi svoj.
I ask what he wants me to do today	Pitam šta želi da uradim danas
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
It really is that simple.	To je zaista tako jednostavno.
Little do they know he will not return.	Malo znaju da se neće vratiti.
Maybe he did this.	Možda je ovo uradio.
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
I didn't have time to ask	Nisam imao vremena da pitam
Which was true.	Što je bila istina.
I see you, you know	Vidim te, znaš
They are not.	Nisu.
It's really nothing.	To zaista nije ništa.
You did the right thing.	Uradili ste pravu stvar.
I don't know anything, I didn't do anything	Ništa ne znam, ništa nisam uradio
So I'm sorry.	Tako da mi je žao.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
Now everything is fine.	Sada je sve u redu.
Just people.	Samo ljudi.
You can't see me now.	Ne možeš me vidjeti sada.
And now they are even better.	A sada su još bolji.
Not a good day.	Nije dobar dan.
They couldn't see it.	Nisu to mogli vidjeti.
I want to believe that.	Želim vjerovati u to.
They just can't help themselves.	Oni jednostavno ne mogu sebi pomoći.
No one is surprised.	Niko nije iznenađen.
He's mine, not yours.	On je moj, ne tvoj.
And so it will remain.	I tako će i ostati.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
I don't want to be here either.	Ni ja ne želim biti ovdje.
I should have told you earlier	Trebao sam ti reći ranije
Which in itself was not a problem.	Što samo po sebi nije bio problem.
I thought that said a lot.	Mislio sam da to puno govori.
Maybe not.	Možda ne.
All she said was.	Sve što je rekla je.
Everyone knows that's not true.	Svi znaju da to nije istina.
I didn't know about all that	Nisam znao za sve to
I do not know how.	Ne znam kako.
I thought it was her	Mislio sam da je to ona
And so on and so forth.	I tako dalje i dalje.
That must be enough.	Mora biti dovoljno.
I would love to see that	Volio bih to vidjeti
I knew everyone here would be safe	Znao sam da će ovdje svi biti sigurni
I wasn't so sure.	Nisam bio tako siguran.
Not so much anymore.	Ne više toliko.
I can't do that often	Ne mogu to često da radim
I know what's going on here	Znam šta se ovde dešava
It shouldn't be like that.	Ne bi trebalo tako.
I love her, but it's too much.	Volim je, ali to je previše.
She looks like you.	Izgleda kao ti.
I can tell you right now	Mogu vam to reći odmah
But you have to give me everything you have.	Ali moraš mi dati sve što imaš.
I'm glad I finished it	Drago mi je što sam to završio
Maybe he would go further.	Možda bi otišao i dalje.
Maybe yes, maybe no.	Možda da, možda ne.
It was him or us.	Bio je on ili mi.
I knew we shouldn't	Znao sam da nismo trebali
You gave me everything.	Dao si mi sve.
I hope you come back and see me again	Nadam se da ćeš se vratiti i vidjeti me ponovo
From things.	Od stvari.
I think she would tell me that	Mislim da bi mi to rekla
I think that's a good question.	Mislim da je to dobro pitanje.
Which it is.	Što i jeste.
What if that.	Šta ako to.
If not, we have a problem.	Ako ne, imamo problem.
I hope you will believe me	Nadam se da ćeš mi vjerovati
He knows what he's talking about.	On zna o čemu priča.
I think you should do that	Mislim da bi to trebalo da uradiš
I asked them if they could help me.	Pitao sam ih da li bi mi mogli pomoći.
I'm not good for you	Nisam dobar za tebe
I haven't heard from you in a while.	Nisam te čuo neko vrijeme.
I haven't seen that before	To nisam ranije vidio
I shouldn't have come	Nisam trebao doći
I think he wanted me to see that	Mislim da je želio da to vidim
But we didn't do it.	Ali mi to nismo uradili.
I've probably never done it as well as you	Vjerovatno to nikad nisam radio tako dobro kao ti
That is very, very difficult.	To je veoma, veoma teško.
Father was also there.	Tamo je bio i otac.
She looks like that.	Ona tako izgleda.
Maybe better than ever, ever.	Možda bolje od bilo koga, ikada.
If it's them.	Ako su to oni.
I loved that thing.	Voleo sam tu stvar.
I couldn't do without you	Ne bih mogao bez tebe
I just had to make sure it wasn't me	Samo sam morao biti siguran da to neću biti ja
I'm so sorry this happened to you	Tako mi je žao što ti se ovo dogodilo
I knew everything he wanted to tell me	Znao sam sve što je htio da mi kaže
I will never be happy again.	Nikada više neću biti sretan.
I don't know if you know this.	Ne znam da li znaš ovo.
He needs time.	Treba mu vremena.
The only way to do that was quickly.	Jedini način da se to uradi bilo je brzo.
I know how much he loves you	Znam koliko te voli
I would love that	Voleo bih to mnogo
No, we didn't.	Ne, nismo.
But it happened.	Ali to se dogodilo.
Nothing is happening here.	Ovde se ništa ne dešava.
They would be.	Bili bi.
Something seemed to be wrong.	Činilo se da nešto nije u redu.
I ask them how it was	Pitam ih kako je bilo
I do not want anything.	Ne želim ništa.
Maybe more now.	Možda više sada.
That's what I wanted	Tako sam to htela
You don't have to do this alone.	Ne morate ovo da radite sami.
I don't need money.	Ne treba mi novac.
Not why, just how.	Ne zašto, samo kako.
There was no time for this.	Nije bilo vremena za ovo.
It was my lucky day.	To je bio moj sretan dan.
But it's not just there.	Ali to nije samo tamo.
I have to be better than that	Moram biti bolji od toga
And he is absolutely right to do so.	I potpuno je u pravu što to čini.
This is happening now.	Ovo se sada dešava.
It was very safe.	Bilo je vrlo sigurno.
Bad, just bad.	Loše, jednostavno loše.
This was my real problem.	Ovo je bio moj pravi problem.
I want to do this.	Želim ovo da uradim.
I wanted my story to be good.	Želeo sam da moja priča bude dobra.
No, they couldn't.	Ne, nisu mogli.
We do everything!.	Radimo sve!.
You never got lost.	Nikad se nisi izgubio.
I knew it had to be you	Znao sam da si to morao biti ti
I thought you wanted to be alone	Mislio sam da želiš biti sam
I was actually a little sorry	Zapravo mi je bilo malo žao
I hope you have something good for me	Nadam se da imaš nešto dobro za mene
It has been easy for me so far	Bilo mi je lako do sada
There is nothing more than that.	Nema ništa više od toga.
I would buy it just to have it.	Kupio bih ga samo da imam.
This was actually a good thing.	Ovo je zapravo bila dobra stvar.
But there would be more.	Ali bilo bi još toga.
I told him the truth	Rekao sam mu istinu
Maybe not now, but it would.	Možda ne sada, ali bi.
He really did what was needed.	Zaista je uradio ono što je trebalo.
Can anyone help.	Može li neko pomoći.
That will be good.	To će biti dobro.
I love my job.	Ja volim svoj posao.
He will even give you money.	Čak će vam dati novac.
He told me this.	Ovo mi je rekao.
I still can’t believe this is happening	Još uvijek ne mogu vjerovati da se ovo dešava
I never said anything about it	Nikad nisam rekao ništa o tome
But now you have to tell me the truth.	Ali sada mi moraš reći istinu.
But now that it is.	Ali sada kada jeste.
You and your father.	Ti i tvoj otac.
I didn't know if he would	Nisam znao da li bi
I see what you did there	Vidim šta si tamo uradio
That seems to be the idea.	Izgleda da je to ideja.
I would be glad.	Bilo bi mi drago.
That will do it.	To će to učiniti.
If it's good.	Ako je dobro.
Anything to do.	Bilo šta da se radi.
I hope he does everything you want.	Nadam se da radi sve što i vi želite.
I wish I could do that.	Voleo bih da to mogu da uradim.
I didn’t expect this to happen so quickly	Nisam očekivao da će se ovo dogoditi tako brzo
I will stay and help here	Ja ću ostati i pomoći ovdje
I thought you left	Mislio sam da si otišao
It was time for work.	Bilo je vrijeme za posao.
But he would understand it.	Ali on bi to shvatio.
It was very easy.	Bilo je vrlo lako.
I didn't know what he was talking about	Nisam znao o čemu priča
We can't do this.	Ovo ne možemo učiniti.
She just doesn't live.	Ona jednostavno ne živi.
But there is another reason.	Ali postoji još jedan razlog.
We both know this.	Ovo oboje znamo.
I won't let him do anything to you	Neću dozvoliti da ti bilo šta uradi
I'm still here who knows how many	Tu sam još ko zna koliko
I wouldn't want to know that.	Ne bih to htela da znam.
I was thinking of you today	Mislio sam na tebe danas
We have a few days.	Imamo nekoliko dana.
He promised me he would.	Obećao mi je da će to učiniti.
I just didn't hear you came	Samo nisam čuo da si došao
I haven't seen you in a long time	Nisam te dugo video
This was pretty easy.	Ovo je bilo prilično lako.
I can not believe	Ne mogu vjerovati
I know you don't like it.	Znam da ti se ne sviđa.
I decided to go home, alone	Odlučio sam da idem kući, sam
This time it's real.	Ovaj put je stvarno.
I'm sure everything will be fine	Siguran sam da će sve biti u redu
I was just thinking, you know.	Samo sam mislio, znaš.
I think you're right too.	Mislim da si i ti u pravu.
I still have it.	Još ga imam.
I don't know anything before that	Ne znam ništa prije toga
He can help you.	On ti može pomoći.
They weren't it could be more.	Nisu bili to može biti više.
You are in.	Ti si u.
He was so sure of himself.	Bio je tako siguran u sebe.
I had no idea you could do this	Nisam imao pojma da možeš ovo da uradiš
I hope this helps.	Nadam se da će ovo pomoći.
They are still there.	I dalje su tamo.
And he will stay here.	I ovdje će ostati.
Yesterday again.	Jučer ponovo.
There is.	Ima.
I really like it.	Stvarno mi se sviđa.
Which it was.	Što je i bilo.
I've never seen them before	Nikad ih prije nisam vidio
I worked for this money.	Radio sam za ovaj novac.
I want to, still.	Želim, još uvijek.
It's like here and like here.	To je kao ovdje i kao ovdje.
And no, you couldn't.	I ne, nisi mogao.
I would do anything to be with you	Sve bih uradio da budem s tobom
I shouldn't have seen him	Nisam ga trebao vidjeti
I'll help you here.	Ja ću ti pomoći ovdje.
I was as surprised as he was	Bio sam iznenađen kao i on
We're doing this together.	Radimo ovo zajedno.
I have to tell you.	Moram ti reći.
And that's no better.	I to nije ništa bolje.
I wasn't sure I wanted her to know	Nisam bio siguran da želim da ona zna
And he was ready for that.	I za to je bio spreman.
Not that he needs to talk.	Nije da treba da govori.
I never thought you'd come back	Nikad nisam mislio da ćeš se vratiti
I ask everything now.	Sve pitam sada.
I was right about him	Bio sam u pravu za njega
Very soon.	Vrlo skoro vrijeme.
We can't see that.	Ne možemo to vidjeti.
That's something.	To je nešto.
I was not completely surprised	Nisam bio potpuno iznenađen
I'm sure you'll be safe here	Siguran sam da ćete ovdje biti sigurni
I decided not to tell him anything at the moment.	Odlučio sam da mu trenutno ništa ne kažem.
I will be everything to you	Ja ću ti biti sve
Nobody ever told us anything.	Niko nam nikad ništa nije rekao.
You're not doing this.	Ne radiš ovo.
I hope it helps you	Nadam se da vam je od pomoći
I couldn't see well enough	Nisam mogao dovoljno dobro da vidim
You know your job.	Znate svoj posao.
Things can happen fast.	Stvari se mogu dogoditi brzo.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ne znam šta mi je.
In fact, we have three.	U stvari, imamo ih tri.
Really people, it's a game.	Zaista ljudi, to je igra.
Someone is there.	Neko je tamo.
That's very good for me.	To je jako dobro za mene.
She is fine now.	Ona je sada dobro.
She was here.	Bila je ovdje.
That is exactly what it is.	To je upravo ono što je.
I have no idea what this is about	Nemam pojma o čemu se radi
And he lives.	I živi.
It's very real.	Veoma je stvarno.
I won't do it again	Neću to više raditi
But it was not so.	Ali nije bilo tako.
Just tell me that.	Samo mi to reci.
People are there.	Ljudi su tamo.
This will definitely help.	Ovo će sigurno pomoći.
I'm sure he'll be fine by now.	Siguran sam da će do sada biti dobro.
And he is right.	I u pravu je.
No one would say anything.	Niko ništa ne bi rekao.
There or not.	Tu ili ne.
She didn't even know where they were.	Nije ni znala gdje su.
I don't know much about that.	Ne znam puno o tome.
That was her.	To je bila ona.
This year.	Ove godine.
We work well together.	Dobro radimo zajedno.
Apparently he was already there.	Očigledno je već bio tamo.
She has to do it herself.	Ona to mora uraditi sama.
Not a very good job.	Nije baš dobar posao.
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
This is all a story.	Sve je ovo priča.
It's hard now.	Sada je to teško.
I could never go back	Nikad se ne bih mogao vratiti
I have a little too	I ja imam malo toga
I should have been here earlier	Trebao sam biti ovdje ranije
I could see.	Mogao sam da vidim.
That is not happening yet.	To se još ne dešava.
We can go home now.	Možemo sada kući.
You, me, we can't do this alone.	Ti, ja, ne možemo ovo sami.
It works for you.	Radi za tebe.
They shouldn't have been.	Nisu trebali biti.
Only one will.	Samo jedan hoće.
I can't do that, not now	Ne mogu to, ne sada
This is going to be hard.	Ovo će biti teško.
I can come anywhere and anytime.	Mogu doći bilo gdje i u bilo koje vrijeme.
Even if it’s bad, even if it’s really bad.	Čak i ako je loše, čak i ako je stvarno loše.
I am glad that you are well.	Drago mi je da ste dobro.
We will not do that.	Nećemo to učiniti.
I couldn't bring him back either	Ni ja ga nisam mogao vratiti
I won't believe it	Neću vjerovati u to
I don't know everything.	Ne znam sve.
Pretty much, actually.	Prilično, zapravo.
I can't stay here anymore	Ne mogu više ostati ovdje
I know about that	Znam za to
I still don't see anything	I dalje ne vidim ništa
This was a job.	Ovo je bio posao.
Something is happening.	Nešto se dešava.
It seemed to work.	Činilo se da radi.
That was really about it.	To je zaista bilo o tome.
But that's the problem.	Ali to je problem.
It was not a good day.	Nije bio dobar dan.
She's just like me.	Ona je baš kao ja.
Maybe it won't be bad.	Možda neće biti loše.
I wasn't sure how much to tell him	Nisam bio siguran koliko da mu kažem
I've asked you so many times	Pitao sam te toliko puta
There were several of them.	Bilo ih je nekoliko.
That has to be done.	To se mora uraditi.
I just couldn't find him.	Jednostavno ga nisam mogao naći.
That didn't happen.	To se nije dogodilo.
We know that, now.	Znamo to, sada.
I can never come to your house again	Ne mogu ti više nikada doći kući
Everything is so hard.	Sve je tako teško.
I loved her too much for that.	Voleo sam je previše za to.
It was good money at the time.	U to vrijeme je to bio dobar novac.
I really like it here.	Stvarno mi se sviđa ovdje.
I didn't and I won't.	Nisam i neću.
I went to work today, as usual	Otišao sam danas na posao, kao i obično
You have to come.	Moraš doći.
But in a good way.	Ali na dobar način.
I wish it was, but it wasn't	Voleo bih da jeste, ali nije
I was wondering what you were doing tonight	Pitao sam se šta radiš večeras
He didn't even know what to say.	Nije znao ni šta da kaže.
I know what he's doing	Znam šta radi
He simply is.	On jednostavno jeste.
I'm ready to pray	Spreman sam da molim
I need some time	Treba mi malo vremena
I have too.	I ja imam.
I don't want him there.	Ne želim ga tamo.
He heard it just today.	Čuo je to upravo danas.
That's all she can do.	To je sve što ona može.
And so he must do.	I tako mora da uradi.
It's not that simple.	Nije tako jednostavno.
Nobody knew who was right.	Niko nije znao ko je u pravu.
I wasn't like them	Nisam bio kao oni
I did not know that.	Nisam to znao.
I can only tell you this	Mogu ti reći samo ovo
I thought it looked good	Mislio sam da dobro izgleda
I really needed this money	Stvarno mi je trebao ovaj novac
I'll be able to meet	Moći ću se naći
This has happened so many times.	Ovo se dogodilo toliko puta.
I want to know what you think	Želim da znam šta misliš
I like the idea.	Sviđa mi se ideja.
This is not so.	Ovo nije tako.
I couldn't have said it better myself.	Ni sam to ne bih mogao bolje reći.
I still couldn’t believe we were doing this	Još uvijek nisam mogao vjerovati da ovo radimo
I really like him	On mi se stvarno sviđa
And it's all good.	I sve je to dobro.
That's what we did.	Tako smo i uradili.
That would be hard enough.	To bi bilo dovoljno teško.
I’ve made it a lot of times	Napravio sam ga puno puta
I didn't even think.	Nisam ni mislio.
What is happening seems very simple.	Ono što se dešava izgleda vrlo jednostavno.
There is a real problem.	Postoji pravi problem.
It wasn't you.	To nisi bio ti.
I like to be alone	Volim biti sam
That was my father.	To je bio moj otac.
That time is not now.	To vrijeme nije sada.
But he obviously thought he could.	Ali očigledno je mislio da i sam može.
That's what it's about.	O tome se radi.
But there is more.	Ali ima još toga.
You just said that.	Upravo si to rekao.
But maybe not.	Ali, možda i nije.
There was no one.	Nije bilo nikoga.
I don't know when and how	Ne znam kada i kako
Neither you nor he.	Ni ti ni on.
Now it seemed I couldn't do that either.	Sada se činilo da ni to ne mogu učiniti.
And do it again.	I uradi to ponovo.
You can't see me.	Ne možeš me vidjeti.
There is nothing without it.	Nije ništa bez toga.
I love being a guy.	Volim biti momak.
I am very good.	Ja sam jako dobar.
And no one saw anything.	I niko ništa nije video.
He asked for it.	On je to tražio.
Just no, no, no.	Samo ne, ne, ne.
These are all.	Ovo su svi.
He won't tell me why.	Neće mi reći zašto.
This never happened	Ovo se nikada nije dogodilo
It's not safe.	Nije sigurno.
I knew what it looked like	Znao sam kako to izgleda
I think you should go home now	Mislim da bi sada trebao ići kući
They didn't even tell us about it.	Nisu nam ni rekli o tome.
I won't always be here	Neću uvek biti ovde
What will happen?	Šta će se dogoditi?
I brought him back	Vratio sam ga
You can't now.	Sada ne možeš.
I wondered how he knew all that	Pitao sam se kako on sve to zna
They shouldn't have.	Nisu trebali.
I didn't want him to come to you	Nisam želeo da dođe do tebe
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
I'm glad this is happening.	Drago mi je da se ovo dešava.
He didn't want it to be easy.	Nije želio da bude lako.
That is what it is about.	To je ono o čemu se radi.
I don't see how bad that can be for you	Ne vidim kako to može biti loše za tebe
I didn't know what else to say	Nisam znao šta više da kažem
He said for sure.	Rekao je sigurno.
It works without problems.	Radi bez problema.
I can tell you that.	Mogu ti to reći.
I guess you know what happened	Pretpostavljam da znate šta se dogodilo
And I don't like them	I ja ih ne volim
And my father was.	I moj otac je bio.
He has nothing.	On nema ništa.
I guess that's the real problem	Pretpostavljam da je pravi problem
I couldn't see him, but he was there	Nisam ga mogao vidjeti, ali on je bio tu
I would like to know.	Voleo bih da znam.
And here we can do a lot.	I ovdje možemo učiniti mnogo.
But that's not actually true.	Ali to zapravo nije istina.
No, that's for sure	Neću, to je sigurno
I mean, obviously that has to be done.	Mislim, očigledno je da se to mora uraditi.
I mean, everyone will tell you that.	Mislim, svi će ti to reći.
And that really happened.	I to se zaista i dogodilo.
Now you want it again.	Sada želite to ponovo.
We will be.	Ćemo biti.
Not that she was.	Nije da je bila.
She didn't want to do it.	Nije htela to da uradi.
But that's just me.	Ali to sam samo ja.
I had to see him again	Morao sam ponovo da ga vidim
Which he didn't have.	Što nije imao.
As it says.	Kako se kaže.
I should have left many years ago	Trebao sam otići prije mnogo godina
It's a good deal if you can get it.	To je dobar posao ako ga možete dobiti.
But it's more than that, it has to be.	Ali to je više od toga, mora biti.
I know you do.	Znam da znaš.
But he tells me he does it often.	Ali on mi kaže da to često radi.
You could stay.	Mogao bi ostati.
I can't go on without you	Ne mogu dalje bez tebe
I'm not sure what the reason is	Nisam siguran koji je razlog tome
I just had to see it	Samo sam to morao vidjeti
I thought that just happened.	Mislio sam da se to upravo dogodilo.
Maybe even a little.	Možda čak i malo.
I'm almost there.	Skoro sam tamo.
I won't say he didn't try	Neću reći da nije pokušao
He is never tired.	Nikad nije umoran.
You can see that there.	To možete vidjeti tamo.
I have no idea who he is	Nemam pojma ko je on
I came yesterday	Došao sam juče
I asked him what was going on	Pitao sam ga šta se dešava
I was happy to do that	Bio sam sretan što sam to uradio
I have enough for both.	Imam dovoljno za oboje.
My friend would be welcome	Dobro bi mi došao prijatelj
I could buy this.	Mogao bih ovo kupiti.
This is pretty fast.	Ovo je prilično brzo.
I really have no idea why.	Zaista nemam pojma zašto.
I've never seen them.	Nikad ih nisam video.
I wondered that too	I ja sam se to pitao
But this is true.	Ali ovo je istina.
It really was like he knew.	Zaista je bilo kao da je znao.
I asked her what she was doing	Pitao sam je šta radi
I guess it's that simple.	Pretpostavljam da je to tako jednostavno.
He could tell how well it was going.	Mogao je reći koliko dobro ide.
Nobody wanted her.	Niko je nije želeo.
I should have come to you	Trebao sam doći do tebe
I didn't think he said something like that before.	Nisam mislio da je tako nešto ranije rekao.
I came to help me	Došao sam da mi pomogne
I know who you are now	Znam ko si sada
They are always together.	Oni su uvek zajedno.
You would know more.	Znao bi više.
They were there for a while.	Bili su tamo neko vrijeme.
I knew what you wanted	Znao sam šta želiš
I will tell him everything.	Reći ću mu sve.
I am very easy to find.	Veoma me je lako naći.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Ne mogu, ne mogu, ne mogu.
That's just it.	To je samo to.
I'm not sure anyone really knows.	Nisam siguran da neko zaista zna.
I know it's not you.	Znam da nisi ti.
I haven't been that long	Nisam tako dugo
I still wasn’t sure who it should be	Još uvijek nisam bio siguran koji bi to trebao biti
I haven't had it in a while	Nisam to imao neko vrijeme
I mean, the sooner the better	Mislim, što prije, to bolje
That is a good idea.	To je dobra ideja.
What would you do?	Šta bi ti uradio.
No one can know.	Niko ne može znati.
I never thought this day would happen	Nikad nisam mislio da će se ovaj dan dogoditi
But no one knows anything.	Ali niko ništa ne zna.
Maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong.	Možda su u pravu, možda nisu u pravu.
I didn't have to say anything	Nisam morao ništa da kažem
I'm not sure how much.	Nisam siguran koliko.
I just never went home.	Samo nikad nisam otišao kući.
I can't do that to him	Ne mogu mu to učiniti
But the first one was still there.	Ali prvi je još bio tamo.
She was here and he wasn't.	Ona je bila ovdje, a on nije.
A person.	Osoba.
And we did.	I to smo uradili.
I wouldn't expect that	Ne bih to očekivao
But this is better.	Ali, ovo je bolje.
Nobody saw him.	Niko ga nije video.
She can do it.	Ona to može.
I had no money with me	Nisam imao novca kod sebe
I'm sure it is.	Siguran sam da jeste.
This is not easy.	Ovo nije jednostavno.
Never more than now	Nikad više nego sada
Went to work.	Otišao na posao.
They are bad for work.	Loše su za posao.

And the door.	I vrata.
I knew you were sure	Znao sam da si siguran
Don't tell me she's not here.	Nemoj mi reći da ona nije ovdje.
That's what was needed here.	To je ono što je ovdje trebalo.
What could be better?!.	Šta bi moglo biti bolje?!.
This time, not so much.	Ovaj put, ne toliko.
I wish you were too, but you're not.	Voleo bih da si i ti, ali nisi.
I can't believe you didn't even tell him	Ne mogu vjerovati da mu nisi ni rekao
I really expected you to	Stvarno sam očekivao da hoćeš
I think you should go	Mislim da bi trebao ići
Someone should be home.	Neko bi trebao biti kod kuće.
But obviously he can’t be where he isn’t.	Ali očigledno ne može biti tamo gdje nije.

Really very good question	Zaista veoma dobro pitanje
And they could easily.	I lako bi mogli.
Now to work.	Sada na posao.
I doubt he told the truth	Sumnjam da je rekao istinu
It was so good to be with him again.	Bilo je tako dobro ponovo biti s njim.
It's just me.	Samo sam ja.
I wish you were still here	Voleo bih da si još uvek ovde
I figured it out tonight	Shvatio sam to večeras
It was really bad for a few days.	Bilo je jako loše nekoliko dana.
Or maybe you don't know.	Ili možda ne znaš.
This could be a problem.	Ovo bi mogao biti problem.
You don't know what you saw.	Ne znaš šta si video.
It must be so.	To mora biti tako.
He didn't tell me anything.	Nije mi ništa rekao.
Tom wasn't sure what to do.	Tom nije bio siguran šta da radi.
It wouldn't be right.	Ne bi bilo u redu.
I can't be here.	Ne mogu biti ovdje.
I thought it was.	Mislio sam da jeste.
It's hard for me today.	Danas mi je teško.
I did this a few more times.	Uradio sam ovo još nekoliko puta.
I still couldn't believe it	Još uvijek nisam mogao vjerovati
I hope it works.	Nadam se da radi.
He himself does not know what it is.	On sam ne zna šta je to.
For now, there’s nothing he doesn’t like.	Za sada ne postoji ništa što mu se ne sviđa.
No more time.	Nema više vremena.
I hope it's good	Nadam se da je dobro
He was with us.	Bio je sa nama.
I'm not here.	Nema mene.
I told him.	rekao sam mu.
I'll tell you.	Ja ću vam reći.
My game was pretty good.	Moja igra je bila prilično dobra.
I probably would too	Verovatno bih i ja bio
This was not good.	Ovo nije bilo dobro.
They should be.	Trebali bi biti.
I never realized that	Nikad to nisam shvatio

I wondered why he did it	Pitao sam se zašto je to uradio
It shouldn't be hard.	Ne bi trebalo biti teško.
I won't see them, but	Neću ih vidjeti, ali
I wouldn't even know what to say.	Ne bih ni znao šta da kažem.
I'm not sure what to do.	Nisam baš siguran šta da radim.
And now you're here.	A sada si tu.
Or as safe as he's ever been.	Ili siguran kao što je ikada bio.
I wasn't sure in any way	Nisam bio siguran ni na koji način
Like he wants something.	Kao da nešto želi.
I had nothing to do.	Nisam imao šta da radim.
I couldn't tell anyone about this	Nisam mogao nikome reći za ovo
I didn't want to be home	Nisam htela da budem kod kuće
And I think that's how it should be	I ja mislim da bi tako trebalo biti
It took a while.	Trebalo je neko vrijeme.
It's not just me.	Nisam samo ja.
They told him more than ever.	Rekli su mu više od bilo koga.
Now I have many, many ideas	Sada imam mnogo, mnogo ideja
See you here next year.	Ovdje se vidi sljedeće godine.
I promised to find her there	Obećao sam da ću je naći tamo
I know what she says is true	Znam da je istina ono što ona govori
We can not.	Ne možemo.
I was always there for him	Uvek sam bila tu za njega
This guy is going.	Ovaj momak ide.
I didn't expect a lot of people.	Nisam očekivao puno ljudi.
I see you're back	Vidim da si se vratio
He couldn't tell.	Nije mogao reći.
I love you both more than you will ever know	Volim vas oboje više nego što ćete ikada znati
I hope you didn't.	Nadam se da nisi.
I think they are what life is	Mislim da su oni ono što je život
The money is there.	Novac je tu.
It's not.	Nije.
But he could do it.	Ali on je to mogao.
I gave him so much	Toliko sam mu dao
I'll stay here while your father needs me.	Ja ću ostati ovdje dok me tvoj otac bude trebao.
I told you everything would be fine	Rekao sam ti da će sve biti u redu
Which was better.	Što je bilo bolje.
That is my first problem.	To je moj prvi problem.
You don't know what you're doing.	Ne znaš šta radiš.
And now, to work.	A sada, na posao.
He didn't know what else he could do.	Nije znao šta više može učiniti.
So he created more problems for himself.	Tako je sebi napravio još problema.
But it shouldn't have been.	Ali, nije trebalo biti.
Yes, he will.	Da, hoće.
I'm here, he said.	Ovdje sam, rekao je.
I hope this helps you	Nadam se da vam je ovo od pomoći
I mean, obviously that has to be done	Mislim, očigledno je da se to mora uraditi
That's probably what's wrong with me.	To je vjerovatno ono što nije u redu sa mnom.
I had no idea who it was	Nisam imao pojma ko je to
It is not a question of whether or not it really is.	Nije pitanje da li zaista jeste ili nije.
We just can't see it.	Jednostavno ga ne možemo vidjeti.
It doesn't work that way.	To ne radi tako.
Can someone help me do that please.	Može li mi neko pomoći da to uradim molim vas.
This is not an easy time.	Ovo nije lako vrijeme.
And he wanted it to be her.	I želio je da to bude ona.
Me more than him.	Ja više nego on.
There is enough money there.	Tamo ima dovoljno novca.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim da je to dobra stvar.
I didn't get any further	Nisam stigao dalje
Do do do do do do.	Do do do do do do.
Maybe he would.	Možda bi.
He wants it very much.	On to jako želi.
It's hard, we all know that.	Teško je, to svi već znamo.
I didn't really want her here	Nisam je stvarno želio ovdje
They were.	Bili su.
He really wasn't.	On zaista nije bio.
It wasn't now.	Sada nije bilo.
I just wish there were more	Samo bih volio da ih je više
No one is ever good or bad.	Niko nikada nije dobar ili loš.
He would be really good at it.	Bio bi stvarno dobar u tome.
I know it's for me	Znam da je za mene
I was still surprised.	I dalje sam bio iznenađen.
It's not easy.	To nije lako.
I knew exactly what to say, when to say it	Tačno sam znao šta da kažem, kada da kažem
I would never be like him	Nikad ne bih bio kao on
Everything was good.	Sve je bilo dobro.
He had to go home.	Morao je kući.
I wasn't sure what to say.	Nisam bio siguran šta da kažem.
I was bad enough for this	Bilo mi je dovoljno loše za ovo
I didn't even understand	Nisam ni shvatio
I asked what was true	Pitao sam šta je istina
I need someone who knows what he's doing	Treba mi neko ko zna šta radi
He's gone, he's gone.	Otišao je, otišao je.
That is a very good idea.	To je jako dobra ideja.
The man is still not talking.	Čovjek još uvijek ne govori.
I think they are both right	Mislim da su oboje u pravu
He got his money.	Dobio je svoj novac.
From now on.	Od sada.
He could do something.	Mogao bi i da uradi nešto.
Probably not for that long.	Vjerovatno ni ne tako dugo.
I knew this was not true	Znao sam da ovo nije istina
I've never seen anyone do something like that before	Nikada prije nisam vidio da neko radi tako nešto
The reason I ask is this.	Razlog zašto pitam je ovo.
We have him.	Imamo ga.
I'm sure he'll be fine	Siguran sam da će biti dobro
I a.	I a.
But not this year.	Ali ne ove godine.
We had no idea.	Nismo imali pojma.
And for now, that was enough.	I za sada je to bilo dovoljno.
We are nothing.	Mi smo ništa.
Pretty good thing.	Prilično dobra stvar.
I think.	Mislim, da.
Nothing happened without it.	Ništa se nije dogodilo bez toga.
Maybe someone can help me.	Možda mi neko može pomoći.
I don't want to know anymore.	Ne želim više da znam.
And now he's gone.	A sada ga nema.
He heard something.	Čuo je nešto.
It was not difficult to do this.	Nije bilo teško ovo uraditi.
I didn't know what was going on	Nisam znao šta se dešava
As if it were.	Kao da je bilo.
Just tell him.	Samo mu reci.
I was nothing anymore	Nisam više bio ništa
We are not together.	Nismo zajedno.
Maybe there is more to it than we know.	Možda ima više toga nego što znamo.
I thought it was as hard as it could have been	Mislio sam da je teško koliko je moglo biti
I never wanted that	Nikada to nisam želeo
I want you all to myself for a few days	Želim vas sve za sebe nekoliko dana
All bad things simply.	Sve loše stvari jednostavno.
I wanted him to just leave	Želio sam da jednostavno ode
It was good for everyone.	Bilo je dobro za sve.
You tell us.	Ti nam reci.
I know you did this	Znam da si ovo uradio
I couldn't see it ever happening	Nisam mogao da vidim da se to ikada dešava
I don't like it at all	Uopšte mi se ne sviđa
It will come of its own accord.	Doći će samo od sebe.
It just works.	Samo radi.
I'll have one too.	I ja ću jedan.
It was more than him.	Bilo je više od njega.
But only for today.	Ali samo za danas.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
We did everything we could.	Uradili smo sve što smo mogli.
But that was not true.	Ali to nije bila istina.
I wasn’t too happy they could do that.	Nisam bio previše sretan što su to mogli.
He had nothing to give me.	Nije imao ništa da mi da.
Either you have to do something, or something has to be done to you.	Ili morate nešto učiniti, ili vam se nešto mora učiniti.
The problem is that it isn't.	Problem je što nije.
I gave you everything.	Dao sam ti sve.
I told him the truth and only the truth	Rekao sam mu istinu i samo istinu
Mine arrived first.	Moj je stigao prvi.
He said very little.	Rekao je vrlo malo.
I could work with you	Mogao bih raditi s tobom
I was tired, that was all	Bio sam umoran, to je bilo sve
I wouldn't expect anything yet	Ne bih još ništa očekivao
I just wish you weren't	Samo bih volio da nisi
This is more than real now.	Ovo je sada više nego stvarno.
I thought you'd be here by now	Mislio sam da ćeš biti ovdje do sada
I mean, really, it wasn’t much.	Mislim, stvarno, nije bilo mnogo.
I don't know what happened	Ne znam šta se dogodilo
You would too.	I ti bi bio.
No, you can't go there.	Ne, ne možeš tamo.
I want to be there for you	Želim biti tu za tebe
I see you, but it's not like before	Vidim te, ali nije kao prije
Why did this happen?	Zašto se to dogodilo?
They were something.	Oni su bili nešto.
I hope it will be good	Nadam se da će biti dobro
He has a problem.	On ima problema.
It was something.	Bilo je to nešto.
But now she knew what she was thinking.	Ali sada je znala šta misli.
I just wanted more from him	Samo sam htela više od njega
He shouldn't be here.	On ne bi trebao biti ovdje.
It has to work.	Mora da radi.
He didn't do it.	On to nije uradio.
And it always works well	I uvek to dobro radi
It could only come from him.	To je moglo doći samo od njega.
He was a very good friend of mine.	Bio mi je veoma dobar prijatelj.
You could say things are wrong.	Moglo bi reći da stvari nisu u redu.
I wouldn't say yes, I wouldn't say no.	Ne bi rekla da, ne bi rekla ne.
We needed a lot.	Trebalo nam je dosta.
I like the idea of ​​it	Sviđa mi se ideja o tome
It was hard to win.	Bilo je teško pobijediti.
I didn't expect it from you	Nisam očekivao od tebe
No money.	Bez novca.
We only need one.	Treba nam samo jedan.
She just told me she was doing it.	Jednostavno mi je rekla da to radi.
He doesn't really do anything.	Zapravo ne radi ništa.
We had nothing.	Nismo imali ništa.
I didn't know what was wrong with you	Nisam znao šta je s tobom
None of this could have happened.	Ništa od toga se nije moglo dogoditi.
It's time for this.	Vrijeme je za ovo.
I think we can do much better.	Mislim da možemo mnogo bolje.
I will not do that.	Neću to učiniti.
But we are here today.	Ali danas smo tu.
I really couldn't say	Zaista ne bih mogao reći
Maybe he didn't have it.	Možda ga nije imao.
I like this.	Volim ovo.
But for how long.	Ali koliko dugo.
You are not.	Ti nisi.
In fact, it is not.	U stvari, nije.
He did it.	On je to radio.
I should know.	Trebalo bi da znam.
But that is no longer good enough.	Ali to više nije dovoljno dobro.
It seems to work.	Čini se da radi.
That was better.	To je bilo bolje.
I am all you are	Ja sam sve što si ti
I think you should find someone	Mislim da bi trebao naći nekoga
This is what you need to work on.	Ovo je ono na čemu treba da radite.
I may not know tomorrow.	Možda neću znati sutra.
I actually like it a lot.	Zapravo mi se mnogo sviđa.
And he doesn't have it.	A on ga nema.
And so on.	I tako dalje.
It should have been three.	Trebalo je biti tri.
But it still works.	Ali i dalje radi.
This can only be good	Ovo može biti samo dobro
This was not my year.	Ovo nije bila moja godina.
I should probably have gone home	Verovatno sam trebao ići kući
I can be a better man for you	Mogu biti bolji čovjek za tebe
I thought it would be me	Mislio sam da ću to biti ja
It's really easy.	Zaista je lako.
I won't do anything	Neću ništa učiniti
I need to see what she really wants	Moram da vidim šta ona zaista želi
I wonder where he really lives	Pitam se gdje on zaista živi
I think that was exactly what it was	Mislim da je upravo to bilo
I will never leave you	Nikada neću otići od tebe
Now or ever.	Sada ili ikada.
That's exactly how it should be.	Upravo tako i treba da bude.
I won't let you do that	Neću ti dozvoliti da to uradiš
I'd say it's mine	Rekao bih da je moj
They really are better.	Zaista su bolji.
But it was not so.	Ali nije bilo tako.
Not only that.	Ne samo to.
That was not for me.	To nije bilo za mene.
No, that would be yesterday.	Ne, to bi bilo juče.
I asked him again and he said he didn't know	Pitao sam ga ponovo i rekao je da ne zna
It never was and never will be.	Nikada nije bilo i nikada neće biti.
I am very happy about that.	Veoma sam sretan zbog toga.
But that was my job.	Ali to je bio moj posao.
I know what he means, but he's wrong	Znam šta misli, ali nije u pravu
Business, she says.	Posao, kaže ona.
I can't find him now.	Ne mogu ga sada naći.
I was in it.	Bio sam u tome.
No one was right.	Niko nije bio u pravu.
I want to see it again.	Želim to ponovo vidjeti.
But that doesn't happen.	Ali to se ne dešava.
I went to him	Otišao sam do njega
I couldn't do it alone	Ne bih mogao sam
Would it really be that hard?	Da li bi to zaista bilo tako teško?
not such an easy question, is it ?.	nije tako lako pitanje, zar ne?.
I really didn't know what to think	Zaista nisam znao šta da mislim
It may be helpful.	Možda vam bude od pomoći.
That could come.	To bi moglo doći.
Not really.	Ne baš.
Everything seems to be fine.	Izgleda da je sve u redu.
He's too good.	Previše je dobar.
I haven't even gone home yet	Nisam još ni otišao kući
I've never heard of that before.	Nikada ranije nisam čuo da se to dešava.
So it has to.	Tako da mora.
I didn't even have one	Nisam ni imao
I never got to that.	Nikad nisam stigao do toga.
John told me that.	John mi je to rekao.
And there we were.	I tu smo bili.
Everyone is safe.	Svi su sigurni.
I'm afraid not	Bojim se da nećemo
I would understand that	Ja bih to shvatio
I still can't believe it	Još uvijek ne mogu vjerovati
I was still not happy about it.	I dalje nisam bio sretan zbog toga.
I expected this, but not so fast	Očekivao sam ovo, ali ne tako brzo
Nobody knew who we were.	Niko nije znao ko smo mi.
I want to go so badly.	Toliko želim da idem.
And it can, very easily.	A može, vrlo lako.
Let me tell you how it was.	Da ti kažem kako je bilo.
Only my father knew.	Samo je moj otac znao.
It should be simple enough.	Trebalo bi biti dovoljno jednostavno.
He needed to say something.	Trebao je nešto reći.
I was never sure.	Nikad nisam bio siguran.
I said we could in any way.	Rekao sam da možemo na bilo koji način.
I know all about what you did	Znam sve o tome šta si uradio
There as a reason.	Tu kao razlog.
They had it.	Imali su to.
I should be with him	Trebao bih biti s njim
You can never be more than you already are.	Nikada ne možete biti više nego što već jeste.
There is nothing good.	Nema ništa dobro.
I think it's pretty simple	Mislim da je to prilično jednostavno
We better not know.	Bolje je da ne znamo.
I just want to know who you are	Samo želim da znam ko si ti
I don’t know why it works, but it works.	Ne znam zašto radi, ali radi.
Now I can take them anywhere.	Sada mogu gdje ih bilo gdje.
I didn't even want to see you	Nisam ni htela da te vidim
I know it's going to happen	Znam da će se to dogoditi
I'm almost as surprised as you are	Iznenađen sam skoro kao i ti
But it has to be done.	Ali to se mora uraditi.
But not yet.	Ali ne još.
We'll talk about that now.	Sada ćemo razgovarati o tome.
I can't believe how easy this is	Ne mogu vjerovati koliko je ovo lako
I don't know if that's true.	Ne znam da li je to istina.
We know that now.	Znamo to sada.
I thought you saw them	Mislio sam da si ih vidio
There is something else.	Ima još nešto.
Not for him.	Nije za njega.
No one came to see me.	Niko nije došao da me vidi.
I don't.	Ja ne.
I think it will be good	Mislim da će biti dobro
I know what's going on	Znam šta se dešava
I just don't see it.	Ja to jednostavno ne vidim.
I was glad it wasn't	Bilo mi je drago što nije
I know what he sees	Znam šta on vidi
My father gave me enough.	Otac mi je dao dovoljno.
I thought it was very good	Mislio sam da je jako dobro
So much really.	Toliko zaista.
But she wasn't there.	Ali ona nije bila tamo.
I love you now and always	Volim te sada i uvek
Something else.	Još nešto.
But it's just me.	Ali to sam samo ja.
I just bought it.	Upravo sam ga kupio.
But that's the problem here.	Ali to je problem ovdje.
Not more than him.	Ne više od njega.
But not here.	Ali ne ovde.
I have no idea what this could be.	Nemam pojma šta bi ovo moglo biti.
This is before.	Ovo je prije.
I didn't expect this to come.	Nisam očekivao da će ovo doći.
I know you probably have something to do	Znam da verovatno imaš nešto što treba da uradiš
There are a lot of them here.	Ima ih dosta ovde.
She didn't say what.	Nije rekla šta.
I just said I could	Samo sam rekao da može
I would have to see her again	Morao bih da je vidim ponovo
I'm so glad for both of you.	Tako mi je drago zbog vas oboje.
I don't know why you're doing this to me.	Ne znam zašto mi to radiš.
There won't be enough for everyone.	Neće biti dovoljno za sve.
I'm sure she knows things are wrong.	Siguran sam da ona zna da stvari nisu u redu.
He was there, but now much further away.	Bio je tu, ali sada mnogo dalje.
How do we know.	Kako da znamo.
This is not an all or nothing problem.	Ovo nije problem sve ili ništa.
I have more than enough	Imam više nego dovoljno
I never loved them.	Nikada ih nisam voleo.
I already know what you meant	Već znam šta si htela da kažeš
I like that everyone is at home.	Volim da su svi kod kuće.
He loves me.	On me voli.
I needed this.	Trebalo mi je ovo.
I didn't even know she was wearing it	Nisam ni znao da ga nosi
How is it there.	Kako je tamo.
I saw things.	Video sam stvari.
I didn't even know that much about it	Nisam ni znao toliko o tome
I want him to be his own man.	Želim da bude svoj čovjek.
I will never do that again	Nikad to više neću učiniti
Not in a good way.	Na ne dobar način.
I couldn't do that	Nisam mogao to da uradim
I didn't see her do that	Nisam je vidio da to radi
I see her more than you	Vidim je više nego ti
It's pretty simple.	To je prilično jednostavno.
I should go with you.	Trebao bi ići s tobom.
I thought before, but not like that.	Mislio sam i ranije, ali ne tako.
That will be us.	To ćemo biti mi.
When it happened, it happened very quickly.	Kada se to dogodilo, dogodilo se veoma brzo.
Like me, actually.	Kao i ja, u stvari.
So are we.	I mi smo.
I do not know.	Ne znam.
I shouldn't have told you that	Nisam ti to trebao reći
Not so much this year.	Ove godine ne toliko.
I really think so.	Zaista mislim da jeste.
I asked and she said she was fine	Pitao sam i rekla je da je dobro
And it just doesn’t exist.	I jednostavno ne postoji.
I will be.	Biti ću .
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
And he was pretty good with it.	I on je bio prilično dobar s tim.
But he didn't say that.	Ali on to nije rekao.
I wonder why he did it	Pitam se zašto je to uradio
I don't want that for anyone.	Ne želim to nikome.
Someone could help there.	Neko bi tamo mogao pomoći.
I did just that.	Uradio sam upravo to.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Činilo se da sve ide dobro.
I never do that.	Ja to nikad ne radim.
I have to be.	Moram biti.
I was in a few.	Bio sam u nekoliko.
You should, but you may not.	Trebao bi, ali možda neće.
I told you that's all we have	Rekao sam ti da je to sve što imamo
I can't say what she thinks	Ne mogu da kažem šta ona misli
I doubt she knows anything at all	Sumnjam da ona uopšte nešto zna
I'm afraid to tell you	Bojim se da ti kažem
Even a few.	Čak nekoliko.
I did the right thing	Radio sam pravu stvar
Tell me something.	Reci mi nešto.
That's what I expected	Toliko sam i očekivao
Few people know that.	Malo ljudi to zna.
I'm not like you	Ja nisam kao ti
I want to be better for both of you	Želim da budem bolji za vas oboje
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
Neither would he.	Ne bi ni on.
It's not like you.	To nije kao ti.
Soon he could no longer see him.	Uskoro ga više nije mogao vidjeti.
I want people to know it's mine	Želim da ljudi znaju da je moja
How and when.	Kako i kada.
He's still here with us.	Još uvijek je ovdje sa nama.
You have to win here, you know.	Ovdje moraš pobijediti, znaš.
I heard him talk about it	Čuo sam ga kako priča o tome
So let's work.	Tako da radimo.
I never asked for money	Nikad nisam tražio novac
I couldn’t believe he was doing this to me	Nisam mogao vjerovati da mi to radi
It would be easy.	Bilo bi lako.
I have you here.	Imam te ovde.
I wasn't sure what to say	Nisam bio siguran šta da kažem
I couldn't go on	Nisam mogao dalje
I thought nothing of it.	Nisam mislio ništa o tome.
You can come back with us.	Možete se vratiti s nama.
I hope they bring me back	Nadam se da će me vratiti
Maybe I don't like it	Možda mi se i ne sviđa
I have something	Ja imam nešto
As you are now.	Kao što si sada.
It could be anything, really.	Moglo bi biti bilo šta, zaista.
I didn't want to see them	Nisam želeo da ih vidim
I didn't ask for that.	Nisam to tražio.
He said the following	Rekao je sljedeće
I knew he couldn't tell me no	Znao sam da mi ne može reći ne
They were there so fast.	Bili su tamo tako brzo.
I would like to see you.	Voleo bih da te vidim.
I didn't want to know.	Nisam htela da znam.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
I mean, it's that simple.	Mislim, tako je jednostavno.
But it was hard to work with him.	Ali bilo je teško raditi s njim.
You know.	Ti znaš.
I had a bad time because of it	Imao sam loše vrijeme zbog toga
I like to see that.	Volim da to vidim.
You have to tell me	Moraš mi reći
I didn't do this for myself	Nisam ovo uradio za sebe
I really know.	Zaista znam.
It can't be easy.	Ne može biti lako.
It will happen.	To će se dogoditi.
That's just me.	To sam samo ja.
You're not sure here.	Ovdje niste sigurni.
You just left.	Upravo si otišao.
I wish people knew.	Voleo bih da ljudi znaju.
There's nothing wrong with that.	Ništa loše u tome.
I just can't believe it.	Jednostavno ne mogu vjerovati.
No idea what will come.	Nema pojma šta će doći.
Maybe he just could.	Možda bi samo mogao.
This is the way to do it.	Ovo je način na koji to treba učiniti.
Will you tell us that you will do it.	Da li ćete nam to reći da ćete uraditi.
That's what he really did.	To je ono što je on zaista radio.
I had to work, but they didn't	Morao sam da radim, ali oni nisu
None of that.	Ništa od toga.
I saw it right there.	Video sam to upravo tamo.
It doesn't do anything.	Ne radi ništa.
You should talk to him.	Trebao bi razgovarati s njim.
He's not like us.	On nije kao mi.
It will always be so.	Tako će uvijek biti.
There is so much we can do.	Toliko toga možemo uraditi.
Maybe they could still.	Možda bi još mogli.
He knows he's not.	On zna da nije.
You just have to do something.	Samo treba nešto da uradiš.
He saw what he did and what he didn't.	Video je šta radi, a šta ne.
I can't believe he's actually mine	Ne mogu vjerovati da je on zapravo moj
I know you didn't do it	Znam da to nisi uradio
He couldn't help himself now.	Sada si nije mogao pomoći.
It is now or never.	Sada je ili nikad.
I've had enough.	Dosta mi je toga.
I had no idea what to think	Nisam imao pojma šta da mislim
I just don't know enough.	Samo ne znam dovoljno.
It could be any question, really.	Moglo bi biti bilo koje pitanje, zaista.
I want everyone alive for a while	Želim da su svi živi neko vrijeme
Tell me it's not you.	Reci mi da nisi ti.
He had no idea which one.	Nije imao pojma koje.
None of us eat.	Niko od nas ne jede.
It was only a matter of time.	Bilo je samo pitanje vremena.
I should have gone earlier	Trebao sam ići ranije
I did a lot of things	Uradio sam mnogo stvari
We had no idea what to do.	Nismo imali pojma šta da radimo.
But he could tell he wanted to come.	Ali mogao je reći da želi doći.
I should be with you	Trebao bih biti s tobom
He didn't know if there was time.	Nije znao da li ima vremena.
Maybe it's still about that.	Možda se još radi o tome.
I did the job myself	Sam sam uradio posao
You know what to do.	Znaš šta treba da uradiš.
We couldn't tell anyone.	Nismo mogli nikome reći.
And they are here.	I oni su ovdje.
I had to tell myself that	Morao sam to sebi reći
That's too much for me.	To je previše za mene.
In fact, he was.	U stvari, bio je.
They had none of that.	Nisu imali ništa od toga.
That in itself is enough.	To je samo po sebi dovoljno.
I see a lot of people	Vidim puno ljudi
He was too tired to talk more.	Bio je previše umoran da više priča.
This is actually happening.	To se zapravo dešava.
It's not enough.	Nije dovoljno.
It's even better.	Čak je i bolje.
I would love to see her again	Voleo bih da je ponovo vidim
And everything will simply be.	I sve će jednostavno biti.
He just works.	On jednostavno radi.
He says he doesn't know.	Kaže da ne zna.
I just couldn’t say it.	Jednostavno nisam mogao to reći.
That's the way to talk.	Na taj način se priča.
I see that no one is.	Vidim da niko nije.
I have no idea why this is happening so fast	Nemam pojma zašto se ovo dešava tako brzo
I really didn't want to believe it	Zaista nisam htio vjerovati
I didn’t think that time would come so quickly	Nisam mislio da će to vrijeme doći tako brzo
I've been here before.	Bio sam ovdje prije.
Not a few times	Nekoliko puta nije
It just seems that way to us.	Samo nama se tako čini.
I guess you'll be there too	Pretpostavljam da ćeš i ti biti tamo
I guess he's just tired this morning	Pretpostavljam da je jutros samo umoran
This one isn't it.	Ovaj nije to.
I didn't see what you got	Nisam video šta imaš
I see so much myself	Toliko i sam vidim
Behind you.	I za tebe.
I'm not sure why.	Nisam siguran zašto.
Nothing was too much of a problem.	Ništa nije bilo previše problema.
I heard.	Čuo sam.
I know how the game works	Znam kako igra radi
I really should go back to school	Stvarno bih se trebao vratiti u školu
I've been for a long time	Bio sam dugo vremena
I guess that makes it all of us	Pretpostavljam da to čini sve nas
I wish there was more to it.	Voleo bih da je više toga.
I know how to get there	Znam kako do tamo
I guess we did everything well	Pretpostavljam da smo sve dobro uradili
I'm afraid he'll come at me	Bojim se da će doći na mene
I expected to know right away.	Očekivao sam da ću odmah znati.
It was not like that for us.	Za nas nije bilo tako.
I'm glad you're here.	Drago mi je da si ovdje.
That's not a problem.	To nije problem.
I was very surprised to hear what happened	Bio sam veoma iznenađen kada sam čuo šta se dogodilo
Yes, it's so hard.	Da, tako je teško.
And this was not it.	A ovo nije bilo to.
But that is unlikely.	Ali to je malo vjerovatno.
I knew there had to be something	Znao sam da mora biti nešto
That's right.	Tako je.
Time is simply not with us.	Vrijeme jednostavno nije s nama.
But it is.	Ali jeste.
I still had nothing to say	I dalje nisam imao šta da kažem
We have to do it or we won't.	Moramo to učiniti ili nećemo.
I have to get back to that	Moram se vratiti u to
Do it for you.	Uradi to za tebe.
I mean, this was it.	Mislim, ovo je bilo.
You don't look.	Ne izgledaš.
Maybe that was true.	Možda je to bila istina.
I won't be helpful.	Neću biti od pomoći.
We have that too.	Imamo i to.
I know this is a completely simple and obvious question	Znam da je to potpuno jednostavno i očigledno pitanje
She knows that.	Ona to zna.
I've seen it before.	Video sam to ranije.
Really fast, really.	Zaista brzo, jako.
I know you got it back.	Znam da si ga vratio.
I think we're better together	Mislim da nam je bolje zajedno
We are real people.	Mi smo pravi ljudi.
Now, not so much.	Sada, ne toliko.
I'm going to see her	Idem da je vidim
I just decided it couldn't be you	Samo sam odlučio da to ne možeš biti ti
I want this.	Želim ovo.
I say something about what's happening to me	Ja kažem nešto o tome šta se dešava sa mnom
I'm fine here.	Dobro sam ovde.
They are not the only ones.	Oni nisu jedini.
I hope you can	Nadam se da ćeš moći
I don't know anything about that.	Ne znam ništa o tome.
He's yours.	On je tvoj.
I started to love him	Počeo sam da ga volim
I didn't need it.	Nije mi trebao.
There are very few of us so far.	Za sada nas je jako malo.
But maybe you could have done it.	Ali možda ste to mogli učiniti.
I could do a lot.	Mogao sam dosta toga.
I wasn't sure what he meant	Nisam bio siguran na šta je mislio
It seems to be going.	Čini se da ide.
People are people are people.	Ljudi su ljudi su ljudi.
And maybe there is.	A možda i ima.
I should have known something like that was going to happen	Trebao sam znati da će se tako nešto dogoditi
I didn't know there was such a thing	Nisam znao da tako nešto postoji
But she can't.	Ali ona ne može.
There will be no more.	Neće ih biti više.
You can see them here and here.	Možete ih vidjeti ovdje i ovdje.
I worked for it.	Radio sam za to.
That it just couldn't be true.	Da to jednostavno ne može biti istina.
You obviously don't know anything about it.	Vi očigledno ne znate ništa o tome.
Father never has time for us.	Otac nikad nema vremena za nas.
That's what you do.	To je ono što ti radiš.
You are her.	Ti si ona.
It was still there.	I dalje je bilo tamo.
It wasn't better tomorrow.	Nije bilo bolje sutra.
It shouldn’t be that hard.	To ne bi trebalo biti tako teško.
Not just good.	Ne samo dobro.
I don't want you to say anything	Želim da ništa ne kažeš
I'm afraid so	Bojim se da jeste
I have been here several times, many years ago	Bio sam ovdje nekoliko puta, prije mnogo godina
I could never bring her back	Nikada je nisam mogao vratiti
I came home and nothing was good without you	Vratio sam se kući i ništa mi nije bilo dobro bez tebe
But even that time is too much.	Ali čak i to vrijeme je previše.
No, I wouldn't.	Ne, ne bi.
Tell me what you decided.	Reci mi šta si odlučio.
No, no, not us.	Ne, ne, ne mi.
It is.	Da jeste.
I'm not your friend or anything	Nisam ti prijatelj ili tako nešto
There is a good reason for that.	Za to postoji dobar razlog.
But he's not there now.	Ali sada nije tamo.
I hope to be back, but the question is when	Nadam se da ću se vratiti, ali pitanje je kada
I told him he could leave at any time	Rekao sam mu da može otići bilo kada
They must be them.	Mora da su oni.
All this is allowed.	Sve ovo je dozvoljeno.
I lost too many people	Izgubio sam previše ljudi
I was busy there for a while	Bio sam zauzet tamo neko vrijeme
I shouldn't have trusted him	Nisam mu trebao vjerovati
I'm done.	Završio sam.
You look busy.	Izgledaš kao da si zauzet.
A question for you.	Pitanje za vas.
I think he said that himself.	Mislim da je i sam to rekao.
I hope this will not be difficult	Nadam se da ovo neće biti teško
I can help you too	Mogu vam pomoći i sebi
So easy for me.	Tako lako za mene.
I want to know what the problem is.	Želim da znam u čemu je problem.
I just thought you wanted to know.	Samo sam mislio da bi htela da znaš.
I need to know what's going on	Moram da znam šta se dešava
You should know that.	Trebao bi to znati.
I think that's enough	Mislim da je to dovoljno
I wonder if he's happy.	Pitam se da li je sretan.
I just said that.	Upravo sam to rekao.
I know you didn't mean anything bad.	Znam da nisi mislio ništa loše.
I would love to see that	Voleo bih to da vidim
I have something to do now	Imam nešto da radim sada
I looked for them, but I couldn't find them	Tražio sam ih, ali ih nisam mogao naći
It's working well now.	Sada radi dobro.
I want to be with you so much	Toliko želim da budem sa tobom
This has not happened before.	To se ranije nije dogodilo.
Maybe he'll be back soon.	Možda će se uskoro vratiti.
I felt sorry for him	Bilo mi ga je žao
I did my best to work today	Dao sam sve od sebe da radim danas
I won't do it this time	Neću to učiniti ovaj put
But he didn't see her.	Ali on je nije vidio.
I knew it was going to be hard	Znao sam da će biti teško
I didn't do anything to you	Nisam ti ništa uradio
I won't talk about that today.	Neću više o tome danas.
It was my lucky day.	Bio je to moj sretan dan.
That's how I wanted to see you again	Tako sam htela da te ponovo vidim
I say, enough.	Kažem, dosta.
You have everything.	Imaš sve.
There is still something wrong.	Još uvijek nešto nije u redu.
I knew it was him	Znao sam da je to bio on
And neither will this one.	A neće ni ovaj.
I hope you're good too.	Nadam se da si i ti dobar.
He knows what he has.	On zna šta ima.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žao.
He was with it.	Bio s tim.
That's for you.	To je za vas .
And we wouldn't know.	A mi ne bismo znali.
I saw him last night.	Video sam ga sinoć.
I'm ready for it	Ja sam spreman za to
Not like before.	Ne kao nekada.
I think you've said enough.	Mislim da si dovoljno rekao.
It wasn't just him.	Nije bio samo on.
I was surprised, but	Bio sam iznenađen, ali
I asked him what would happen if he didn't	Pitao sam ga šta će se dogoditi ako ne učini
I thought you were the problem, not me	Mislio sam da si ti problem, ne ja
I am moving on.	Idem dalje.
He knew what we were.	Znao je šta smo.
I always knew that	Uvek sam to znao
I knew this was going to happen	Znao sam da će se ovo dogoditi
He never knew who he was	Nikad nije znao ko je on
Nice to see you all here.	Drago mi je da vas sve vidim ovdje.
I just want money	Samo želim novac
She told me she loved me.	Rekla mi je da me voli.
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
I wasn't sorry	Nije mi je bilo žao
I was safe and secure	Bio sam siguran i siguran
I can't say.	Ne mogu reći.
As if that would ever happen.	Kao da će se to ikada dogoditi.
Not this year.	Ne ove godine.
You don't look like that to me.	Ne izgledaš mi tako.
This is much better.	Ovo je mnogo bolje.
I just want you to be well	Samo želim da ti bude dobro
I've got one.	Imam jedan.
I hope this helps you.	Nadam se da će vam to pomoći.
No, it has to go.	Ne, mora da ide.
That's so bad.	To je tako loše.
Like her.	Kao i ona.
It just goes.	To jednostavno ide.
It's just a good job.	To je samo dobar posao.
I'm that someone.	Ja sam taj neko.
He is afraid.	On se boji.
I didn't and I was glad	Nisam i bilo mi je drago
I want to go there.	Želim da idem tamo.
I can't do that for both of us	Ne mogu to za nas oboje
He really left.	On je zaista otišao.
I'm sorry, she said again.	Žao mi je, rekla je ponovo.
I can't do anything wrong	Ne mogu ništa loše da uradim
I will return.	Ja ću vratiti.
Nobody knew why.	Niko nije znao zašto.
I can't tell you more than that	Ne mogu vam reći više od toga
I was ready to love him	Bio sam spreman da ga volim
When it's time.	Kad je vrijeme.
I didn't have time for that anymore	Nisam više imao vremena za to
I always have a problem with that	Uvek imam problema sa tim
In a good way.	Na dobar način.
I'm done with that.	Završio sam s tim.
It can work for several days.	To može raditi nekoliko dana.
It has everything.	Ima sve.
I think that's enough.	Mislim da je dovoljno.
I know you know.	Znam da znaš.
He had no money now.	Sada mu više nije bilo novca.
Work on yourself.	Radite na sebi.
You can't go back.	Ne možeš se vratiti.
I wonder where he is	Pitam se gdje je
To be that year again.	Da ponovo budem te godine.
I thought it was a good idea at the time	Mislio sam da je to bila dobra ideja u to vrijeme
I know how he feels.	Znam kako se osjeća.
But I never did.	Ali nikad nisam.
I've never done anything before.	Nikad ništa ne radim ranije.
I know you wanted that	Znam da si to htela
I don't know anything about that	Ne znam ništa o tome
I have everything tonight	Večeras imam sve
But now she knew better.	Ali sada je znala bolje.
I was as happy as I could be	Bio sam sretan koliko mogu
I searched and searched	Tražio sam i tražio
This could be done very easily.	To bi se moglo uraditi vrlo lako.
It really does exist.	Zaista postoji.
I want to be me again	Želim ponovo biti ja
That was real enough.	To je bilo dovoljno stvarno.
And that's just what we know.	I to je samo ono za koje znamo.
I am glad.	Drago mi je.
But so it was.	Ali tako je i bilo.
is he you 	jesi li on ti?
Or something bad.	Ili nešto loše.
It is hard to say that this is a good thing.	Teško se može reći da je ovo dobra stvar.
I couldn't let that happen	Nisam to mogao dozvoliti
I could never do that.	Nikad to ne bih mogao.
There's just nothing I can do here.	Jednostavno ne mogu ništa učiniti ovdje.
And that would be enough.	I to bi bilo dovoljno.
They will talk.	Oni će razgovarati.
But that was many years ago.	Ali to je bilo prije mnogo godina.
I hope you really like it	Nadam se da ti se stvarno sviđa
There is no one tonight.	Večeras nema nikoga.
I want to see them.	Želim da ih vidim.
But we need to go further.	Ali treba ići dalje.
I know it was fast	Znam da je to bilo brzo
I really want you to	Zaista ti to želim
I just didn't realize how much	Samo nisam shvatio koliko
But for me.	Ali za mene.
I'm not sure why that is.	Nisam siguran zašto je to tako.
It was easy, but it took time.	Bilo je lako, ali je trebalo vremena.
I couldn't believe this.	Nisam mogao vjerovati u ovo.
I really hope something will come of it.	Zaista se nadam da će nešto biti od toga.
Besides, nothing can be said.	Osim toga, ništa se ne može reći.
Maybe it's not over yet.	Možda još nije završio.
He never does much.	On nikada ne radi mnogo toga.
I should have gone home	Trebao sam ići kući
I can't say that.	Ne mogu to reći.
He was the only one.	On je bio jedini.
Probably nothing, but he couldn't be sure.	Vjerovatno ništa, ali nije mogao biti siguran.
And much more.	I mnogo više.
I wasn't there for you	Nisam bio tamo zbog tebe
There was nothing that I could do.	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim.
And you're right.	I u pravu si.
I do not want anything.	Ne želim ništa.
Maybe it was nothing.	Možda nije bilo ništa.
I knew he was trying to see what was wrong	Znao sam da pokušava vidjeti šta nije u redu
One here and one there.	Jedan ovde i jedan tamo.
I didn't have to do this alone	Nisam morao ovo da radim sam
I just wasn't entirely sure what was what	Samo nisam bio potpuno siguran šta je šta
Oh last night.	O sinoć.
That wasn't exactly true.	To baš i nije bila istina.
This is fine for now.	Ovo je u redu za sada.
I know exactly what you're doing	Znam tačno šta radiš
That may be true.	To je možda tačno.
It's been a long time, for sure.	Bilo je to dugo vremena, sigurno.
I haven't even seen her yet	Nisam je još ni vidio
I want to be like her	Želim da budem kao ona
I thought of that too	I ja sam mislio na to
I certainly never have	Ja sigurno nikad nisam
When you think something, just say it.	Kad nešto misliš, samo reci.
We're only human, you know.	Mi smo samo ljudi, znaš.
I love what you do!.	Volim ono što radiš!.
It's hard for me.	Teško mi je.
I just need something.	Samo mi treba nešto.
He did not know what he was looking for.	Šta je tražio, nije znao.
We never told anyone.	Nikada nikome nismo rekli.
I really need to know how to do it	Zaista moram znati kako to učiniti
It always works.	To uvijek radi.
I didn’t mean any of it that way	Nisam ništa od toga mislio na taj način
They are here.	Oni su ovde.
I certainly didn't want that	Ja to sigurno nisam htela
But only that.	Ali samo to.
I didn’t say it was actually happening	Nisam rekao da se to zapravo dešava
Not much more.	Ne mnogo više.
I took it as a yes	Ja sam to shvatio kao da
I know it's hard for you now	Znam da ti je sada teško
Even that was difficult.	Čak je i to bilo teško.
Maybe I can do something for you.	Možda ću moći nešto učiniti za tebe.
I didn't ask him again	Nisam ga ponovo pitao
I love this car.	Volim ovaj auto.
He wasn't sure he ever would.	Nije bio siguran da će ikada.
But this was not the only story.	Ali ovo nije bila jedina priča.
I don't seem to see anything	Čini se da ne vidim ništa
Maybe not.	Možda nisi.
I am nothing, and he is everything.	Ja sam ništa, a on je sve.
I didn't know either	Ni ja nisam znao
This is actually happening.	Ovo se zapravo dešava.
I love it all with you	Volim sve to kod tebe
The question is who knew.	Pitanje je ko je znao.
I made it for you	Napravio sam ga za tebe
I didn't have many friends	Nisam imao mnogo prijatelja
It's not just that.	Nije samo to.
While she.	Dok ona.
Nobody said anything.	Niko ništa nije rekao.
We didn't have much money.	Nismo imali puno novca.
You have nothing to tell me.	Nema šta da mi kažeš.
She was right for me.	Bila je u pravu za mene.
I hope you stay with us.	Nadam se da ćeš ostati sa nama.
It's easy for us.	Lako nam je.
I have a lot of things to do	Imam puno stvari za uraditi
He must come.	On mora doći.
It should be.	Trebao bi biti.
I would think.	mislio bih.
I knew exactly what he was going to do tonight	Tačno sam znao šta će raditi večeras
I'm sure he knew what he was talking about.	Siguran sam da je znao o čemu govori.
I shouldn't have told him	Nisam mu trebao reći
I didn't see him here tonight	Nisam ga vidio ovdje večeras
Much more, but not with us	Mnogo više, ali ne kod nas
There are so many people.	Ima toliko ljudi.
He's just going.	On samo ide.
I thought she wanted to talk too	Mislio sam da i ona želi razgovarati
I couldn't go to school today	Danas ne bih mogao ići u školu
He did it for me.	On je to uradio za mene.
Please don't anymore.	Molim te, nemoj više.
I really knew where they were	Zaista sam znao gdje su
I wished none of that had ever happened	Voleo sam da se ništa od toga nikada nije dogodilo
I couldn't believe it was her	Nisam mogao vjerovati da je to ona
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I have to be more than sure	Moram biti više nego siguran
I will probably never see them again.	Vjerovatno ih više nikada neću vidjeti.
It's true.	To je tačno.
Not long.	Nije dugo.
You don't have to do anything.	Ne moraš ništa da radiš.
And that is life itself.	A to je sam život.
I love it too.	I ja to volim.
I couldn't let him do that	Nisam mu mogao dozvoliti da to uradi
I can't in any way.	Ne mogu ni na jedan način.
You certainly can't be that.	To sigurno ne možeš biti.
I didn't want to tell him anything	Nisam mu htio ništa reći
What happened should not have happened.	Ono što se dogodilo nije se trebalo dogoditi.
I have another appointment	Imam još jedan sastanak
I am always the first to tell him everything	Ja sam uvijek prvi koji će mu sve reći
Everyone knows them.	Svi ih znaju.
This was very, very bad.	Ovo je bilo jako, veoma loše.
I mean, he was fine	Mislim, bio je u redu
So it is with us.	Tako je i sa nama.
I would tell you	Rekao bih ti
I had to know the truth	Morao sam znati istinu
Everything as.	Sve kao.
I didn't even do anything wrong	Nisam čak ni uradio ništa loše
All of us.	Svi mi.
And I loved that.	I to sam voleo.
Or you already know the truth.	Ili već znate istinu.
There were a lot of people.	Bilo je puno ljudi.
We have almost everything.	Imamo skoro sve.
A lot.	Mnogo.
Tell me what's wrong.	Reci mi šta nije u redu.
I was sorry for him	Bilo mi je žao zbog njega
We don't.	Mi ne.
He said so	On je tako rekao
Someone has to.	Neko mora.
There was probably a lot of that.	Verovatno je bilo dosta toga.
Do this now.	Uradite ovo odmah.
I could still see him	Još sam ga mogao vidjeti
But he would.	Ali on bi.
But it still looks like a good deal.	Ali i dalje izgleda kao dobar posao.
I probably never will	Vjerovatno nikad neću
I am you, completely	Ja sam ti, potpuno
I'll be better this time	Ovaj put ću biti bolji
And it didn't.	I nije.
Apparently he's been here a long time.	Očigledno je tu već jako dugo.
But you heard her.	Ali čuo si je.
You just couldn't see it.	Jednostavno to nisi mogao vidjeti.
I knew what he was planning	Znao sam šta planira
I don't know what to say now.	Ne znam šta da kažem sada.
I don't know who it is	Ne znam ko je to
But he said nothing.	Ali nije rekao ništa.
We did everything we could.	Uradili smo sve što smo mogli.
And it almost works.	I skoro da radi.
I want more than that.	Želim više od toga.
I think he just needs time.	Mislim da mu samo treba vremena.
Except they're not.	Osim što nisu.
I heard nothing more	Nisam čuo ništa više
I'm working on it now	Sada radim na tome
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
I thought everything was fine	Mislio sam da je sve u redu
I just want you to know that nothing happened last night	Samo želim da znaš da se ništa nije dogodilo sinoć
That's life.	To je život.
I was with him on that	Bio sam sa njim na tome
And she knew what she had to do.	I znala je šta mora da uradi.
I haven't got home yet	Još nisam stigao kući
But he has to.	Ali mora.
I really needed a new car	Stvarno mi je trebao novi auto
I can't stay here anymore	Ne mogu više ostati ovdje
I'm not sure what happened there, but something.	Nisam siguran šta se tamo dogodilo, ali nešto.
She was right.	Bila je u pravu.
I just heard.	Upravo sam čuo.
I really didn't want this	Zaista nisam htela ovo
He would be.	On bi bio.
Not so bad.	Nije baš tako loše.
We will not leave.	Nećemo otići.
I didn't know anything about what he wanted	Nisam znao ništa o tome šta želi
I have to tell him about it	Moram mu reći o tome
Before or now.	Prije ili sada.
I always have something to say	Uvek imam nešto da kažem
They were now.	Sada su bili.
It's not for us.	Nije za nas.
I would love that.	volio bih to.
I have nothing more to say here	Nemam više šta da kažem ovde
You want them.	Ti ih želiš.
You can do it well.	Možeš ti to dobro.
I didn't want to tell him that	Nisam htela da mu to kažem
I didn't mean it.	Nisam mislio.
But I never would.	Ali nikad ne bih.
And work on it.	I radi na tome.
I never did.	Nikad nisam.
I see it there	Vidim to tamo
That was the question.	To je bilo pitanje.
No one will come after me.	Niko neće doći za mnom.
They would never know if he was good or bad.	Nikada ne bi znali da li je dobar ili loš.
As a team.	Kao tim.
I love him while we have him	Volim ga dok ga imamo
I went with him to one	Otišao sam s njim u jedan
He's just doing his job.	On samo radi svoj posao.
I was safe there.	Tamo sam bio siguran.
You have to leave.	Moraš otići.
I was quite surprised.	Bio sam prilično iznenađen.
But it cannot be.	Ali to ne može biti.
But not much.	Ali ne mnogo.
I doubt he could	Sumnjam da bi mogao
I didn't see what was being played.	Nisam video šta se svira.
But now I have another problem.	Ali sada imam još jedan problem.
I won't talk like that.	Neću tako razgovarati.
I never heard of it again	Nikada više nisam čuo o tome
I could see her working there	Mogao sam je vidjeti kako tamo radi
He told you he still loved you, he just couldn't stay here.	Rekao ti je da te još uvijek voli, samo nije mogao ostati ovdje.
Nobody knows everything.	Niko ne zna sve.
She will say something.	Ona će nešto reći.
I have a lot of things to do	Imam mnogo stvari da uradim
But actually, you're not.	Ali u stvari, niste.
I just knew they couldn’t be for me	Samo sam znao da ne mogu biti za mene
I want to say that.	Želim to reći.
As if that would happen.	Kao da bi se to dogodilo.
I had no idea who she was	Nisam imao pojma ko je ona
I didn't know what he meant	Nisam znao šta misli
And it doesn't work.	I to ne radi.
We have that now.	To sada imamo.
We know how to do it.	Znamo kako to da uradimo.
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
He says we need to talk.	Kaže da moramo razgovarati.
I didn't have long.	Nisam imao dugo.
It looks fine.	Izgleda u redu.
I love you only for you	Volim te samo zbog tebe
I know he told you that, but it wasn't true	Znam da ti je to rekao, ali to nije bila istina
I can't get to that.	Ne mogu doći do toga.
I want that.	Želim to.
That would be good.	To bi bilo dobro.
This time he does.	Ovaj put pravi.
He wasn't sure now.	Sada nije bio siguran.
And talk.	I razgovarati.
I asked him how to get the money	Pitao sam ga kako do novca
But that doesn’t plan them for you right away.	Ali to vam ih ne planira odmah.
I have no more money	Nemam više novca
I just don't know how yet.	Samo još ne znam kako.
That is easy.	To je lako.
He knew he had to say something more.	Znao je da mora reći nešto više.
Me too.	I ja sam.
It works so far.	To do sada radi.
You never knew what he was going to do.	Nikad nisi znao šta će da uradi.
All right, do it again.	U redu, uradi to ponovo.
That was pretty good.	To je bilo prilično dobro.
But it must be true.	Ali mora da je tačno.
I knew exactly what he was thinking	Tačno sam znao šta misli
But that is not enough.	Ali to nije dovoljno.
I have no friends.	Nemam prijatelja.
I can't say how anyone could know.	Ne mogu reći kako bi neko mogao znati.
And it's not true.	I nije istina.
We just have a meeting.	Samo imamo sastanak.
I want to be as far away as possible	Želim da budem što dalje
I saw you do it.	Video sam da to radiš.
And if we don't work, we're fine with that.	I da ne radimo, u redu smo s tim.
Apparently we're not the only ones.	Očigledno nismo jedini.
Now he wants more and more.	Sada želi sve više i više.
I thought we had something	Mislio sam da imamo nešto
And so on, and so forth.	I tako dalje, i tako dalje.
I am all you can be	Ja sam sve što možeš biti
She can't do that.	Ona to ne može da uradi.
Maybe a little further	Možda malo dalje
I should have been reached earlier.	Trebalo je ranije doći do mene.
He will not allow it.	On to neće dozvoliti.
I didn't have any more	Nisam imao više
And you can't be better.	I ne možeš biti bolji.
I was a little surprised.	Bio sam malo iznenađen.
Much of what she said was true	Mnogo toga što je rekla bilo je istina
Simple and easy.	Jednostavno i lako.
But we can if we have to.	Ali možemo ako treba.
As before.	Kao i prije.
You still can.	Još uvek možeš.
I can't see.	Ne mogu da vidim.
I have no idea why he's here	Nemam pojma zašto je ovdje
It can be done, easily.	Može se, lako.
They will for sure.	Oni će sigurno.
It was pretty good.	Bilo je prilično dobro.
There will be another one soon.	Uskoro će biti još jedan.
I never loved him very much	Nikada ga nisam mnogo voleo
And the video looks good.	I video izgleda dobro.
I'm not surprised you don't say anything.	Nisam iznenađen što ništa ne kažeš.
There were none.	Nije ih bilo.
I always had to do it alone	Uvek sam to morao da radim sam
I haven't seen you in a while.	Nisam te vidio neko vrijeme.
I was ready for this	Bio sam spreman za ovo
That won't help.	To neće pomoći.
Not this one.	Ne ovaj.
I really should have done this last night	Zaista sam trebao ovo uraditi sinoć
You have to tell me more.	Moraš mi reći više.
I didn't know you had it in you	Nisam znao da imaš to u sebi
He hasn't come home yet.	Još nije došao kući.
I want you to know everything	Želim da znaš sve
He wondered who he was.	Pitao se ko je on.
Not very good.	Ne baš dobro.
There is still time.	Još ima vremena.
I didn't mean that.	Nisam to mislio.
I can tell you more further.	Mogu vam reći više dalje.
I saw everything.	Video sam sve.
Maybe in its own way it is.	Možda na svoj način i jeste.
I'm good at it.	Dobar sam u tome.
You got this.	Dobio si ovo.
I didn't have time for that	Nisam imao vremena za to
It was really, really good.	Bilo je stvarno, stvarno dobro.
I love it with you	Volim to kod tebe
This is real.	Ovo je stvarno.
Now more than ever before.	Sada više nego ikada prije.
Maybe you're right.	Možda ste u pravu.
This one isn't.	Ovaj nije.
The question is simple.	Pitanje je jednostavno.
He's really into it.	On je stvarno u tome.
I didn't want to be completely alone	Nisam htela da budem potpuno sama
It was so bad this time.	Ovaj put je bilo tako loše.
You will find me	Naći ćeš me
I never gave my problem to anyone	Nikada nikome nisam dao svoj problem
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
And she's like.	I ona je kao.
I thought it was pretty good	Mislio sam da je prilično dobro
In fact, it was better that way.	U stvari, tako je bilo bolje.
I want to be like you.	Želim da budem kao ti.
I can give you everything you need and more	Mogu ti dati sve što ti treba i više
Is that right.	Je li tako.
I’m glad we did what we did.	Drago mi je što smo uradili to što smo uradili.
Yes, it's you.	Da, to si ti.
We were alone.	Bili smo sami.
He wanted them there.	Želio ih je tamo.
You didn't do anything.	Nisi ništa uradio.
He just loved to play	Samo je volio da se igra
You shouldn't even be here.	Ne bi trebalo ni biti ovdje.
You have a job.	Imaš posao.
It was afternoon.	Bilo je popodne.
I was sure he was there.	Bio sam siguran da je tamo.
Nobody said it was easy.	Niko nije rekao da je lako.
We didn't have time for this.	Nismo imali vremena za ovo.
We'll meet there right away.	Naći ćemo se tamo odmah.
She was something.	Ona je bila nešto.
And we don't need him to see us.	I ne treba nam da dođe da nas vidi.
He must be my father.	Mora da je moj otac.
I asked them what happened	Pitao sam ih šta je bilo
You know what you're doing.	Znaš šta radiš.
We have it now.	Imamo ga sada.
No, it's not a car.	Ne, nije auto.
You have to believe in it.	Morate vjerovati u to.
I said if he has it.	Rekao sam da li ga ima.
You're right.	U pravu si.
I never thought it would work so fast	Nikad nisam mislio da će raditi tako brzo
I didn't know what he wanted from me	Nisam znala šta želi od mene
I know how much.	Znam koliko.
But probably not the way you think.	Ali vjerovatno ne na način na koji mislite.
Nobody did anything.	Niko ništa nije uradio.
It was the only job he could find.	To je bio jedini posao koji je mogao naći.
But we didn't.	Ali nismo.
I couldn't let him do that	Nisam mu mogao dozvoliti da to uradi
I was almost sure of it	Bio sam skoro siguran u to
I have to do something	Moram nešto da radim
I had none of that	Nisam imao ništa od toga
I would give it to you for the first time	Dao bih ti to prvi put
That's it.	To je to.
We don’t even have to stay.	Ne moramo čak ni ostati.
I know what you did	Znam šta si radio
It can't be, or it will be, but it is.	Ne može biti, ili će biti, ali jeste.
I know where they might be	Znam gdje bi mogli biti
But he would come back.	Ali on bi se vratio.
But they will return immediately.	Ali oni će se odmah vratiti.
It really works.	Zaista radi.
Today.	Danas.
It always seemed to me that he had his way.	Uvek je, činilo mi se, imao svoj put.
I hope it will be soon	Nadam se da će to biti uskoro
I know that too.	Znam i to.
I couldn't tell myself	Nisam mogao sebi reći
I know him very well	Znam ga jako dobro
He would think so too.	I on bi to mislio.
I wasn't sure if you could do that	Nisam bio siguran da li bi ti to mogao
It’s just not that simple.	To jednostavno nije tako jednostavno.
Maybe it's you.	Možda si to ti.
But no one asked him.	Ali niko ga nije pitao.
I want to go home too	I ja želim da idem kući
I was as happy as I could be	Bio sam sretan koliko sam mogao
I know you can do so well	Znam da možeš tako dobro
I haven't heard anything yet	Još nisam ništa čuo
I think we all know this.	Mislim da svi ovo znamo.
It was obvious that this was my life now.	Bilo je očigledno da je ovo sada moj život.
I didn’t know why she just didn’t tell the truth	Nisam znao zašto jednostavno nije rekla istinu
I'm going home from now on	Od sada idem kući
Even more than she was now.	Čak i više nego što je bila sada.
She didn't know if there was a right way.	Nije znala postoji li pravi put.
I didn't mean it that way	Nisam to tako mislio
I asked him for more time, and he said okay	Zamolio sam ga za još vremena, a on je rekao u redu
No, that wasn't right.	Ne, to nije bilo u redu.
I've been expecting you for a while	Očekivao sam te već neko vrijeme
And it looks like he was right.	I izgleda kao da je bio u pravu.
You will not go.	Nećeš ići.
I had to go with him	Morao sam da idem sa njim
I love being alone	Mnogo volim biti sam
He can give it to you.	On ti može dati.
He wasn't sure about anything.	Nije bio siguran ni u šta.
I want him to see everything now	Želim da sada vidi sve
Or nothing yet.	Ili još ništa.
But right now it looks like it never works.	Ali trenutno izgleda kao da nikada ne radi.
You should have known better.	Trebao si znati bolje.
I have to have.	Moram da imam.
I’m not saying that can’t happen	Ne kažem da se to ne može dogoditi
I hope he had a happy life	Nadam se da je imao sretan život
It was very difficult.	Bilo je veoma teško.
I didn't even know how	Nisam ni znao kako
I can give you everything	Mogu ti dati sve
Works.	Radi.
I just needed to know	Samo sam trebao znati
It could be me.	Mogao bih biti ja.
I wish it was just that easy	Voleo bih da je samo tako lako
I think so too.	I ja tako mislim.
It’s a story unto itself, but not for now.	To je priča za sebe, ali ne za sada.
I still wish you well.	I dalje želim sve dobro.
I used to be able to do that	Nekada sam to mogao
We would do this ourselves.	Sami bismo ovo uradili.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
Just a little tired is all.	Samo malo umoran je sve.
Nobody expected that from him.	Niko to nije očekivao od njega.
For a while none of us said anything.	Neko vrijeme niko od nas nije ništa rekao.
I hope it's still good	Nadam se da je još dobro
It's just always there.	Jednostavno je uvijek tu.
I never knew it could happen so fast	Nikad nisam znao da se to može dogoditi tako brzo
I already know who this is	Ja već znam ko je ovo
We didn't have it.	Nismo ga imali.
Maybe she was right.	Možda je bila u pravu.
I asked him where he lived	Pitao sam ga gdje živi
I was pretty sure you'd come here	Bio sam prilično siguran da ćeš ovdje doći
I understood what he meant	Shvatio sam šta je mislio
He would tell you everything.	On bi ti sve rekao.
Not that he actually is.	Nije da on zapravo jeste.
They and you.	Oni i ti.
I do not know what it is.	Ne znam šta je to.
I'm glad, actually.	Drago mi je, u stvari.
You know what they were.	Znaš šta su bili.
I had to know what he was thinking	Morao sam da znam šta misli
He wondered if she also knew it was a date.	Pitao se zna li i ona da je to sastanak.
I got lost just a few years ago	Izgubio sam se prije samo nekoliko godina
I told him many years ago	Rekao sam mu prije mnogo godina
This was fine.	Ovo je bilo u redu.
I didn't know it was so	Nisam znala da je tako
We will not do that.	Nećemo to učiniti.
I want him very much.	Želim ga jako.
You are right there.	Tu ste u pravu.
Maybe I need a friend	Možda mi treba prijatelj
I already knew he thought he loved me	Već sam znala da misli da me voli
She said she felt safe there.	Rekla je da se tamo osjeća sigurno.
I told him who was going	Rekao sam mu ko ide
He didn't look well.	Nije izgledao dobro.
I thought it was better that way	Mislio sam da je tako bolje
It looks much better now.	Sada izgleda mnogo bolje.
I knew he had something to say.	Znao sam da ima nešto da kaže.
I'm not leaving without you	Neću otići bez tebe
Why or why not.	Zašto ili zašto ne.
I don't know much about it.	Ne znam mnogo o tome.
The truth is that you should know better.	Istina je da biste trebali znati bolje.
I hope to see you soon.	Nadam se da ću te uskoro vidjeti.
But it's not just that.	Ali nije samo to.
Maybe that's why you seemed to want it.	Možda je to razlog zašto ti se činilo da to želiš.
I needed someone to go with me.	Trebao mi je neko da ide sa mnom.
I couldn't say that before	Nisam to mogao reći ranije
But I wouldn't.	Ali ne bi.
I never said anything	Nikad nisam ništa rekao
But it's never enough.	Ali to nikad nije dovoljno.
Which he is.	Što on i jeste.
There should be no problem.	Ne bi trebalo biti problema.
When I'm usually afraid of it.	Kada se obično toga bojim.
I know more than you	Znam više od tebe
I know you can do it	Znam da ti to možeš
I wonder why you came	Pitam se zašto si došao
It's not us.	To nismo mi.
The story is nothing.	Priča nije ništa.
Everything is fine with me.	Sve je u redu sa mnom.
I came to tell you the truth	Došao sam da vam kažem istinu
They didn't really do anything.	Oni zapravo ništa nisu uradili.
That was not enough.	To nije bilo dovoljno.
She just told the truth.	Rekla je samo istinu.
He must have been gone for a very long time.	Mora da ga nije bilo jako dugo.
I just said he went with you	Upravo sam rekao da je otišao s tobom
I couldn't go on anymore	Nisam više mogao da idem dalje
I've never been there to see.	Nikad nisam bio tamo da vidim.
Is this.	Je li ovo.
Anytime, anywhere.	Bilo kada, bilo gdje.
Never, actually.	Nikad, zapravo.
This will not be.	Ovo neće biti.
I mean, you know, both.	Mislim, znate, oboje.
I always have to make sure I guess he's right	Uvek moram biti siguran da ga pretpostavljam u pravu
I wish it wasn't so.	Voleo bih da nije tako.
I want to know anything he has to tell us.	Želim da znam bilo šta što ima da nam kaže.
You were right about everything.	Bio si u pravu za sve.
There is a lot of money for money.	Ima mnogo novca za novac.
Better life now.	Sada bolji život.
That's what he likes to do.	To je ono što voli da radi.
But that would never happen.	Ali to se nikada ne bi dogodilo.
But this time we didn't.	Ali ovaj put nismo.
That it will never come back.	Da se to nikada neće vratiti.
I wondered what he was doing	Pitao sam se šta radi
I'm going to what you thought.	Idem na ono što si mislio.
This will be fine.	Ovo će biti u redu.
I thought it would never happen	Mislio sam da se to nikada neće dogoditi
I have to do this fast	Moram da uradim ovo brzo
In fact, you have to.	U stvari, morate.
I was no longer my own man	Nisam više bio svoj čovjek
But it was something.	Ali to je bilo nešto.
I haven't heard of anything	Nisam čuo ni za šta
I hope he comes back	Nadam se da će se vratiti
That's a very good thing.	To je jako dobra stvar.
I think that can help us.	Mislim da nam to može pomoći.
That's for you.	To je za vas.
That can never happen.	To se nikada ne može dogoditi.
I won't tell anyone.	Neću nikome reći.
Maybe too much.	Možda i previše.
I wanted a better life	Želeo sam bolji život
That was something we knew.	To je bilo nešto što smo znali.
But I wouldn't know why	Ali ne bih znao zašto
And I was really busy	I ja sam zaista bio zauzet
That would be easy.	To bi bilo lako.
I doubt this.	Sumnjam u ovo.
He would be right.	Bio bi u pravu.
I haven't heard of this one	Nisam čuo za ovaj
I just didn’t have time for that	Jednostavno nisam imao vremena za to
I knew he was there	Znao sam da je tamo
Which is true.	Što je tačno.
She said you did it.	Rekla je da si to uradio.
I have to leave soon	Moram uskoro otići
Lots of times.	Puno puta.
I could only see him	Mogao sam samo da ga vidim
I did something difficult	Uradio sam nešto teško
I saw you this afternoon	Video sam te danas popodne
I know he won't be here tonight	Znam da neće biti ovde večeras
Even when we don't need it right now.	Čak i kada nam to sada ne treba.
I had none of that	Nisam imao ništa od toga
I hope you had a good day today	Nadam se da ste danas imali dobar dan
That is easy.	To je lako.
I can't help you.	Ne mogu vam pomoći.
That's all he needed.	To je sve što mu je trebalo.
She doesn't work, she doesn't go to school.	Ona ne radi, ne ide u školu.
No, it really isn't.	Ne, stvarno nije.
I mean, not everyone but me	Mislim, ne svi osim mene
He didn't even ask.	Nije ni pitao.
This happened last week.	Ovo se dogodilo prošle sedmice.
I need to stay home for a while	Moram malo ostati u kući
And good.	I dobro.
I could tell what he meant	Mogao sam reći šta je mislio
I knew exactly where he would be	Tačno sam znao gdje će biti
And what do you know, there is one.	A šta znaš, postoji jedan.
And there is a reason why.	I postoji razlog zašto.
I know exactly what's going on here	Znam tačno šta se ovde dešava
I don't have one.	Ja nemam.
I see you're not well	Vidim da nisi dobro
She would know.	Znala bi.
Everyone knows so much so far.	Toliko svi znaju do sada.
I just want to help.	Samo želim pomoći.
But also a good thing.	Ali i dobra stvar.
I never wanted to be with him.	Nikad nisam htela da budem sa njim.
Now you can see what's going on.	Sada možete vidjeti šta se dešava.
Nice to see you again	Drago mi je da te ponovo vidim
I can't believe what just happened	Ne mogu vjerovati šta se upravo dogodilo
I wondered that too	I ja sam se to pitao
He never asked us for anything again.	Nikada više nije tražio ništa od nas.
You never want to say, you know, that's it.	Nikad ne želiš reći, znaš, da je to to.
I have a lot of money	Imam dosta novca
I began to wonder why that might be	Počeo sam da se pitam zašto bi to moglo biti
I better do it now	Bolje da to uradim sada
I would never do that	Nikad to ne bih uradio
I didn't want him to leave	Nisam htela da ode
I want us both to do it together	Želim da to uradimo oboje zajedno
I've seen it before	I ja sam to vidio prije
What is it.	Što je.
Nothing more than that, really.	Ništa više od toga, zaista.
I came home to see her	Došao sam kući da je vidim
I can't go to a meeting	Ne mogu da idem na sastanak
there is.	postoji.
I can do it better than you.	Ja to mogu bolje od tebe.
And that will be easy enough.	A to će biti dovoljno lako.
Work.	Posao.
But that was it.	Ali to je bilo od toga.
I can get a job if I have to	Mogu dobiti posao, ako treba
I want to talk to you	želim razgovarati s tobom
I hope it's not so bad for you	Nadam se da nije tako loše za tebe
That's how it will be from now on.	Tako će biti od sada.
It seems not so.	Čini se da nije tako.
I'm ready for it.	Spreman sam za to.
I still just wanted to go home	I dalje sam samo želio ići kući
I always expected you to be with me.	Uvek sam očekivao da ćeš biti sa mnom.
In fact, he never did.	U stvari, on to nikada nije uradio.
I don't know who did it.	Ne znam ko je to uradio.
I saw her.	Video sam je.
It seemed like life was good.	Činilo se kao da je život bio dobar.
I really didn't need that now	To mi sada zaista nije trebalo
I think it looks much better	Mislim da izgleda mnogo bolje
I'm happy to see you	sretan sam što te vidim
No one would know.	Niko ne bi znao.
I didn't have time for this	Nisam imao vremena za ovo
I would never go back.	Nikad se ne bih vratio.
you are me	ti si ja.
You will find things to do.	Naći ćeš stvari za raditi.
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam uradio ništa loše
That certainly never happened.	To se sigurno nikada nije dogodilo.
I don't think you can do that.	Mislim da to ne možeš.
I had no idea about much	Nisam imao pojma o mnogo toga
Nobody wants anything.	Niko ništa ne želi.
You are safe here.	Ovdje ste sigurni.
I asked him if that was really true	Pitao sam ga da li je to zaista istina
I hope to be there tomorrow	Nadam se da ću biti tamo sutra
I'm going to a new job	Idem na novi posao
I was very sorry for him	Bilo mi ga je jako žao
I just love her.	Ja je jednostavno volim.
He really loved me.	On me je zaista voleo.
I know they are there	Znam da su tamo
I wonder how long he's been here	Pitam se koliko je dugo ovdje
Man has everything he needs	Čovjek ima sve što mu treba
No no no no.	Ne ne ne ne.
Today has been a pretty good day.	Danas je bio prilično dobar dan.
I didn't even know what he was talking about	Nisam ni znao o čemu priča
This is probably not true.	Ovo vjerovatno nije istina.
I didn't say that well	Nisam to dobro rekao
I hope so.	Nadam se da jeste.
To know too much.	Znati previše toga.
They said they couldn't tell me.	Rekli su da mi ne mogu reći.
I want it very much.	Želim to jako.
He did very well.	Uradio je veoma dobro.
I can't do this for you.	Ne mogu to učiniti za tebe.
Do this, don't do that.	Uradi ovo, nemoj ono.
That in itself is not a problem.	To samo po sebi nije problem.
Live with it for a while.	Živi malo s tim.
I didn't know how to ask that	Nisam znao kako da to pitam
Who will believe this.	Ko će ovo vjerovati.
Maybe he would.	Možda bi.
I would do both.	Uradio bih oboje.
I won't tell anyone.	Neću nikome reći.
A lot of money and that's it.	Puno novca i to je.
I wonder where she is	Pitam se gdje je ona
You're really not good at it.	Ti stvarno nisi dobar u tome.
I knew why he was here	Znao sam zašto je ovdje
And maybe.	I možda.
I need someone.	Treba mi neko.
I had a little too much	Imao sam malo previše
Much, much better.	Mnogo, mnogo bolje.
I'm sure there are more.	Siguran sam da ih ima još.
He did it.	On je to uradio.
Yes, he would go.	Da, otišao bi.
That way everything will be easy.	Tako će sve biti lako.
That could be difficult.	To bi moglo biti teško.
I know too well	Previše dobro znam
It can just happen.	To se jednostavno može dogoditi.
Now they would have it.	Sada bi ga imali.
They don't know.	Oni ne znaju.
I'm still here.	I dalje sam tu.
Like this job.	Kao ovaj posao.
I'm sure it will help	Siguran sam da će pomoći
She is.	Ona je.
But you know better.	Ali ti znaš bolje.
It won't help you and you know it.	Neće ti pomoći i ti to znaš.
That shouldn't be a problem.	To ne bi trebao biti problem.
I wish he had more friends	Voleo bih da ima više prijatelja
I could never do it alone.	Nikada to sam ne bih mogao.
To be happy now.	Da budem sretan sada.
It's not hard enough.	Nije dovoljno teško.
Either a problem, or what you have.	Ili problem, ili šta imaš.
I was ready to move on.	Bio sam spreman da idem dalje.
I hope he comes back	Nadam se da će se vratiti
Or for you.	Ili za tebe.
Tell us what you want.	Reci nam šta želiš.
I knew right away what was going on	Odmah sam znao šta se dešava
That would be for me.	To bi bilo za mene.
He was sure the man was not alone.	Bio je siguran da čovjek nije sam.
I know that for sure.	Znam to sigurno.
I've never heard that before.	Nikad to ranije nisam čuo.
I couldn't stay either, but I had to be here	Ni ja nisam mogao ostati, ali sam morao biti ovdje
But he was not there.	Ali on nije bio tamo.
And so it will continue to be.	I tako će biti i dalje.
We wouldn't do that.	Mi to ne bismo uradili.
I know how much you loved them	Znam koliko si ih volio
Here now.	Ovde sada.
I thought he would be safe enough	Mislio sam da će biti dovoljno sigurni
To be yours.	Da budem tvoj.
I know it can be hard	Znam da može biti teško
But now he knew better.	Ali sada je znao bolje.
It really looks bad.	Zaista izgleda loše.
It's just like that.	Samo je tako.
I want him to eat well	Želim da jede dobro
I probably asked him to do it	Verovatno sam ga zamolio da to uradi
Nobody told me that before.	Niko mi to ranije nije rekao.
More than a little, maybe.	Više nego malo, možda.
I never thought this would ever come from him.	Nikad nisam mislio da će ovo ikada doći od njega.
I thought you were going to say something else	Mislio sam da ćeš reći još nešto
I would always be fine	Uvek bih bio u redu
That's all I can say	Toliko mogu reći
It works well.	Radi dobro.
I know what he wants	Znam šta hoće
I would have to tell him everything.	Morao bih mu sve reći.
Can't you?	Zar ne možeš?
I had to be alone	Morao sam da budem sam
I thought it was just a story.	Mislio sam da je to samo priča.
Like a person.	Kao i osoba.
We were both.	Oboje smo bili.
I like it simply.	Sviđa mi se jednostavno.
That's hard for me.	To mi je teško.
We have to do it now.	Moramo to uraditi sada.
It's all you.	Svi ste vi.
Few people know that.	Malo ljudi to zna.
He just doesn't want to do it.	On to jednostavno ne želi da uradi.
I really loved her	Zaista sam je voleo
I didn't know what he went to do	Nisam znao šta je otišao da uradi
For me, it’s like another day.	Za mene je to kao još jedan dan.
I can only be alone for so long	Toliko dugo mogu samo sama
That's exactly what I'm doing	Upravo to radim
That is what we are doing now.	To je ono što sada radimo.
But they are not the only ones.	Ali oni nisu jedini.
If we can.	Ako možemo.
I wanted him to tell me what he wanted	Želio sam da mi kaže šta želi
I know what you said is true	Znam da je istina ono što si rekao
I was more than ever.	Bio sam više od bilo koga.
I will help you.	Ja ću ti pomoći.
I asked him how old he was	Pitao sam ga koliko ima godina
It's for you.	Za tebe je.
He wasn't here.	On nije bio ovde.
Today is my first day.	Danas mi je prvi dan.
I knew you would.	Znao sam da hoćeš.
I told him to go to work	Rekao sam mu da ide na posao
You do not know me.	Ne znaš me.
This is correct.	Ovo je tačno.
A little there.	Malo tamo.
If you want.	Ako želiš.
I'm always me.	Ja sam uvek ja.
I immediately saw that it would be difficult for him.	Odmah sam vidio da će mu biti teško.
I mean, you wanted me here so bad	Mislim, toliko si me želeo ovde
I think this could be better	Mislim da bi ovo moglo biti bolje
I thought about you a lot	Mnogo sam mislio na tebe
He didn't even hear it.	On to nije ni čuo.
Maybe someone did.	Možda neko jeste.
I want you to know that	Želim da to znaš
I couldn't see anyone	Nisam mogao nikoga da vidim
Maybe you're right.	Možda ste u pravu.
I don't care how fast you leave.	Nije mi ništa koliko brzo ćeš otići.
We have it is not.	Mi imamo to nije.
I can't go now	Ne mogu da idem sada
Everything was really good.	Sve je bilo stvarno dobro.
He should have eaten more.	Trebalo je da jede više.
I wouldn't want that.	Ne bih to želio.
I wish he was still here	Voleo bih da je još uvek ovde
I thought maybe.	Mislio sam možda.
They were never right.	Nikada nisu bili u redu.
You will find the way.	Naći ćeš put.
That wasn't quite there tonight.	To nije bilo baš tamo večeras.
It was bad.	Bilo je loše.
I didn't expect this	Nisam očekivao ovo
It all works well.	To sve dobro radi.
I never wanted to need someone	Nikada nisam htela da mi neko treba
We must have done something right	Mora da smo uradili nešto kako treba
And here I am.	I tu sam ja.
I knew he was right	Znao sam da je u pravu
I mean, someone had to do it	Mislim, neko je to morao da uradi
I couldn't tell him the truth	Nisam mu mogao reći istinu
I just want it to be better for everyone.	Samo želim da bude bolje za sve.
This is all.	To je sve.
I didn't even want to say that	Nisam ni to htela da kažem
Business is business, and money is money	Posao je posao, a novac je novac
This, we said, cannot be.	Ovo, rekli smo, ne može biti.
That's what a father can do.	To je ono što otac može.
I didn't even know about it	Zapravo nisam ni znao za to
And he doesn't talk.	I ne priča.
You are the only person who can help me.	Ti si jedina osoba koja mi može pomoći.
But for now, that's good.	Ali za sada je to dobro.
He came alone.	On je sam došao.
I thought that was a good thing.	Mislio sam da je to dobra stvar.
I will be both.	Ja ću biti oboje.
I think a lot of people would.	Mislim da bi mnogo ljudi.
I can tell you what it was.	Mogu ti reći šta je to bilo.
She has no one.	Ona nema nikoga.
I had no money or friends.	Nisam imao ni novca ni prijatelja.
I mean, really.	Mislim, zaista.
I'm just doing my job	Ja samo radim svoj posao
To love you.	Da te volim.
I was ready for it	Bio sam spreman za to
Indeed, that is true.	Zaista, to je tačno.
I just needed the money	Samo mi je trebao novac
I knew more than that	Znao sam više od toga
No, no, not like that.	Ne, ne, ne tako.
We had a real problem.	Imali smo pravi problem.
I didn't think that was the reason at all	Uopšte nisam mislio da je to razlog
I would try not to think of him	Pokušao bih da ne mislim na njega
This is bad.	Ovo je loše.
I just have a little time to be with you	Imam samo malo vremena da budem s tobom
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
You like that.	Sviđa ti se to.
True or not, that's a good story.	Istina ili ne, to je dobra priča.
I would not.	Ne bih.
But that no longer exists.	Ali to više ne postoji.
I know what he's going to do	Znam šta će da uradi
We have to do something right	Mora da radimo nešto kako treba
I would actually love to	Ja bih zapravo volio
I thought of everything	Mislio sam na sve
I think it's too much.	Mislim da je previše.
It wasn't that, he didn't need anything.	Nije to bilo to, nije mu tu ništa trebalo.
That wouldn't be so bad.	To ne bi bilo tako loše.
It's so much with you.	Toliko je s tobom.
I want to know why he left	Želim da znam zašto je otišao
I had nothing.	Nisam imao ništa.
I actually wanted her	U stvari sam je želeo
I didn't want to	Nisam htela
I think we have a good reason for that.	Mislim da imamo dobar razlog za to.
He would see her.	On bi je video.
I'm going there right now	Idem tamo upravo sada
I want to be in it.	Želim biti u tome.
He was not happy.	Nije bio sretan.
He always wishes he could get more.	Uvijek želi da može dobiti više.
And better there than here.	I bolje tamo nego kod nas.
I never heard the reason why	Nikada nisam čuo razlog zašto
I still have my code.	Još uvijek imam moj kod.
If he wants something, he goes for it.	Ako nešto želi, ide za tim.
I actually started doing it.	Zapravo sam počeo to da radim.
I always knew when it was you	Uvek sam znao kada si to ti
I say something.	Ja kažem nešto.
I didn't know this, really	Nisam znao ovo, zaista
I knew it was a problem	Znao sam da je problem
I knew nothing more than you.	Nisam znao ništa više od tebe.
He should feel bad about it, but he didn’t.	Trebalo bi da se osjeća loše zbog toga, ali nije.
I thought you wanted that from me.	Mislio sam da to želiš od mene.
I know you can and you will if you have to	Znam da možeš i hoćeš ako moraš
In fact, it was.	U stvari je i bilo.
I couldn't believe he was my first	Nisam mogao vjerovati da mi je on prvi
I still want you to work here	I dalje želim da radiš ovdje
I have no idea what he's doing there	Nemam pojma šta on tamo radi
And I really meant it	I ja sam to stvarno mislio
I never had a problem with him.	Nikad nisam imao problema sa njim.
It's okay, really.	U redu je, zaista.
He didn't want to.	Nije želio.
I think there are more	Mislim da ih još ima
Anything is better than nothing.	Bilo šta je bolje nego ništa.
So it shouldn’t be that hard.	Tako da ne bi trebalo biti tako teško.
I was surprised too.	I ja sam bio iznenađen.
Bad bad bad.	Loše loše loše.
I thought everything would be fine	Mislio sam da će sve biti kako treba
We have to be here.	Moramo biti ovdje.
I have to go to work tomorrow	Moram sutra na posao
You couldn't help it.	Nisi mogao pomoći.
It won't work until you do this.	Neće raditi dok ovo ne uradite.
We said no.	Rekli smo ne.
I never wondered what it looked like	Nikada se nisam pitao kako to izgleda
There is a very good reason for that.	Za to postoji veoma dobar razlog.
I feel sorry for him.	Žao mi ga je.
I really love you	Zaista te volim
He left for the day.	Otišao je na dan.
I have a lot of money	Imam puno novca
There are more of you than us.	Ima vas više nego nas.
That is hard.	To je teško.
I asked them if they knew anything about it	Pitao sam ih da li znaju nešto o tome
There is no time for that now.	Sada nema vremena za to.
We told him why we were there.	Rekli smo mu zašto smo tamo.
Now I was really alone	Sada sam zaista bio sam
I just wish you didn't do them	Samo bih volio da ih ne radiš
He never tried to see her again.	Nikada više nije pokušao da je vidi.
This was no longer my father.	Ovo više nije bio moj otac.
It was good that I left.	Bilo je dobro što sam otišao.
It was a hard, hard time.	Bilo je to teško, teško vrijeme.
I told him what happened	Rekao sam mu šta se dogodilo
He knows nothing.	On ništa ne zna.
Can anything be known?	Može li se nešto znati?
I love him, and he loves me	Volim ga, i on voli mene
It's hard now.	Sada je teško.
I'm not there yet	Nisam već tamo
He had so many ideas.	Imao je toliko ideja.
I wonder what we're doing tonight	Pitam se šta radimo večeras
Yes, that's right.	Da, tako je.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
Good guy, good guy	Dobar momak, dobar momak
To this day, no one knows what happened.	Do danas niko ne zna šta se dogodilo.
But that was good enough.	Ali to je bilo dovoljno dobro.
I just needed to know that was it	Samo sam trebao znati da je to sve
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
I could be home even more than that	Mogao bih biti kod kuće čak i više od toga
That's all for me.	Za mene je to sve.
It's not right.	Nije u redu.
I wondered how he got there	Pitao sam se kako je stigao tamo
Like it's going to happen.	Kao da će se to dogoditi.
I never see him again.	Nikad ga više ne vidim.
You had to be there.	Morao si biti tamo.
And why? 	I zašto?
I want to go tomorrow.	Želim da idem sutra.
That's what he does.	To je ono što on radi.
I had nothing	Nisam imao ništa
He could have done that.	To je mogao.
I want to see who it is	Želim da vidim ko je to
I was really happy	Bio sam zaista sretan
I would love to see you there !.	Voleo bih da te vidim tamo!.
It's better than nothing.	Bolje je nego ništa.
He knew he loved her.	Znao je da je voli.
I didn't think he would	Nisam mislio da hoće
I knew what he meant	Znao sam šta je htio reći
It was strong, as if he knew it would be.	Bilo je jako, kao da je znao da će biti.
And he knew.	I on je znao.
I never finished anything.	Nikad nisam ništa završio.
Be on time.	Biti na vrijeme.
Nothing seems to be working.	Čini se da ništa ne radi.
And I had to be ready	I ja sam morao biti spreman
Maybe that's how it should be.	Možda bi tako trebalo biti.
I'm glad for him.	Drago mi je zbog njega.
But he left a lot.	Ali mnogo je otišao.
We have to.	Moramo.
I have no idea what to do now	Nemam pojma šta da radim sada
I was in.	Bio sam u.
It was just a door.	Bila su to samo vrata.
She knows what she's doing.	Ona zna šta radi.
He is very tired.	Veoma je umoran.
I didn't want to be there.	Nisam želeo da bude tamo.
I shouldn't have said that	Nisam to trebao reći
I guess we did.	Pretpostavljam da smo to uradili.
I know how much he loves you	Znam koliko te voli
I didn't ask her to come.	Nisam je pitao da dođe.
It wasn't.	Nije bilo.
I'll meet you there	Naći ćemo se tamo
I just finished everything	Upravo sam završio sve
I have to be sure.	Moram biti siguran.
We all knew it was there.	Svi smo znali da je tamo.
But you all know how we work.	Ali svi znate kako radimo.
I still love her.	I dalje je volim.
And something good and something bad.	I nešto dobro i nešto loše.
I didn't want to now	Nisam htela sada
I just can't do this again	Jednostavno ne mogu ovo ponovo
Nothing was too much of a problem.	Ništa nije bilo previše problema.
And something is happening.	I nešto se dešava.
I certainly didn't tell anyone	Sigurno nikome nisam rekao
Someone who isn't me.	Neko ko nisam ja.
This does not have to be true.	Ovo ne mora biti istina.
That's what he was supposed to do.	To je trebalo da uradi.
He could have done this.	Ovo je mogao da uradi.
I told you you were safe	Rekao sam ti da si siguran
I was too glad to go.	Bilo mi je previše drago da idem.
I never want that again	Ne želim to više nikada
I knew who they were and what they were	Znao sam ko su i šta su
No problem here.	Nema tu problema.
This should do.	Ovo bi trebalo da uradi.
You're not good enough.	Nisi dovoljno dobar.
But he knew he was there.	Ali znao je da je tamo.
I never feel like it.	Nikad mi se ne ide.
I haven't done any of that for so long	Tako dugo nisam radio ništa od toga
I've never had a problem.	Nikada nisam imao problema.
I already told you	Već sam ti rekao
I was just a little surprised	Samo sam bio malo iznenađen
I decided to be happy.	Odlučio sam da budem sretan.
Not to that.	Ne i tome.
I could have done more	Mogao sam više
I could work from home	Mogao bih raditi od kuće
Do what works for you.	Radite ono što radi za vas.
I had no idea what he was talking about	Nisam imao pojma o čemu priča
And she said she loved me.	I rekla je da me voli.
You might see something you like.	Možda ćete vidjeti nešto što vam se sviđa.
And this is all true.	I ovo je sve istina.
I have a lot for you to do	Imam mnogo za tebe da uradim
I can say it works	Mogu reći da radi
I just needed the money	Samo mi je trebao novac
I think they know.	Mislim da znaju.
But I'm going to see him tomorrow	Ali idem ga vidjeti sutra
That's what he should do.	To bi trebalo da uradi.
With a little.	Sa malo.
We can do better.	Možemo bolje.
I really like that man	Stvarno mi se sviđa taj čovjek
But maybe it wasn't always like that.	Ali možda nije uvijek bilo tako.
I think that would be obvious	Mislim da bi to bilo očigledno
It's just not you.	Samo nisi ti.
I very much doubt it.	Veoma sumnjam.
She just told me.	Upravo mi ih je rekla.
I couldn't tell him anything	Nisam mu mogao ništa reći
That can't happen.	To se ne može dogoditi.
I'm alone, but that's good	Sam sam, ali to je dobro
I would never ask anyone	Nikada ne bih nikoga pitao
There's nothing good I can do here	Ne mogu da uradim ništa dobro ovde
Bi.	Bi.
I just didn't decide how	Samo nisam odlučio kako
And you have to tell him.	I moraš mu reći.
It was very simple.	Bilo je vrlo jednostavno.
I mean, a lot	Mislim, mnogo
Good job.	Dobar posao.
You could see that last year.	To ste mogli vidjeti prošle godine.
He could come and help.	Mogao bi doći da pomogne.
I thought you knew that	Mislio sam da znaš to
Yes.	Može.
I promised not to say	Obećao sam da neću reći
I wouldn't want him to be sorry	Ne bih želio da mu bude žao
I've done it all before	Sve sam to radio ranije
I didn't get it	Nisam to shvatio
I want to do something.	Želim nešto da radim.
Yes, it's so good.	Da, tako je dobro.
I just want him to be a good person	Želim da bude samo dobra osoba
I'll get to you.	Doći ću do tebe.
I couldn't say anything	Nisam mogao ništa da kažem
I'm here with you	Ja sam tu i sa tobom
I had to see a little better	Morao sam da vidim malo bolje
Yes, that was it.	Da, to je bilo to.
I would say that is true today	Rekao bih da je to danas tačno
I see you like it	Vidim da ti se to sviđa
I think my friend is right	Mislim da je moj prijatelj u pravu
You must have needed it.	Mora da ti je trebao.
We know where he worked and what he did.	Znamo gdje je radio i šta je radio.
But that is not the case.	Ali to nije tako.
Looks like we didn't.	Izgleda da nismo.
I've seen it before	Video sam to ranije
He hasn't told me much yet.	Još mi nije mnogo rekao.
He heard there were thirty of them.	Čuo je da ih ima trideset.
She knows the way.	Ona zna put.
There's no one here either.	Ni ovde nema nikoga.
We should talk more.	Trebali bismo više razgovarati.
I still couldn't see what it was	Još nisam mogao da vidim šta je to
We couldn't see anything.	Nismo mogli ništa vidjeti.
I want to know what happened and why	Želim da znam šta se dogodilo i zašto
But there is not much help.	Ali nema puno pomoći.
.	.
They had a good reason for that.	Imali su dobar razlog za to.
I told you everything.	Sve sam ti rekao.
I was not ready for what happened next	Nisam bio spreman za ono što se dalje dogodilo
He wondered what to say, what to do.	Pitao se šta da kaže, šta da radi.
I want to know if they are okay	Želim da znam da li su dobro
I'm sorry about him.	Žao mi je zbog njega.
I hope you stay there	Nadam se da ćeš ostati tamo
That's what you need to know.	To je ono što treba da znate.
I needed him as much as he needed me	Trebao sam ga koliko i on mene
I just didn’t get to that	Jednostavno nisam stigao do toga
It won't be long.	Neće dugo.
We need that this year.	To nam treba ove godine.
Not so much but enough.	Ne toliko ali dovoljno.
I'm not saying that at all	Ja to uopšte ne kažem
You don't have to say anything.	Ne moraš ništa da kažeš.
He didn't have to do that.	Nije morao to da uradi.
But you know what it is.	Ali znaš šta je to.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
I should have done it many years ago	Trebao sam to učiniti prije mnogo godina
Weather was not the only problem.	Vrijeme nije bio jedini problem.
I told you it would be easy	Rekao sam ti da će biti lako
I have for a long time	Imam već dugo vremena
I went and finished dinner	Otišao sam i završio večeru
I just wish him a better life	Samo mu želim bolji život
Not for you.	Nije za tebe.
I can't bring him back.	Ne mogu ga vratiti.
I always wanted this life	Uvek sam želeo ovaj život
I always wanted to see him, but I never did.	Uvek sam želeo da ga vidim, ali nikad nisam.
I didn't see a problem with that	Nisam vidio problem u tome
I know how to do it	Znam kako to da uradim
I never said that.	Nikad nisam to rekao.
I couldn't do it without him	Ne bih to mogao bez njega
It wasn't them.	To nisu bili oni.
I see you have a problem	Vidim da imaš problem
Nobody expected that.	To niko nije očekivao.
I didn't expect that	Nisam to očekivao
Just to see him.	Samo da ga vidim.
I got the job very quickly	Dobio sam posao veoma brzo
It wasn't that hard.	Nije bilo tako teško.
You shouldn't be here.	Ne bi trebao biti ovdje.
I like it so much.	Toliko mi se sviđa.
I had no idea what he was thinking	Nisam imao pojma šta misli
We really need it.	Zaista nam treba.
I know this has been difficult	Znam da je ovo bilo teško
I need more time.	Treba mi više vremena.
I just couldn’t believe it	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati
And he never came back.	I nikad se nije vratio.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
We're not sure.	Nismo sigurni.
I'm not well anymore	Nisam više dobro
He wants to talk.	Želi razgovarati.
I didn't do anything wrong	Nisam radio ništa loše
Not so much, not so fast.	Ne toliko, ne tako brzo.
I just wanted to see	Samo sam htela da vidim
He said it was okay.	Rekao je da je u redu.
This is real work.	Ovo je pravi posao.
I didn't want anything to do with you	Nisam htela ništa sa tobom
I have no help at home.	Nemam pomoć u kući.
I love you.	Volim te.
I couldn't talk to anyone	Nisam mogao ni sa kim razgovarati
I think that's a good idea.	Mislim da je to dobra ideja.
He was here now.	Sada je bio ovde.
You think he is.	Misliš da je on.
Not in a good or bad way.	Ne na dobar ili loš način.
He wants to do it.	Želi da uradi.
Either that or he knows nothing.	Ili to ili ne zna ništa.
I've never seen her	Nikad je nisam video
I never even saw him.	Nikad ga nisam ni video.
This is not me.	Ovo nisam ja.
This is the right path.	Ovo je pravi put.
Nothing is better.	Ništa nije bolje.
I have to.	Moram.
I have no idea who.	Nemam pojma ko.
He had to do something to keep him busy.	Morao je učiniti nešto da bude zauzet.
There is something else.	Ima još nešto.
I wish it was, but it wasn't	Voleo bih da jeste, ali nije
I would definitely come back again	Sigurno bih se vratio ponovo
It works well.	Radi dobro.
I can do it.	Ja to mogu.
I'm not sure you will.	Nisam siguran da hoćeš.
And he got it.	I dobio ga je.
But there is always a reason.	Ali uvijek postoji razlog.
I haven't figured that out yet	Nisam to shvatio do sada
I am absolutely sure of that.	Potpuno sam siguran u to.
It happens to all of us and it often happens.	Svima nam se to dešava i često se dešava.
I didn't think it would be	Nisam mislio da će biti
Say it better than you could.	Reci to bolje nego što bi mogli.
Probably true.	Vjerovatno je istina.
I already told you that	To sam ti već rekao
I can go much, much more	Mogu ići mnogo, mnogo više
That's good to know.	To je dobro znati.
I knew what it looked like.	Znao sam kako to izgleda.
Not you, but the question.	Ne ti, nego pitanje.
I thought this didn't work.	Mislio sam, ovo ne radi.
That is what they should do.	To je ono što bi oni trebali učiniti.
I like that a lot more.	To mi se mnogo više sviđa.
He never has time for me.	On nikad nema vremena za mene.
He wasn't very ready.	Nije bio baš spreman.
I thought that was it.	Mislio sam da je to to.
And he loved me even more.	I voleo me je još više.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
I don't want to stay here anymore	Ne želim više ostati ovdje
I know what you did to me.	Znam šta si mi uradio.
I can't do things.	Ne mogu da radim stvari.
I think there's something wrong with him.	Mislim da nešto nije u redu s njim.
I think we need to get them back.	Mislim da ih moramo vratiti.
I have to do it now	Moram to uraditi sada
I need to know something	Moram da znam nešto
This was not how it should have been.	Ovo nije bilo kako je trebalo biti.
You don't have to do that.	Ne morate to da radite.
Another and another.	Još jedan i još jedan.
And maybe better.	A možda i bolje.
I never looked for them	Nikada ih nisam tražio
It was really easy.	Bilo je zaista vrlo lako.
Maybe he's here.	Možda je ovdje.
He had to be sure of this.	Morao je biti siguran u ovo.
I didn't even know where he lived.	Nisam ni znao gdje živi.
I'm so sorry about that.	Jako mi je žao zbog toga.
We both know.	Oboje znamo.
I often thought that was it	Često sam mislio da je to to
That really never happens	To se zaista nikada ne dešava
It's happening.	To se dešava.
You said so well.	Tako si dobro rekao.
They do not know.	Ne znaju.
I would hardly be the first.	Teško da bih bio prvi.
It wouldn't be the first time.	Ne bi bilo ni prvi put.
I just wanted you to know that.	Samo sam htela da to znaš.
It took him a while.	Trebalo mu je malo.
It doesn't even look like anyone lives here.	Čak i ne izgleda da ovde neko živi.
I don't think it will work at all.	Mislim da uopšte neće raditi.
We couldn't do that.	Nismo mogli to da uradimo.
But that's not a problem.	Ali to nije problem.
There is enough for all of us.	Ima dovoljno za sve nas.
The truth is.	Istina je.
I should have said no	Trebao sam reći ne
I have to go to work.	Moram na posao.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
And this is obviously not good.	A ovo očigledno nije dobro.
.	.
See if it works.	Vidi da li to radi.
A lot of it was good.	Mnogo toga je bilo dobro.
We all know this is simply not true.	Svi znamo da to jednostavno nije istina.
I just came.	Upravo sam došao.
Often not.	Često ne.
I couldn't really believe it.	Nisam mogao baš vjerovati.
Live a little.	Živi malo.
I'm sorry this happened.	Žao mi je što se ovo dogodilo.
Maybe he and she.	Možda on i ona.
But it's a bad road.	Ali to je loš put.
He obviously doesn't exist.	On očigledno ne postoji.
And she doesn't even know it.	A ona to ni ne zna.
She was well enough now.	Sada je bila dovoljno dobro.
He certainly can.	Sigurno je da može.
And so they did.	I tako su i uradili.
I'm glad he's here	Drago mi je da je ovdje
I had no problem with that	Nisam imao problema sa tim
I certainly didn't expect that	Ja to sigurno nisam očekivao
Just so easy.	Samo tako lako.
That's not real life.	To nije pravi život.
And this was not so little.	A ovo nije bilo tako malo.
I wasn’t sure there for a while	Nisam bio siguran tamo neko vrijeme
I actually wanted to do it	Ja sam zapravo htio to učiniti
It couldn't be.	Nije moglo biti.
I didn't know who was who	Nisam znao ko je koji
It's not obvious or anything.	Nije očigledno ili tako nešto.
We work more.	Radimo više.
I think so, but it's not certain.	To ja mislim, ali nije sigurno.
He tells us who we are.	On nam govori ko smo.
It was new.	To je bio novi.
I've never seen you so well.	Nikad te nisam vidio tako dobro.
It was a pretty good deal.	Bio je to prilično dobar posao.
He wants to be better.	On želi da bude bolji.
Maybe we can just help a little?	Možda možemo samo malo pomoći?
It's not like that anymore.	Nije više tako.
What did you do.	Šta si uradio.
He still didn't know what it was about.	Još uvijek nije znao o čemu se radi.
That's another one.	To je još jedan.
I'll say this.	Reći ću ovo.
There were a lot of them.	Bilo ih je puno.
I doubt it will ever happen now.	Sumnjam da će se to ikada dogoditi sada.
I wondered why.	Pitao sam se zašto.
If they’re not for you, that’s fine.	Ako nisu za vas, to je u redu.
Still nothing happened.	I dalje se ništa nije dogodilo.
Now we know much more.	Sada znamo mnogo više.
Nobody told me that.	Niko mi to nije rekao.
Everything will be good.	Sve će biti dobro.
From no one.	Ni od koga.
U.	U.
One is more than nothing.	Jedan je više od ništa.
I don't know what to say about that.	Ne znam da imam šta da kažem o tome.
He was gone the next day.	Sljedećeg dana ga nije bilo.
Actually more than that.	Zapravo više od toga.
None.	Nema.
Quick.	Brzo.
I saw her do it.	Video sam je kako to radi.
I know that now.	Znam to sada.
I wish I was here with you right now.	Voleo bih da si sada ovde sa tobom.
Which says something.	Što nešto govori.
Maybe we should have.	Možda smo trebali.
Nobody saw anything.	Niko ništa nije video.
It's not easy to do right now.	Trenutno to nije lako uraditi.
I have no idea what happened to him.	Nemam pojma šta mu se dogodilo.
All that stuff.	Sve te stvari.
Tomorrow is a new day.	Sutra je novi dan.
And there, three more.	A tamo, još tri.
I still love you.	Još uvijek te volim.
This is not difficult.	Ovo nije teško.
This is not a question.	Ovo nije pitanje.
But there is more to do.	Ali ima još toga da se uradi.
Please more, more.	Molim vas više, više.
They're not sure what it is now.	Nisu sigurni šta je to sada.
This will be my year.	Ovo će biti moja godina.
She wanted me to know.	Htela je da znam.
I've already seen the bad code.	Već sam vidio loš kod.
They didn't know for themselves what they were.	Nisu znali za sebe šta su.
I see we're doing this.	Vidim da radimo ovo.
Maybe, never.	Možda, nikad.
He said too much.	Rekao je previše.
I've never had enough.	Nikad mi nije dosta.
Which, he knew, would never happen.	Što se, znao je, nikada neće dogoditi.
They are together now.	Sada su zajedno.
He couldn't say more.	Više nije mogao reći.
Yes, you actually can.	Da, zapravo možete.
Nothing can be said about that.	Ništa se ne može reći o tome.
Not three times.	Ne tri puta.
That was a few years ago.	To je bilo prije nekoliko godina.
I would do that.	Ja bih to uradio.
It was a job.	Bio je to posao.
She loves them very much!.	Ona ih jako voli!.
I know you have it with you.	Znam da ga imaš kod sebe.
So fast.	Tako brzo.
I really loved her.	Zaista sam je voleo.
But he couldn't do it alone.	Ali on to ne bi mogao sam.
This could be true.	Ovo bi moglo biti tačno.
I started to wonder if this was such a good idea.	Počeo sam da se pitam da li je ovo tako dobra ideja.
Not that it was good.	Nije da je to bilo dobro.
Or maybe he could.	Ili bi možda mogao.
But there are a lot of people there.	Ali tamo ima mnogo ljudi.
Maybe not.	Možda i nisu.
So does everyone.	Tako i svi.
So it was hard.	Tako da je bilo teško.
But they are wrong.	Ali oni nisu u pravu.
Like a door.	Kao vrata.
I'm good at it.	Dobar sam u tome.
As far as we know.	Koliko znamo.
And not only for yourself.	I ne samo za sebe.
Really, really good.	Zaista, stvarno dobro.
It doesn't work anymore.	Više ne radi.
And he heard them.	I on ih je čuo.
He could see it, but he couldn't reach it.	Mogao je to vidjeti, ali nije mogao doći do toga.
He didn't even ask about it tonight.	Večeras nije ni pitao o tome.
It's nothing, but it's not something either.	To nije ništa, ali nije ni nešto.
Actually it was.	Zapravo je bilo.
I didn't even hear the question.	Nisam ni čuo pitanje.
No one seemed to be home.	Činilo se da niko nije bio kod kuće.
I don't see this.	Ja ovo ne vidim.
He loved them.	Voleo ih je.
It seems right to me.	Čini mi se tačno.
He says simple and easy.	Kaže jednostavno i jednostavno.
He brought us all back to what we were.	Sve nas je vratio u ono što smo bili.
Everyone knows what happened.	Svi znaju šta se dogodilo.
We can talk about it.	Možemo razgovarati o tome.
Or even win.	Ili čak pobijediti.
It was really good for me.	Bilo mi je stvarno dobro.
We know so much.	Toliko znamo.
asked.	pitao.
I've never had a problem.	Nikada nisam imao problema.
That’s the thing you do.	To je stvar koju radite.
You know who you are and what you are.	Znate ko ste i šta ste.
But you're wrong.	Ali nisi u pravu.
I just didn’t know any better.	Jednostavno nisam znao ništa bolje.
That doesn't happen.	To se ne dešava.
Just one of us now.	Samo jedan od nas sada.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
But now we know they were there.	Ali sada znamo da su bili tamo.
He decided not to.	Odlučio je da ne.
I'm not asking anything.	Ne pitam ništa.
Besides, it wasn't just him.	Osim toga, nije bio samo on.
I had to.	Morao sam.
You knew nothing about it.	Niste znali ništa o tome.
There is enough to wear.	Ima dovoljno toga da se nosi.
Nobody goes home.	Niko ne ide kući.
But he's not here yet.	Ali on još nije ovdje.
This is a car.	Ovo je auto.
He preferred to do things his own way.	Više je volio da radi na svoj način.
She said nothing.	Nije rekla ništa.
I couldn't say exactly, 'he says.	Ne bih mogao tačno da kažem', kaže on.
I was really happy to see them.	Bio sam zaista sretan što sam ih vidio.
But there is still much to be done.	Ali ima još mnogo toga da se uradi.
You can't do it alone.	Ne možete to sami.
I often wonder.	Često se pitam.
It took me a long time to be alone.	Trebalo mi je dosta vremena da budem sam.
It's not.	Nije.
He loves those things.	On voli te stvari.
Even just a little better.	Čak i samo malo bolje.
Don't give it to me.	Nemoj mi to dati.
My life is bad, but good.	Moj život je loš, ali dobar.
I have no idea.	Nemam pojma.
You know you won't.	Znaš da nećeš.
I feel a little better.	Malo mi je bolje.
I do not think.	Ne mislim.
I will not give a video.	Neću dati video.
This is not true.	Ovo nije istina.
I knew it would be so.	Znao sam da će biti tako.
I know you are.	Znam da jesi.
But that is not enough.	Ali to nije dovoljno.
Not everyone is there.	Nisu svi tamo.
I'm surprised you're here tonight.	Iznenađen sam da si večeras ovde.
And it's not okay.	I nije u redu.
He wanted it badly.	Želio je to jako.
She didn't want to see him.	Nije htela da ga vidi.
Everything is working again.	Sve ponovo radi.
He didn't want to see that again.	Nije želio da to ponovo vidi.
Not more than you.	Ne više od tebe.
But that was it.	Ali to je bilo to.
She didn't want it.	Ona to nije htela.
She didn't want to do it.	Ona to nije htela da uradi.
But that alone is not enough.	Ali ni samo to nije dovoljno.
Nothing ever happened.	Nikad se ništa nije dogodilo.
He knew what was happening.	Znao je šta se dešava.
I have three.	Imam tri.
He wouldn't have to.	Ne bi morao.
You have to go and see someone.	Moraš otići i vidjeti nekoga.
He probably was.	Vjerovatno je bio.
You can trust me.	Možeš mi vjerovati.
She does them well.	Ona ih dobro radi.
I did it for you, for us.	Uradio sam to za tebe, za nas.
It would be good if you did.	Bilo bi dobro da jesi.
But that was a good thing for me.	Ali to je bila dobra stvar za mene.
I can't see.	Ja ne mogu da vidim.
he thought.	mislio je.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
They are all people.	Svi su ljudi.
I think the more you work, the better.	Mislim da što više radiš, to bolje.
My father gave it to me.	Otac mi ga je dao.
She doesn't have to.	Ona ne mora.
I could work.	Mogao bih raditi.
But he wasn't like you.	Ali on nije bio kao ti.
I did it.	Ja sam to napravio.
Even if they didn't before, they know now.	Čak i ako ranije nisu, sada znaju.
I don't even know.	Čak ni ne znam.
This was not what he wanted.	Ovo nije bilo ono što je želio.
But maybe it can do more.	Ali možda može više.
We have to make sure it's them.	Moramo biti sigurni da su to oni.
I'm better now, really.	Sada mi je bolje, stvarno.
This is going well for me.	Ovo mi dobro ide.
People are still there.	Ljudi su još tamo.
And much more.	I mnogo više.
The only problem is that we haven't said what it is yet.	Jedini problem je što još nismo rekli šta je to.
He would be safe here.	Bio bi siguran ovdje.
She was mine.	Bila je moja.
You can't do that to me.	Ne možeš mi to učiniti.
My father knew that too.	I moj otac je to znao.
I asked him what happened.	Pitao sam ga šta se dogodilo.
For me, this is true.	Za mene je ovo tačno.
This was not a problem, but the way they told me it was.	Ovo nije bio problem, ali način na koji su mi rekli jeste.
Not just to do something.	Ne samo da uradim nešto.
He knew how good he was.	Znao je koliko je dobar.
I don't need anything from you.	Ne treba mi ništa od tebe.
No one would buy it.	Niko ga ne bi kupio.
Besides, he couldn't see anything.	Osim toga nije mogao vidjeti ništa.
Maybe he's sorry.	Možda mu je žao.
It won't be long.	Neće još dugo.
It was just him and me.	Bili smo samo on i ja.
This was wrong.	Ovo nije bilo u redu.
As usual, there were none.	Kao i obično, nije ih bilo.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
What are you going to do next?	Šta ćeš dalje?
He'll be with us soon.	Uskoro će biti kod nas.
She tells him to leave.	Ona mu kaže da ode.
Not that he thought he would.	Nije da je mislio da hoće.
We knew he would be back soon.	Znali smo da će se uskoro vratiti.
I knew he would do it.	Znao sam da će to učiniti.
He was with me last night.	Bio je sa mnom sinoć.
You say you want me.	Kažeš da me želiš.
I have to go home.	Moram ići kući.
Apparently he really was.	Očigledno je zaista bio.
He had no idea what he was going to say.	Nije imao pojma šta će reći.
That could be true.	To bi moglo biti istina.
He could never tell you.	Nikad ti nije mogao reći.
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
It was a job.	To je bio posao.
I just don't have it in me anymore.	Jednostavno to više nemam u sebi.
I can't say enough about it.	Ne mogu reći dovoljno o tome.
We both know what you've been doing around the house.	Oboje znamo šta si radio u kući.
And no, you can't see it.	I ne, ne možete to vidjeti.
He couldn't believe how easy it was.	Nije mogao vjerovati koliko je to lako.
Like us.	Kao i mi.
As a thing.	Kao stvar.
He just left.	Upravo je otišao.
This is not what you want.	Ovo nije ono što želiš.
He should be there.	Trebao bi biti tamo.
But he got there.	Ali stigao je tamo.
She knew immediately that he was not human.	Odmah je znala da on nije čovjek.
We could do anything.	Mogli bismo sve.
I know my way there.	Znam svoj put do tamo.
There was no one.	Nije bilo nikoga.
That's right.	Upravo je tako.
I have enough money.	Imam dovoljno novca.
Someone would hear.	Neko bi čuo.
It's still bad.	Još je loše.
But he knew it wouldn't happen that way.	Ali znao je da se to neće dogoditi tako.
There are more.	Ima ih još.
I've never been there.	Nikada nisam bio tamo.
I knew it couldn't be that way.	Znao sam da ne može biti tako.
You can be sure he won't be here.	Možete biti sigurni da on neće biti ovdje.
You can only be your own.	Ti možeš biti samo svoj.
He would be good.	Bio bi dobar.
I'm happy.	Ja sam sretan.
I'm not very happy about that.	Nisam baš sretan zbog toga.
I think that's really all we need for now.	Mislim da je to zaista sve što nam za sada treba.
It doesn't seem to work.	Čini se da ne radi.
No, no no no and no.	Ne, ne ne ne i ne.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
That's for us.	To je za nas.
what to do.	šta da radim.
They certainly couldn't be.	Sigurno nisu mogli biti.
Yes, you may be sure of that.	Da, možda ste sigurni u to.
Why? 	Zašto?
he thought.	mislio je.
That's what he would do.	To bi on uradio.
It looks like nothing.	Izgleda kao ništa.
I do not think.	Ne mislim.
From now on you can find me here.	Od sada me možete naći ovdje.
But you didn't.	Ali nisi.
It is not a question of whether this is true or not.	Nije pitanje da li je to istina ili ne.
It was also good.	Bilo je i dobro.
So much to do, with so little time.	Toliko toga za uraditi, sa tako malo vremena.
I didn't know what, but more.	Nisam znao šta, ali više.
I'm like you.	Ja sam kao ti.
I guess that was the reason.	Pretpostavljam da je to bio razlog.
What happend, happend.	Šta je bilo, bilo je.
Who is he? 	Ko je on?
I have no idea how to proceed.	Nemam pojma kako dalje.
I said it would happen.	Rekao sam da će se to dogoditi.
It's not a story.	To nije priča.
It was pretty bad.	Bilo je prilično loše.
It was her.	Bila je to ona.
You don't need him either.	Ne treba ni on.
It works well.	Radi dobro.
Yes you are.	Da, jesi.
But we won't be there long.	Ali nećemo dugo tamo.
Does not work.	Ne radi.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
A friend of a friend.	Prijatelj prijatelja.
He doesn't do anything.	Ne radi ništa.
Maybe you know the reason.	Možda znate razlog.
You know how it works.	Znate kako to radi.
Anything that can happen now.	Sve što se sada može dogoditi.
He could do anything.	Mogao je sve da uradi.
And he still doesn't know.	I još uvek ne zna.
There is nothing to talk about.	Nema šta da se priča.
Maybe he didn't say it right.	Možda nije dobro rekao.
And it ever will be.	I ikada će biti.
Maybe it was even true.	Možda je čak i bila istina.
I got it.	Imam ga.
I just don’t know how to do my job.	Jednostavno ne znam kako da radim svoj posao.
He knew there was a problem.	Znao je da postoji problem.
He has no idea.	On nema pojma.
He has a school.	Ima školu.
He looked quite surprised to see us.	Izgledao je prilično iznenađen što nas je vidio.
That's how it's done.	Tako se radi.
No one has ever heard of this.	Niko nikada nije čuo za ovo.
I need more.	Trebao bih više.
I'm pretty happy.	Prilično sam sretan.
It's not about you.	Nije zbog tebe.
Besides, not much is known about it.	Osim toga, o tome se ne zna mnogo.
Things he must have seen.	Stvari koje je sigurno vidio.
It was like you came home.	Bilo je kao da si došao kući.
Just what he needed.	Baš ono što mu je trebalo.
She didn't know what she was saying.	Nije znala šta govori.
I know he's telling the truth.	Znam da govori istinu.
I could for a while longer.	Mogao bih još neko vrijeme.
More than ever.	Više od bilo koga.
He never heard that.	Nikad to nije čuo.
She didn't even know.	Nije ni znala.
I came back like them.	Vratio sam se kao i oni.
I don't even need help.	Ne treba mi ni pomoć.
Apparently the man wanted to talk.	Očigledno je čovjek želio razgovarati.
I don't know what's going on there.	Ne znam šta se tamo dešava.
Someone has to do it.	Neko to mora da uradi.
That's a good game !.	To je dobra igra!.
But that was just what he expected.	Ali to je bilo samo ono što je očekivao.
I bought them.	Kupio sam ih.
We need to know that.	Moramo to znati.
More than nothing.	Više nego ništa.
It's almost ready.	Skoro je spreman.
I'm single right now, but even still.	Trenutno sam sama, ali čak i dalje.
You expected too much.	Očekivao si previše.
No, he would have to do things his own way.	Ne, morao bi da radi stvari na svoj način.
He didn't see anyone for a while.	Neko vrijeme nije vidio nikoga.
They simply know their job.	Jednostavno, znaju svoj posao.
I had a reason.	Imao sam razlog.
And it shouldn't be difficult.	I to ne bi trebalo biti teško.
I mean, pretty much.	Mislim, prilično.
That couldn't happen.	To se nije moglo dogoditi.
It will be.	Biti će.
Now everything works.	Sada sve radi.
Everything you need to know.	Sve što treba da znate.
There weren't many of us.	Nije nas bilo puno.
It was obvious what they were.	Bilo je očigledno šta su.
Why? 	Zašto?
he wondered.	pitao se on.
We need to talk.	Moramo razgovarati.
I love them both.	Volim ih oboje.
Not me.	Ne ja.
And someone did.	I neko jeste.
It's not us.	To nismo mi.
Now he could do a little more.	Sada je mogao učiniti malo više.
And he loves his job.	I voli svoj posao.
Me, he said.	Ja, rekao je.
Nobody wants to go there anymore.	Niko više ne želi da ide tamo.
But they were together.	Ali bili su zajedno.
That has already happened.	To se već dogodilo.
Nice to see you both again.	Drago mi je da vas oboje ponovo vidim.
I had to see.	Morao sam da vidim.
It was time for work.	Bilo je vrijeme za posao.
So it was now.	Tako je bilo i sada.
Me for him.	Ja za njega.
I know that.	Znam to.
I was thinking of you, he said.	Mislio sam na tebe, rekao je.
Must be.	Mora biti.
I don't know how to really say that.	Ne znam kako to da kažem zaista.
But it never is.	Ali nikad nije.
That's exactly what they were.	Upravo to su bili.
You will find someone.	Naći ćeš nekoga.
That is to say, he did nothing.	To će reći, ništa nije uradio.
He's doing it to see what you do.	On to radi da vidi šta ćeš uraditi.
I work for you.	Ja radim za tebe.
And he would love that now.	I on bi to sada voleo.
Years, if you will.	Godine, ako želite.
I like that more.	To mi se više sviđa.
I was happy to try.	Bio sam sretan što sam pokušao.
They didn't know about him.	Nisu znali za njega.
This never happened.	Ovo se nikada nije dogodilo.
Not for us but for ourselves.	Ne za nas nego za sebe.
That no longer exists here.	To ovde više ne postoji.
He is not alone now either.	Ni on sada nije jedan.
You would never have to work again.	Nikad više ne bi morao da radiš.
Or trying to be.	Ili pokušava da bude.
We are here.	Tu smo.
I love him a lot.	Volim ga puno.
We have to be sure.	Moramo biti sigurni.
But we will surely win.	Ali sigurno ćemo pobijediti.
I don't even want to know.	Ne želim ni da znam.
I just don’t see it that way.	Ja to jednostavno ne vidim tako.
And so it was.	I bilo je tako.
But the story is much more than that.	Ali priča je mnogo više od toga.
It does something for.	To čini nešto za .
I don't know what to do.	Ne znam šta da.
Just you and me.	Samo ti i ja.
I don't know if that's true or not.	Ne znam da li je to istina ili ne.
That was me.	To sam bio ja.
If not already.	Ako već nije.
I could do so much more.	Mogao bih mnogo više.
We are sorry.	Žao nam je.
There seems to be no one.	Čini se da nema nikoga.
And you knew it.	I ti si to znao.
I do work.	Ja radim posao.
I hope you like it here.	Nadam se da vam se sviđa ovdje.
I'm not sure.	Nisam baš siguran.
No one can help.	Niko ne može pomoći.
No one goes alone.	Niko ne ide sam.
You do not know.	Ne znaš.
He did this before.	Radio je ovo ranije.
Maybe I don't know today.	Možda ne znam danas.
This is really happening.	Ovo se zaista dešava.
But he went with it.	Ali on je otišao s tim.
It has to.	Mora.
I will be the first to tell you about myself.	Ja ću biti prvi koji će vam to reći o sebi.
We will not do that.	To nećemo učiniti.
I just had to know.	Samo sam morao znati.
That it couldn't be.	Da to nije moglo biti.
But obviously not good.	Ali očigledno nije dobro.
He doesn't do anything.	Ne radi ništa.
And so it happened.	I tako se to i dogodilo.
Arrived there this afternoon.	Stigao tamo popodne.
You're with me now.	Sada si sa mnom.
I know he wants me to have this.	Znam da želi da imam ovo.
This is it.	To je ovo.
I would be very happy.	Bio bih veoma sretan.
It's not easy, never easy.	Nije lako, nikad lako.
Like her.	Kao i ona.
This was hard to say.	Ovo je bilo teško reći.
It seemed to work.	Činilo se da radi.
I never did that, so it was good.	Nikad to nisam radio, tako da je to bilo dobro.
It was good when it was just me.	Bilo je dobro kad sam bio samo ja.
It's just a dinner date.	To je samo sastanak za večeru.
I wish you didn't have to.	Voleo bih da ne moraš.
I know it is.	Znam da jeste.
I can't say what's going on.	Ne mogu reći šta se dešava.
He needed money, for sure.	Trebao mu je novac, sigurno.
More like.	Više kao.
I didn't hear anything.	Nisam ništa čuo.
I knew what was going to happen.	Znao sam šta će se dogoditi.
I've seen a lot of them.	Vidio sam ih dosta.
You should have seen it too.	I ti si to trebao vidjeti.
It took a while.	Trebalo je neko vrijeme.
That's obvious.	To je očigledno.
I'm sure not.	Siguran sam da nije.
Not the first time either.	Ni prvi put.
It was pretty good.	Bilo je prilično dobro.
He should have known that, but he didn't.	Trebao je to znati, ali nije.
But things are better now.	Ali stvari su sada bolje.
But this one has.	Ali ovaj ima.
And they knew it.	I oni su to znali.
Nobody knows who she is.	Niko ne zna ko je ona.
He could not.	Nije mogao.
Maybe he could.	Možda čak i mogao.
I do it well.	Ja to dobro radim.
And that's a good thing.	I to je dobra stvar.
You have to give it back.	Morate vratiti.
But with you there is.	Ali sa tobom ima.
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
Better not.	Bolje je ne.
And so they had.	I tako su imali.
There was more here.	Ovdje je bilo više.
I'd like to go again.	Voleo bih da idem ponovo.
All this is obvious.	Sve je ovo očigledno.
So it's hard.	Tako da je teško.
No, you already have it.	Ne, već ga imaš.
Not even tonight.	Čak ni večeras.
I didn't see it.	Nisam to vidio.
You're.	Ti si.
I don't want that.	Ne želim to.
It used to be much better.	Nekada je bilo mnogo bolje.
I'm not with him.	Nisam sa njim.
You just got back to work.	Upravo si se vratio na posao.
But they are not me.	Ali oni nisu mi.
You never loved her.	Nikad je nisi voleo.
And now he's back.	A sada se vratio.
I am so happy to be able to tell you this.	Tako sam sretan što mogu da vam ovo kažem.
But I can't do that.	Ali ja to ne mogu.
He wouldn't come back.	Ne bi se vratio.
He couldn't do it without you.	On to ne bi mogao bez tebe.
He can live again.	Može ponovo da živi.
I have to go home.	Moram ići kući.
But he was not there today.	Ali danas ga nije bilo.
This was not enough.	Ovo nije bilo dovoljno.
You're the one with the problem.	Ti si taj koji ima problem.
In fact, I didn't like them very much.	U stvari, nisam ih mnogo voleo.
We are much better because of you.	Mnogo smo bolji zbog tebe.
We can't do without it.	Ne možemo bez toga.
I just don't want to go alone.	Samo ne želim da idem sam.
You can't see that either.	Ni to se ne vidi.
He is a man.	On je čovjek.
But business, yes, that's the problem.	Ali posao, da, to je problem.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
Someone is doing it.	Neko to radi.
None of us could play it.	Niko od nas nije mogao da je igra.
I'm sure it exists.	Siguran sam da postoji.
You're so right.	Tako si u pravu.
I'll just be back.	Samo ću se vratiti.
Is that what you're doing?	Da li je to ono što radiš.
You made a life here.	Napravio si život ovdje.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Nisam siguran u čemu je problem.
We just aren't.	Mi jednostavno nismo.
But we weren't here.	Ali mi nismo bili ovdje.
He came to help.	Došao je da pomogne.
He didn't know she knew.	On nije znao da ona zna.
It's always been that way for me.	Za mene je uvijek bilo tako.
Which is not.	Što nije.
It is simply what it is.	Jednostavno je ono što jeste.
Which you will do.	Što ćete i učiniti.
Simple and accurate.	Jednostavno i tačno.
A few years.	Nekoliko godina.
She is that for me.	Ona je to za mene.
He didn't hear.	Nije čuo.
He has a lot to say about himself.	Ima dosta toga da kaže za sebe.
But now you're gone.	Ali sada te nema.
If only she knew.	Da je samo znala.
But it wouldn't, for sure.	Ali ne bi, sigurno.
Not going to happen.	Neće moći.
Dan and that.	Dan i to.
I could do it now.	Mogao bih to sada.
One of us.	Jedan od nas.
That's a lot.	To je mnogo.
I pray he's fine.	Molim se da je dobro.
Not so, obviously.	Ne tako, očigledno.
So we can talk.	Da bi mogli razgovarati.
Work with me here.	Radi sa mnom ovde.
I had to.	Morao sam.
There was never anything there.	Tamo nikad ništa nije bilo.
As far as he knew, that was true.	Koliko je znao, to je bila istina.
It's not a job for you.	To nije posao za tebe.
And for now, don't speak.	I za sada ne govori.
I'm not feeling well.	Nisam baš dobro.
That would not happen at home.	Kod kuće se to ne bi dogodilo.
Something is obviously wrong.	Nešto očigledno nije u redu.
I have to trust you.	Moram ti vjerovati.
My story is my story.	Moja priča je moja priča.
It took some work.	Trebalo je malo raditi.
I'm going to work on a lot of things today.	Danas ću raditi na dosta toga.
He doesn't do anything.	Ne radi ništa.
We may know more.	Možda znamo više.
He didn't want me to go.	Nije želio da idem.
You know what's going to happen.	Znaš šta će se dogoditi.
And you don't have to.	I ne morate.
Apparently, it is.	Očigledno, jeste.
This is the first.	To je prvi.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
But obviously not.	Ali očigledno nije.
Have a nice trip.	Sretan put.
He had no idea how.	Nije imao pojma kako.
No, maybe you won't.	Ne, možda nećeš.
You can trust us.	Možete nam vjerovati.
I know it's me.	Znam da sam ja.
I know you're not.	Znam da nisi.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Nije znao šta radi.
They should do it right.	Trebali bi to uraditi kako treba.
Has anyone ever heard of this.	Da li je neko ikada čuo za ovo.
See if he wants to talk.	Vidi da li želi da priča.
I would do that.	Ja bih to uradio.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
I love completely.	Volim potpuno.
Enough.	Dosta.
I just don't seem to have a problem with that.	Samo izgleda da nemam problema sa tim.
He admitted what he did.	Priznao je šta je uradio.
I need better.	Moram bolje.
He could not.	Nije mogao.
It is and it is not.	Jeste i nije.
In fact, it can help.	U stvari, može pomoći.
I'll pick you up again.	Doći ću po tebe ponovo.
She was much more than me.	Bila je mnogo više od mene.
If it was, we wouldn't be here.	Da jeste, ne bi bili ovde.
She knew immediately what she wanted.	Odmah je znala šta želi.
You don't like it at home.	Ne sviđa ti se to kod sebe.
That is simply not true.	To jednostavno nije istina.
Nothing seemed to work.	Činilo se da ništa ne radi.
That's my job.	To je moj posao.
No one was sure why.	Niko nije bio siguran zašto.
But it was true.	Ali to je bila istina.
Just like us.	Baš kao i mi.
What she wanted to say.	Šta je htela da kaže.
He would like to know.	Voleo bi da zna.
The people who were supposed to be there for you weren't there.	Ljudi koji su trebali biti tu za tebe nisu bili.
I wasn't so sure.	Nisam bio tako siguran.
I should have been.	Trebao sam biti.
Much better than me.	Mnogo bolje od mene.
There is no way to do that.	Ne postoji način da se to uradi.
What can you tell me?	Šta mi možeš reći?
None of us knew.	Niko od nas nije znao.
But he was.	Ali bio je.
But all good.	Ali sve dobro.
But we.	Ali mi.
I'm not there.	Nisam tamo.
He wanted to help in any way he could.	Želio je pomoći na bilo koji način.
He wasn't surprised to hear that.	Nije bio iznenađen što je to čuo.
But he wouldn't say, not yet.	Ali nije htio reći, ne još.
You can not.	Ne možeš.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
That is no longer true.	To više nije istina.
I think that happens a lot.	Mislim da se to često dešava.
I know exactly how it is.	Znam tačno kako je to.
It will be easy now.	Sada će biti lako.
That's good for me !.	To je dobro za mene!.
Could be a problem.	Mogao bi biti problem.
I used to be pretty good at it.	Nekada sam bio prilično dobar u tome.
But it's not because of me.	Ali to nije zbog mene.
It was not easy.	Nije bilo lako.
That's both.	To je oboje.
And it's not hard to do.	I to nije teško uraditi.
We said for sure.	Rekli smo sigurno.
That's a lot of money.	To je dosta novca.
Everyone knows this is true.	Svi znaju da je ovo istina.
This is not happening.	Ovo se ne dešava.
But that was not the reason.	Ali to nije bio razlog.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
It seemed to be both.	Činilo se da je oboje.
But even.	Ali čak.
So it's hard.	Tako da je teško.
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
He doesn't seem to be able to help himself.	Čini se da si ne može pomoći.
I was really happy with you, when you wanted me.	Bio sam zaista sretan sa tobom, kad si me htio.
Maybe they'll know where we can talk.	Možda će znati gdje možemo razgovarati.
And he was.	I bio je.
I didn't want her.	Nisam je želio.
I thought of him often.	Često sam mislio na njega.
We do our job and do it pretty well.	Radimo svoj posao i to prilično dobro.
He knew that very well.	Znao je to vrlo dobro.
Yes, good.	Da, dobro.
She told him he had to do the right thing.	Rekla mu je da mora da uradi pravu stvar.
I just can't work.	Jednostavno ne mogu raditi.
And for a while it was a problem.	I neko vrijeme je to bio problem.
There is nothing that can be done about it.	Tu se ništa ne može učiniti.
It shouldn't have been like that.	Nije trebalo biti tako.
And he worked with me to make it even better.	I radio je sa mnom da to bude još bolje.
This year it's you.	Ove godine si ti.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
It's true.	To je istina.
He would try there.	Pokušao bi tamo.
He loved them all.	On ih je sve volio.
Only, not this.	Samo, ne ovo.
And yes, yes.	I da, da.
That would be difficult.	To bi bilo teško.
He said this.	Rekao je ovo.
She knew what she was planning.	Znala je šta planira.
I wonder about that.	Pitam se o tome.
He came right away.	Odmah je došao.
None of that here.	Ništa od toga ovde.
But not much.	Ali ne mnogo.
No, he wants to eat, he says.	Ne, on hoće da jede, kaže.
Nice to see this.	Drago mi je da vidim ovo.
I love him.	Volim ga.
I didn't tell anyone what happened.	Nikome nisam rekao šta se dogodilo.
So she never told him too much.	Tako da mu nikad nije rekla previše.
He must not have seen her talk into it.	Mora da je nije vidio kako govori u to.
It's working well now.	Sada radi dobro.
He's good, but not that good.	On je dobar, ali ne toliko dobar.
He's in trouble.	On ima problema.
I shouldn't go yet.	Ne bih trebao ići još.
But nothing good will come of having them.	Ali ništa dobro neće doći od toga da ih ima.
You just.	Ti samo.
He has and.	On ima i.
It was the first time this had happened.	Bilo je to prvi put da se to dogodilo.
I don't know if this one.	Ne znam da li je ovaj.
Now do three more times.	Sada uradite još tri puta.
Tried again.	Pokušao ponovo.
He told me no.	Rekao mi je ne.
He had nothing to say.	Nije imao šta da kaže.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
They will come.	Oni će doći.
You could.	Mogao si.
I knew they would never find him.	Znao sam da ga nikada neće naći.
People won't even talk to him.	Ljudi neće ni razgovarati s njim.
You're good at it.	Dobar si u tome.
I have to have what you have.	Moram da imam ono što ti imaš.
It took a while.	Trebalo je malo vremena.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
You could go to school if you wanted to.	Mogao si ići u školu ako želiš.
Or let me ask you something.	Ili da te nešto pitam.
You know what this is about.	Znaš o čemu se radi.
I can trust you.	Mogu ti vjerovati.
He never had a car.	Nikada nije imao auto.
I'm fine with that.	U redu sam sa tim.
Now we have too many.	Sada imamo previše.
It's better not to know.	Bolje je ne znati.
That's exactly not it.	Upravo to nije.
That's enough time.	To je dovoljno vremena.
We knew that.	To smo znali.
And if she was there.	I ako je bila tamo.
There was no door.	Nije bilo vrata.
But that is not enough.	Ali to još nije dovoljno.
You are what you are.	Ti si ono što jesi.
He is good for you.	On je dobar za tebe.
I just didn’t do it this year.	Samo nisam to uradio ove godine.
Easy and hard.	Lako i teško.
I'm not a bad guy.	Nisam loš momak.
What they were sure of.	U šta su bili sigurni.
What to do, what to do.	Šta raditi, šta raditi.
Some of it is.	Nešto od toga jeste.
She knew she looked good.	Znala je da dobro izgleda.
Now she really knows.	Sada ona zaista zna.
That's just not what you say.	To jednostavno nije ono što ti kažeš.
And she was.	I ona je bila.
Everyone but me.	Svi osim mene.
I won't talk about that today.	Neću više o tome danas.
And in fact, very difficult.	I u stvari, veoma teško.
Don't talk so fast.	Ne govori tako brzo.
That's how it should be.	Tako treba da bude.
Usually you can't do that.	Obično to ne možete.
He knew that better than anyone.	Znao je to bolje od bilo koga.
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
Yes, we do a lot of good things.	Da, radimo mnogo toga što je dobro.
She can't do that.	Ona to ne može.
He shouldn't have done that.	Nije trebalo to da uradi.
Except he knew he was.	Osim što je znao da jeste.
This was the truth.	Ovo je bila istina.
You have to do this yourself.	Ovo morate sami da uradite.
We knew nothing about anything.	Nismo znali ništa ni o čemu.
You have to help him.	Moraš mu pomoći.
People are people.	Ljudi su ljudi.
But not here.	Ali ne ovde.
I'm here now.	Sada sam ovdje.
But maybe it is.	Ali možda jeste.
There will be no problem.	Neće biti problema.
As if no one was home.	Kao da niko nije bio kod kuće.
And the next.	I sljedeće.
I mean, a lot.	Mislim, puno.
I'll tell you what you think.	Reći ću ti šta misliš.
For now, this works for us.	Za sada nam ovo radi.
Yes, it's true.	Da, to je istina.
He'll be here soon.	Doći će uskoro.
He needs someone to do it for him.	Treba mu neko da to uradi za njega.
You don't know he's here anymore.	Ne znaš da je više tu.
I want to see you so much.	Toliko te želim vidjeti.
Everyone but me.	Svi osim mene.
It wasn't so true.	Nije bilo tako tačno.
He was right for me.	On je bio pravi za mene.
Okay, maybe not.	U redu, možda ne.
No one loved too much.	Niko nije voleo previše.
I can't help it.	Ne mogu pomoći.
He says he needs to talk to me.	Kaže da mora razgovarati sa mnom.
People, not so much.	Ljudi, ne toliko.
Maybe he wants to.	Možda to i želi.
And maybe that's it.	A možda je to to.
Any of us.	Bilo ko od nas.
I could never be.	Nikada ne bih mogao biti.
Maybe he couldn't talk to you.	Možda nije mogao razgovarati s tobom.
Nothing there either.	Ni tamo ništa.
Yes, he had.	Da, imao je.
So far they have not done what they said.	Do sada nisu uradili ono što su rekli.
Yes, it was a job.	Da, to je bio posao.
From now on I will be your friend.	Od sada ću ti biti prijatelj.
There is not much to say about it.	Nema previše za reći o tome.
This is for you.	Ovo je za tebe.
I have to make it look hard.	Moram učiniti da izgleda teško.
There is only one.	Postoji samo jedan.
That's why he's here.	Za to je tu.
We have been doing this for several years.	Radimo to već nekoliko godina.
You did everything.	Sve si uradio.
I know you better than you know me.	Znam te bolje nego ti sebe.
You could do another one.	Mogao bi da uradiš još jedan.
You did this to me.	Uradio si mi ovo.
They knew that was it.	Znali su da je to to.
He won't come.	Neće doći.
Enough looks.	Dosta izgleda.
I knew this.	Znao sam ovo.
If ever.	Ako je ikada.
No you're not.	Ne, nisi.
Everyone already knows about this.	Svi već znaju za ovo.
None of this is true.	Ništa od toga nije istina.
Now you are.	Sada jesi.
But we should have seen it coming.	Ali trebali smo to vidjeti.
It's really easy.	Zaista je lako.
It's anyone.	To je bilo ko.
You could be, if you were me.	Mogao bi biti, da si bio ja.
I certainly can't do anything with it.	Ja sigurno ne mogu ništa učiniti s njim.
Maybe not tomorrow.	Možda ne sutra.
I need to see her.	Moram da je vidim.
That's your life now.	To je sada tvoj život.
It could have been us.	Mogli smo biti mi.
What are they.	Šta su.
You have time.	Imaš vremena.
I can't even be sure.	Ne mogu ni biti siguran.
I think we have a lot for us.	Mislim da imamo mnogo toga za nas.
This was not how it should be.	Ovo nije bilo kako bi trebalo biti.
But something is better than nothing.	Ali nešto je bolje nego ništa.
She knew better than that.	Znala je bolje od toga.
Not even him.	Čak ni on.
As if that never happened.	Kao da se to nikada nije dogodilo.
I heard about someone who could help.	Čuo sam za nekoga ko bi mogao pomoći.
I just can't do that.	Jednostavno ne mogu tako da radim.
I can do a lot.	Mogu puno toga da uradim.
But it could.	Ali moglo bi.
I've never seen him before.	Nikad ga prije nisam vidio.
He just knew he needed it.	Samo je znao da mu treba.
But we are doing much more.	Ali mi radimo mnogo više.
She's here.	Ona je ovde.
We didn't do it.	Nismo to uradili.
I have no idea what he's doing.	Nemam pojma šta radi.
If you know, you know.	Ako znaš, znaš.
He really does his job.	On zaista radi svoj posao.
I could say too much.	Mogao bih reći previše.
I will be.	Biti ću.
As always.	Kao i uvek.
Maybe she was.	Možda je bila.
He bought me a lot of things.	Kupio mi je mnogo stvari.
These are.	Ovo su.
And so this.	I tako ovo.
For life in general.	Za život uopšte.
I would be very busy.	Bio bih veoma zauzet.
Either or, or or.	Ili ili, ili ili.
She works, she has a job.	Ona radi, ima posao.
I have to tell you the truth.	Moram ti reći istinu.
He needed to do something.	Trebao je nešto da uradi.
There were none.	Nije ih bilo.
I really have no idea how to proceed.	Zaista nemam pojma kako dalje.
Just do it this way.	Samo uradi to na ovaj način.
Something in it, maybe.	Nešto u tome, možda.
That man is so good at home.	Taj čovjek je tako dobar kod kuće.
You can be sure of that.	U to možete biti sigurni.
We love that it's simple here.	Sviđa nam se da je jednostavno ovdje.
I think she's good for him.	Mislim da je dobra za njega.
But this time I'm really glad.	Ali ovaj put mi je zaista drago.
How can he.	Kako može.
I wonder why that is.	Pitam se zašto je to tako.
So that would be good.	Tako da bi bilo dobro.
Now he is back in that school.	Sada se vratio u tu školu.
I thought it was more than that.	Mislio sam da je više od toga.
He never wanted her.	Nikada je nije želio.
It's not good enough.	Nije dovoljno dobro.
Tell me now.	Reci mi sada.
There was nothing to return to.	Nije se bilo na šta vratiti.
Now I have time and money.	Sada imam vremena i novca.
They could go on a trip.	Mogli bi ići na put.
I don't want to help him.	Ne želim mu pomoći.
I decided on that.	Odlučio sam se na to.
Not even today.	Čak ni danas.
But this is not a new way.	Ali to nije novi način.
And tonight you came back with a lot of money.	A večeras si se vratio sa mnogo novca.
It's not either.	Nije ni .
I know it's hard.	Znam da je to teško.
And we can do better than that.	A možemo i bolje od toga.
You can trust me.	Možeš mi vjerovati.
Or maybe ever.	Ili možda ikada.
And there is much more.	I ima još mnogo toga.
Tell me it's not true.	Reci mi da nije istina.
But you can't say.	Ali ne možete reći.
He's done with it.	Završio je s tim.
Maybe we all had it in us.	Možda smo to svi imali u sebi.
No one was supposed to come and see him tonight.	Večeras niko nije trebao doći i vidjeti ga.
The next question.	Sljedeće pitanje.
You don't know how glad I am for that.	Ne znaš koliko mi je drago zbog toga.
I wouldn't go.	Ne bih otišao.
I really love it.	Zaista volim.
Before that, actually.	Prije toga, zapravo.
He still wasn't sure who it was.	Još uvijek nije bio siguran ko je to.
But it is not and never has been.	Ali nije i nikada nije bilo.
I'm not sure what to do.	Nisam siguran šta da radim.
And they will win.	I oni će pobijediti.
This is really the thing.	Ovo je stvarno stvar.
Even so.	Čak i tako.
I don't know what to do anymore.	Ne znam više šta da radim.
But nobody knows that.	Ali niko to ne zna.
It never has and it never will.	Nikad nije i nikada neće.
I hope tomorrow will be a little better.	Nadam se da će sutra biti malo bolje.
There was still time to do something.	Još je bilo vremena da se nešto uradi.
He couldn't help but see it.	Nije mogao a da to ne vidi.
Something must have happened.	Mora da se nešto dogodilo.
Now we have to go.	Sada moramo ići.
He really has to do it.	Zaista to mora učiniti.
I know what.	Znam šta.
I should have known better.	Trebao sam znati bolje.
It never would be.	Nikada ne bi bilo.
He wondered what he expected.	Pitao se šta je očekivao.
It was good here.	Ovdje je bilo dobro.
He'll be home soon.	Uskoro će biti kući.
It's okay, like we'll get to it.	U redu je, kao da ćemo doći do toga.
That was not what he wanted.	To nije bilo ono što je želio.
You're gone.	Otišao si.
Yes and no.	Da i ne.
And your job.	I tvoj posao.
I'm glad you could come.	Drago mi je što si mogao doći.
I want her to talk.	Želim da ona govori.
We have to work together.	Moramo da radimo zajedno.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
I'm going with you.	idem sa tobom.
My father is gone.	Moj otac je otišao.
You, if necessary.	Ti, ako treba.
That has to happen.	To se mora dogoditi.
It's happening.	To se dešava.
That's exactly as it should be.	To je tačno kako bi trebalo da bude.
He had never been there before.	Nikada ranije nije bio tamo.
And for you, this is just another day.	A za tebe je ovo samo još jedan dan.
It won't be long.	Neće doći još dugo.
No problem.	Nema problema.
All this is fine.	Sve ovo je u redu.
Nothing really happened there.	Tamo se zaista ništa nije dogodilo.
We should have known better.	Trebali smo znati bolje.
They needed him to need him.	Trebali su mu da bi ga trebao.
I should probably go back.	Verovatno bih se trebao vratiti.
But that wasn't bad enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno loše.
But now I like it.	Ali sada mi se sviđa.
.	.
Someone could have done something, right.	Neko je mogao nešto da uradi, zar ne.
He loves you.	Voli te.
He is so right.	On je tako u pravu.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
That has them.	To ih ima.
They had it all.	Imali su sve.
It's not for you either.	Nije ni za tebe.
Which they did.	Što su i uradili.
She says you asked her.	Kaže da si je pitao.
And she told me all about it.	I rekla mi je sve o tome.
More than a lot.	Više nego puno.
I want to see it now.	Želim to sada vidjeti.
She's gone now.	Sada je više nema.
But really, this was better.	Ali, stvarno, ovo je bilo bolje.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda neće.
I'm not leaving.	Neću otići.
And a lot for now.	I dosta toga za sada.
But he shouldn't have.	Ali nije trebao.
What he looked like.	Kako je izgledao.
Not that there is a problem with that.	Nije da postoji problem s tim.
They will be a team.	Oni će biti tim.
I know you didn't love me.	Znam da me nisi volio.
Money, money, money.	Novac, novac, novac.
Think of him, there he is.	Misli na njega, tu je.
It took a long time.	Trebalo je dosta vremena.
They are a good team.	Oni su dobar tim.
I never would.	Nikada ne bi.
We all have them.	Svi ih imamo.
It may or may not be.	To može biti ili ne mora biti.
Together we can win.	Zajedno možemo pobijediti.
I won't get them.	Neću ih dobiti.
He didn't even ask.	Nije ni pitao.
They used to be like us.	Nekada su bili kao mi.
He had everything.	Imao je sve.
They were people.	Bili su ljudi.
That's what I want.	To je ono što želim.
He knew what he needed.	Znao je šta mu treba.
But better than nothing.	Ali bolje nego ništa.
But my job is to say something, anything.	Ali moj posao je da kažem nešto, bilo šta.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim da je to dobra stvar.
But we are too.	Ali i mi smo.
Or you had one.	Ili ste ga imali.
You have to come get me.	Moraš doći po mene.
What do you think you should do?	Šta mislite da treba da uradite.
If he only knew what was really going on.	Kad bi samo znao šta se zaista dešava.
I was really glad to see her.	Zaista mi je bilo drago vidjeti je.
So much has happened.	Toliko se toga dogodilo.
It's you.	To si ti.
And they were right.	I bili su u pravu.
But for now, he really wanted to see her.	Ali za sada je jako želio da je vidi.
I can't help you.	Ne mogu ti pomoći.
I didn't even see her.	Nisam je ni vidio.
He didn't want them this time.	Ovaj put ih nije želio.
He saw himself.	Video je sebe.
He wanted it too.	I on je to želeo.
I can go any way.	Mogu ići na bilo koji način.
He is surprised.	On je iznenađen.
That may be good enough for me.	To može biti dovoljno dobro za mene.
I see.	Vidim.
If it is.	Ako je.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
This was no longer a game.	Ovo više nije bila igra.
It wasn't that bad actually.	Zapravo i nije bilo tako loše.
I was busy.	Bio sam zauzet.
They are just there.	Oni su samo tamo.
He just has to play with me.	Mora da se samo igra sa mnom.
I have something.	Ja imam nešto.
That's the problem here.	To je problem ovdje.
Just one problem.	Samo jedan problem.
Maybe this too.	Možda i ovo.
They will work together from now on.	Od sada će raditi zajedno.
Obviously so.	Očigledno je tako.
I guess so.	Pretpostavljam da jeste.
But for him it was not.	Ali za njega to nije bilo.
That's just what they did, and that was it.	To je jednostavno ono što su uradili, i to je bilo to.
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
Say it.	Reci to.
More than that, please.	Više toga, molim.
He is the only one he ever had.	On je jedini koji je ikada imao.
I haven't heard that before.	Nisam to ranije čuo.
You will know everything.	Sve ćeš znati.
But that was not all.	Ali to nije bilo sve.
He's not a bad man.	Nije loš čovjek.
That is simply true.	To je jednostavno istina.
He did it very few times.	Učinio je to vrlo malo puta.
What's wrong with you seems to be talking.	Šta nije u redu s tobom, izgleda da govori.
I do this often.	Ja to često radim.
But ‘this’ was bad.	Ali 'ovo' je bilo loše.
I'll do it, and you have to go.	Ja ću to učiniti, a ti moraš ići.
It was very difficult.	Bilo je jako teško.
This was so bad.	Ovo je bilo tako loše.
Not that he needed it.	Nije da mu je to trebalo.
And that may be true.	I to je možda istina.
Probably.	Vjerovatno.
She never told me anything.	Nikad mi ništa nije rekla.
I said good.	Rekao sam dobro.
He will still come.	Još će doći.
Neither is she.	Nije ni ona.
Seems right to me.	Čini mi se u pravu.
I say no.	Ja kažem ne.
He said nothing about it.	Nije rekao ništa o tome.
I'm not so sure anymore.	Nisam više tako siguran.
We are here.	Tu smo.
Maybe he can't tell me how he is.	Možda mi ne može reći kako je.
Right on time.	Tačno na vrijeme.
I think this could be a problem.	Mislim da bi ovo mogao biti problem.
I have no problem with that.	Nemam problema sa tim.
No one had anything to say.	Niko nije imao šta da kaže.
I'm going to a party.	Idem na zabavu.
And it was.	I bilo je.
He's throwing a party.	On pravi zabavu.
It always could.	Uvek je moglo.
But they are not a problem.	Ali oni nisu problem.
I think you're right.	Mislim da si u pravu.
He will come.	Doći će.
I think that looks better.	Mislim da to izgleda bolje.
This is what she has to do.	Ovo ona mora da uradi.
There is no more way.	Puta više nema.
As it must.	Kao što mora.
I know you would.	Znam da bi.
When you got it, you got it.	Kad si ga dobio, dobio si ga.
But who knows.	Ali ko zna.
I felt better.	Bilo mi je bolje.
But it is exactly the same with us.	Ali i kod nas je upravo tako.
He is more afraid of you than you are of him.	On se više boji tebe nego ti njega.
I'll give him the money.	Ja ću mu dati novac.
He didn't want her.	Nije je želio.
They just aren't there.	Oni jednostavno nisu tamo.
I'm sure.	siguran sam.
He had a place to be.	Imao je gdje biti.
This is not true.	Ovo nije istina.
We don't even know what it is.	Ne znamo ni šta je od toga.
We are not sure why this was so.	Nismo sigurni zašto je to bilo tako.
She didn't want to know.	Nije htela da zna.
He probably thought it was better than it actually was.	Vjerovatno je mislio da je bolje nego što je zapravo bilo.
He doesn't know about me.	On ne zna za mene.
It's a little better now, you might say.	Sada je malo bolje, mogli bi reći.
We'll find a way.	Naći ćemo način.
But he needed more.	Ali trebalo mu je više.
This is him.	Ovo je on.
That was the only time he lost.	To je bio jedini put da je izgubio.
That's what she said.	Tako je rekla.
None of us should ever.	Niko od nas nikada ne bi trebao.
I'm sorry, but it is.	Žao mi je, ali jeste.
It can happen here.	To se može dogoditi ovdje.
You were in it.	Bio si u tome.
How did that happen? 	Kako se to dogodilo?
Not that they had much.	Nije da su imali mnogo.
He has his own way of doing things.	On ima svoj način da radi stvari.
He did so badly.	Tako je loše napravio.
I guess that's true.	Pretpostavljam da je to istina.
But it was something.	Ali to je bilo nešto.
All this is still a work in progress.	Sve ovo se još radi.
It wasn't meant to be.	Nije trebalo da bude.
They didn't say what.	Nisu rekli o čemu.
It really can be anywhere.	To zaista može biti bilo gdje.
That will happen to you.	To će ti se dogoditi.
This is simple.	Ovo je jednostavno.
She never needs it.	Ona nikad ne treba.
I knew it was now or never.	Znao sam da je sada ili nikad.
No one could.	Niko nije mogao.
Who are you.	Koji si ti.
It was a good day.	Bio je to dobar dan.
He said to do it together.	Rekao je da to uradimo zajedno.
And there are still people.	I još ima ljudi.
But there are so few of them.	Ali ima ih tako malo.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
We can't do this.	Ne možemo ovo.
It's really that simple.	To je zaista tako jednostavno.
I started asking them.	Počeo sam da ih pitam.
But this was bad.	Ali ovo je bilo loše.
But she.	Ali ona.
I just was.	Samo sam bio.
He started.	Počeo je.
This is easy to do.	Ovo je lako uraditi.
It's not a game.	To nije igra.
That was me too.	To sam bio i ja.
Easy question.	Lako pitanje.
I wasn't the only one.	Nisam bio jedini.
He still hasn't decided what to do.	Još uvijek se nije odlučio šta da radi.
He didn't ask for it.	Nije ga tražio.
You did that to me before.	To si mi radio ranije.
Money is time.	Novac je vrijeme.
It was good that he did that.	Bilo je dobro da je to uradio.
We shouldn’t talk about which way is better.	Ne bismo trebali razgovarati o tome koji je način bolji.
Tired of people.	Umoran od ljudi.
But I guess.	Ali pretpostavljam.
I really didn't want to go.	Zaista nisam htela da idem.
Looks like we have.	Izgleda da imamo.
You were right.	Bio si u pravu.
But no one said that.	Ali to niko nije rekao.
You need a lot.	Treba ti puno.
And there is not much time.	I nema mnogo vremena.
By now, everyone knew why.	Do sada su svi znali zašto.
That's what I told myself.	To sam sebi rekao.
My years have passed and I am glad for that.	Prošle su mi godine i drago mi je zbog toga.
Besides, he's not here.	Osim toga, on nije ovdje.
I don't like what's going on here.	Ne sviđa mi se šta se ovde dešava.
You better know that.	Bolje da to znaš.
But he never seems to have made it.	Ali čini se da nikada nije stigao do toga.
It was very good for me.	Bilo mi je jako dobro.
I know where they are at home.	Znam gdje su kod kuće.
Nobody asked for her.	Niko je nije tražio.
There you are.	Tu si.
For me, this is as good as a lot.	Za mene je ovo dobro kao puno.
I don't think so.	Mislim da neće.
It's mine now.	Sada je moj.
People just weren’t in it.	Ljudi jednostavno nisu bili u tome.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
But for now we must go.	Ali za sada moramo otići.
It needs to be done for me.	Treba to uraditi za mene.
But that doesn't say much.	Ali to ne govori mnogo.
She loves you.	Ona voli tebe.
So it has to be for now.	Tako to mora biti za sada.
This will not be small.	Ovo neće biti malo.
Nobody knows how.	Niko ne zna kako.
Is that correct ?.	Je to tačno?.
I would like something.	Voleo bih nešto.
That looks like a lot.	To izgleda puno.
I really want to be his friend.	Zaista želim da mu budem prijatelj.
He had no idea what to do.	Nije imao pojma šta da radi.
This is much better.	Ovo je mnogo bolje.
It was just a story.	To je bila samo priča.
But we are never alone, not really.	Ali nikad nismo sami, ne baš.
He was no longer human.	Više nije bio čovjek.
We had a few ourselves.	I sami smo imali nekoliko.
And maybe you're like us.	I možda si kao mi.
He told me that himself.	On mi je to sam rekao.
I don't know who it was.	Ne znam koji je to bio.
It's all there.	Sve je tu.
Go to work.	Ići na posao.
This is actually my first time.	To mi je zapravo prvi put.
Maybe he was already here.	Možda je već bio ovdje.
I thought you understood that.	Mislio sam da si to shvatio.
No, he's gone.	Ne, on je otišao.
It would always be that way.	Uvek bi bilo tako.
You won't do that.	Nećeš to uraditi.
He was my father.	On je bio moj otac.
This is going to be hard.	Ovo će biti teško.
It took time.	Trebalo je vremena.
You could tell him anything.	Moglo bi mu se reći bilo šta.
I don't know where he is or what he is doing.	Ne znam gdje je i šta radi.
No, it really isn't.	Nije, zaista nije.
But it's hard for me.	Ali mi je teško.
They did a really good job.	Uradili su zaista dobar posao.
That could be true.	To bi moglo biti istina.
You can’t get that anywhere.	To ne možete dobiti bilo gdje.
There was no one there but you and me.	Tamo nije bilo nikoga osim tebe i mene.
It was this.	Bilo je ovo.
This is all.	To je sve.
No, it's not good.	Ne, nije dobro.
There is another one.	Postoji još jedan.
You are mine.	Ti si moja.
And we have the right thing for it.	A mi imamo pravu stvar za to.
And in fact it is.	I zapravo i jeste.
I have never been so glad to see them.	Nikad mi nije bilo tako drago da ih vidim.
I was there for that.	Bio sam tamo zbog toga.
But it doesn't work.	Ali ne radi.
And we already have.	I već imamo.
He was all that.	On je bio sve to.
You don't have to do this.	Ne morate ovo da radite.
You do it for yourself.	Radiš to za sebe.
For me, it is what it is.	Za mene je ono što jeste.
Almost three years.	Skoro tri godine.
You gave us home.	Dao si nas kući.
That's how you are like me.	Na taj način si kao ja.
I knew you would come.	Znao sam da ćeš doći.
All that.	Sve to.
Maybe better than she knew herself.	Možda bolje nego što je sama znala.
So easy and fast.	Tako lako i brzo.
Maybe he's right.	Možda je u pravu.
No one is what it seems.	Niko nije ono što izgleda.
It just isn't.	Jednostavno nije.
He did a really good job.	Uradio je zaista dobar posao.
I would do that.	Ja bih to uradio.
Which works for me.	Što mi radi.
We were no longer a team.	Više nismo bili tim.
There is no one tonight.	Večeras nema nikoga.
I thought there were only a few.	Mislio sam da ih je samo nekoliko.
And that's what they did.	I to je ono što su uradili.
Nobody wanted them.	Niko ih nije želeo.
And more.	I više.
He himself was wrong.	On sam po sebi nije bio u pravu.
There was nothing that I could do.	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim.
He had no idea why.	Nije imao pojma zašto.
But if not.	Ali ako nije tako.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
But that's not there anymore.	Ali to više nije tu.
That's exactly what he wants.	To je upravo ono što želi.
We can't say this.	Ovo ne možemo reći.
He just knows it.	On to jednostavno zna.
It's easy to do.	Lako se radi.
He did a good job.	Uradio je dobar posao.
She didn't know who the father was.	Nije znala ko je otac.
She didn't want to go.	Nije htela da ide.
I was supposed to have a question.	Trebalo je da imam pitanje.
You're here with me.	Ovdje si sa mnom.
It took me a while.	Trebalo mi je malo vremena.
But he wants her to know what's going to happen.	Ali želi da ona zna šta će se dogoditi.
In a few years, actually.	Za nekoliko godina, zapravo.
She's not me.	Ona nije ja.
I want it soon.	Želim to uskoro.
He has too many friends.	Ima previše prijatelja.
No, I didn't even ask.	Ne, nisam ni pitao.
Which he does.	Što i radi.
It could have been but.	Moglo je biti ali.
He didn't seem to see anything.	Činilo se da ništa ne vidi.
Maybe he'll stay with us, maybe he won't.	Možda će ostati s nama, možda neće.
No time to help.	Nema vremena za pomoć.
That has already happened.	To se već dogodilo.
Nobody asked me to see her today.	Niko me nije pitao da je vidim danas.
I always like to be sure.	Uvek volim da budem siguran.
It really wasn't that bad.	Zaista nije bilo tako loše.
Nobody asked him.	Niko ga nije pitao.
You should too.	I ti bi trebao.
It goes with us.	To ide sa nama.
Very happy so far.	Veoma sretan do sada.
It's hard to leave.	Teško je otići.
He had too much money.	Imao je previše novca.
You couldn't see them.	Nisi ih mogao vidjeti.
For now, everything looks good.	Za sada sve izgleda dobro.
I wonder if he ever got it.	Pitam se da li ga je ikada dobio.
I just know this.	Samo znam ovo.
I can't tell you what.	Ne mogu ti reći šta.
I really had nothing to do with it.	Zaista nisam imao ništa s tim.
Even life itself.	Čak i sam život.
He doesn't do anything.	On ništa ne radi.
No money.	Nema novca.
I just don't want to.	Jednostavno ne želim.
He was sure of it.	Bio je siguran u to.
I'm sure of it.	Siguran sam u to.
In fact, she was there for a while.	U stvari, bila je tamo neko vrijeme.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
Nobody says that.	Niko to ne kaže.
I did my job.	Uradio sam svoj posao.
That is not enough.	To nije dovoljno.
He asked what had happened.	Pitao je šta se dogodilo.
Until next time.	Do sljedećeg puta.
We don't know why.	Ne znamo zašto.
Everything is OK.	Sve je u redu.
That was hard.	To je bilo teško.
But that would not be good.	Ali to ne bi bilo dobro.
He is not for you to do what you want.	On nije za tebe da radiš šta hoćeš.
I have no idea what it is.	Nemam pojma šta je to.
A lot.	Mnogo.
He also knew when.	Znao je i kada.
That was a good thing.	To je bila dobra stvar.
If so, it can't be helped.	Ako je tako, ne može se pomoći.
They had a.	Imali su a.
We have to go.	Moramo ići.
We never knew why.	Nikada nismo znali zašto.
He was there for a few days.	Bio je tamo nekoliko dana.
You should know that.	Morao bi to znati.
I'm not just happy.	Nisam samo sretan.
These are people.	To su ljudi.
Do it fast.	Uradi to brzo.
That would be tomorrow.	To bi bilo sutra.
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
He's probably had them for a while.	Vjerovatno ih ima neko vrijeme.
He wasn't even the first.	Nije čak ni bio prvi.
Maybe he liked it more than anything.	Možda je više nego voleo.
I don't know if anything will help.	Ne znam da li će nešto pomoći.
Maybe it was him.	Možda je to bio on.
We know you know.	Znamo da znaš.
But it didn't!.	Ali nije!.
None of us are going home tomorrow.	Niko od nas sutra ne ide kući.
I even bought it.	Čak sam i kupio.
Years, years, years.	Godine, godine, godine.
I do not see anything wrong with it.	Ne vidim ništa loše u tome.
There's a lot going on.	Mnogo toga se dešava.
So we had a really good time.	Tako da nam je bilo jako dobro.
But it wasn't that bad.	Ali, nije bilo tako loše.
What is? 	Šta je?
he wondered.	pitao se on.
I can't be.	Ne mogu biti.
The problem is that she is too.	Problem je što i ona.
Or maybe it's not me, it's them.	Ili možda nisam ja, nego oni.
You know who people are.	Znaš ko su ljudi.
I just don't know where they are.	Ne znam samo gdje su.
No, that's not right.	Ne, to nije u redu.
Maybe that's why.	Možda je to razlog zašto.
, she is alone.	, sam je.
He has nothing left.	Nema mu ništa više.
I don't know what will happen.	Ne znam šta će se dogoditi.
He never said what it was.	Nikad nije rekao šta je to.
In fact, it wasn't that bad.	Zapravo, nije bilo tako loše.
Maybe he didn't want to talk about it.	Možda nije želio da priča o tome.
There is a problem.	Postoji problem.
I don't want him to see this.	Ne želim da vidi ovo.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
And it seems not.	A izgleda da nije.
These are people.	To su ljudi.
Now, question three.	Sada, pitanje tri.
He didn't want her to know yet.	Nije želio da ona još zna.
But we can, and indeed should, do more.	Ali možemo, i zaista bismo trebali učiniti više.
For now, we are safe.	Za sada smo sigurni.
I'm not sure.	Nisam siguran.
No, it's not like that for us.	Nije, nije tako za nas.
He did both.	Uradio je oboje.
But that's me.	Ali to sam ja.
I'm all for it.	Ja sam za to.
But something was wrong.	Ali nešto nije bilo u redu.
As if he knew something she didn't.	Kao da je znao nešto što ona nije.
It won't work.	Neće raditi.
It seemed easy to him.	Činilo mu se lako.
I thought so fast.	Mislio sam tako brzo.
He could go to school.	Mogao bi ići u školu.
Only a few things could happen.	Moglo se dogoditi samo nekoliko stvari.
I was for it.	Bio sam za to.
I hope it is helpful.	Nadam se da je od pomoći.
No, it really is.	Ne, zaista jeste.
As he was, he was not.	Kako je bio, nije.
It really does exist.	Zaista postoji.
I still hope that someone will, but that it won't be me.	I dalje se nadam da neko hoće, ali da to neću biti ja.
We work here.	Radimo ovdje.
It's not hard or anything.	Nije teško ili ništa.
He's not here.	Nije ovde.
Probably not.	Vjerovatno nije.
You're back.	Vratio si se.
I think.	Mislim da.
I'm very sorry.	Jako mi je žao.
I used to.	Nekada sam.
But they are wrong.	Ali nisu u pravu.
It is time.	Vrijeme je.
I want to know if he will be happy.	Želim da znam da li će biti sretan.
You're welcome.	Nema na čemu.
You are alone now.	Sada ste sami.
They just can't.	Oni jednostavno ne mogu.
I wasn't so sure.	Nisam bio tako siguran.
I had no problem with that.	Nisam imao problema sa tim.
So far that has been true.	Do sada je to bila istina.
None of us ever came back.	Niko od nas se nikada nije vratio.
There were many more.	Bilo ih je mnogo više.
You can do it now.	Možeš to sada.
You know you have something to say.	Znaš da imaš nešto da kažeš.
I told him we wouldn't do it.	Rekao sam mu da to nećemo učiniti.
He was not happy about it.	Nije bio sretan zbog toga.
This is not my father.	Ovo nije moj otac.
You didn't do it.	Nisi to uradio.
We had a meeting and a good one.	Imali smo sastanak i dobar.
I'm not sure exactly why, but it is.	Nisam siguran tačno zašto, ali jeste.
There are a lot of them there.	Ima ih puno tamo.
That is not certain either.	Ni to nije sigurno.
For a better life.	Za bolji život.
Yes, it's true.	Da, to je istina.
I said no, just a little.	Rekao sam ne, samo malo.
That would not be true.	To ne bi bila istina.
He knew that.	On je to znao.
Or he thinks he knows.	Ili misli da zna.
You're better.	Ti si bolji.
Not him, not now.	Ne on, ne sada.
Someone else saw this.	Još neko je vidio ovo.
He knew what you were doing.	Znao je šta radiš.
I had to.	Morao sam.
I should have known.	Trebao sam da zna.
And it's pretty simple.	I to je prilično jednostavno.
If we have to, it can't be helped.	Ako moramo, ne može se pomoći.
Any day now.	Bilo koji dan sada.
That's what he does.	To je ono što on radi.
That wasn't it.	To nije bilo to.
We did it very well for what we had.	Uradili smo to veoma dobro za ono što smo imali.
You have to go.	Moraš ići.
I think it will be.	Mislim da će biti.
He didn't know why.	Nije znao zašto.
Yes a lot.	Da puno.
I'm a little tired of it.	Pomalo sam umoran od toga.
And time.	I vrijeme.
I was busy, and the years passed.	Bio sam zauzet, a godine su prošle.
That she didn't want them.	Da ih nije htela.
He was such a good father.	Bio je tako dobar otac.
You're fine.	U redu si.
No one ever came back.	Niko se nikada nije vratio.
Maybe I could do this.	Možda bih mogao ovo da uradim.
There has never been a better time for him to play well.	Nikada nije bilo bolje vrijeme za njega da igra dobro.
I have to go home.	Moram ići kući.
It's enough.	Dosta mi je.
My car won't.	Moj auto neće.
He never saw it.	Nikoga nije video.
There are many things you need to buy.	Postoji mnogo stvari koje morate kupiti.
I have to do it.	Moram to da uradim.
He knew when he would come home.	Znao je kada će doći kući.
She must have known what was going on.	Mora da je znala šta se dešava.
It's true.	To je istina.
Nobody knows what it is.	Niko ne zna šta je to.
But there was nothing.	Ali nije bilo ništa.
I don't have one.	Nemam.
I can't talk to him.	Ne mogu razgovarati s njim.
I will help you.	Ja ću ti pomoći.
She has her own way of doing things.	Ona ima svoj način da radi stvari.
And that's okay.	I to je u redu.
It was a game, if it was a game.	To je bila igra, ako je bila igra.
It seemed to be.	Činilo se da jeste.
He had never asked before.	Nikad prije nije pitao.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
Only a few people do that.	Samo nekoliko ljudi to radi.
All this is happening fast.	Sve se ovo dešava brzo.
Don't even talk to me.	Nemoj čak ni razgovarati sa mnom.
And he loves it.	I on to voli.
You don't know what they're going to do.	Ne znaš šta će oni uraditi.
Who knew.	Ko je znao.
Even if I could, I wouldn't.	Čak i da mogu, ne bi.
Just like that.	Samo tako.
It can't be.	To ne može biti.
Now and always.	Sada i uvek.
It's that simple.	To je ono jednostavno.
No, that can't be, she told herself.	Ne, to ne može biti, rekla je sebi.
Or they won't say.	Ili neće reći.
I'm almost there.	Skoro sam tamo.
I loved that car.	Voleo sam taj auto.
I'm fine.	Dobro sam.
The more the better.	Što više to bolje.
He doesn't have to talk to tell you he loves you.	Ne mora da govori da bi ti rekao da te voli.
I was so tired.	Bio sam tako umoran.
Maybe it's not about the money.	Možda nije zbog novca.
We were right.	Bili smo u pravu.
She wanted to go.	Ona je htela da ide.
I didn't know he would be here.	Nisam znao da će biti ovde.
I'd like to come back.	Volio bih se vratiti.
You are there.	Vi ste tamo.
Maybe it is now.	Možda je sada.
But they really aren't.	Ali zaista nisu.
He's not really your father.	On zapravo nije tvoj otac.
That you had something to say.	Da si imao šta da kažeš.
My father was a bad guy.	Moj otac je bio loš momak.
That's just not right.	To jednostavno nije u redu.
If you have a job.	Ako imaš posao.
I have to work.	Moram da radim.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
I just wanted to tell you that.	Samo sam ti to htio reći.
Don't do that again.	Nemoj to više da radiš.
You probably should.	Verovatno bi trebao.
They said before.	Prije su rekli.
I hope that's okay.	Nadam se da je to u redu.
Too many years.	Previše godina.
No time.	Nema vremena.
But she didn't say more.	Ali više nije rekla.
I can't say anything about that.	Ne mogu ništa reći o tome.
I gave you a few things.	Dao sam ti nekoliko stvari.
I wish you would, you know.	Voleo bih da bi, znaš.
Something was good.	Nešto je bilo dobro.
They could be.	Oni bi to mogli biti.
We don't know what we'll find.	Ne znamo šta ćemo naći.
I'm sure you know that.	Siguran sam da to znaš.
I had a friend.	Imao sam prijatelja.
There was no one here.	Ovdje nije bilo nikoga.
It could be a problem.	Mogao bi biti problem.
I was still right.	I dalje sam bio u pravu.
And you were right.	I ti si bio u pravu.
And you say you haven't seen it.	A ti kažeš da nisi video.
Like the person he was now.	Kao osoba koja je sada bio.
All right, it's going.	U redu, ide.
He has it.	On je ima.
No one is sure what to do about it.	Niko nije siguran šta da radi o tome.
How could they.	Kako bi mogli.
I don't feel sorry for myself.	Nije mi žao sebe.
He knew what was what.	Znao šta je šta.
I never did.	Nikad nisam.
Even that is a lot.	Čak je i to mnogo.
I love him as a friend.	Volim ga kao prijatelja.
And that's really hard.	A to je zaista teško.
Except me.	Osim mene.
Something was wrong.	Nešto nije bilo tačno.
You can't go yet.	Ne možeš još ići.
She says yes.	Ona kaže da.
We don't know what happened.	Ne znamo šta se dogodilo.
But no one was happy about it.	Ali niko nije bio sretan zbog toga.
That is a difficult question.	To je teško pitanje.
You don't know what he is.	Ne znaš šta je on.
It's too much here.	Ovde je previše.
It still has.	Još uvijek ima.
You have too much for you.	Imaš previše toga za tebe.
That's him.	To je on.
He knows you don't like it and he decided.	On zna da ti se to ne sviđa i odlučio je.
He didn't ask what happened to him.	Nije pitao šta mu se dogodilo.
I wish I was that.	Voleo bih da sam to.
he thought.	mislio je.
I didn't know what was what.	Nisam znao šta je šta.
But he said he could see it.	Ali on je rekao da to može vidjeti.
You can do whatever you want.	Možeš da radiš šta hoćeš.
It's just hard.	To je samo teško.
You were there.	Bili ste tamo.
It could be tonight.	Može biti večeras.
Everything is OK.	Sve je u redu.
You won't be sorry.	Neće vam biti žao.
Here she is.	Ovde je ona.
Yes, that's what you should do.	Da, to je ono što bi trebalo da uradiš.
That's actually a good thing.	To je zapravo dobra stvar.
She simply cannot believe that such a thing exists.	Ona jednostavno ne može vjerovati da tako nešto postoji.
We know that for sure.	To sigurno znamo.
And let me tell you - this is all there is to it.	I da vam kažem ovo ima sve u sebi.
Yes, that's it.	Da, to je to.
You did everything right.	Sve si dobro uradio.
But there is nothing we can do about it.	Ali tu ništa ne možemo učiniti.
I don't want that for anyone.	Ne želim to nikome.
Nobody told him anything.	Niko mu ništa nije rekao.
We are not.	Mi nismo.
I'd say it's not as bad as you think.	Rekao bih da nije tako loše kao što mislite.
Other than that, it just exists.	Osim toga, samo postoji.
That would be very bad.	To bi bilo jako loše.
I wasn’t sure there for a while.	Nisam bio siguran tamo neko vrijeme.
I have seen this happen many, many times.	Video sam da se ovo dešava mnogo, mnogo puta.
Everyone will help.	Svi će pomoći.
.	.
So simple.	Tako jednostavno.
They're almost there.	Skoro su tu.
I just wanted you to know.	Samo sam htela da znaš.
I hope this might help.	Nadam se da će ovo možda pomoći.
You will see this soon.	Uskoro ćete to vidjeti.
He was there.	Tu je bio.
You can't do better than that.	Ne možete bolje od toga.
Maybe we won't.	Možda nećemo.
Nobody saw him.	Niko ga nije video.
This cannot be true.	Ovo ne može biti istina.
And yes, it is.	I da, jeste.
It's not over.	Nije završio.
We or they.	Mi ili oni.
I was sure.	Bio sam siguran.
But it could be better than it is.	Ali moglo bi biti i bolje nego što jeste.
Or not.	Ili ne.
Let me see you again.	Da te ponovo vidim.
You can buy it today.	Možete ga kupiti danas.
It must be soon.	Mora biti uskoro.
He will find her.	Naći će je.
She can never know that.	Ona to nikada ne može znati.
Nothing was actually better, probably.	Ništa zapravo nije bilo bolje, vjerovatno.
He was looking for you.	Tražio te je.
That is hard.	To je teško.
He decided.	Odlučio se.
But really very good.	Ali stvarno jako dobro.
I said.	rekao sam.
I made it myself.	Napravio sam ga sam.
None of this will be easy.	Ništa od toga neće biti lako.
And it wasn't good.	I nije bilo dobro.
He plays well.	Igra dobro.
I still have it too.	I ja ga još uvijek imam.
I think we did it.	Mislim da smo to uradili.
See if it's okay.	Vidi da li je u redu.
It was like that with us.	Kod nas je bilo tako.
Maybe it's better that way.	Možda je tako bolje.
They are wrong !.	Oni nisu u pravu!.
It's nothing.	Nije ništa.
This may have been helpful.	Ovo je možda bilo od pomoći.
I know where he is.	Znam gdje je.
He gave it to me.	Dao mi ga je.
It's not.	Nije.
That doesn't happen anymore.	To se više ne dešava.
They still weren't there.	I dalje ih nije bilo.
She told me she loved you.	Rekla mi je da te voli.
This could be better.	Ovo može biti bolje.
But maybe that's not a good idea.	Ali možda to nije dobra ideja.
That's what you did as a father.	To je ono što si radio kao otac.
But, well, someone could come back.	Ali, dobro, neko bi se mogao vratiti.
I knew what he was trying to do.	Znao sam šta pokušava da uradi.
But he was not the only one.	Ali on nije bio jedini.
I won't tell him.	Neću mu reći.
I didn't tell him anything.	Ništa mu nisam rekao.
For something to be done.	Za nešto da se uradi.
What he was.	Šta je on bio.
I just want to be alone.	Samo želim da budem sam.
I've never seen anything like it.	Nikad nisam vidio tako nešto.
But maybe it is.	Ali možda i jeste.
It's just.	To je samo.
That was true.	To je bila istina.
He didn't know where he was or what he was.	Nije znao ni gdje je ni šta je.
And we couldn't go back.	I nismo se mogli vratiti.
I won't tell you anything like that.	Neću vam reći ništa tako.
He had to say something.	Morao je nešto reći.
That's the only way.	To je jedini način.
He has life in him.	Ima život u sebi.
I haven't done that before.	Nisam to radio ranije.
With .	Sa .
She didn't tell him anything.	Nije mu ništa rekla.
At the moment, it looks like he will win.	Trenutno izgleda da će pobijediti.
If you want one.	Ako želiš jedan.
They are not sure.	Nisu sigurni.
To see me just now.	Da me samo sada vidi.
It was not difficult for us to do that.	Nije nam bilo teško da to uradimo.
If so, I need that code.	Ako je tako, treba mi taj kod.
That's where she goes to school.	Tamo ona ide u školu.
But that's the way it is.	Ali to je tako.
You can't help but do it.	Ne možete a da to ne uradite.
It's really that easy.	Zaista je tako lako.
I never came back.	Nikad se nisam vratio.
And it should definitely be there.	A tamo bi sigurno trebalo biti.
And that's in order.	I to je po redu stvari.
I see someone say they were the first.	Vidim da je neko rekao da su prvi.
This is not my job.	Ovo nije moj posao.
I can't work.	Ne mogu da radim.
He had his way.	Imao je svoj put.
Maybe you are too.	Možda si i ti.
Let's do this together.	Uradimo ovo zajedno.
Do it for me, please, she said.	Učini to za mene, molim te, rekla je.
No, never, she said.	Ne, baš nikad, rekla je.
Maybe it will happen and maybe it will happen soon.	Možda će se dogoditi i možda će se dogoditi uskoro.
But he didn't know it.	Ali on to nije znao.
You want it so badly.	Toliko to želiš.
It's really good.	Zaista je dobro.
I don’t have much to say about myself.	Nemam puno toga da kažem o sebi.
I'll get to that now.	Doći ću do toga sada.
He knew this too.	Znao je i ovo.
And there are a lot of them.	A ima ih puno.
That's a really good thing.	To je zaista dobra stvar.
When you need it, you need it.	Kad ti treba, treba ti.
He doesn't know who you are yet.	On još ne zna ko si ti.
That would be all.	To bi bilo sve.
I knew you would find me.	Znao sam da ćeš me naći.
This has to be here, it has to be there.	Ovo mora biti ovdje, to mora biti tamo.
Or maybe he knew exactly where she was.	Ili je možda tačno znao gdje je ona.
But they had money.	Ali imali su novca.
Just as a thing.	Samo kao stvar.
I should have been here.	Trebao sam biti ovdje.
And see why.	A vidi se i zašto.
But it was enough.	Ali dosta je bilo.
We'll talk more about that next week.	O tome ćemo više razgovarati sljedeće sedmice.
Now you know why.	Sada znate zašto.
I am so glad.	Tako mi je drago.
I just did that last week.	Upravo sam to uradio prošle sedmice.
It was so easy.	Bilo je tako lako.
Looks good.	Izgleda dobro.
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
I'll take them, please.	Ja ću ih, molim te.
Yes, she would.	Da, ona bi.
This should have been easy.	Ovo je trebalo da bude lako.
I can't find him now.	Ne mogu ga sada naći.
He could see her.	Mogao je da je vidi.
And it's not time yet.	I još nije vrijeme.
I hope you can help.	Nadam se da možete pomoći.
He couldn't say that.	Nije mogao to da kaže.
So we'll be fine.	Tako da ćemo biti dobro.
I know you work.	Znam da radiš.
All that to me.	Sve to mi.
It was something people should know.	To je bilo nešto što bi ljudi trebali znati.
I had to know.	Morao sam znati.
But we didn't know what to do.	Ali nismo znali šta da radimo.
I mean, just one.	Mislim, samo jedan.
I had as much to say as anyone.	Imao sam mnogo toga da kažem kao i bilo ko.
I think we have a team.	Mislim da imamo tim.
That is what we can and must do today.	To je ono što možemo i moramo učiniti danas.
I think there's more to it than that.	Mislim da ima više od toga.
And you know which one.	I znaš koji.
He didn't say that.	On to nije rekao.
Now it has happened.	Sada se to dogodilo.
This is like.	Ovo je kao.
Maybe until tomorrow or more.	Možda do sutra ili više.
That's what it looks like.	Tako izgleda.
That's how you do it.	Tako to radiš.
I didn't hear him say that the first time.	Nisam ga čuo da je to rekao prvi put.
He wondered about that too.	I on se pitao o tome.
He heard me.	Čuo me je.
It's just there.	Samo je tamo.
Right here.	Baš ovdje.
He was like.	Bio je kao.
We needed this for a long time.	Ovo nam je dugo trebalo.
No time for that.	Nema vremena za to.
It's better that no one knows about him.	Bolje je da niko ne zna za njega.
I can't do anything alone.	Ne mogu ništa sam.
But it didn't take him long.	Ali nije mu trebalo mnogo vremena.
He will be fine.	On će biti dobro.
I couldn't see anyone.	Nisam mogao nikoga da vidim.
I don't see a problem with that.	Ne vidim problem u tome.
Good for him if he leaves.	Dobro za njega ako ode.
And he meant it at the time.	I mislio je to u to vrijeme.
I do not think.	Ne mislim.
He has to play like that.	Mora da igra tako.
I could have stayed home.	Mogao sam ostati kod kuće.
Nobody.	Niko.
I bought three.	Kupio sam tri.
We are just people.	Mi smo samo ljudi.
The story is here.	Priča je tu.
I didn't know what she was doing there.	Nisam znao šta ona tamo radi.
I saw it right away.	Odmah sam to vidio.
But it's nothing.	Ali nije ništa.
There just aren't enough of them.	Samo ih nema dovoljno.
But that's not the only problem.	Ali to nije jedini problem.
That's for you.	To je za tebe.
Yeah, you could say that.	Ja, moglo bi se reći.
Now we know why.	Sada znamo zašto.
He himself was not there.	On sam nije bio tamo.
I just wanted you to think that.	Samo sam htela da to misliš.
He did that last year.	To je uradio prošle godine.
This is what.	Ovo je šta.
Yes, it happens.	Da, dešava se.
We have to have dinner.	Moramo na večeru.
The way that only.	Način na koji samo .
Maybe today.	Možda danas.
We know exactly what we need to do.	Znamo tačno šta treba da uradimo.
They said no.	Rekli su ne.
This is not true.	Ovo nije tačno.
But only if it works.	Ali samo ako radi.
I really like this job.	Zaista mi se sviđa ovaj posao.
It just wasn't safe.	Jednostavno nije bilo sigurno.
You can do whatever you want.	Možeš da radiš šta hoćeš.
People knew about it, but said nothing.	Ljudi su znali za to, ali ništa nisu rekli.
It was simple.	Bilo je jednostavno.
I don't know why that happened.	Ne znam zašto se to dogodilo.
No idea why he's here or what to do.	Nema pojma zašto je ovdje ili šta da radi.
A lot, maybe.	Mnogo, možda.
He's waiting for us.	Čeka nas.
I don't see why.	Ne vidim zašto.
And there she was.	I tu je bila ona.
But they didn't say anything.	Ali ništa nisu rekli.
Yes, it was.	Da, bilo je.
Just like he said.	Baš kao što je rekao.
This is a good team.	Ovo je dobar tim.
Now we know.	Sada znamo.
Now this one.	Sada ovaj.
I loved her so much.	Tako sam je voleo.
But it probably wouldn't be good.	Ali vjerovatno ne bi bilo dobro.
She does it herself.	Ona to radi sama.
Nobody will tell me.	Niko mi neće reći.
This can't be real.	Ovo ne može biti stvarno.
That didn't happen here.	To se ovdje nije dogodilo.
I need to know if he's right.	Moram da znam da li je u pravu.
I thought maybe even you could be .	Mislio sam da bi možda čak i ti mogao biti .
She wasn't there.	Ona nije bila tamo.
Is that happening.	Da li se to dešava.
He won't be ready.	Neće biti spreman.
But it was good.	Ali bilo je dobro.
But you just couldn't do it.	Ali ti to jednostavno nisi mogao.
You can give it to me.	Možeš mi ga dati.
I can't say when.	Ne mogu reći kada.
I really have no idea what's going on.	Zaista nemam pojma šta se dešava.
And soon.	I to uskoro.
Besides, she knew.	Osim toga, znala je.
Now there is a thing.	Sada postoji stvar.
They can be anything.	Mogu biti bilo šta.
I really want that.	Ja to jako želim.
Until this afternoon.	Do danas popodne.
It was too good for that.	Bilo je previše dobro za to.
That's none of my business.	To nije moja stvar.
No problem at the moment.	Trenutno nema problema.
One good friend of mine has this problem.	Jedan moj dobar prijatelj ima ovaj problem.
This is not how it should be.	Ovo nije kako bi trebalo da bude.
And she knew.	I znala je.
I want you to do this for me.	Želim da uradiš ovo za mene.
And thoughts.	I misli.
You can see it.	Možete to vidjeti.
They did that.	To su uradili.
Are you.	Jesi li.
We are more than that.	Mi smo više od toga.
They knew where they were.	Znali su gdje su.
That really happened.	To se zaista dogodilo.
There are a lot.	Ima ih puno.
Maybe they were right, and maybe they weren’t.	Možda su bili u pravu, a možda i nisu.
A lot of people.	Puno ljudi.
I said that's not it.	Rekao sam da to nije to.
Maybe you're right, he said.	Možda si u pravu, rekao je.
All this just this year.	Sve to samo ove godine.
No one is just what you are to me.	Niko nije samo ono što si ti za mene.
It doesn’t even have to be a thing.	To čak i ne mora biti stvar.
Because.	Zbog.
But for me.	Ali za mene.
Dan.	Dan.
I have to say it several times.	Moram to reći nekoliko puta.
Just don't say anything.	Samo ne govori ništa.
And that's good.	I to je dobro.
All the best from me.	Sve dobro od mene.
That wasn't real.	To nije bilo stvarno.
But he won't be able to stay here long.	Ali neće moći dugo ostati ovdje.
Now you really had it.	Sada si to stvarno imao.
I asked what was wrong.	Pitao sam šta nije u redu.
I wouldn't tell anyone.	Ne bih to nikome rekao.
And he will.	I on će.
He figured it would be well out of the way.	Shvatio je da će to biti dobro s puta.
He had done it before.	On je to radio i ranije.
But that's better than nothing.	Ali to je bolje nego ništa.
I hope you got it.	Nadam se da si ga dobio.
That's the way it is right now.	Tako je trenutno.
But I'm not sure how to do it.	Ali nisam baš siguran kako da to uradim.
Or don't.	Ili nemoj.
We have to meet.	Moramo se naći.
I'm afraid of that.	Bojim se toga.
That's the reason.	To je razlog.
And there are a lot of them.	A ima ih puno.
No one knew what could happen.	Niko nije znao šta bi se moglo dogoditi.
I said the sooner the better.	Rekao sam što ranije to bolje.
Everyone said so.	Svi su tako rekli.
I hope tomorrow will be a better day.	Nadam se da će sutra biti bolji dan.
I was glad I left.	Bilo mi je drago što sam otišao.
But the man was right.	Ali čovjek je bio u pravu.
Things can't get any better.	Stvari ne mogu ići na bolje.
I'm glad you're okay.	Drago mi je da si dobro.
You know me.	Znaš me.
I am the reason why.	Ja sam razlog zašto.
She has to tell me what to do.	Ona mi mora reći šta da radim.
I am happy to be doing my job.	Sretan sam što radim svoj posao.
No, neither is he.	Ne, nije ni on.
It's been a long time.	To je dugo vremena.
I'll tell you what really happened.	Reći ću ti šta se zaista dogodilo.
It was more than he ever did.	Bilo je to više nego što je ikada učinio.
Have fun with him.	Zabavi se s njim.
It's hard to really say.	Teško je zaista reći.
And, that's exactly what's happening.	I, upravo se to dešava.
And he will.	I hoće.
I wouldn't ask him for anything.	Ne bih od njega tražio ništa.
It won't work.	To neće moći.
It's not safe.	Nije sigurno.
But so far they have not.	Ali do sada nisu.
You know, we do a lot of things well.	Znate, mi radimo mnogo stvari dobro.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
But you're right.	Ali u pravu si.
Someone will do it, but it doesn't look like it will be us.	Neko će to učiniti, ali ne izgleda da ćemo to biti mi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
And if he could do this to you.	I kad bi mogao ovo da ti uradi.
There's a lot going on this week.	Ima puno toga ove sedmice.
But it doesn't work.	Ali to ne radi.
It was them.	To su bili oni.
That's it.	To je to.
That he is still waiting for me.	Da me još čeka.
He is not happy.	On nije sretan.
I don't even know what to do with it.	Ne znam ni šta da radim s tim.
I was happy to be there.	Bio sam sretan što sam bio tamo.
I haven't seen you in a while.	Nisam te vidio neko vrijeme.
Let's do it now !.	Uradimo to sada!.
They are not at home.	Nisu kod kuće.
It's not just for me.	To nije samo za mene.
I did it.	Učinio sam to.
You don't even think he's good.	Čak ni ne misliš da je dobar.
But someone has to say these things.	Ali neko mora da kaže ove stvari.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
It's so good.	Tako je dobro.
So I'm not doing well.	Tako da mi ne ide dobro.
We have to go home.	Moramo ići kući.
Or with us.	Ili kod nas.
The truth is.	Istina je.
And he wants to be like them.	I želi da bude kao oni.
Therein lies the problem for me.	Tu je problem za mene.
Everything is going well.	Sve ide dobro.
Good to see this.	Dobro je vidjeti ovo.
He said so.	On je tako rekao.
I can't say why now.	Ne mogu sada reći zašto.
Sure.	Sigurno.
I knew he was right.	Znao sam da je u pravu.
I am him.	Ja sam on.
No, for a few.	Ne, za nekoliko.
I needed it.	Trebao mi je.
But very difficult.	Ali veoma teško.
To work.	Na posao.
He obviously doesn't want to see us.	Očigledno ne želi da nas vidi.
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
Or maybe he doesn't.	Ili ga možda nema.
I couldn't help it.	Nisam mogao pomoći.
I shouldn't have come.	Nisam trebao doći.
That's right now.	Tako je sada.
He could hardly help.	Teško je mogao pomoći.
You have to come see.	Morate doći vidjeti.
He was sure he had done it.	Bio je siguran da je to uradio.
Maybe I can help.	Možda mogu pomoći.
Um, the only one.	Ovaj, jedini.
That's how you'll find him.	Tako ćete ga naći.
We should never have done them.	Nikada ih nismo trebali raditi.
He wasn't sure he wanted to.	Nije bio siguran da to želi.
You had a meeting.	Imali ste sastanak.
I'm just going.	Samo idem.
Yes, you know.	Da bi, znate.
I saw it, now.	Video sam to, sada.
It's not a job.	To nije posao.
But he didn't leave.	Ali nije otišao.
It still goes its own way.	I dalje ide na svoj način.
I'm not sure why it works.	Nisam siguran zašto to radi.
I would like to.	Volio bih.
That is a difficult question.	To je teško pitanje.
I just work and that's it.	Samo radim i to je to.
I'm glad you did.	Drago mi je da jeste.
This was nothing.	Ovo nije bilo ništa.
They both know it's not that simple.	Oboje znaju da to nije tako jednostavno.
That was really true.	To je zaista bilo tačno.
And he didn't look happy about it.	I nije izgledao sretan zbog toga.
He had never seen anything like it.	Nikad nije video tako nešto.
I'll go alone.	Ja ću ići sam.
That and only that.	To i samo to.
And it seems to work.	I izgleda da radi.
Is it money? 	Je li to novac?
And it was true.	I bila je istina.
That is the right path to power.	To je pravi put do moći.
I hope not.	Nadam se da neće.
It's about.	Radi se o.
You know this.	Ovo znaš.
And it wasn't that bad.	I nije bilo tako loše.
That's a lot.	To je mnogo.
He didn't think about it.	Nije mislio o tome.
He did it.	Uradio je to.
A lot of people do that.	Mnogo ljudi to radi.
And that's where he went.	I tamo je otišao.
Not tomorrow.	Ni sutra.
But it was okay.	Ali bilo je u redu.
You just know.	Samo znaš.
No, it wasn't right.	Ne, nije bilo u redu.
I really don't know what to say more than that.	Zaista ne znam šta da kažem više od toga.
I know what it looks like.	Znam kako izgleda.
But it's not really.	Ali zapravo nije.
I didn't hear that either.	Ni ja to nisam čuo.
She just didn't know what it could be.	Jednostavno nije znala šta bi to moglo biti.
Besides.	Osim toga.
As it should be.	Kako mora.
I like the way it works.	Sviđa mi se način na koji radi.
Not that he says that.	Nije da on to kaže.
There are several.	Ima ih nekoliko.
Do what works.	Radite ono što radi.
This will not be easy.	Ovo neće biti lako.
It's not a job.	Nije posao.
Nothing happened.	Ništa se nije dogodilo.
The next day.	Sljedećeg dana.
He probably won't even tell me.	Verovatno mi neće ni reći.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
Someone gave it to me.	Neko mi ga je dao.
They didn't do anything for us.	Nisu uradili ništa za nas.
I was even happy to be lost.	Čak sam bio sretan što sam se izgubio.
You can get them tomorrow.	Možeš ih dobiti sutra.
And he'll probably never see her at home again.	I vjerovatno je nikada više neće vidjeti kod kuće.
He wasn't the only one either.	Ni on nije bio jedini.
He would try.	On bi pokušao.
I loved you too.	I ja sam tebe voleo.
That will come very soon.	To će doći vrlo brzo.
That was a few years ago.	Bilo je to prije nekoliko godina.
He couldn't say anything.	Ne bi mogao ništa da kaže.
This will be enough.	Ovo će biti dovoljno.
He knew he was right for us before us.	Znao je da je pravi za nas prije nas.
But you never knew.	Ali nikad nisi znao.
This may not be the case today.	Danas to možda i nije tako.
But that was the only way.	Ali to je bio jedini način.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
It rained last night and today.	Sinoć i danas kiša.
I can still see him.	Još ga mogu vidjeti.
She can do it.	Ona to može.
I wasn't looking for a job.	Nisam tražio posao.
Who knows what could have happened so far.	Ko zna šta se do sada moglo dogoditi.
You never know who you'll find !.	Nikad ne znaš koga ćeš naći!.
Not yet.	Za sada nije.
That is what will happen.	To je ono što će se dogoditi.
And there you are.	I tu ste.
It is now.	Sada jeste.
Or if there are too many problems, that's fine.	Ili ako je previše problema, to je u redu.
I didn't know, maybe she was right, maybe she knew something.	Nisam znao, možda je bila u pravu, možda je nešto znala.
The truth has no way.	Istina nema put.
You are probably right.	Verovatno ste u pravu.
But it happened for the first time.	Ali to se dogodilo prvi put.
There must have been thirty people there.	Mora da je tamo bilo trideset ljudi.
We have to help.	Moramo pomoći.
Just you and me.	Samo ti i ja.
He did this to me.	On mi je ovo uradio.
I haven't seen you either.	Nisam te vidio i.
Another left.	Još jedan je otišao.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
But not today.	Ali ne danas.
Say what needs to be said.	Reci šta treba da se kaže.
He doesn't know that.	On to ne zna.
You just need something in yourself.	Samo treba nešto u sebi.
But the truth was they were fine.	Ali istina je bila da su bili u redu.
I told him what had happened to me.	Rekao sam mu šta mi se dogodilo.
I had very little money.	Imao sam vrlo malo novca.
But who knows.	Ali ko zna.
If you want something done right.	Ako želite da se nešto uradi kako treba.
There is still no help.	I dalje nema pomoći.
That's him.	To je on.
This is not right.	Ovo nije u redu.
And there are problems with that.	I s tim ima problema.
I don't know about him.	Ne znam za njega.
I really don't know what to do now.	Zaista ne znam šta da radim sada.
Who knows, it could happen.	Ko zna, moglo bi se dogoditi.
This did not happen.	Ovo se nije dogodilo.
It's you and me.	To smo ja i ti.
Which is actually a good thing.	Što je zapravo dobra stvar.
Which is obviously happening now.	Što se očigledno dešava sada.
He knows it, and they know it.	On to zna, i oni to znaju.
Maybe not.	Možda neće.
He wasn't sure if they knew more.	Nije bio siguran da li oni više znaju.
You didn't do it for him.	Nisi to uradio zbog njega.
He is a good father.	On je dobar otac.
He said you knew about it.	Rekao je da znate za to.
Not that he probably would.	Nije da bi vjerovatno.
Not too much.	Ne previše.
I would do anything.	Uradio bih sve.
It's not right what's going on.	Nije u redu šta se dešava.
It was good of him.	Bilo je dobro od njega.
Nothing can be so easy.	Ništa ne može biti tako lako.
You don't know anything.	Ti ne znaš ništa.
How are you.	Kako ti.
I'm tired of you.	Umoran sam od tebe.
I’m sure it doesn’t do any good.	Siguran sam da to ne čini dobro.
She has to go.	Ona mora da ide.
I know you too well.	Znam te previše dobro.
He couldn't do anything right now.	Sada nije mogao ništa da uradi kako treba.
It's much better.	Mnogo je bolje.
There must be a story in it.	Mora da postoji priča u tome.
Really strong.	Zaista jako.
So much time.	Toliko vremena.
The thing is, it can be.	Stvar je u tome da može biti.
There were too many people.	Bilo je previše ljudi.
So he eats it too.	Tako da i on to jede.
It just happened.	To se jednostavno dogodilo.
I would like to know why.	Želeo bih da znam zašto.
So he finished everything.	Tako da je sve završio.
Not now, he said.	Ne sada, rekao je.
Not so with me.	Sa mnom nije tako.
Maybe we're both right.	Možda smo oboje u pravu.
They've been there before.	Bili su tamo ranije.
It works well.	To dobro radi.
Yes, it probably would.	Da, vjerovatno bi.
But nothing bad has happened yet.	Ali ništa loše se još nije ni dogodilo.
She would be fine alone.	Bila bi dobro sama.
It was something he never knew.	To je bilo nešto što nikada nije znao.
He didn't decide what would be better.	Nije odlučio šta bi bilo bolje.
And he loves it.	I on to voli.
People know that.	Ljudi to znaju.
It wouldn't be the first time.	Ne bi bilo prvi put.
You don't have to be.	Ne morate biti.
There is only one way to do this.	Postoji samo jedan način da se to uradi.
We are so glad.	Tako nam je drago.
That way she would always know where they were.	Tako bi uvijek znala gdje su.
You want him to be like you.	Želiš da bude kao ti.
I know what he did.	Znam šta je radio.
But it is really true.	Ali to je zaista istina.
Everything would be fine.	Sve bi bilo u redu.
You must be over thirty.	Mora da imaš više od trideset godina.
All you think is you don't like it.	Sve što misliš je da ti se ne sviđa.
He goes on.	On ide dalje.
That wasn't it.	To nije bilo to.
I have a problem.	Imam problema.
I may not like her, but she can.	Možda mi se ne sviđa, ali ona to može.
We have a new one.	Imamo novi.
But the man said nothing.	Ali čovjek ništa nije rekao.
She wanted to do it.	Htela je to da uradi.
He knew he had them.	Znao je da ih ima.
He never did.	Nikad nije.
What? 	Šta?
He says.	On kaže.
And that is true.	I to je istina.
You got it right.	Dobro si shvatio.
Nothing much happened.	Ništa se mnogo nije dogodilo.
He would be.	On bi bio.
All the better for us.	Tim bolje za nas.
Maybe that's the problem.	Možda je to problem.
I know it's not enough.	Znam da nije dovoljno.
She didn't know that.	Ona to nije znala.
And no one ever does that.	I to niko nikada ne radi.
Money is hard to come by.	Do novca je teško doći.
He could leave now, if he wanted to.	Mogao bi sada otići, ako želi.
I want to be helpful.	Želim biti od pomoći.
That's why.	To je razlog zašto.
She really knew what he was thinking.	Zaista je znala šta on misli.
That's how we do things.	Tako radimo stvari.
He wants the truth.	On želi istinu.
That will be a long time.	To će biti dugo.
I thought everything was fine.	Mislio sam da je sve u redu.
It was like what happened today.	Bilo je to kao ono što se dogodilo danas.
How about this.	Šta kažeš na ovo.
But not just now.	Ali ne samo sada.
I want better.	Želim bolje.
They don't know what they want.	Ne znaju šta hoće.
He works there too.	I on tamo radi.
It doesn't really exist.	Zapravo ne postoji.
I want to be both.	Želim da budem oboje.
I would like to work again.	Voleo bih ponovo da radim.
Just not yet.	Samo ne još.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
Someone should help him.	Neko bi mu trebao pomoći.
I'm still working.	I dalje radim.
It's just like that.	To je jednostavno tako.
I have a lot of stories.	Imam puno priča.
It will get where you want it.	Doći će tamo gdje želite.
That it won't happen.	Da se to neće dogoditi.
That was never my way.	To nikada nije bio moj način.
They told me when and how to do everything.	Rekli su mi kada i kako sve da uradim.
That's what they did to me.	To su mi uradili.
And he didn't leave.	I nije otišao.
It's all me.	Sve sam ja.
Or a.	Ili a.
I wasn’t sure what, but it was real.	Nisam bio siguran šta, ali bilo je stvarno.
He says nothing, or has nothing to say.	Ne govori ništa, ili nema šta da kaže.
Not too bad.	Nije baš loše.
Soon, someone will.	Uskoro, neko hoće.
That's not so bad.	To nije tako loše.
This is really good.	Ovo je stvarno dobro.
I still have no idea.	Još uvijek nemam pojma.
In fact, it looks just like before.	U stvari, izgleda baš kao i prije.
That might be hard to do.	To bi moglo biti teško za uraditi.
I think they're still there.	Mislim da su još tamo.
Yes, it could.	Da, moglo bi.
Say it works.	Reci da radi.
But not tonight.	Ali ne večeras.
We don't know how it works.	Ne znamo kako to radi.
That's it.	To je to.
Anything can help.	Bilo šta može pomoći.
It's them.	To su oni.
This year it looks better than last year.	Ove godine izgleda bolje nego prošle godine.
I can not believe.	Ne mogu vjerovati.
I hope someone can help.	Nadam se da neko može pomoći.
And I thought.	I mislio sam.
I hope this was helpful.	Nadam se da je ovo bilo od pomoći.
Yes, he said.	Da, rekao je.
This does not have to be a problem.	Ovo ne mora biti problem.
Not a bit.	Ni malo.
I heard this.	Čuo sam ovo.
Probably if.	Vjerovatno ako .
It's just a matter with me.	To je samo stvar sa mnom.
It's more like.	To je više kao.
But that didn't happen either.	Ali ni to se nije dogodilo.
But not if he was busy.	Ali ne ako je bio zauzet.
He wants to talk to you.	Želi razgovarati s tobom.
That's right, he said.	Tako je, rekao je.
I have something to do with it.	Imam nešto s tim.
We can't say why.	Ne možemo reći zašto.
But there should be no more than that.	Ali ne bi trebalo biti više od toga.
She has a lot of ideas.	Ona ima puno ideja.
I knew very quickly what it was.	Vrlo brzo sam znao šta je to nešto.
This is not happening at the moment.	To se trenutno ne dešava.
I mean, really.	Mislim, stvarno.
I really don't want to.	Zaista ne želim.
All that stuff.	Sve te stvari.
There was nothing.	Ništa nije bilo.
I don't know if that's true.	Ne znam da li je to tačno.
Maybe it is, but not fast enough for me.	Možda i jeste, ali ne dovoljno brzo za mene.
But we work.	Ali mi radimo.
But not them.	Ali ne oni.
And it is.	I jeste.
It could be better.	Moglo bi biti bolje.
But it is.	Ali jeste.
But it can help.	Ali može pomoći.
I want to do it.	Želim to da uradim.
Maybe nothing.	Možda ništa.
Not yet, and maybe never.	Ne još, a možda nikad.
This was good to know.	Ovo je bilo dobro znati.
You're .	Ti si .
So far this has not happened.	Do sada se to nije dogodilo.
There seemed to be no help for that.	Činilo se da tome nema pomoći.
But that was the way.	Ali to je bio način.
But it wasn't that easy.	Ali nije bilo tako lako.
Yes, he had, but whether he still exists is unknown.	Da, imao je, ali da li još postoji, ne zna se.
They were a pretty good team.	Bili su prilično dobar tim.
There is only one way.	Postoji samo jedan način.
Like yes.	Kao da.
That was my problem.	To je bio moj problem.
I can go back home.	Mogu se vratiti kući.
I tried to work with you.	Pokušao sam da radim sa tobom.
What was is no more.	Ono što je bilo više nije.
I hope it's better.	Nadam se da je bolje.
But that is still a problem.	Ali to je i dalje problem.
There is nothing to go in the afternoon.	Popodne nema šta da ide.
I just wanted to say that right away.	Samo sam to odmah htio reći.
I'm pretty sure you will too.	Prilično sam siguran da ćeš i ti biti.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
You may not know exactly what you need.	Možda ne znate tačno šta vam treba.
Often, much more.	Često, mnogo više.
He's just playing for money.	On samo igra za novac.
He couldn't really.	Nije mogao baš.
It goes even further than this year.	To ide i dalje od ove godine.
I said yes.	Rekao sam da.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
But he knew right away.	Ali odmah je znao.
I'm going with you.	Idem s tobom.
But he wouldn't be happy about it.	Ali ne bi bio sretan zbog toga.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
She didn't want to play at all.	Uopšte nije htela da se igra.
I've seen enough.	Video sam dovoljno.
He asked for nothing.	Nije tražio ništa.
People are here for you.	Ljudi su tu za vas.
None of that ever happened.	Ništa od toga se nikada nije dogodilo.
It was so easy.	Bilo je tako lako.
I love, I love, I love.	Volim, volim, volim.
But I don't know why, but it doesn't work.	Ali ne znam zašto, ali ne radi.
It works well.	Dobro radi.
They had little.	Imali su malo.
And you don't know any better.	A ti ne znaš ništa bolje.
It never is and never will be.	Nikad nije i nikada neće.
He worked on it.	On je radio na tome.
We can't tell the truth now.	Ne možemo sada reći istinu.
That's the way it will be.	Tako će stvari biti.
I'm so sorry.	Tako mi je žao.
It may not even exist.	Možda čak i ne postoji.
All those things we could see.	Sve te stvari koje smo mogli vidjeti.
Or maybe he was just as tired as she was.	Ili je možda jednostavno bio umoran kao i ona.
That's where the work happens.	Tu se dešava posao.
He must know.	Mora da zna.
And that's the problem.	I to je problem.
But being there.	Ali biti tamo.
Nobody ever goes there.	Tamo niko nikad ne ide.
Just this here and now.	Samo ovo i ovdje i sada.
Not that he would admit to such a thing.	Nije da bi on tako nešto priznao.
She told you that.	Ona ti je to rekla.
I saw it happen.	Video sam da se to dešava.
I've had enough.	Bilo mi je dosta.
About both of us, actually.	O nama oboje, zapravo.
He seemed perhaps right.	Činilo se da je možda u pravu.
It's not just me.	Nisam samo ja.
I doubt that's likely.	Sumnjam da je to vjerovatno.
You can come if you want.	Možete doći, ako želite.
I'm here to work.	Ovde sam da radim.
Why not be the first?	Zašto ne biste bili prvi?
You do not want.	Ne želiš.
Now they are together again.	Sada su ponovo zajedno.
I didn't tell anyone.	Nisam nikome ništa rekao.
I just told you.	Upravo sam ti rekao.
He works alone.	On radi sam.
Little by little.	Malo pomalo.
Maybe she loves him.	Možda ga voli.
We always know we are someone.	Uvek znamo da smo neko.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
Say what you think.	Reci šta misliš.
He never does that.	Nikad to ne radi.
More to talk about.	Više da se priča.
I was the road.	Ja sam bio put.
This exists in itself.	Ovo postoji samo po sebi.
How to be one of you.	Kako biti jedan od vas.
He'll stay there a little longer.	Tamo će ostati još malo.
So it was for him.	Tako je bilo za njega.
That's right.	Tako je.
? 	?
It has everything you need and more.	Ima sve što vam treba i više od toga.
We didn't have much time.	Nismo imali puno vremena.
No one will ever find me.	Niko me nikada neće naći.
Not even for you.	Čak ni za tebe.
But only.	Ali samo.
It was a good game.	Bila je to dobra igra.
I'll tell you about it.	Reći ću vam o tome.
It's been a long time.	Bilo je to dugo vremena.
They knew what it could do.	Znali su šta to može učiniti.
If only they knew.	Kad bi samo znali.
Or her.	Ili ona.
They had no money.	Nisu imali novca.
I think it's both.	Mislim da je oboje.
But what was that?	Ali šta je to bilo to.
We knew we were a good team.	Znali smo da smo dobar tim.
It was a good idea.	Bila je to dobra ideja.
I love it too.	I ja to volim.
I don't think you're good.	Mislim da nisi dobar.
He never wanted me, really.	Nikada me nije želio, zaista.
I don't know how he needs so much time.	Ne znam kako mu treba toliko vremena.
Do not do that!.	Ne radi to!.
If you don't know, say so.	Ako ne znaš, reci.
She was what she was.	Ona je bila ono što jeste.
I say we are the first.	Kažem da smo prvi.
You do so much alone.	Toliko toga radiš sam.
It has to be done, it has to be done.	Mora se uraditi, mora se uraditi.
They know exactly what's going on.	Oni tačno znaju šta se dešava.
I bought one.	Kupio sam jedan.
This is the first problem.	Ovo je prvi problem.
I’m not sure why, but it was fast.	Nisam siguran zašto, ali bilo je brzo.
He was the one.	On je bio taj.
But you never know what life will do.	Ali nikad ne znaš šta će život učiniti.
And she was there.	I ona je bila tamo.
That's what he expected.	To je ono što je očekivao.
I couldn't doubt it.	Nisam mogao da sumnjam u to.
There is no help for that.	Nema pomoći za to.
And he's here.	I on je ovde.
He doesn't measure anything.	Ništa ne meri.
It's happening more than you think.	To se dešava više nego što mislite.
But you are right.	Ali, u pravu ste.
He lives here.	On živi ovdje.
Just like he said he would.	Baš kao što je rekao da hoće.
You want it to be for you.	Želiš da bude za tebe.
And that's a little time.	I to je malo vremena.
Neither here nor there.	Ni ovdje, ni tamo.
And he was right.	I bio je u pravu.
They knew.	Znali su.
We just don't know what will happen yet.	Samo još ne znamo šta će biti.
We know that.	Znamo to.
It was the same today.	Tako je bilo i danas.
It's working well now.	Sada radi dobro.
This was easy for me.	Ovo mi je bilo lako.
They were just.	Bili su samo.
What did you say.	Šta si rekao.
I left.	Otišao sam.
I know things are there.	Znam da su stvari tamo.
We’re not exactly sure when that will happen.	Nismo baš sigurni kada će se to dogoditi.
I wish you could come too.	Voleo bih da i ti možeš doći.
I didn't see anything.	Nisam ništa video.
That would be something.	To bi bilo nešto.
So are we.	I mi smo.
It’s about what you’re going to do next, next, next, next.	Radi se o tome šta ćeš učiniti sljedeće, sljedeće, sljedeće, sljedeće.
She was at a party.	Bila je na zabavi.
But it doesn't go that way.	Ali to ne ide na taj način.
Nobody, he said.	Niko, rekao je.
From a friend.	Od prijatelja.
I'm sure of it now.	Sada sam siguran u to.
Only, there is no time.	Samo, nema vremena.
And they didn't.	A nisu.
He had it.	Imao je to.
do, do.	uradi, uradi.
I hadn't heard of it before.	Nisam čuo za to ranije.
Apparently not.	Očigledno nije.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I loved, loved, worked with him.	Voleo sam, voleo, radio sa njim.
That will never happen.	To se nikada neće dogoditi.
It must be found.	Mora da se može naći.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
I won't be long.	Neću dugo.
If there are enough of you.	Ako vas ima dovoljno.
I was quite surprised.	Bio sam prilično iznenađen.
It is.	Da jeste.
Quick and easy !.	Brzo i lako!.
He was the first.	On je bio prvi.
I've been doing this for a while.	Radio sam ovo neko vrijeme.
This is good to see.	Ovo je dobro vidjeti.
He wished I could.	Želio je da mogu.
I think so.	Mislim da jeste.
Everything is very.	Sve je veoma.
Here.	Ovdje.
It was just an idea.	To je bila samo ideja.
But probably not.	Ali vjerovatno ne.
I think we need to get them back.	Mislim da ih moramo vratiti.
You have to see it.	Morate to vidjeti.
You don't have to.	Ne morate.
If only it were that simple.	Da je tako jednostavno.
I need to see that.	Moram to vidjeti.
He would try again.	Pokušao bi ponovo.
Never again.	Nikada više nije.
You had it all.	Imao si sve.
That should have been enough.	Trebalo je biti dovoljno.
None of us would want to.	Niko od nas ne bi želeo.
You did what you did for you.	Uradio si ono što si uradio za tebe.
Maybe not.	Možda nije.
I did it again.	Uradio sam to ponovo.
She was someone.	Ona je bila neko.
It was hard not to tell you.	Bilo je teško ne reći ti.
He came.	On je došao.
I wouldn't know what to tell anyone.	Ne bih znao šta da kažem nikome.
Was.	Bilo je.
It would be really good to see her.	Bilo bi stvarno dobro vidjeti je.
He loved them enough for that.	Voleo ih je dovoljno za to.
He didn't do it.	On to nije uradio.
He just did.	Upravo je uradio.
We need yours too.	Treba nam i tvoj.
I really can't help you.	Stvarno ti ne mogu pomoći.
You are real.	Vi ste pravi.
It is true, as you will see very well.	Istina je, kao što ćete vrlo dobro vidjeti.
There were many of them.	Bilo ih je mnogo.
Nobody told me anything.	Niko mi ništa nije rekao.
I had no idea.	Nisam imao pojma.
The only way they know.	Jedini način na koji znaju.
More is planned, he said.	Planira se više, rekao je.
I never want to be him again.	Nikad više ne želim da budem on.
That is indeed true.	To je zaista istina.
If you were there, you would know.	Da si bio tamo, znao bi.
I was glad to be there.	Bilo mi je drago biti tamo.
It wasn't enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno.
This is not a game.	Ovo nije igra.
You couldn't tell when he needed it.	Niste mogli reći kada ga je trebalo.
But this is my life.	Ali ovo je moj život.
That will not happen.	To se neće dogoditi.
But there must be more to it than that.	Ali mora biti više od toga.
I asked him to tell me that.	Zamolio sam ga da mi to kaže.
He came to help, and he will help.	Došao je da pomogne, i pomoći će.
We both knew that.	Oboje smo to znali.
He wasn't happy about that.	Nije bio sretan zbog toga.
I know what to do now.	Znam šta da radim sada.
If you were here.	Da si bio ovde.
I got you.	Imam te.
I hope it works for you.	Nadam se da radi za vas.
She never said anything.	Nikada nije rekla ništa.
So it was for me.	Tako je bilo i za mene.
Here you can see what is happening.	Ovdje možete vidjeti šta se dešava.
I can't go on.	Ne mogu dalje.
You just have to know that you can too.	Samo moraš znati da i ti možeš.
I haven't been there long enough.	Nisam bio tamo dovoljno dugo.
That's what he wants.	To je ono što on želi.
I guess you can't do that.	Pretpostavljam da to ne možeš.
For.	Za.
We can't do everything in one day.	Ne možemo sve da uradimo za jedan dan.
But his father wants him there.	Ali otac ga želi tamo.
But still nothing.	Ali i dalje ništa.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
And it is.	I jeste.
The more the better.	Što više to bolje.
So far so good.	Do sada je tako.
I have a job.	Imam posao.
I just wanted to ask you.	Samo sam htela da te pitam.
But as far as I know, it works well.	Ali koliko znam, radi dobro.
You have to do it.	Moraš to uraditi.
You can't believe anything she says.	Ne možeš vjerovati ništa što ona kaže.
I'm going to work on it.	Idem da radim na tome.
But you don't know.	Ali ti ne znaš.
Just to see how it is.	Samo da vidim kako je.
That was a good reason to leave home as soon as he could.	To je bio dobar razlog da ode od kuće što je prije mogao.
I should go.	Trebao bih otići.
I could never do that.	Nikada to ne bih mogao.
I've said enough.	Rekao sam dovoljno.
Everyone had them.	Svi su ih imali.
It works well so far.	Sada radi dobro do sada.
People had little money.	Ljudi su imali malo novca.
But it's not that it was good.	Ali nije da je bilo dobro.
But not much.	Ali ne mnogo.
Anything beyond that, you are alone.	Sve dalje od toga, sami ste.
You lost one, you lost many.	Izgubio si jedan, izgubio si mnogo.
You need to know how to do it.	Morate znati kako to raditi.
That's not what he does to me.	To nije ono što mi radi.
I think he's happy.	Mislim da je sretan.
I want you with us for this.	Želim te sa nama za ovo.
It was just the way it was.	Jednostavno je bilo kako jeste.
He loved to talk.	Voleo je da priča.
I never wanted to be like him.	Nikad nisam želeo da budem kao on.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
And that's my problem.	I to je moj problem.
He can't do this again.	Ne može ovo ponovo.
Nothing this year.	Ove godine ništa.
Nothing I haven't seen many times before.	Ništa što nisam vidio mnogo puta prije.
I never thought you would.	Nikad nisam mislio da hoćeš.
Why why why why.	Zašto zašto zašto zašto.
Life goes on.	Život ide dalje.
And these are not.	A ove nisu.
I had no time.	Nisam imao vremena.
He never saw it.	Nikada to nije vidio.
And it never will be.	I nikada neće biti.
But this will not be so easy.	Ali ovo neće biti tako lako.
Now he had no one, nothing.	Sada nije imao nikoga, ništa.
It's only three days from now.	To je samo tri dana od sada.
But it didn't.	Ali nije.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
It never did.	Nikad nije.
No one ever gave me anything.	Niko mi nikad ništa nije dao.
Not like me.	Ne kao ja.
She plays hard to get.	Ona se igra teško dobiti.
It's not something you have.	To nije nešto što imaš.
They were not helpful.	Nisu bili od pomoći.
I know he's just a person.	Znam da je on samo osoba.
We are like a radio.	Mi smo kao radio.
You're actually right.	Zapravo si u pravu.
He left.	Otišao je.
I really would.	Zaista bi.
I wanted my life.	Želeo sam svoj život.
It's not just about us.	Ne radi se samo o nama.
I said with whom.	Rekao sam s kim.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
I'm sure of it.	Ja sam siguran u to.
If you are sure.	Ako ste sigurni.
She told him the truth.	Rekla mu je istinu.
It's not quite there yet.	Još nije baš tamo.
This is not good or bad.	Ovo nije dobro ili loše.
It's not about that.	Ne radi se o tome.
But it was hard, hard.	Ali bilo je teško, teško.
I'm very sorry.	Jako mi je žao.
John wasn't there.	John nije bio tamo.
And just as he realized how much he wanted her.	I baš kao što je shvatio koliko je želi.
But that says so little.	Ali to tako malo govori.
Maybe he's right.	Možda je u pravu.
Very little.	Vrlo malo.
He never returned.	Nikad se nije vratio.
Yes, it's true.	Da to je istina.
We are alone now.	Sada smo sami.
It was just a question of when.	Bilo je samo pitanje kada.
He had heard so much about it.	Toliko je čuo o tome.
And she will no longer be alone.	I više neće biti sama.
I mean here.	Mislim ovdje.
But it wasn't that bad.	Ali to nije bilo tako loše.
Probably true.	Verovatno i istina.
Obviously, this is a problem.	Očigledno, ovo je problem.
Everything is going well.	Sve ide dobro.
I hope everyone is fine.	Nadam se da su svi dobro.
I'm sorry it just isn't.	Žao mi je što jednostavno nije.
Indeed, he does not seem to be able to.	Zaista, čini se da ne može.
Neither was he.	Nije bio ni on.
But you'll be home soon.	Ali uskoro ćeš biti kući.
I only have this.	Imam samo ovo.
I've had it for a few years.	Imam ga već nekoliko godina.
I hope someone else comes for him.	Nadam se da će još neko doći po njega.
Tonight, if you want.	Večeras, ako želiš.
Only so long can you go so hard.	Samo tako dugo možeš ići tako teško.
He did it.	On je to radio.
It's my job to know.	To je moj posao da znam.
You won't, you know.	Nećeš, znaš.
We've had enough for now.	Dosta nam je za sada.
They just can't do it.	Oni to jednostavno ne mogu.
I want to see you.	Želim da te vidim.
Nobody tells you that.	Niko ti to ne govori.
He is ready.	On je spreman.
We needed that.	To nam je trebalo.
We couldn't go back now.	Sada se nismo mogli vratiti.
He was hope.	On je bio nada.
In fact, no one is.	U stvari, niko nije.
And not just you.	I ne samo ti.
What do you think.	Šta mislite.
I'm sorry, she said.	Žao mi je, rekla je.
A few years.	Nekoliko godina.
That's one way.	To je jedan način.
More than enough.	Više nego dovoljno.
I know exactly what he's doing.	Znam tačno šta radi.
He needed everything he had.	Trebalo mu je sve što je imao.
Obviously not.	Očigledno nije.
I have to be.	Moram biti.
It was very, very good.	Bilo je jako, jako dobro.
You are there.	Ti si tamo.
You haven't yet.	Još nisi.
There is nothing to buy.	Nema se šta kupiti.
That's what we do.	To je ono što radimo.
Nobody did.	Niko nije.
We know where he is.	Znamo gdje je.
I heard little, I saw nothing.	Malo sam čuo, ništa nisam vidio.
It shouldn't run fast.	Ne bi trebalo da radi brzo.
There was no help for him.	Nije mu bilo pomoći.
I didn't want to know.	Nisam htela da znam.
I had a good day.	Imao sam dobar dan.
Nothing much.	Ništa mnogo.
All that stuff.	Sve te stvari.
This is not the first time he has done such a thing.	Ovo nije prvi put da je uradio tako nešto.
We have to do it right.	Moramo to da uradimo kako treba.
Yes, no problem.	Jeste, bez problema.
They know everything.	Oni sve znaju.
Just keep going.	Samo tako dalje i dalje.
This is the only one.	Ovo je jedina.
This does not happen often anymore.	To se više ne dešava često.
He was never there.	Nikada nije bio tamo.
He is better than us.	On je bolji od nas.
It doesn't work anymore.	Više ne radi.
This will not be easy to say.	Ovo neće biti lako reći.
Not the way you think.	Ne na način na koji misliš.
How is it .	Kako je .
He always had something to do.	Uvek je imao nešto da radi.
I doubt it.	Sumnjam u to.
They knew why they were there.	Znali su zašto su tamo.
He worked harder to have a better life.	Radio je više da bi imali bolji život.
And I told him that.	I to sam mu rekao.
He can't go.	Ne može ići.
I don't know what they are.	Ne znam šta su oni.
Things you probably shouldn't.	Stvari koje verovatno ne bi trebalo.
you say.	ti kažeš.
He loves these things.	On voli ove stvari.
I'm tired of it.	Umoran sam od toga.
And it was good that he did.	I bilo je dobro da je to uradio.
I wondered what he would tell me.	Pitao sam se šta će mi reći.
But that doesn't do any good.	Ali to ne čini dobro.
In fact, it is already happening.	U stvari, to se već dešava.
It's money.	To je novac.
You can't let him do that.	Ne možeš mu dozvoliti da to uradi.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
It's like.	To je kao.
Or he told me he did.	Ili mi je rekao da jeste.
I know he would say that too.	Znam da bi i on to rekao.
But now that may not happen.	Ali sada se to možda neće dogoditi.
But this is.	Ali ovo je.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
In fact, I like not having it.	U stvari, volim da ga nemam.
Quick and easy.	Brzo i jednostavno.
I knew that very well.	To sam dobro znao.
It's too real.	Previše je stvarno.
He said it himself.	On je to sam rekao.
I said maybe.	Rekao sam možda.
Everyone knew that.	Svi su to znali.
It was a really, really hard time for me.	Bilo je to zaista, zaista teško vrijeme za mene.
‘year’.	'godina'.
Maybe, but it's unlikely.	Možda, ali malo je vjerovatno.
Today it is.	Danas jeste.
You can do it if you want.	Možeš to uraditi ako želiš.
And before that.	I prije toga.
We will help you.	Mi ćemo vam pomoći.
It is usually about.	Obično se radi o.
You wanted me.	Želeo si me.
I can't do this without you.	Ne mogu ovo bez tebe.
I'm not one.	Ja nisam jedan.
Many times, if true.	Više puta, ako je istina.
It is so.	To je tako.
I may not get any of that.	Možda neću dobiti ništa od toga.
But he doesn't want to help us either.	Ali ni on ne želi da nam pomogne.
She thinks this is a good thing.	Ona misli da je ovo dobra stvar.
Really long.	Zaista dugo.
And this time he is safe.	I ovaj put je siguran.
But that seemed to be the only way.	Ali činilo se da je to jedini način.
He was the first there.	On je bio prvi tamo.
It works well.	Radi dobro.
He did it quickly.	Brzo je to uradio.
I'm not afraid.	Ja se ne bojim.
I could tell.	Mogao bih reći.
If only it was.	Samo da jeste.
I think he likes it.	Mislim da mu se sviđa.
A new life.	Novi život.
Something very bad just happened.	Nešto jako loše se upravo dogodilo.
I was ready for it.	Bio sam spreman za to.
Today it was me.	Danas sam to bio ja.
I’m glad it looks so good.	Drago mi je da izgleda tako dobro.
That wasn't true either.	Ni to nije bila istina.
We have to tell the truth.	Moramo reći istinu.
It wasn't like now.	Nije bilo kao sada.
We couldn't talk here.	Nismo mogli razgovarati ovdje.
Maybe never since last night.	Možda nikad od sinoć.
That was bad.	To je bilo loše.
I didn't want to do this alone.	Nisam želeo ovo da uradim sam.
And what else did they know.	I šta su još znali.
You are with me.	Ti si sa mnom.
Something will happen.	Nešto će se dogoditi.
But now we are better than that.	Ali sada smo bolji od toga.
I never thought he would leave.	Nikad nisam mislio da će otići.
But there is another.	Ali postoji još jedan.
Not much.	Ne mnogo.
No one was sure what was going on.	Niko nije bio siguran šta se dešava.
Or say no.	Ili reci ne.
And that was her.	I to je ona bila.
She loves you very much.	Ona te mnogo voli.
How about that?	Šta kažeš na to?
I don't know anything.	Ne znam ništa.
There is something else.	Ima još nešto.
As if she didn't know.	Kao da nije znala.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
Certainly not.	Sigurno ne bi.
Everything is as good as it is.	Sve je dobro kako jeste.
He really has better things to do.	On zaista ima bolje stvari za uraditi.
Maybe not so good.	Možda nije tako dobro.
It didn't take long.	Nije dugo trebalo.
I'm sure he's right.	Siguran sam da je u pravu.
Which won't work.	Što neće raditi.
Anytime.	Bilo kada.
It wasn't him.	To nije bio on.
But it's not good.	Ali nije dobro.
I do not know why.	Ne znam zašto.
She goes on.	Ona ide dalje.
He was surprised to see me.	Bio je iznenađen kad me je vidio.
But you did.	Ali jesi.
I think everything you say is true.	Mislim da je sve što kažeš tačno.
I've never seen this before.	Nikada prije nisam vidio ovo.
It wasn't a job.	To nije bio posao.
That will never happen.	To se nikada neće dogoditi.
I think it's really good for us.	Mislim da nam je to zaista dobro.
He never wanted to do it again.	Nikad to više nije želio da uradi.
I'll say yes!.	Reći ću da!.
That's life in general.	To je život uopšte.
He never was.	Nikada nije bio.
But that is no longer true.	Ali to više nije istina.
But say you'll be back.	Ali reci da ćeš se vratiti.
I thought he would be better.	Mislio sam da će mu biti bolje.
I hope so.	Nadam se da jeste.
I know the truth.	Znam istinu.
He's not doing so well.	Ne ide mu tako dobro.
If he doesn't do a good job.	Ako ne uradi dobar posao.
They didn't know what.	Nisu znali šta.
It's a little hard to work with.	Malo je teško raditi.
This works and works very well.	Ovo radi i radi vrlo dobro.
It's really about power.	Stvarno se radi o moći.
It was a really difficult time for me.	Bilo je to zaista teško vrijeme za mene.
I expected much more.	Očekivao sam mnogo više.
I guess that was it.	Pretpostavljam da je to bilo to.
We can do more and better.	Možemo više i bolje.
But I want to.	Ali želim.
It will go on.	Ići će i dalje.
They know exactly what's going on.	Oni tačno znaju šta se dešava.
I was good enough.	Bio sam dovoljno dobar.
It's very.	To je veoma.
They didn't tell us how.	Nisu nam rekli kako.
I know he would say that too.	Znam da bi i on to rekao.
But he can't.	Ali ne može.
If you won't, who will?	Ako ti nećeš, ko će?
But not too much.	Ali ne previše.
That can only be a good thing.	To može biti samo dobra stvar.
If we really have.	Ako zaista imamo.
I never said that.	Nikad to nisam rekao.
Or he knew it.	Ili je to znao.
This is not much.	Ovo nije puno.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda i nije.
But he didn't know that.	Ali on to nije znao.
I'm afraid so, almost.	Bojim se da je tako, skoro.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
I didn't expect to see them.	Nisam očekivao da ću ih vidjeti.
I had no idea what to say to that.	Nisam imao pojma šta da kažem na to.
This is not difficult.	Ovo nije teško.
Or even this afternoon.	Ili čak danas popodne.
Maybe you don't know.	Možda i ne znaš.
Besides, you have to tell us what's going on.	Osim toga, morate nam reći šta se dešava.
I was happy to do it.	Bio sam sretan što sam to uradio.
I didn't tell him.	Nisam mu rekao.
I really doubt it.	Zaista sumnjam.
I hope we never have to again.	Nadam se da nikada više nećemo morati.
With so much you could do.	Sa toliko toga što bi mogao da radiš.
That must have happened to me.	To mi se sigurno dogodilo.
Who we are.	Ko smo mi.
Nothing is wrong.	Ništa nije u redu.
Enough of that.	Dosta toga.
You can't just leave.	Ne možeš samo otići.
He says nothing more.	Ne kaže ništa više.
It was enough, it was a lot.	Bilo je dosta, bilo je mnogo.
But he won't leave.	Ali on neće otići.
There's nothing we can do.	Ne možemo ništa.
In fact, it is not.	U stvari, nije.
It was just something that happened.	Bilo je to samo nešto što se dogodilo.
You can't stay here alone.	Ne možete ostati ovdje sami.
So, perhaps, so far.	Tako je, možda, do sada.
Not you, not them.	Ne ti, ne oni.
I was ready.	Bio sam spreman.
He loved the good life.	Voleo je dobar život.
But it wouldn't be me.	Ali to ne bih bio ja.
They couldn't see him.	Nisu ga mogli vidjeti.
No friend.	Niko prijatelj.
That's how it's done.	Tako se radi.
But she doesn't have to work.	Ali ona ne mora da radi.
He was usually right.	Obično je bio u pravu.
It really was.	To je zaista bilo.
I want too much.	Želim previše.
I certainly won't.	Ja sigurno neću.
He can see it.	On to može vidjeti.
They can do it.	Oni to mogu.
I would do this.	Ja bih ovo uradio.
It must have been just that guy, he told himself.	Sigurno je to bio samo taj momak, rekao je sebi.
Now we know it's not.	Sada znamo da nije.
It's something you shouldn't do.	To je nešto što ne treba da radite.
So much has happened.	Toliko se toga dogodilo.
I don't know if it's this one.	Ne znam da li je ovaj.
You should go too.	I ti bi trebao ići.
She said so.	Ona je tako rekla.
And in fact they were not.	A u stvari nisu bili.
I want more than just seeing.	Želim više od samo vidjeti.
In fact, she was.	U stvari bila je.
He can't see you today.	Ne može te vidjeti danas.
He works better and better.	On radi sve bolje i bolje.
More than you would there.	Više nego što bi tamo.
I don't even know why.	Ne znam ni zašto.
Tell us the truth.	Reci nam istinu.
Nothing for you right now.	Ništa za tebe trenutno.
If only for a while.	Ako samo na neko vrijeme.
But no one knows what happened next.	Ali šta se dalje dogodilo niko ne zna.
Probably not.	Verovatno nije.
I could still see him.	Još sam ga mogao vidjeti.
But he's doing well.	Ali dobro mu ide.
The only question was who it would be.	Pitanje je bilo samo ko će to biti.
A long time ago.	Prije mnogo vremena.
He is a good man who knows his job.	On je dobar čovjek koji zna svoj posao.
This is not obvious.	Ovo nije očigledno.
But you look good.	Ali dobro izgledaš.
I never told you this.	Nikad ti ovo nisam rekao.
I like how it looks now.	Sviđa mi se kako sada izgleda.
He wanted the truth.	Želio je istinu.
And you want more.	I ti želiš više.
Good father.	Dobar otac.
Not much here.	Ovdje nema puno.
I know he will.	Znam da hoće.
I would never do that to us.	Nikada nam to ne bih uradio.
Never say never.	Nikad ne reci nikad.
One cannot know something that is not so.	Ne može se znati nešto što nije tako.
It was quick.	Bilo je brzo.
She's still a problem.	Ona je i dalje problem.
I just didn't think this would happen.	Nisam samo mislio da će se ovo dogoditi.
But this was difficult.	Ali ovo je bilo teško.
I really don't know what to do anymore.	Zaista više ne znam šta da radim.
But there is help.	Ali tu je pomoć.
It was too good.	Bilo je previše dobro.
It's fast.	Brzo je.
But it seems to have happened.	Ali izgleda da se to dogodilo.
This is life.	Ovo je život.
It actually works pretty well.	Zapravo radi prilično dobro.
And, in fact, that's exactly right.	A, u stvari, to je upravo tako.
That much I know.	Toliko znam.
I see that myself.	To i sam vidim.
I got almost nothing.	Dobio sam skoro ništa.
Just nothing.	Samo ništa.
Why should it be easy?	Zašto bi to trebalo da bude lako?
But it seems so.	Ali izgleda tako.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
It wasn't good at the time.	U to vrijeme nije bilo dobro.
But that would be so hard.	Ali to bi bilo tako teško.
Would do it again.	Uradio bi to ponovo.
And very happy.	I veoma sretan.
If we have time, we can get to it.	Ako imamo vremena, možemo doći do toga.
That's good and bad.	To je dobro i loše.
I wish you could.	Bi da možeš.
This is my first problem.	Ovo je moj prvi problem.
She can do much better than that.	Ona može mnogo bolje od toga.
She will help me.	Ona će mi pomoći.
You can do everything right and it still happens.	Možete učiniti sve kako treba i to se i dalje dešava.
It’s just not good enough for enough people.	Jednostavno nije dovoljno dobro za dovoljno ljudi.
Everything we need to know.	Sve što treba da znamo.
They can't do anything to us.	Ne mogu nam ništa učiniti.
We can be sure that this is true.	Možemo biti sigurni da je to tačno.
If we have a problem, we this.	Ako imamo problem, mi ovo.
From that.	Od toga.
It's none of my business.	Nije moja stvar.
I don't do that anymore.	Više to ne radim.
No, no, that's okay.	Ne, ne, to je u redu.
He wanted something he could do on his own.	Želeo je nešto što može sam da uradi.
It was very real.	Bilo je vrlo stvarno.
The question is whether that is true or not.	Pitanje je da li je to tačno ili ne.
In fact, there really is.	U stvari, zaista postoji.
Like all of them.	Kao i svi oni.
You couldn't see it.	Nisi to mogao vidjeti.
You did the right thing.	Uradio si kako treba.
You did everything right.	Uradili ste sve kako treba.
This is not right.	Ovo nije u redu.
I say it again.	Ponovo kažem.
You're not ready.	Nisi spreman.
Everything he said was enough.	Sve što je rekao bilo je dovoljno.
It actually works.	To zapravo radi.
I did not know what to say.	Nisam znao šta da kažem.
There is no one like him.	Ne postoji niko kao on.
We were once human.	Nekada smo bili ljudi.
And you can do it too.	A i ti to možeš.
It was that man.	Bio je to taj čovjek.
We should have been sure.	Trebali smo biti sigurni.
Just like people.	Baš kao i ljudi.
I saw him yesterday.	Video sam ga juče.
As if it had already happened.	Kao da se to već dogodilo.
I do not know either.	Ne znam ni ja.
Yes, we have to do it.	Da, moramo to učiniti.
It wasn't hard.	Nije bilo teško.
But now there was no time.	Ali sada nije bilo vremena.
There.	Tamo .
Is that you?.	Jesi li to ti?.
I guess so.	Pretpostavljam da jeste.
And he knew he had to do it fast.	I znao je da to mora učiniti brzo.
He plays well.	Igra dobro.
But it was hard for him.	Ali mu je bilo teško.
I will be a father.	Ja ću biti otac.
It's a good game.	To je dobra igra.
She told me to move on.	Rekla mi je da idem dalje.
One and only.	Jedan i jedini.
There are also a lot of people.	Ima i dosta ljudi.
They are with me.	Oni su sa mnom.
You will probably have to go to work.	Vjerovatno ćete morati na posao.
That's not my problem.	To nije moj problem.
I can not believe.	Ne mogu vjerovati.
I love you more than you know.	Volim vas više nego što znate.
You are all here.	Svi ste ovde.
But he loved you.	Ali on te je volio.
I asked her about it.	Pitao sam je o tome.
I loved these.	Voleo sam ove.
We were supposed to meet here.	Ovdje smo se trebali naći.
That's right.	Tako je.
Work with him.	Radi sa njim.
I won't take it easy.	Neću lako.
But you haven't yet.	Ali još nisi.
There is no one to help me.	Nema ko da mi pomogne.
I see it.	Vidim to.
Besides, something like that probably doesn't exist.	Osim toga, tako nešto vjerovatno ne postoji.
But there is much more to it than that.	Ali ima mnogo više od toga.
Now, it won't.	Sada, neće.
This is for all of us.	Ovo je za sve nas.
It doesn’t have to happen right away.	Ne mora se to dogoditi odmah.
Maybe it's that one.	Možda je i taj.
You want to do well for him.	Želiš da radiš dobro za njega.
So far, no problems.	Do sada, nema problema.
It wasn't hard.	Nije bilo teško.
It's not the first time.	Nije prvi put.
Do they know what they have done?	Da li znaju šta su uradili?
But this can be difficult.	Ali ovo može biti teško.
But you didn't do that.	Ali vi to niste uradili.
He couldn't see her.	Nije mogao da je vidi.
I have it now.	Imam ga sada.
Yes, you can really only do what you really can.	Da, zaista možete učiniti samo ono što zaista možete.
I'm afraid you're right.	Bojim se da si u pravu.
There seemed to be no time.	Činilo se kao da nema vremena.
I was so happy to see them both.	Bio sam tako sretan što sam ih oboje vidio.
She was at home here.	Ovdje je bila kod kuće.
You gave it away.	Dao si ga.
We really didn't.	Zaista nismo.
Tell him that.	Reci mu to.
Nobody asked me to do it.	Niko me nije pitao da to uradim.
And maybe.	I možda .
They didn't say anything.	Ništa nisu rekli.
Tell him everything.	Reci mu sve.
But they knew very little.	Ali oni su znali vrlo malo.
When you have to work, you have to work.	Kad moraš da radiš, moraš da radiš.
And he did the job !.	I posao je uradio!.
But it wasn't always like that.	Ali nije uvijek bilo tako.
Now he wondered.	Sada se pitao.
You could come and stay with us.	Mogli biste doći i ostati kod nas.
It's still you.	I dalje si ti.
I haven't been there long.	Nisam bio tamo dugo.
You probably are too.	I ti si, vjerovatno.
He had to go now.	Morao je da ide sada.
Now that's not such a good idea.	Sada to nije tako dobra ideja.
It can't be hard.	To ne može biti teško.
He made it.	On je to napravio.
Maybe there's something he can do.	Možda ima nešto što može da uradi.
What does it look like?	Kako to izgleda?
I've never heard of it.	Nikad nisam čuo za to.
We either work or we don’t.	Ili radimo ili ne radimo.
You know, you don't even have to do this.	Znate, ne morate ni ovo da radite.
They had a lot of problems.	Imali su mnogo problema.
I'm sure he would.	Siguran sam da bi.
He thought everything would be fine.	Mislio je da će sve biti u redu.
Get and how much.	Dobiti i koliko.
Something is working.	Nešto radi.
It just looks like something you say.	Samo izgleda kao nešto što kažeš.
There's nothing wrong with that.	Nije u redu s tim.
That would really be too much.	To bi zaista bilo previše.
You have to do something else.	Moraš još nešto da uradiš.
You obviously know what you're doing.	Očigledno znaš šta radiš.
I can't talk to you right now.	Ne mogu razgovarati s tobom sada.
I kept saying no.	I dalje sam rekao ne.
But it takes time.	Ali za to treba vremena.
That was the story.	To je bila priča.
We are human.	Mi smo ljudi.
That would be the case now.	Tako bi sada bilo.
Just a friend, that's all.	Samo prijatelj, to je sve.
I think do what you want.	Mislim da radi ono što želiš.
There is no door.	Nema vrata.
I'm not sure what's going on or what to do.	Nisam siguran šta se dešava ili šta da radim.
You don't have to tell me you're tired.	Ne moraš mi reći da si umoran.
I could do without it.	Mogao sam i bez toga.
It's just being here.	To je samo biti ovdje.
There aren't many of them.	Nema ih mnogo.
But that won't be enough.	Ali to neće biti dovoljno.
I have them all here.	Imam ih sve ovdje.
He waits for no one.	Ne čeka nikoga.
We had you here last year.	Imali smo te ovdje prošle godine.
If only it was.	Samo da jeste.
If only she would tell him she loves him.	Kad bi mu samo rekla da ga voli.
We can't do our job without it.	Bez toga ne možemo raditi svoj posao.
I want to be a guy.	Želim da budem momak.
But he knows he's right.	Ali on zna da je u pravu.
This is fast.	Ovo je brzo.
I had to help him this time.	Morao sam mu pomoći ovaj put.
Actually, it happened quite quickly.	Zapravo, to se dogodilo prilično brzo.
I think that's really something.	Mislim da je to zaista nešto.
He didn't want to do that.	On to nije htio učiniti.
Can you do that?	Možeš li to da uradiš?
It can't be right.	Ne može biti u redu.
When would.	Kada bi .
There was nothing certain about that.	U tome nije bilo ništa sigurno.
I work.	Radim.
You all have to trust me, just a little longer.	Morate mi svi vjerovati, samo još malo.
They simply.	Oni jednostavno.
She never said she was afraid of him.	Nikada nije rekla da ga se boji.
That would be enough.	To bi bilo dovoljno.
It was day.	Bio je dan.
And it's true, they were.	I istina je, bili su.
That is not easy to do.	To nije lako uraditi.
They will come for it.	Doći će po to.
That's good money.	To je dobar novac.
You didn't do anything.	Nisi ništa radio.
They did nothing wrong.	Nisu uradili ništa loše.
I decided on that.	Odlučio sam se na to.
What he had to do.	Šta je morao da uradi.
No one needs to know.	Niko ne mora da zna.
They won't come back.	Neće se vratiti.
I'm really happy for you.	Zaista sam sretan zbog tebe.
They are here.	Oni su ovde.
It's really you.	To si ti zaista.
I would have understood that immediately.	Ja bih to odmah shvatio.
You seem to be able to do anything.	Čini se da možeš sve.
I want to do everything.	Želim sve da uradim.
That's what you have to do.	To je ono što morate učiniti.
He didn't even have it.	Nije ga ni imao.
This is something more than that.	Ovo je nešto više od toga.
He actually likes school.	On zapravo voli školu.
Now, don't.	Sada, i nemoj.
Probably not.	Vjerovatno nije.
He just had.	Upravo je imao.
But if that's not you, that's okay.	Ali ako to nisi ti, u redu je.
This will happen quickly.	Ovo će se brzo dogoditi.
I always thought everyone knew this.	Uvek sam mislio da svi ovo znaju.
A friend came to drive us.	Došao je prijatelj da nas vozi.
But you don't have to do that.	Ali ne morate to da radite.
Like it's just a matter of time.	Kao da je samo pitanje vremena.
I can not anymore.	Ne mogu više.
But that is not really the case.	Ali to u stvari nije tako.
But we had no idea.	Ali nismo imali pojma.
We need more of that.	Treba nam više toga.
He would have to see it for himself.	Morao bi to sam da vidi.
He left immediately.	Odmah je otišao.
More this time.	Više ovaj put.
I expected that.	Očekivao sam to.
I could do it now, you know.	Mogao bih to sada da uradim, znaš.
It could be a lot.	Moglo bi biti mnogo.
But life is good.	Ali život je dobar.
It's too much at home.	Previše je kod kuće.
Everything will be fine.	Sve će biti u redu.
No one could find him.	Niko ga nije mogao naći.
It was real.	Bilo je stvarno.
I'll just stay home.	Samo ću ostati kod kuće.
He doesn't love me either.	I on me ne voli.
It's bad enough for that.	Dovoljno je loše za to.
I'm tired of myself.	Umoran sam od sebe.
That one didn't see me.	Taj me nije vidio.
He wants her.	On je želi.
Just live with it.	Samo živi s tim.
That's how it was for me.	Tako mi je bilo.
I don't know who.	Ne znam s kim.
And that's not all.	I to nije sve.
We could do it together, you and me.	Mogli bismo to zajedno, ti i ja.
It will all be work.	Sve će to biti posao.
It was really good for a while.	Bilo je jako dobro neko vrijeme.
Good money if you can get it.	Dobar novac ako ga možete dobiti.
I'll find him.	Naći ću ga.
Everything is a game there.	Tamo je sve igra.
I asked when he would be back.	Pitao sam kada će se vratiti.
I can buy it.	Mogu to kupiti.
They were a problem.	Oni su bili problem.
I have it.	Imam to.
But now he was his own again.	Ali sada je ponovo bio svoj.
I hope not.	Nadam se da nije tako.
That’s the only way my father loves it.	To je jedini način na koji moj otac voli.
It was a lot.	Bilo je puno.
More than that, we don't know.	Više od toga, ne znamo.
Just a little bit for now.	Samo malo za sada.
He told me to ask you.	Rekao mi je da te pitam.
I probably need a few more days, as always.	Vjerovatno mi treba još nekoliko dana, kao i uvijek.
I'm doing them tomorrow.	Radim ih sutra.
But they had me.	Ali imali su mene.
He is what he is.	On je ono što jeste.
I think he told me that.	Mislim da mi je to rekao.
It's not just.	Nije samo.
He wasn't bad.	Nije bio loš.
But that's the problem.	Ali to je problem.
That's right now.	To je trenutno.
Who said very little and did much.	Koji je rekao vrlo malo, a uradio mnogo.
I really like it.	Stvarno mi se sviđa.
We are the first.	Mi smo prvi.
For what? 	Za što?
he wondered.	pitao se on.
He asked about you.	Pitao je za tebe.
I will tell you.	Reći ću ti.
But he seems to be fine.	Ali izgleda da je on dobro.
No, not tomorrow.	Ne, ne sutra.
I did my best.	Dao sam sve od sebe.
And that could never happen.	A to se nikada ne bi moglo dogoditi.
I'm sorry she knew.	Žao mi je što je znala.
And to be happy.	I da budem sretan.
My father didn't.	Moj otac nije.
Maybe I knew that.	Možda sam to znao.
I can't do it again.	Ne mogu to ponovo.
But that's not the problem here.	Ali to ovdje nije problem.
I can't do what you do.	Ne mogu da radim ono što ti radiš.
Things, not so much.	Stvari, ne toliko.
I've never even heard of such a thing.	Nikad nisam ni čuo za tako nešto.
It must be good.	Mora biti dobro.
People are .	Ljudi su .
That's what you should be doing.	To je ono što bi trebao raditi.
It's just you and me.	Samo smo ti i ja.
I want you too much.	Želim te previše.
Which it doesn't.	Što ne čini.
I hope you are.	Nadam se da jesi.
But that was no good.	Ali to nije bilo dobro.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
This is not true at all.	Ovo uopšte nije tačno.
I have to move on.	Moram dalje.
We still don't know what it was.	Još uvijek ne znamo šta je to bilo.
Maybe even to yourself.	Čak i sebi možda.
Which is correct.	Što je tačno.
I think it's both.	Mislim da je oboje.
I have one more day than you.	Imam još jedan dan više od tebe.
She said she didn't feel well.	Rekla je da se ne osjeća dobro.
I know you want to.	Znam da želiš.
I have everything.	Imam sve.
I didn't see it right away.	Nisam to odmah vidio.
It's okay, you know.	U redu je, znaš.
There's so much he can do.	Toliko toga može da uradi.
I think that is correct.	Mislim da je to tačno.
That will never happen.	To se nikada neće dogoditi.
There is simply no money.	Novac jednostavno nema.
Except they know what it is.	Osim što znaju šta je to.
We've all been there.	Svi smo bili tamo.
It's really simple.	Zaista je jednostavno.
He could be here.	Ovdje bi mogao.
I'm sure you would too.	Siguran sam da bi i ti.
She knew which was which.	Znala je koja je koja.
And that was the problem.	I to je bio problem.
Besides, he was right.	Osim toga, bio je u pravu.
Just me, really.	Ja samo, zaista.
It was a bad day.	Dan je bio loš.
I thought there was something wrong with that.	Mislio sam da nešto nije u redu s tim.
It wasn't always like that.	Nije uvijek bilo tako.
You cannot do this work alone.	Ne možete sami raditi ovaj posao.
That seems to be true.	Čini se da je to tačno.
I really can't say for sure.	Zaista ne mogu reći, sigurno.
You have many years in you.	Imaš mnogo godina u sebi.
It's mine too.	I moj je.
They are absolutely right.	Potpuno su u pravu.
And that's hard.	I to je teško.
He wasn't surprised at all.	Uopšte nije bio iznenađen.
I just want it to work.	Samo želim da radi.
No, not that.	Ne, ne to.
Okay, everyone knew about these things except him.	U redu, svi su znali za ove stvari osim njega.
We didn't do it alone.	Nismo to uradili sami.
Or it doesn't work properly.	Ili ne radi kako treba.
No, you heard me.	Ne, čuo si me.
We need help.	Treba nam pomoć.
He tells you exactly what he thinks.	On vam tačno kaže šta misli.
You have to believe it.	Morate vjerovati u to.
He was doing his job.	Radio je svoj posao.
A lot needs to be done.	Mnogo toga treba uraditi.
I thought that was correct.	Mislio sam da je to tačno.
We have it.	Imamo ga.
And indeed, it was.	I zaista, bilo je.
We all have them.	Svi ih imamo.
He expected her to come back.	Očekivao je da će se vratiti.
Maybe what he did to me isn't so bad.	Možda to što mi je uradio i nije tako loše.
I love everything he does.	Volim sve što radi.
But now it will stay.	Ali sada će ostati.
Like, he doesn't have it.	Kao, on to nema.
You never came back.	Nikad se nisi vratio.
And maybe it's true.	I možda je tačno.
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
He was the only one who could.	On je jedini mogao.
That they don't know.	Da ne znaju.
I liked to think so.	Voleo sam da tako mislim.
I could.	Mogao bih.
I want so many things.	Želim toliko stvari.
Bad and real.	Loše i stvarno.
It's not easy.	Nije lako.
I don't see it.	Ne vidim to.
Radio with him.	Radio sa njim.
I say what.	Kažem šta .
Now he had done all he could.	Sada je učinio sve što je mogao.
It just works really well.	Jednostavno radi jako dobro.
There is not much to see.	Nema mnogo za vidjeti.
I almost like it a lot.	Skoro da mi se mnogo sviđa.
You wanted us all together.	Želeo si nas sve zajedno.
I know that in a way that you never will.	Znam to na način na koji ti nikad nećeš.
It's good, not bad.	Dobro je, nije loše.
There was no time to tell him.	Nije bilo vremena da mu kažem.
He didn't mean that.	Nije mislio na to.
She is right.	U pravu je.
He didn't tell us who we were.	Nije nam rekao ko smo.
It's so easy !.	To je tako lako!.
Whether that was true or not is hard to say.	Teško je reći da li je to bilo tačno ili ne.
This is my job.	Ovo je moj posao.
But it is much more.	Ali to je mnogo više.
If you still want it, fine.	Ako ga i dalje želiš, u redu.
I was really, really surprised.	Bio sam stvarno, stvarno iznenađen.
He couldn't say exactly why.	Nije mogao tačno reći zašto.
He was ready.	Bio je spreman.
They're pretty good.	Prilično su dobro.
All those things.	Sve te stvari.
No, there will be none of that today.	Ne, danas neće biti ništa od toga.
It is nothing more than that.	Nije ništa više od toga.
I want to know that.	Želim to znati.
You know, not me, we.	Znaš, ne ja, mi.
That or or, that or or.	To ili ili, to ili ili.
You never saw me.	Nikad me nisi video.
But my car.	Ali moj auto.
He does his job very well.	Svoj posao radi veoma dobro.
It couldn't do more than it already did.	Nije moglo više nego što je već činilo.
Maybe more than enough.	Možda i više nego dovoljno.
This is not what she wanted.	Ovo nije ono što je htela.
It just can’t happen.	To se jednostavno ne može dogoditi.
But he got better almost immediately.	Ali, skoro odmah mu je bilo bolje.
We could have been alone.	Mogli smo biti i sami.
he sees them very well.	on ih veoma dobro vidi.
He arrived early.	Stigao je ranije.
That's what it should do.	To je ono što bi trebalo da radi.
That seems true.	To izgleda tačno.
I think he's right.	Mislim da je u pravu.
He obviously didn't do that.	To očigledno nije uradio.
he thought.	mislio je.
So far you have said enough.	Za sada ste rekli dovoljno.
He knows everything that can be known.	On zna sve što se može znati.
And she was there.	I ona je bila tamo.
She said for sure.	Rekla je sigurno.
You can return it now.	Možete ga vratiti sada.
I saw it.	Video sam to.
He thought of everything.	Mislio je na sve.
Not bad.	Nije loš.
That just wasn't true.	To jednostavno nije bila istina.
I mean it.	Mislim to.
It didn't happen right.	Nije se dogodilo kako treba.
I know you're right.	Znam da si u pravu.
And yes, that's true.	I da, to je istina.
Almost anything you want.	Skoro sve što želiš.
Indeed, we know it is.	Zaista, znamo da jeste.
Everything is current.	Sve je trenutno.
Nothing would happen.	Ništa se ne bi dogodilo.
And see why he says that.	I vidi se zašto to kaže.
It can't be that bad.	Ne može biti tako loše.
You all have to.	Svi morate.
I did that too.	I ja sam to uradio.
I never had one.	Nikad ga nisam imao.
It wouldn't be difficult.	Ne bi bilo teško.
No one did that either.	Ni to niko nije uradio.
But not really.	Ali ne stvarno.
I knew he knew that too.	Znao sam da je i on to znao.
That's what he told me a few days ago.	To mi je rekao prije nekoliko dana.
That's what they're for.	Za to su oni.
I'm really begging you.	Zaista te molim.
It could be anyone here.	Mogao bi biti bilo ko ovdje.
This could be good.	Ovo bi moglo biti dobro.
I will win this year.	Ove godine ću pobijediti.
If only it could be that simple.	Kad bi to moglo biti tako jednostavno.
But he wanted even more.	Ali želio je još više.
I had to tell him.	Morao sam mu reći.
He says something about you.	Kaže nešto za tebe.
Nobody knew who they were.	Niko nije znao ko su oni.
I'm like her.	Ja sam kao ona.
I have no idea.	Nemam pojma.
You are what you are.	Ti si ono što jesi.
And this is bad.	A ovo je loše.
Maybe she was all of those things.	Možda je ona bila sve te stvari.
They shouldn't do that.	Oni to ne bi trebali raditi.
I have to give it to him.	Moram mu to dati.
Good to know.	Dobro je znati.
And she wanted to know.	I ona je htela da zna.
I don't want to be with you.	Ne želim da budem s tobom.
That's the way it should be done.	To je način na koji to treba učiniti.
I've never been so happy before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio tako sretan.
You can't see any of that.	Ništa od toga ne možete vidjeti.
I decided not to tell him anything at the moment.	Odlučio sam da mu trenutno ništa ne kažem.
That's life.	To je život.
He seems to have understood well.	Izgleda da je dobro shvatio.
I can't do anything.	Ne mogu ništa.
Everyone knows me.	Svi me znaju.
It should be there.	Tamo treba da bude.
I would always be alone.	Uvek bih bila sama.
We can find plenty of time for that.	Možemo naći dosta vremena za to.
Yes, it just doesn't work.	Da, jednostavno ne radi.
I am going home.	Idem kući.
I can't trust anyone.	Ne mogu vjerovati nikome.
I've never seen him.	Nikad ga nisam vidio.
He's sure of it.	On je siguran u to.
It works.	To radi.
This was wrong.	Ovo nije bilo u redu.
Do you think it works?	Mislite li da radi?
You came back for it.	Vratio si se po to.
But maybe he was better now.	Ali možda mu je sada bilo bolje.
And it doesn't work.	I ne radi.
There doesn't have to be anything wrong.	Ne mora biti ništa loše.
I didn’t expect it to be that good.	Nisam očekivao da će biti tako dobro.
But he still had too much time.	Ali i dalje je imao previše vremena.
I saw them today.	Video sam ih danas.
She said you just need help.	Rekla je da ti samo treba pomoć.
I saw that.	Vidio sam to.
I didn't know she could do that.	Nisam znao da ona to može.
She was no help to him here.	Ona mu ovdje nije bila od pomoći.
I still don't know if we can do it.	Još uvek ne znam da li možemo to da uradimo.
It could be something, it could be nothing.	Moglo bi biti nešto, a moglo bi biti ništa.
He was gone.	Više ga nije bilo.
This code works.	Ovaj kod radi.
You can be sure of that.	U to možete biti sigurni.
It really is nothing.	Zaista nije ništa.
I can't do without him.	Ne mogu bez njega.
And that he will be back soon.	I da će se uskoro vratiti.
I have no idea about that.	Nemam pojma o tome.
My father is waiting for me at home.	Otac me čeka kući.
I have that too.	Imam i to.
Everything was as it should be.	Sve je bilo kako treba.
It's more just too much.	To je više samo previše.
Why not? 	Zašto ne?
He says.	On kaže.
He saw them, but not in time.	Video ih je, ali ne na vrijeme.
They said this.	Rekli su ovo.
And it always goes.	I uvek ode.
It is what it is.	To je ono što je.
He just sees what he sees and goes after it.	On samo vidi ono što vidi i ide za tim.
It's enough.	Dosta mi je.
Something needs to be done quickly.	Nešto treba brzo da se uradi.
You definitely need to know what it’s all about.	Sigurno morate znati o čemu se radi.
For very.	Za veoma.
Not that, please not that! 	Ne to, molim te ne to!
.	.
Not to mention, we.	Da ne kažem, mi.
Neither did she on him.	Ni ona na njega.
I wish it wasn't.	Voleo bih da nije.
I know what.	Znam šta.
That's pretty fast.	To je prilično brzo.
Don't say anything.	Ne govori ništa.
Maybe quite a long time.	Možda dosta dugo.
Probably no one will.	Vjerovatno niko neće.
I'm not glad this happened.	Nije mi drago što se ovo dogodilo.
I had time.	Imao sam vremena.
I know you are.	Znam da jesi.
He came to his door.	Došao mu je do vrata.
No one saw him again.	Niko ga više nije video.
And they would know.	I oni bi znali.
I didn't get to go because of the weather.	Nisam stigao da idem zbog vremena.
We should have been there.	Trebali smo biti tamo.
I still don't know that.	Ni dan danas to ne znam.
I was right not to do that.	Bio sam u pravu što to nisam uradio.
We don't need it here.	Ne treba nam to ovdje.
That's what he does.	To je ono što on radi.
We have to work together.	Moramo da radimo zajedno.
I'm surprised you're here.	Iznenađen sam da si ovde.
To see them.	Da ih vidim.
I mean, it's not.	Mislim, nije.
Or maybe it's not him.	Ili možda nije on.
He had never done that before.	Nikad to ranije nije uradio.
It's been a long time.	Bilo je dugo.
That's good to know.	To je dobro znati.
That could probably be done.	To bi se vjerovatno moglo uraditi.
I wouldn't say anything.	Ne bih ništa rekao.
We do it too.	I mi to radimo.
But not this time.	Ali ne ovaj put.
But there won't be that many.	Ali neće ih biti toliko.
I'm here.	Tu sam.
We have it all and more.	Imamo sve to i više.
It should be very easy for you.	Trebalo bi vam biti vrlo lako.
Do everything she tells you.	Uradi sve što ti ona kaže.
That's what we did today.	To smo danas uradili.
But he couldn't do anything.	Ali nije mogao ništa.
That seems like a long time.	Čini se da je to dugo.
Better him than us.	Bolje on nego mi.
I should never have gone alone.	Nikada nisam trebao otići sam.
It was probably a good thing she wasn't here.	Verovatno je bilo dobro što nije bila ovde.
I was looking for a little.	Tražio sam malo.
And my car.	I moj auto.
But she wasn't.	Ali nije bila.
You do that too.	I ti to radiš.
No, he didn't need it, he said.	Ne, nije mu trebao, rekao je.
They are now more than ever before.	Sada su više nego ikada prije.
You're not there either.	Nisi ni tamo.
What is it, she said.	Šta je, rekla je.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
And there are a lot of them.	A ima ih dosta.
Neither is she.	Nije ni ona.
I like him as a person.	Sviđa mi se kao osoba.
I don't know anything more about it.	Ne znam ništa više o tome.
I didn't, you know.	Nisam, znaš.
That needs to be discussed.	O tome treba razgovarati.
He did not return.	Nije se vratio.
Tomorrow will be a better day.	Sutra će biti bolji dan.
Surely nothing happened.	Sigurno se ništa nije dogodilo.
I wanted him too.	I ja sam ga htela.
All he could do was wait.	Sve što je mogao je da čeka.
I have no idea.	Nemam pojma.
Not that way at all.	Uopšte ne na taj način.
If only they could.	Samo da su mogli.
What happened is this.	Ono što se dogodilo je ovo.
There's a car over there.	Tamo je auto.
None of us knew what to do.	Niko od nas nije znao šta da radi.
You know why you're here.	Znaš zašto si ovdje.
While this.	Dok ovo.
I never asked.	Nikad nisam pitao.
This we know.	Ovo znamo.
More than glad.	Više nego drago.
Just not mine.	Samo ne moj.
I should have known.	Trebao sam znati.
Just while we're at it.	Samo dok to radimo.
This is pretty fast so far.	Ovo je do sada prilično brzo.
He can help us.	On nam može pomoći.
Yes, good question.	Da, dobro pitanje.
It was really, really hard.	Bilo je stvarno, stvarno teško.
And you know too much.	A i ti znaš previše.
More can be done and must be done.	Više se može uraditi i mora se uraditi.
It would be difficult.	Bilo bi teško.
Probably never would.	Vjerovatno nikad ne bi.
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
I worked.	Ja sam radio.
But this was not all.	Ali ovo nije bilo sve.
Nothing works.	Ništa ne radi.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
She said she did.	Rekla je da jeste.
But she was none of those things.	Ali ona nije bila ništa od toga.
You will all be together.	Svi ćete biti zajedno.
Now to work.	Sada na posao.
It's just hard to say.	Samo je teško reći.
You should never do this.	Nikada ovo ne bi trebalo da radiš.
We always will, actually.	Uvek ćemo, zapravo.
All this no longer exists for me.	Sve ovo za mene više ne postoji.
You are both right.	Oboje ste u pravu.
You can't do it anymore.	Ne možeš više.
Maybe he still was.	Možda je i dalje bio.
I didn't know who.	Nisam znao ko.
Except that's not exactly what they said.	Samo što nisu baš to rekli.
But he doesn't seem to see me.	Ali kao da me ne vidi.
You know that.	Znaš to.
But what if.	Ali šta ako.
This is how it should be.	Ovo bi trebalo biti tako.
Something is happening there.	Nešto se tamo dešava.
Which is three.	Što je tri.
It does a lot for us.	To čini mnogo za nas.
You know that better than I do.	Znaš to bolje od mene.
She is as good as she told me.	Ona je dobra kao što mi je to rekla.
And that will be it.	I to će biti to.
You know them.	Znaš ih.
That way she has time.	Na taj način ona ima vremena.
I did nothing more than that.	Nisam uradio ništa više od toga.
I thought you liked it.	Mislio sam da ti se sviđa.
I need both.	Treba mi oboje.
It's just me.	Samo sam ja.
He can only do what he is told.	Može da radi samo ono što mu se kaže.
No one should, but someone has to.	Niko ne bi trebao, ali neko mora.
Maybe one day.	Možda jedan dan.
I mean, no better.	Mislim, ne bolje.
He'll just get better.	Samo će mu biti bolje.
Now it all happened.	Sada se sve to dogodilo.
He has a life.	Ima život.
I love that I can do that.	Volim što mogu to da uradim.
Why not? 	Zašto ne?
he thought.	mislio je.
We can't stay here now.	Ne možemo sada ostati ovdje.
You don't want me here.	Ne želiš me ovdje.
And besides, we can't help ourselves.	A osim toga, ne možemo si pomoći.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
I never told anyone.	Nikad nikome nisam rekao.
But nothing happened.	Ali ništa se nije dogodilo.
I wanted to say something, anything.	Želeo sam da kaže nešto, bilo šta.
The car seems to have a life of its own.	Čini se da auto ima svoj život.
Now is a good time.	Sada je dobro vrijeme.
I guess you didn't know he was actually going to do that.	Pretpostavljam da nisi znao da će on to zaista učiniti.
And you know that.	I ti to znaš.
He probably doesn't think it's time.	Vjerovatno ne misli da je vrijeme za to.
I'm never good enough.	Nikad nisam dovoljno dobar.
But if it is.	Ali ako jeste.
Like right now.	Kao upravo sada.
It doesn't go any further.	Ne ide dalje.
This new code works.	Ovaj novi kod radi.
I don't like them either.	Ni ja ih ne volim.
He didn't ask about me.	Nije pitao za mene.
She knows it can be that way.	Ona zna da to tako može biti.
I know everything you want to say.	Znam sve što želiš da kažeš.
I have what you say you need.	Imam ono što kažeš da ti treba.
I just wish there were more of them.	Samo bih volio da ih je više.
We need to talk to you.	Moramo razgovarati s tobom.
She really was.	Stvarno je bila.
And there we were.	I tu smo bili.
But you still can’t go there and stay.	Ali još uvijek ne možete otići tamo i ostati.
He doesn't love me.	On me ne voli.
That must be probable.	To mora biti vjerovatno.
Just as they should have.	Baš kao što su i trebali.
He was in it for himself.	Bio je u tome za sebe.
That will do it.	To će to učiniti.
I've never been there.	Nikada nisam bio tamo.
Not yet, he told himself.	Ne još, rekao je sebi.
I have to do it.	Moram to uraditi.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
You are alone.	Sami ste.
He had no one.	Nije imao nikoga.
I have no idea why he's there at all.	Nemam pojma zašto je uopšte tamo.
So we were actually there.	Tako da smo zapravo bili tamo.
I'm always glad to see him.	Uvek mi je drago da ga vidim.
I don't need any more.	Ne treba mi više.
You have to believe in it.	Morate vjerovati u to.
You are here again.	Ponovo ste ovdje.
And you never know when it will come in handy.	I nikad ne znaš kada će ti dobro doći.
I promised.	Obećao sam.
He didn't have time.	Nije imao vremena.
All was well now.	Sada je sve bilo dobro.
Now it's very simple how to do it.	Sada je vrlo jednostavno kako to da uradimo.
He will come.	On će doći.
I came to see you.	Došao sam da te vidim.
Three that no one came for.	Tri po koje niko nije došao.
They all said no.	Svi su rekli ne.
I have to be ready.	Moram biti spreman.
We all have.	Svi mi imamo.
That's not true for me.	To nije istina za mene.
Now the question is what happens next.	Sada je pitanje šta se dalje dešava.
Which is a very good thing.	Što je jako dobra stvar.
That speaks for itself.	To govori samo za sebe.
Yes, that really happened.	Da, to se zaista dogodilo.
There's something you're doing.	Ima nešto što radiš.
He was just tired.	Samo je bio umoran.
I'm sure it will be.	Siguran sam da će biti.
That is simply not true.	To jednostavno nije istina.
No one will see you.	Niko vas neće vidjeti.
It's like that at all.	Uopšte je tako.
This is completely true.	Ovo je potpuno tačno.
I was actually very good to myself.	Zapravo sam bio jako dobar za mene.
It's hard for him.	Teško mu je.
This was a meeting.	Ovo je bio sastanak.
For me, life is bad.	Za mene je život loš.
I guess so, and I hope so.	Pretpostavljam da jeste, i nadam se.
I left today.	Otišao sam danas.
I didn't even expect it to come.	Nisam ni očekivao da će doći.
I saw the meeting.	Video sam sastanak.
That seems obvious enough.	To izgleda dovoljno očigledno.
You have to get to him.	Moraš doći do njega.
He is a really good person.	On je zaista dobra osoba.
But apparently not.	Ali očigledno nije.
That was life.	To je bio život.
Look, it's just hard.	Vidi, samo je teško.
I just had to know.	Samo sam morao znati.
He would be right, as always.	Bio bi u pravu, kao i uvek.
But not too much.	Ali ne previše.
And maybe he did it more than once.	A možda je to učinio više puta.
He looked like a man who was not feeling well.	Izgledao je kao čovjek koji se ne osjeća dobro.
Which is enough.	Što je dovoljno.
And that's what it does.	I to je ono što radi.
He said it would probably be this week.	Rekao je da će to vjerovatno biti ove sedmice.
He's done with it now.	Sada je završio s tim.
They may not be safe for everyone.	Možda nisu sigurni za sve.
No problem yet.	Još nema problema.
This is what is happening now.	To je ono što se sada dešava.
And that's not all.	I to nije sve.
I really love this job.	Zaista volim ovaj posao.
For me there is no problem.	Za mene tu nema problema.
I'm glad you're here.	Drago mi je što ste ovdje.
Just do this.	Samo uradi ovo.
He didn't see anyone.	Nikoga nije video.
Either something is wrong with him or he isn't.	Ili mu nešto nije u redu ili nije.
He looked bad.	Loše je izgledao.
I just need some time.	Samo mi treba malo vremena.
The question is whether they will.	Pitanje je da li hoće.
I'm a bad man.	Ja sam loš čovjek.
This was not certain.	Ovo nije bilo sigurno.
But it never was.	Ali nikad nije bilo.
He wants me to tell him.	Želi da mu kažem.
That is very obvious.	To je vrlo očigledno.
He had it.	Imao je to.
That's how we are at home.	Tako smo kod kuće.
That is obviously not true.	To očigledno nije tačno.
We can't help you anymore.	Ne možemo vam više pomoći.
You're bad.	Ti si loš.
He's the only one who can tell.	On je jedini koji može reći.
There wasn't enough time.	Nije bilo dovoljno vremena.
How can you.	Kako možeš.
There was a problem.	Tu je bio problem.
I prefer good.	Više volim dobro.
I don't think they ever will.	Mislim da nikada neće.
You must leave now.	Morate otići sada.
It doesn't carry much more.	Ne nosi mnogo više.
He had had enough today.	Danas mu je bilo dosta.
He liked to see her there.	Voleo je da je vidi tamo.
This may be a matter of time.	Ovo može biti pitanje vremena.
I'm with you.	Ja sam sa tobom.
I have the following but it doesn't work.	Imam sljedeće ali ne radi.
Why are you here.	Zašto si ovde.
Anything to help.	Bilo šta da pomogne.
None.	Nema.
The job is good.	Posao je dobar.
It just couldn't be.	To jednostavno nije moglo biti.
But all this is still not enough.	Ali sve ovo još uvijek nije dovoljno.
We are all good.	Svi smo dobro.
It is still true.	I dalje je istina.
It's been there for a while.	Tu je neko vrijeme.
I have to.	Moram.
Nobody knows about it.	Niko ne zna za to.
He is here to help.	On je tu da pomogne.
I didn't mean anything.	Nisam ništa mislio.
Tonight, if you want.	Večeras, ako želiš.
But it's so hard.	Ali to je tako teško.
That's all there is now.	To je sve što sada postoji.
I'm right now like rain.	Sada sam u pravu kao kiša.
He just can't do that to me.	On jednostavno ne može to da mi uradi.
It still could.	I dalje bi moglo.
No, you're probably right.	Ne, vjerovatno si u pravu.
You can leave now.	Možete otići sada.
Never again for me.	Za mene više nikad.
He wanted it for so long.	Želio je to tako dugo.
But it's not quite that simple.	Ali nije baš tako jednostavno.
A few things.	Nekoliko stvari.
Maybe something like that happened now.	Možda se tako nešto sada dogodilo.
I hope one of you could help me.	Nadam se da bi mi neko od vas mogao pomoći.
We can only go so fast.	Možemo samo tako brzo.
But that is not going to happen here.	Ali to se ovdje neće dogoditi.
You have to do this yourself.	Ovo morate uraditi sami.
This time it works.	Ovaj put radi.
He lives here.	On živi ovde.
There was no help for him now.	Sada mu nije bilo pomoći.
Nothing has ever been easy for me.	Nikad mi ništa nije bilo lako.
I won't always be there.	Neću uvek biti tu.
He is more than that.	On je više od toga.
And they are not the only ones.	I nisu jedini.
I really want to do more things.	Zaista želim raditi više stvari.
And that's all for now.	I to je sve za sada.
She is there.	Ona je tamo.
Surely someone must know something.	Sigurno neko mora nešto znati.
I want to go there too.	I ja želim da idem tamo.
And for not much money.	I to za ne mnogo novca.
Or I thought you were.	Ili sam mislio da jesi.
It was more than it seemed.	Bilo je više nego što se činilo.
That works well enough.	To radi dovoljno dobro.
As if he knew he would.	Kao da je znao da hoće.
It always has been and always will be.	Uvijek je bilo i uvijek će biti.
But the truth was that he didn't want to.	Ali istina je bila da on to nije želio.
Which we all were.	Što smo svi bili.
He never told me how he knew.	Nikad mi nije rekao kako zna.
But it's true.	Ali to je istina.
But there is one problem with it.	Ali postoji jedan problem sa njim.
But it's a good idea.	Ali to je dobra ideja.
He can't take it.	Ne može to da nosi.
Now he's back with us.	Sada se vratio sa nama.
Yes, we can help you.	Da, možemo vam pomoći.
She just wouldn't.	Ona jednostavno ne bi.
Like, even tomorrow.	Kao, čak i sutra.
The story of the house.	Priča o kući.
I'm so tired of it.	Tako sam umoran od toga.
I have no idea what to do.	Nemam pojma šta da radim.
But not this morning.	Ali ne jutros.
But not too much.	Ali ne previše.
He still wanted it.	I dalje je to želio.
Besides, they were right about this.	Osim toga, za ovo su bili u pravu.
But she knew something.	Ali ona je znala nešto.
It's here, and it was here.	Ovdje je, i bilo je ovdje.
Better than it was.	Bolje nego što je bilo.
Yes, he probably meant it.	Da, vjerovatno je to mislio.
That's my way.	To je moj način.
We have a few of them.	Imamo ih nekoliko.
She doesn't do that often.	Ona to ne radi često.
No, it's him.	Ne, on sam.
I didn't want anything from him.	Nisam htela ništa od njega.
I love you so much.	volim puno.
Not for us.	Ne za nas.
He wasn't.	Nije bio.
And that was many years ago.	A to je bilo prije mnogo godina.
And this is not really true.	A ovo zapravo nije istina.
I certainly didn't want to.	Ja sigurno nisam htela.
She can't talk.	Ona ne može da govori.
He would know what to do.	Znao bi šta da radi.
That's how I wanted to be there.	Tako sam htela da budem tamo.
But not any job.	Ali ne bilo koji posao.
And no problem with that.	I bez problema u tome.
Few days ago.	Prije nekoliko dana.
I never have, I never will.	Nikad nisam, nikad neću.
That's them.	To su oni.
I did it and more.	Uradio sam to i više.
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
He'll be with us soon.	Uskoro će biti s nama.
I have no idea why.	Nemam pojma zašto.
It would be difficult.	Bilo bi teško.
But if you think so, fine.	Ali ako tako mislite, dobro.
It was the first time in a very long time.	Bilo je to prvi put za jako dugo vremena.
No, that can't be true.	Ne, to ne može biti tačno.
It's never long.	Nikad nije dugo.
You saw him.	Vidio si ga.
Or do this.	Ili uradi ovo.
And it doesn't look so good anymore.	I više ne izgleda tako dobro.
Not until you tell me.	Ne dok mi ne kažeš.
I'm sorry .	Žao mi je .
He certainly didn't have one himself.	On sam sigurno nije imao.
They don't know any better.	Oni ne znaju bolje.
And so far that seems to be true.	I za sada se čini da je to istina.
We do the following.	Radimo sljedeće.
She knew that.	Ona je to znala.
We almost know.	Skoro da znamo.
I would love them.	Voleo bi ih.
Or it can go further than that.	Ili može ići dalje od toga.
You were.	Bio si.
I heard about it.	Čuo sam za to.
The man said nothing.	Čovjek ništa nije rekao.
And maybe he told me that.	A možda mi je to rekao.
Or maybe he just expected too much.	Ili je možda samo previše očekivao.
I don't like it very much.	Ne volim to mnogo.
These are just three.	Ovo su samo tri.
He didn't mean it.	Nije to mislio.
But you could say.	Ali moglo bi se reći.
I hope mine is too.	Nadam se da je i moj.
And everyone is on it.	I svi su na tome.
We already knew that.	To smo već znali.
I've been there several times.	Bio sam tamo nekoliko puta.
I do not think.	Ne mislim.
It was an obvious question.	To je bilo očigledno pitanje.
He could be right.	Mogao bi biti u pravu.
Unless they know too.	Osim ako ni oni ne znaju.
I don't want you here either.	Ni ja te ne želim ovdje.
I guess that would be better that way.	Pretpostavljam da bi tako bilo bolje.
You know they know these things.	Znaš da znaju ove stvari.
But he wouldn't say, or couldn't say.	Ali nije htio reći, ili nije mogao reći.
Nobody's here yet.	Još niko nije ovde.
They can help too.	I oni mogu pomoći.
Better than last year.	Bolje nego prošle godine.
That's a really good idea.	To je zaista dobra ideja.
Maybe I knew better.	Možda sam znao bolje.
He sees things.	On vidi stvari.
You could, you know.	Mogao bi, znaš.
There is too much going on.	Previše se toga dešava.
I was glad to be there.	Bilo mi je drago biti tamo.
It doesn't have to be.	Ne mora biti.
Everything was safe.	Sve je bilo sigurno.
In fact, she wants him to see.	U stvari, ona želi da on vidi.
You just told me that.	Upravo si mi to rekao.
I never told him anything like that.	Nikad mu nisam rekao tako nešto.
But he wanted more.	Ali želio je više.
I can't say whether he saw it or not.	Ne mogu reći da li je to vidio ili ne.
We are both still.	Oboje smo još uvek.
It's happening here.	To se dešava ovde.
Not always a good reason.	Nije uvijek dobar razlog.
He has no idea what it is.	On nema pojma šta je to.
It's a job.	To je posao.
You know.	Da, znaš.
My job does it that way.	Moj posao to čini tako.
But this is good for me.	Ali ovo je dobro za mene.
I probably would.	Verovatno bih.
That's how it really was.	Tako je zaista bilo.
He had to do it himself.	Morao je to sam da uradi.
I didn't promise you that would happen.	Nisam ti obećao da će se to dogoditi.
You have to do your job.	Moraš da radiš svoj posao.
No one could see.	Niko nije mogao da vidi.
And he didn't need it.	I nije mu trebalo.
Have fun.	Zabavi se.
It was how she knew it would be.	Bilo je kako je znala da će biti.
That was never a good idea.	To nikada nije bila dobra ideja.
It’s not that it might not happen.	Nije da se to možda neće dogoditi.
How is it not.	Kako nije.
It is not me.	Nisam ja.
That's it for now.	To je to za sada.
Yes exactly.	Da, baš tako.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da se vidi.
I just got home, actually.	Upravo sam stigao kući, zapravo.
That was enough for both of us.	To je bilo dovoljno za oboje.
Not now.	Sada nije.
Maybe we wouldn't.	Možda i ne bismo.
It usually isn't.	Obično nije.
And that's really it.	I to je zaista to.
He decided that last night.	Odlučio je to sinoć.
It can be quite difficult.	Može biti prilično teško.
You could do that too.	Mogao bi i ti to.
I don't know, but maybe you know.	Ne znam, ali možda ti znaš.
There was also time.	Bilo je i vrijeme.
Something happened to me.	Nešto mi se dogodilo.
It had to be you.	Morao si biti ti.
This is something we have to do together.	Ovo je nešto što moramo uraditi zajedno.
Knowing is much better than not knowing.	Znati je mnogo bolje nego ne znati.
I'll pick you up.	Doći ću po tebe.
The day has begun.	Dan je počeo.
This is difficult.	Ovo je teško.
I'm not entirely sure about that.	Nisam potpuno siguran u to.
We can only do what we can.	Možemo samo ono što možemo.
I wish he was here.	Voleo bih da je ovde.
What we did and so on.	Šta smo uradili i tako dalje.
It seemed.	Činilo se .
You have to come back.	Moraš se vratiti.
That he would just leave.	Da će samo otići.
It's been a long time.	Bio je to dugo vremena.
But you have to do this for me.	Ali ovo morate uraditi za mene.
And he went further than that.	I otišao je i dalje od toga.
I already told you.	Već sam ti rekao.
We, live.	Mi, živi.
He is not good for himself.	I sam sebi nije dobar.
They will stay in it.	Oni će ostati u tome.
You can tell.	Možeš reći.
It was neither here nor there.	To nije bilo ni ovdje ni tamo.
It's not like home.	Nije kao kod kuće.
Do this and nothing more.	Uradite ovo i ništa više.
You do not know.	Ne znaš.
When she works.	Kad ona radi.
A lot of people.	Puno ljudi.
He never got lost.	Nikad se nije izgubio.
Everything can be good enough.	Sve može biti dovoljno dobro.
If anyone can help please let me know.	Ako neko može pomoći molim vas da mi kaže.
I know it doesn't work for everyone.	Znam da to ne ide svima.
But it was more than that, she said.	Ali to je bilo više od toga, rekla je.
He still is, and he loves it.	Još uvijek je, i voli to.
It looks real.	Izgleda stvarno.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Možda je to dobra stvar.
And he knew he couldn't allow it.	I znao je da to ne može dozvoliti.
I have to tell you about it.	Moram da ti kažem o tome.
But they will be back tomorrow.	Ali oni će se vratiti sutra.
We have a lot of problems.	Imamo mnogo problema.
And so he went on.	I tako je otišao dalje.
They are still together.	I dalje su zajedno.
I lost it too.	I ja sam ga izgubio.
I've never heard that before.	Nikada ranije to nisam čuo.
I shouldn't have left.	Nisam ni trebao otići.
Nothing is in itself.	Ništa nije samo po sebi.
Someone had to see it.	Neko je to morao da vidi.
He always tells the truth.	Uvek govori istinu.
And that was a good thing.	I to je bila dobra stvar.
But it could be.	Ali moglo bi biti.
Yes they are.	Da oni su.
Be right.	Biti u pravu.
Don't tell me about it.	Ne govori mi o tome.
He knew it well.	On je to dobro znao.
Someone knows something.	Neko zna nešto.
You'll never know who you could have been.	Nikad nećeš znati ko si mogao biti.
He even says so himself.	On to čak i sam kaže.
But he had to work at it.	Ali morao je da radi na tome.
Nothing is ever wrong.	Nikad ništa nije u redu.
You know what to do, just do it.	Znaš šta treba da radiš, samo uradi to.
it is not.	nije.
But we can know it will happen.	Ali možemo znati da će se to dogoditi.
But they are nothing.	Ali oni su ništa.
That should be better.	To bi trebalo biti bolje.
What can happen to you.	Šta ti se sve može dogoditi.
I can't reach him.	Ne mogu do njega.
I didn't want to.	Nisam htela.
I mean, really, really simple.	Mislim, stvarno, stvarno jednostavno.
As you know, this is obviously not true.	Kao što znate, ovo očigledno nije istina.
But you don't say anything.	Ali ti ništa ne kažeš.
The only question was how much.	Pitanje je bilo samo koliko.
I think of myself.	Mislim od sebe.
He was a lucky man and he knew it.	Bio je sretan čovjek i znao je to.
For all of us, you are fine.	Za sve nas, ti si dobro.
We were that.	Bili smo to.
He couldn't do it alone anymore.	Više nije mogao sam.
And he did it well.	I on je to dobro uradio.
I wonder who it was.	Pitam se ko je to bio.
I didn't love her.	Nisam je voleo.
.	.
You can get help.	Možete dobiti pomoć.
You needed me.	Trebao si me.
One is all we need.	Jedan je sve što nam treba.
I saw something.	Video sam nešto.
I wish I had one.	Voleo bih da imam jedan.
Yes, for now.	Da, za sada.
No, not even you.	Ne, čak ni ti.
He went to the door.	Otišao je do vrata.
And it looks good.	I dobro izgleda.
I've never seen him.	Nikad ga nisam vidio.
I'm fine now.	Sada sam u redu.
Me too, but he works harder.	I ja, ali on radi više.
Which is what you need to do.	Što i vi treba da uradite.
I'm absolutely sure of that.	Potpuno sam siguran u to.
He can help you.	On ti može pomoći.
I did not know.	Nisam znao.
Everything is good!.	Sve je dobro!.
I don't want to do too much.	Ne želim da radim previše toga.
And he said he didn't know why.	A on je rekao da ne zna zašto.
But without it.	Ali bez toga.
I haven't seen you here before.	Nisam te prije vidio ovdje.
Which was true, she did.	Što je bila istina, ona jeste.
I know you want to help.	Znam da želiš pomoći.
That's not good for anyone.	To nije dobro ni za koga.
Don't tell me anything.	Ne govori mi ništa.
I was no longer alone.	Nisam više bio sam.
As if .	Kao da .
Just talk.	Samo priča.
It was just him.	Bio je samo on.
If she only knew.	Kad bi samo znala.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
Or what he would think.	Ili šta bi on mislio.
He is right today.	Danas je u pravu.
I know what it should do.	Znam šta bi trebalo da radi.
Unless he eats.	Osim ako ne jede.
But he would have none of that.	Ali on ne bi imao ništa od toga.
They just don’t know anything better.	Oni jednostavno ne znaju ništa bolje.
I really would.	Zaista bi.
But she can't say what she sees.	Ali ona ne može reći šta vidi.
Only one man was not surprised.	Samo jedan čovjek nije bio iznenađen.
We just said no.	Upravo smo rekli ne.
He had heard them before.	Čuo ih je ranije.
But yes, we are sure.	Ali da, sigurni smo.
Which is not.	Što nije.
Probably not fast enough for me.	Vjerovatno ne dovoljno brzo za mene.
No one knows but you.	Niko ne zna osim tebe.
But together, we have a lot.	Ali zajedno, imamo mnogo.
But you don't know that.	Ali ti to ne znaš.
That was none of us.	To nije bio niko od nas.
She was not there at the time.	Ona nije bila tamo u to vrijeme.
He saw something more.	Video je nešto više.
Time no longer exists.	Vrijeme više ne postoji.
They don't know.	Oni ne znaju.
He said they were together.	Rekao je da su zajedno.
We know there are a few, but not many.	Znamo da ih ima nekoliko, ali ne mnogo.
I never knew about this.	Nikad nisam znao za ovo.
He is waiting for you.	On te čeka.
Maybe she is.	Možda je ona.
He has a good job.	Ima dobar posao.
But it's obvious.	Ali to je očigledno.
That's the problem.	To je problem.
he thought.	mislio je.
Looks like a good one.	Izgleda kao dobar.
I can do more than that.	Mogu više od toga.
You are alone.	Sami ste.
He works alone.	On radi sam.
They knew it was there.	Znali su da je tamo.
Many things are good.	Mnogo stvari je dobro.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
We never were.	Nikada nismo bili.
I wasn't myself.	Nisam bio svoj.
He said all that.	Sve je to rekao.
He acknowledged them.	On ih je priznao.
What could be better than that?	Šta može biti bolje od toga?
Nobody knows anything about it.	Niko ne zna ništa o tome.
It seems so.	Čini se da.
Yeah, that's not good.	Da, to nije dobro.
I do not like you anymore.	Ne volim te više.
But the job was hard to get.	Ali posao je bilo teško dobiti.
It seemed like it didn't happen.	Činilo se kao da se to nije dogodilo.
You shouldn't do that at all.	Ne bi trebalo to uopšte da radiš.
He didn't have to.	Nije morao.
Many times actually.	Mnogo puta zapravo.
I didn't say anything.	Ništa nisam rekao.
Maybe I can't.	Možda ne mogu.
And this is another one.	A ovo je još jedan.
He does the right job.	Pravi pravi posao.
They just knew, they said.	Samo su znali, rekli su.
I'm so scared.	Tako se bojim.
They were alone at the moment.	Trenutno su bili sami.
And he wants to have fun.	I on želi da se zabavi.
They just aren't there.	Jednostavno ih nema.
She was at home.	Bila je kod kuće.
This is always true.	Ovo je uvijek istina.
That shouldn't happen.	To se ne bi trebalo dogoditi.
Really with you.	Zaista sa tobom.
Everyone knows that and it's always there.	To svi znaju i uvijek je tu.
No, no, no and no.	Ne, ne, ne i ne.
Who was he.	Ko je on bio.
We did it.	Mi smo to uradili.
This has never been a problem for us.	Ovo nam nikada nije bio problem.
As always, no one was there.	Kao i uvijek, nije bilo nikoga.
But he didn't do it.	Ali, on to nije uradio.
You still have life for life.	Još imaš život za život.
And do this fast.	I uradi ovo brzo.
That was all I was glad about.	To je bilo sve što mi je bilo drago.
That's just not me.	To jednostavno nisam ja.
He didn't come to me.	Nije došao kod mene.
I really wish you were here.	Zaista bih volio da si ovdje.
This is not allowed.	Ovo nije dozvoljeno.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
He had no idea how he felt now.	Nije imao pojma kako se sada osjeća.
It was nothing.	To je bilo ništa.
He likes to play.	Voli da se igra.
Maybe more stuff.	Možda još stvari.
asked.	pitao.
We just need to see more.	Jednostavno moramo vidjeti više.
She must know.	Ona mora znati.
She didn't really know what to do.	Nije baš znala šta da radi.
I want to do this for him.	Želim ovo da uradim za njega.
He would know what to tell him.	Znao bi šta da mu kaže.
But none of that.	Ali ništa od toga.
You said that many times.	Rekao si to mnogo puta.
He loved me too.	I on je mene volio.
But maybe and probably they were better than sure.	Ali možda i vjerovatno su bili bolji nego sigurno.
She's working on it.	Ona radi na tome.
No one seems to know what it could have been.	Čini se da niko ne zna šta je to moglo biti.
I think he could do it.	Mislim da bi on to mogao.
That was all, surely.	To je bilo sve, sigurno.
How easy! 	Kako lako!
I should have told you, yes.	Trebao sam ti reći, da.
In fact, all the better.	U stvari, tim bolje.
We are very	Veoma smo.
Who knows why not.	Ko zna zašto nije.
I can still see him.	Još ga vidim.
She knew it wasn't.	Znala je da nije.
I think that will be enough.	Mislim da će to biti dovoljno.
They were not with me.	Nisu bili sa mnom.
She still is.	Ona i dalje jeste.
Just the door.	Samo vrata.
It would be.	Bilo bi .
Life seemed to be good.	Život je, izgleda, bio dobar.
Things to see.	Stvari koje treba vidjeti.
I think he bought it.	Mislim da je to kupio.
We had a real party.	Imali smo pravu zabavu.
And maybe he could.	A možda bi i mogao.
Simple, isn't it.	Jednostavno, zar ne.
It's safe and fast.	Sigurno je i brzo.
But it didn't.	Ali nije.
I want to be there for everyone.	Želim biti tu za sve.
You can help.	Možete pomoći.
Not unless you want to.	Ne osim ako ne želiš.
But it doesn't work.	Ali to ne radi.
She knew what it was all about.	Znala je o čemu se radi.
You need more than that.	Treba ti više od toga.
You were too.	I ti si bio.
I didn't have time to say anything.	Nisam imao vremena ništa reći.
I did not see you.	Nisam te vidio.
I tried to get help.	Pokušao sam dobiti pomoć.
I want her here now.	Želim je ovdje odmah.
Obviously it is.	Očigledno jeste.
She is at home.	Ona je kod kuće.
We can never go back to those years.	Nikada ne možemo vratiti te godine.
I need to see what's what.	Moram da vidim šta je šta.
He couldn't find it.	Nije ga mogao naći.
I asked how.	Pitao sam kako.
We really do.	Zaista to radimo.
He always says that.	On to uvek govori.
Maybe he's home, don't you know.	Možda je kod kuće, zar ne znaš.
I'm glad you could come.	Drago mi je da si mogao doći.
So they could talk.	Da bi mogli razgovarati.
I hope it works well.	Nadam se da radi dobro.
You knew that.	Znao si to.
But you will find something.	Ali naći ćeš nešto.
He didn't have much to say about it.	Nije imao mnogo toga da kaže o tome.
We know they were there.	Znamo da su bili tamo.
You're here now.	Sada si tu.
Nothing could be seen there.	Tamo se ništa nije moglo vidjeti.
But we all know how that goes.	Ali svi znamo kako to ide.
It arrived a few days ago.	Stigao je prije nekoliko dana.
Maybe a little.	Možda malo.
The money just wasn't there.	Novac jednostavno nije bio tamo.
This code seems to say that it is not true.	Čini se da ovaj kod kaže da nije istina.
But this time there is nothing to be done.	Ali ovaj put nema šta da se uradi.
I'm glad you did.	Drago mi je da jeste.
He was right about that.	Bio je u pravu u tome.
But maybe there.	Ali možda tamo.
All we know is that there will be many.	Sve što znamo je da će ih biti mnogo.
They could.	Oni bi mogli.
Yes, she does.	Da, ona ima.
That we can still be together.	Da još možemo biti zajedno.
Not really.	Ne baš, zaista.
We are glad.	Drago nam je.
But something else besides that.	Ali još nešto osim toga.
You never know when something good will come.	Nikad se ne zna kada će nešto dobro doći.
So he told himself.	Tako je rekao sebi.
You just can't do it anymore.	Jednostavno to više ne možeš.
She will do it for me.	Ona će to učiniti za mene.
You know what you're doing.	Znaš šta radiš.
It should do everything you want.	Trebalo bi da radi sve što želite.
You have me there.	Imaš me tamo.
But we are only thirty people.	Ali mi smo samo trideset ljudi.
But even that wasn't too good.	Ali ni to nije bilo previše dobro.
That was the first.	To je bio prvi.
But there were a few things.	Ali nekoliko stvari je bilo.
You don't know what it's like here.	Ne znaš kako je ovdje.
If only he knew what was coming.	Kad bi samo znao šta će doći.
But it still doesn't work.	Ali i dalje ne radi.
He went there, but returned quickly.	Otišao je tamo, ali se brzo vratio.
Don't do this and do that.	Ne radi ovo i radi ono.
None of us had a clue.	Niko od nas nije imao pojma.
And this is true.	I ovo je istina.
To tell the truth.	Da kaže istinu.
I've always been there for you.	Uvek sam bio tu za tebe.
That's them, all right.	To su oni, u redu.
I can't help him, nor can you.	Ne mogu mu pomoći, kao ni ti.
It was not good at all.	Uopšte nije bilo dobro.
But here we are.	Ali tu smo mi.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Nisam siguran kako to učiniti.
He was anything but.	Bio je sve samo ne.
You should buy what you should do.	Trebao bi kupiti ono što bi trebao učiniti.
Someone will come.	Neko će doći.
I know what's going on.	Znam šta se dešava.
As always, alone.	Kao i uvek, sama.
But that's just me.	Ali to sam samo ja.
I like to think.	Volim da mislim.
And that's how we did it.	I tako smo to uradili.
He didn't want to know either.	Ni on nije želio da zna.
I'm home now.	Sada sam kod kuće.
But work is work.	Ali posao je posao.
That's good there.	To je dobro tamo.
Not me, he meant, never me.	Ne ja, htio je reći, nikad ja.
You don't have to go together.	Ne morate ići zajedno.
You did it to me, she said.	Ti si mi to uradio, rekla je.
But they didn't do it alone.	Ali nisu to uradili sami.
But who knows.	Ali ko zna.
It doesn't look good to me.	Ne izgleda mi dobro.
And don't tell him.	I nemoj mu reći.
I will never trust him again.	Nikad mu više neću vjerovati.
I may never see them again.	Možda ih više nikad neću vidjeti.
He was pretty bad.	Bio je prilično loš.
That it is very fast.	Da je veoma brzo.
But apparently so are you.	Ali očigledno jesi i ti.
It's not easy, that's for sure.	Nije lako, to je sigurno.
We were a real team.	Bili smo pravi tim.
He was sure of that now.	U to je sada bio siguran.
I hope you stay here.	Nadam se da ćeš ostati ovde.
That's exactly the problem.	To je upravo problem.
The reason for that.	Razlog tome.
He was right about that.	Bio je u pravu u tome.
In fact, it was more.	U stvari, bilo je više.
This time, earlier.	Ovaj put, ranije.
You said that yourself, several times.	To ste i sami rekli, nekoliko puta.
This is probably a good thing.	Ovo je vjerovatno dobra stvar.
Or, like we said, you can come home.	Ili, kao što smo rekli, možete doći kući.
I never did.	Nikad nisam.
We were at home.	Bili smo kod kuće.
They know who you are.	Oni znaju ko ste.
I thought he would.	Mislio sam da hoće.
I have no idea how or why.	Nemam pojma kako i zašto.
He won't be able to work for a few days.	Nekoliko dana neće moći da radi.
And that's not good for any of us.	A to nije dobro ni za koga od nas.
I can't tell you more than that now.	Ne mogu vam sada reći ništa više od toga.
It can be done.	To se može uraditi.
There is nothing you can do now.	Sada ne možete ništa da uradite.
If you don’t want this, that’s fine.	Ako ne želite ovo, to je u redu.
What we did was not enough.	Ono što smo uradili nije ni bilo dovoljno.
I don't want that for you.	Ne želim to za tebe.
But it wasn't without problems.	Ali nije bilo bez problema.
She didn't know what she was thinking.	Nije znala šta misli.
There was no one there.	Tamo nije bilo nikoga.
Maybe he's just going to work.	Možda samo ide na posao.
There is a lot of time.	Ima mnogo vremena.
We won't this time.	Ovaj put nećemo.
So we know he was here.	Tako da znamo da je bio ovdje.
We can see that.	Možemo to vidjeti.
Or it was something more.	Ili je to bilo nešto više.
Anything more than that is wrong.	Sve više od toga nije u redu.
He could have done more if he wanted to.	Mogao je učiniti više da je htio.
And we have a lot of them.	A imamo ih puno.
I think that would be a good idea.	Mislim da bi to bila dobra ideja.
It's a bad job, you know.	To je loš posao, znaš.
It's not us.	To nismo mi.
I see no one is.	Vidim da niko nije.
Maybe you can help him.	Možda mu možeš pomoći.
They don’t know what we know.	Oni ne znaju ono što mi znamo.
There was not much to see.	Nije bilo mnogo za vidjeti.
That would be me.	To bih bio ja.
But I'm good at it.	Ali ja sam dobar u tome.
He is alone.	On je sam.
Dan was sure of it.	Dan je bio siguran u to.
There didn't seem to be anyone there.	Činilo se da tamo nema nikoga.
From a friend.	Od prijatelja.
I have a little.	Imam malo.
There comes a time when it is enough.	Dođe vrijeme kada je dovoljno.
This is the right team.	Ovo je pravi tim.
But we are not a car.	Ali mi nismo auto.
That's a bad question.	To je loše pitanje.
Being the thing of the year.	Biti stvar godine.
That's a lot of money.	To je mnogo novca.
And that's a good question.	I to je dobro pitanje.
I never have time.	Ja nikad nemam vremena.
Time is money, and lots of it.	Vrijeme je novac, i mnogo toga.
He was the one in order.	On je bio taj u redu.
That's good for us.	To je dobro za nas.
They did a lot.	Uradili su mnogo.
But this is what this job does to you.	Ali ovo je ono što vam ovaj posao čini.
He must have known that.	On je to sigurno znao.
That's fine with us.	Nama je to u redu.
And how much he wants to know.	I koliko želi da zna.
But we didn't do anything.	Ali nismo ništa uradili.
There aren't enough of them.	Nema ih dovoljno.
Maybe that's what he meant.	Možda je to mislio.
I would really like some help to get it working properly.	Zaista bih volio pomoć da to radi kako treba.
It was very difficult for us.	Bilo nam je jako teško.
But see if you can go further.	Ali vidi možeš li ići dalje.
I actually like it now.	Sada mi se zapravo sviđa.
Things will come and go.	Stvari će doći i otići.
He had plenty of time.	Imao je dosta vremena.
You had a hard time with us.	Bilo ti je teško sa nama.
Never, probably.	Nikad, vjerovatno.
I can't go back.	Ne mogu se vratiti.
I never said that.	Nikad nisam to rekao.
He shouldn't eat this.	Ne bi trebalo da jede ovo.
It's still mine.	I dalje je moj.
He does it.	On to radi.
Maybe even mine.	Možda čak i moj.
But that is not true.	Ali to nije istina.
But that was not enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno.
He did everything she told him.	Uradio je sve što mu je rekla.
I would never lose her.	Nikad je ne bih izgubio.
Always me and them.	Uvek ja i oni.
They could many times.	Mogli su mnogo puta.
I wish you better.	Želim ti bolje.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Nisam uradio ništa loše.
Even more today.	Danas još više.
But now we are all fine.	Ali sada smo svi dobro.
You have to do it.	Morate to uraditi.
There's more.	Ima još toga.
But life goes on.	Ali život ide dalje.
I could tell he didn't want to talk here.	Mogao sam reći da ne želi razgovarati ovdje.
It's not like that anymore.	Više nije tako.
He still does.	I dalje to radi.
I thought I'd talk to him.	Mislio sam razgovarati s njim.
He wants her so much.	On je toliko želi.
Just like me, she thinks.	Baš kao i ja, misli ona.
Exactly what he promised not to do.	Upravo ono što je obećao da neće učiniti.
There is no good way.	Ne postoji dobar način.
Not like before.	Ne kao nekada.
I only know what they told me.	Znam samo ono što su mi rekli.
I'm not sure.	Nisam baš siguran.
Earlier this year.	Ranije ove godine.
That's what I thought.	Tako sam i mislio.
Maybe that was true.	Možda je to bila istina.
Someone has to know the truth.	Neko mora znati istinu.
It's not just you.	Nisi samo ti.
Neither is he.	Nije ni on.
But he got life.	Ali on je dobio život.
She wants something, she goes after it.	Ona želi nešto, ide za tim.
But it's not like that.	Ali nije tako.
If it were true.	Da je to istina.
One will be fine.	Jedan će biti u redu.
I'm not sure.	Nisam siguran.
He said too much.	Rekao je previše.
We are here right now.	Ovdje smo upravo sada.
And it was bad.	I bilo je loše.
But it wasn't, not really.	Ali nije bilo, ne baš.
We were glad we did.	Bilo nam je drago što smo to uradili.
You have to do what works for you.	Moraš da radiš ono što radi za tebe.
Help will come.	Pomoć će doći.
It's a good thing he already knows so much.	Dobro je što već toliko zna.
It's that bad.	Toliko je loše.
We couldn't do it alone.	Ne bismo to mogli sami.
He doesn't go to school with you.	Ne ide s tobom u školu.
Money wouldn't do that.	Novac to ne bi uradio.
But he didn't tell anyone why.	Ali nikome nije rekao zašto.
That's what they would do.	To bi oni uradili.
Okay, you can't.	Dobro, ne možeš.
Just so on and on.	Samo tako dalje i dalje.
But she didn't want me.	Ali ona me nije htela.
You did it yourself.	Sam si to uradio.
And at this time.	I to u ovo vrijeme.
I'll say this again.	Reći ću ovo ponovo.
But maybe they shouldn't have.	Ali možda i nisu trebali.
It could be this week.	Moglo bi biti ove sedmice.
But not everyone.	Ali neće svi.
This is not working well.	Ovo ne radi dobro.
I can be back in a minute.	Mogu se vratiti za malo.
I don't know enough.	Ne znam dovoljno.
Looks like that's it.	Izgleda da je to to.
They must have known.	Mora da su znali.
We weren't there for him.	Za njega nismo bili tamo.
No, please don't.	Ne, molim te nemoj.
Very happy, indeed.	Veoma sretan, zaista.
They will come for us.	Doći će po nas.
Think, think, think.	Misli, misli, misli.
Just all bad.	Samo sve loše.
He will be found.	On će se naći.
Just drive there.	Samo vozi tamo.
Not exactly for him.	Ne baš za njega.
It was something he didn't expect at all.	To je bilo nešto što uopšte nije očekivao.
Why it happened.	Zašto se to dogodilo.
We will be her.	Mi ćemo biti ona.
You are a man.	Ti si čovjek.
He probably knew everything.	Verovatno je sve znao.
It was really simple.	Bilo je zaista jednostavno.
She was.	Ona je bila .
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to istina.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I think you already know that.	Mislim da to već znaš.
We have very little time.	Imamo vrlo malo vremena.
I think he's probably pretty happy.	Mislim da je vjerovatno prilično sretan.
Yes, we can do it.	Da, mi to možemo.
It works too.	Radi i to.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
None of it is certain.	Ništa od toga nije sigurno.
No, not really.	Ne, ne baš.
You look good.	Dobro izgledaš.
I have never had this problem before.	Nikada ranije nisam imao ovaj problem.
There is more.	Ima i više.
I will never tell anyone about it.	Nikad nikome neću reći o tome.
They are there.	Oni su tamo.
He doesn't say.	Ne pravi.
He shouldn't be here.	On ne bi trebao biti ovdje.
Don't talk bad about yourself.	Ne govori loše o sebi.
But maybe they should be.	Ali možda bi trebali biti.
Maybe it would, and maybe it wouldn’t.	Možda bi, a možda i ne.
I can be anyone.	Mogu biti bilo ko.
That he wants her.	Da je želi.
I just don't know how you got there.	Samo ne znam kako si stigao tamo.
If you don't know what to say, don't say anything.	Ako ne znaš šta da kažeš, ne govori ništa.
And you are not alone.	A vi niste sami od sebe.
Not even a friend.	Čak ni prijatelja.
It's a game.	To je igra.
You will do it for me.	Ti ćeš to učiniti za mene.
You can do whatever you want.	Možeš da radiš šta hoćeš.
He is more afraid of you than you are of him.	On vas se boji više nego vi njega.
I'm really begging you.	Zaista te molim.
There was no more time.	Nije bilo više vremena.
They very well could.	Vrlo dobro bi mogli.
She was already home.	Već je bila kod kuće.
I told him we wouldn't do that.	Rekao sam mu da to nećemo učiniti.
He was supposed to be a father.	On je trebao da bude otac.
He wondered if his father could see him now.	Pitao se može li ga otac sada vidjeti.
It is good.	Dobro je.
Yes, you should.	Da, trebalo bi.
That might be too obvious.	To bi moglo biti previše očigledno.
I was a little tired too.	I ja sam bio malo umoran.
Do you like?.	Sviđa li ti se?.
There are lots of ideas.	Ima puno ideja.
He knew very little.	Znao je vrlo malo.
I want to know what you both know.	Želim da znam šta oboje znate.
But he couldn't say no either.	Ali ni on nije mogao reći ne.
This just wasn't good.	Ovo jednostavno nije bilo dobro.
I've been here a few times.	Bio sam ovdje nekoliko puta.
Nothing would come of it.	Ništa ne bi bilo od toga.
Not a bad day.	Nije loš dan.
He came yesterday to tell us.	Došao je juče da nam kaže.
I saw it right away.	Odmah sam to vidio.
Maybe it's just me.	Možda sam to samo ja.
I didn't leave you.	Nisam otišao od tebe.
I can never do that.	Ja to nikad ne mogu.
They should know.	Trebalo bi da znaju.
I know you're the one.	Znam da si ti taj.
Something is wrong, not right at all.	Nešto nije u redu, uopšte nije u redu.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
I didn't hear anything.	Nisam čuo ništa.
He seems much better, but he wants to see you again.	Čini se mnogo bolje, ali želi da te ponovo vidi.
Now obviously.	Sada očigledno.
It's me, but it's not mine.	To sam ja, ali nije moj.
But for me, not for you.	Ali za mene, ne za tebe.
It just couldn’t have happened.	To se jednostavno nije moglo dogoditi.
I will leave.	Ja ću otići.
Pretty simple, really.	Prilično jednostavno, zaista.
I haven't heard from anyone.	Nisam se čuo ni sa kim.
He thinks it's very bad for you.	On misli da je to jako loše za tebe.
I told you.	Rekla sam ti.
Not that she said much.	Nije da je rekla puno.
That needs to be seen.	To treba vidjeti.
How can that be? 	Kako to može biti?
This is actually not hard to do.	Ovo zapravo nije teško uraditi.
It's really just one day.	To je zaista samo jedan dan.
We're not home anymore.	Više nismo kod kuće.
They are both fine.	Oboje su dobro.
I never knew there was anything wrong with that.	Nikada nisam znao da nešto nije u redu s tim.
I was so tired and all.	Bio sam tako umoran i sve.
No, really, do it.	Ne, stvarno, uradi to.
I do it.	Ja to radim.
What happend, happend.	Šta je bilo, bilo je.
You said we'd talk about it.	Rekao si da ćemo razgovarati o tome.
But we don’t have to be right.	Ali ne moramo biti u pravu.
That is to play well.	To je da se igra dobro.
I like how it works here.	Sviđa mi se kako radi ovdje.
Please, just see me.	Molim te, vidi samo mene.
I love them too.	I ja ih volim.
I do not think .	Ne mislim .
But we don't know who.	Ali ne znamo ko.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
You know what you always say.	Znaš šta uvek kažeš.
Not much, but enough.	Ne mnogo, ali dovoljno.
You have to go home.	Moraš ići kući.
I couldn't do anything.	Nisam mogao ništa da uradim.
You want it yourself.	Želiš sam.
And was in color.	I bio u boji.
He decided not to.	Odlučio je da to ne učini.
I haven't heard that before.	Nisam to ranije čuo.
I really loved that time.	Zaista sam volio to vrijeme.
None of us were happy about it.	Niko od nas nije bio sretan zbog toga.
They told us many things.	Rekli su nam mnogo stvari.
It was a good question, really.	Bilo je to dobro pitanje, zaista.
She was not completely alone.	Nije bila potpuno sama.
Usually, but not always.	Obično, ali ne uvijek.
But we were not allowed.	Ali nije nam bilo dozvoljeno.
He said okay, tell me what you know.	Rekao je u redu, reci mi šta znaš.
And this is something.	I ovo je nešto.
That's easy to say, but hard to do.	To je lako reći, ali teško uraditi.
Maybe there's more.	Možda ima još toga.
Do it or don't.	Uradite to ili ne.
I shouldn't talk to him.	Ne bih trebao razgovarati s njim.
The guy can.	Momak može.
So they said.	Tako su rekli.
Think of the good you will do.	Mislite na dobro koje ćete učiniti.
There is only good to be done.	Samo ima dobro da se uradi.
You need to be completely ready.	Treba biti potpuno spreman.
But that's not it.	Ali to nije to.
Time is not what it seems.	Vrijeme nije ono što se čini.
We couldn't see anything.	Nismo mogli ništa vidjeti.
I think it probably is.	Mislim da verovatno jeste.
I do not know what to do.	Ne znam šta da radim.
He does so much.	Toliko toga radi.
It was here, or there, or even further.	Bilo je ovdje, ili tamo, ili još dalje.
And neither are we.	A nismo ni mi.
He wasn't sure why, but he was.	Nije bio siguran zašto, ali jeste.
I've never seen him do that before.	Nikad ga prije nisam vidio da to radi.
But the truth is that no one really knows.	Ali istina je da niko zaista ne zna.
You know that's how it should be.	Znaš da tako treba da bude.
It was time for her to talk.	Bilo je vrijeme da ona priča.
I'm not sure it will be.	Nisam siguran da će biti.
It's for everyone.	To je za sve.
They did it.	Oni su to uradili.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
You think you know.	Misliš da znaš.
How are you.	Kako si.
Someone was on us.	Neko je bio na nama.
But what happened.	Ali šta je bilo.
That's for good.	To je za dobro.
No one said that, but he was sure of it.	Niko to nije rekao, ali on je bio siguran u to.
But he left.	Ali on je otišao.
But it wasn't all a game.	Ali nije sve bila igra.
Just the day before he was doing well.	Samo dan prije je radio dobro.
It seems as usual.	Čini se kao i obično.
I'm like you, right now.	Ja sam kao ti, trenutno.
It's not safe here.	Ovdje nije sigurno.
It can be a.	To može biti a.
I can't find anything wrong.	Ne mogu naći ništa loše.
You can't stay.	Ne možeš ostati.
But we should have known.	Ali trebali smo znati.
She didn't want to be here.	Nije htela da bude ovde.
And he knew.	I on je znao.
How hard is that?	Koliko je to teško?
We both know she can do it anytime.	Oboje znamo da ona to može da uradi bilo kada.
Or, you can just tell us.	Ili, možete nam samo reći.
I never heard from him.	Nikad se nisam čuo s njim.
I really love how it looks.	Zaista volim kako izgleda.
I should be at home.	Trebao bih biti kod kuće.
That's it .	To je to .
Yes we can.	Da, možemo.
He certainly has one now.	Sada ga sigurno ima.
You don't need to know what it is.	Ne morate znati šta je to.
I needed it.	Trebao mi je.
Do what he says.	Uradi šta kaže.
I think it was more.	Mislim da je bilo više.
You don't have to give me anything back.	Ne moraš mi ništa vratiti.
I was bad.	Bio sam loš.
That was all she knew.	To je bilo sve što je znala.
Except they're not.	Osim što nisu.
I don't actually do that much anymore.	Zapravo više to ne radim mnogo.
I wasn't there.	Nisam bio tamo.
I just can't.	Jednostavno ne mogu.
You can do anything.	Možeš sve.
They won't do it for me.	Neće to uraditi za mene.
And it takes time.	I treba vremena.
I guess that's something.	Pretpostavljam da je to nešto.
It was a real job.	Bio je to pravi posao.
But he did nothing.	Ali nije uradio ništa.
But better than nothing.	Ali bolje nego ništa.
It works without problems.	Radi bez problema.
He was my boyfriend.	Bio je moj momak.
I want you to know that.	Želim da to znaš.
I should have known that.	Trebao sam to znati.
They couldn't come.	Nisu mogli doći.
That's the problem with him.	To je problem sa njim.
There were a lot of problems.	Bilo je mnogo problema.
He did more.	Uradio je više.
I have nothing to do with it.	Ja nemam ništa s tim.
There is so much.	Toliko toga ima.
Or maybe it is.	Ili možda jeste.
And you know, it wasn't even that.	I znaš, nije čak ni to bilo.
Almost thirty times more.	Skoro trideset puta više.
Not tonight, maybe never.	Ne večeras, možda nikad.
Nothing is here.	Ništa nije ovde.
But it is not.	Ali to nije.
He went back to school.	Vratio se u školu.
This in itself already works.	Ovo samo po sebi već radi.
They know exactly what it is.	Oni tačno znaju šta je to.
I think this could help you.	Mislim da bi ti ovo moglo pomoći.
Looks like it's all there.	Izgleda da je sve tu.
No, that would be too easy.	Ne, to bi bilo previše lako.
I can do everything without any problems.	Sve mogu bez problema.
No one could do better.	Niko nije mogao bolje.
But apparently it is.	Ali očigledno jeste.
This won't work anymore.	Ovo više neće moći.
But you didn't.	Ali nisi.
He probably should have known better.	Vjerovatno je trebao znati bolje.
Or he thought he was.	Ili je mislio da jeste.
The problem was that he didn't know what.	Problem je bio u tome što nije znao šta.
Probably something bad is happening.	Verovatno se nešto loše dešava.
Maybe that was true too.	Možda je i to bila istina.
He wasn't much better than himself, and he knew it.	Nije bio mnogo bolji od sebe, i znao je to.
They will find you.	Naći će te.
I want to be there.	Želim biti tamo.
Now it's just me and him.	Sada smo samo ja i on.
I know he will.	Znam da hoće.
We do what we have to do.	Radimo ono što moramo.
I had no idea what it was.	Nisam imao pojma šta je to.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
He didn't want to be there.	Nije želio biti tamo.
No one is really happy.	Niko zaista nije sretan.
We had everything we needed.	Imali smo sve što nam je trebalo.
They were both.	Oboje su bili.
He probably saw something.	Verovatno je nešto video.
But now there was nothing that could be done.	Ali sada se tu ništa nije moglo učiniti.
Everything works as it should.	Sve radi kako treba.
All to the good.	Sve na dobro.
But just to be sure.	Ali samo da budem siguran.
But they don't know better.	Ali oni ne znaju bolje.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
You just can't.	Jednostavno ne možete.
I said too much.	Rekao sam previše.
I thought you'd know about it.	Mislio sam da ćeš znati za to.
I won't let him see that.	Neću dozvoliti da to vidi.
I told you why not.	Rekao sam ti zašto ne.
This was not a game for him.	Ovo za njega nije bila igra.
It's easy.	Lako je.
But everyone knows her.	Ali, svi je znaju.
I mean well.	Mislim dobro.
It can't be easy.	Lako ne može biti.
He never heard that.	Nikad to nije čuo.
So he didn't say much.	Tako da nije mnogo rekao.
We have everything !.	Imamo sve!.
No one ever knew there were people here.	Niko nikada nije znao da ovde ima ljudi.
I'm not afraid anymore.	Više se ne bojim.
You do everything yourself.	Sve radite sami.
That was easy.	To je bilo lako.
She knew what to do next.	Znala je šta dalje treba da uradi.
He didn't ask for any of that.	Nije tražio ništa od toga.
I had no idea what this could be.	Nisam imao pojma šta bi ovo moglo biti.
But it should work well.	Ali trebalo bi da radi dobro.
Not really, no.	Ne baš, ne.
He had a reason to be there.	Imao je razlog da bude tamo.
I was thinking only of myself.	Mislio sam samo na sebe.
And you know, it probably was.	I znate, vjerovatno je bilo.
Now, he never will.	Sada, nikada neće.
There is a way.	Postoji način.
That’s what they really should be doing.	To je ono što bi oni zaista trebali učiniti.
The only one in fact.	Jedina u stvari.
I was happy again.	Ponovo sam bio sretan.
I hope to find you there.	Nadam se da ću te tamo naći.
It was true, and easy to say.	Bila je to istina, i lako je reći.
We're good there.	Dobro smo tamo.
But maybe that's not the problem.	Ali možda to i nije problem.
This should be done.	Ovo treba uraditi.
Yes, it's you.	Da, to si ti.
Yes, that's a good idea.	Da, to je dobra ideja.
And that is it.	I to je to.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
Apparently so.	Očigledno je tako.
I haven't before.	Nisam ranije.
And it just doesn’t work.	I jednostavno ne radi.
You sure will.	Sigurno ćeš.
You have powers.	Imaš moći.
To tell him she loves him.	Da mu kaže da ga voli.
Was it.	Da li je bilo.
It’s something that won’t happen again.	To je nešto što se više neće dogoditi.
She doesn't want to live.	Ona ne želi da živi.
I'll get it.	Ja ću ga dobiti.
There was nothing that anyone could do for him.	Niko ništa nije mogao učiniti za njega.
I would like to.	Volio bih.
She tells you she knows.	Ona ti kaže da zna.
Anyone but him.	Bilo ko osim njega.
He works alone.	On radi sam.
There has been no such thing so far.	Tako nešto do sada nije bilo.
There was just something about it that didn't feel right.	Bilo je samo nešto u tome što se nije činilo u redu.
But it really isn't.	Ali zapravo nije.
We will know that next year.	To ćemo znati sljedeće godine.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
I don't have to stay here.	Ne moram ostati ovdje.
It is good that this is not happening again.	Dobro je da se ovo više ne dešava.
That could no longer be allowed.	To se više nije moglo dozvoliti.
We don't know that.	Mi to ne znamo.
And so it really happened.	I tako se zaista i dogodilo.
You have to go now.	Morate ići odmah.
He shouldn't have done this.	Nije trebao ovo da uradi.
And now there was no one.	A sada nije bilo nikoga.
You won't find me here anymore.	Nećeš me više naći ovde.
I'd know that anywhere.	Znao bih to bilo gdje.
I know that very well.	Znam to jako dobro.
And it was very, very difficult.	I bilo je veoma, veoma teško.
I heard him too.	Čuo sam i njega.
We didn't do that.	Mi to nismo uradili.
But he didn't ask.	Ali nije pitao.
He did what he could.	Uradio je šta je mogao.
This is not help.	Ovo nije pomoć.
Not anymore.	Ne u više.
I hope it comes soon.	Nadam se da će brzo doći.
That's what he does.	To je ono što on radi.
But that’s exactly what you want.	Ali to je upravo ono što želite.
That's a real father.	To je pravi otac.
So he's good for me.	Tako da je on dobro za mene.
It's going well there.	Tamo ide dobro.
Will you .	Hoćeš li .
I'm busy, you know.	Zauzet sam, znaš.
I say that.	Ja to kažem.
But that's not what we had.	Ali to nije ono što smo imali.
It seems like almost anything could happen.	Čini se kao da bi se moglo dogoditi skoro sve.
The problem still exists.	Problem i dalje postoji.
If you're good, you're good.	Ako si dobar, dobar si.
I love it, and so will you.	Ja to volim, a i ti ćeš.
I'm so good.	Tako mi je dobro.
I had no idea what to say or do.	Nisam imao pojma šta da kažem ili uradim.
If you really want to know.	Ako stvarno želiš znati.
There is still much to be said.	Ima još mnogo toga da se kaže.
They know better.	Oni znaju bolje.
I should have done it earlier.	Trebao sam to uraditi ranije.
I had a life here.	Imao sam život ovde.
It would be mine.	Bio bi moj.
They will come for me.	Doći će po mene.
It won't be difficult.	Neće biti teško.
It's not that bad.	Nije tako loše.
To him, this was all just a game.	Za njega je sve ovo bila samo igra.
And a half.	I po.
She was still there.	Ona je još bila tamo.
Any time will do.	Bilo koje vrijeme će mi pomoći.
You shouldn't even be here.	Ne bi ni trebao biti ovdje.
He's obviously playing well.	Očigledno igra dobro.
He was glad there was no moon.	Bilo mu je drago što nema mjeseca.
Too much for me.	Previše za mene.
These are all things together.	Sve su to stvari zajedno.
That's all there is.	To je sve što postoji.
They always have been, and always will be.	Uvek su bili, i uvek će biti.
He must come to us.	On mora doći kod nas.
Some of it is easy.	Nešto od toga je lako.
The question is yes or no.	Pitanje je da ili ne.
I couldn't find them until now.	Nisam ih mogao naći do sada.
He wasn't sure yet.	Još nije bio siguran.
Yes, that's right.	Da, tako je.
I See You.	Vidim te.
I heard about it.	Čuo sam za to.
But there is more at stake here.	Ali ovdje se igra više.
Maybe he knows something.	Možda zna nešto.
But maybe that's a good thing.	Ali možda je to dobra stvar.
I was sure of it.	Bio sam siguran u to.
You might be okay with that.	Možda ćeš biti u redu s tim.
I am asking you.	Pitam te.
He should know better.	Trebalo bi da zna bolje.
He had to know what happened.	Morao je znati šta se dogodilo.
She knew what she would find.	Znala je šta će naći.
It works fine.	Radi u redu.
It will probably never happen.	Vjerovatno se to nikada neće dogoditi.
You are always there.	Uvek si tu.
No one has ever seen me do that.	Niko me nikada nije video da to radim.
I think you should go to him.	Mislim da bi trebao otići do njega.
You should bring him back.	Trebao bi ga vratiti.
And he wasn't the only one.	I nije bio jedini.
But it really happened this week.	Ali to se zaista dogodilo ove sedmice.
But maybe now, you know, you should leave.	Ali možda bi sada, znaš, trebao otići.
No one, as far as she knew.	Niko nije, koliko je ona znala.
I think it's good.	Mislim da je dobar.
Now she knows the truth.	Sada ona zna istinu.
I was really happy.	Bio sam zaista sretan.
It's not that simple.	Nije tako jednostavno.
I did not see you.	Nisam te vidio.
It never did, really.	Nikad nije, zaista.
She was what she was.	Bila je ono što je bila.
But he wouldn't.	Ali on ne bi.
I only have one life.	Imam samo jedan život.
Only he couldn't leave.	Samo što nije mogao otići.
It was too much.	Bilo je previše toga.
I'm better.	Bolje mi je.
You look like that too.	I ti izgledaš tako.
He came right away.	Došao je odmah.
I can't say yet.	Ne mogu još reći.
I never asked you about your life.	Nikad te nisam pitao za život.
It won't be out of the way.	Neće biti s puta.
I'm working on it right now.	Radim na tome upravo sada.
That will be all for now.	To će biti sve za sada.
I don't like doing anything.	Ne volim ništa da radim.
That will never happen.	To se nikada neće dogoditi.
I'd like to think that's true.	Voleo bih da mislim da je to istina.
It’s really really bad, and we all know why.	Zaista je jako loše, i svi znamo zašto.
But that will not always be the case.	Ali to neće uvijek biti tako.
That's not you.	To nisi ti.
But I didn't know what or when to ask.	Ali nisam znao šta ili koga da pitam.
He didn't really do anything.	On zapravo ništa nije uradio.
But that didn’t really happen at the party.	Ali to se zapravo nije dogodilo na zabavi.
I think that's fine.	Mislim da je to u redu.
But it wasn't like that.	Ali to nije bilo tako.
It was my first time here.	Bio sam prvi put ovdje.
It wasn't meant to be either.	Ni to nije trebalo biti.
This happens quite often.	Ovo se dešava prilično često.
Besides, he won't stay here long.	Osim toga, neće dugo ostati ovdje.
I'm pretty happy here.	Prilično sam sretan ovdje.
None of us speak.	Niko od nas ne govori.
I've never done that before.	Nikad to ranije nisam radio.
.	.
But this didn't happen either.	Ali ni ovo se nije dogodilo.
They told me that.	Rekli su mi to.
I admitted him.	Ja sam ga priznao.
I'm not even afraid.	Čak se i ne bojim.
I did a pretty good job.	Uradio sam prilično dobar posao.
He actually said so.	On je zapravo tako rekao.
It doesn't look good.	Ne izgleda dobro.
When he wasn’t home, it wasn’t okay.	Kad nije bio kod kuće, nije bilo u redu.
Maybe you didn't.	Možda nisi.
I had no idea it would be you.	Nisam imao pojma da ćeš to biti ti.
But for us it was real, very bad.	Ali za nas je to bilo stvarno, jako loše.
For so much.	Za toliko mnogo.
Or very little.	Ili vrlo malo.
He couldn't see anyone.	Nikoga nije mogao vidjeti.
But that's what you are.	Ali to je ono što jesi.
If you only knew.	Da si znao.
I mean, we can't now.	Mislim, ne možemo sada.
It was pretty easy for me.	Bilo mi je prilično lako.
I think that's a good thing.	Mislim da je to dobra stvar.
Father looks.	Otac izgleda.
And my father.	I moj otac.
He really doesn't mean it.	On to stvarno ne misli.
I heard him speak too.	I ja sam ga čuo kako govori.
Not for him, but for you.	Ne za njega, nego za tebe.
I doubt so.	Sumnjam da je tako.
The truth is.	Istina je.
How nice of you.	Kako ti je drago.
You're almost here and it just can't go any further.	Skoro da ste ovdje i jednostavno ne može dalje.
I know what to say.	Znam šta da kažem.
A friend was with me.	Prijatelj je bio sa mnom.
No, no time for any of that.	Ne, nema vremena za bilo šta od toga.
This is all we have.	Ovo je sve što imamo.
I wish you well in that.	Želim ti dobro u tome.
But it's not that easy.	Ali to nije tako lako.
Now we do a lot more.	Sada radimo mnogo više.
And it probably is.	I vjerovatno jeste.
Do what you want, when you want.	Radi šta hoćeš, kad hoćeš.
She is completely alone.	Ona je potpuno sama.
I did it and I would do it again.	Uradio sam to i uradio bih to ponovo.
They were now three to one.	Sada su bili tri prema jedan.
And now it will happen.	A sada će se to dogoditi.
You don't want that, obviously.	Vi to ne želite, očigledno.
I'll.	Ja ću.
But the game is still a game.	Ali igra je i dalje igra.
To see.	Vidjeti .
I know there is more.	Znam da ima još više.
They told me they told him.	Rekli su mi da su mu rekli.
Tell me if it works.	Reci da li radi.
It was not better.	Nije bilo bolje.
Now tell everyone about it.	Sada reci svima o tome.
Someone loved you.	Neko te je volio.
And that's the reason why.	I to je razlog zašto.
Now we all know that.	Sada to svi znamo.
They are nobody.	Oni su niko.
And it was enough.	I bilo je dovoljno.
We would be together even more.	Bili bi zajedno još više.
He would try.	On bi pokušao.
Or maybe he was further away from me.	Ili je možda bio dalje od mene.
Or maybe they never actually had one.	Ili ga možda zapravo nikada nisu ni imali.
This should be it.	Ovo bi trebalo biti to.
This is pretty obvious.	Ovo je prilično očigledno.
.	.
To stay or not to stay.	Ostati ili ne ostati.
Must be.	Mora biti.
She won't get it.	Ona to neće dobiti.
You are too alone here.	Previše si sam ovde.
I knew this pretty well.	Znao sam ovo prilično dobro.
He needed it for sure.	Trebalo mu je sigurno.
We don't have to talk about it.	Ne moramo o tome.
It's just a lot better.	Samo je mnogo bolje.
Maybe they're right.	Možda su u pravu.
On me.	Na mene.
All of this actually happened.	Sve se ovo zapravo dogodilo.
Your car or mine.	Tvoj auto ili moj.
It's not going as well as yesterday.	Ne ide tako dobro kao juče.
That's what the meeting was about.	O tome je bio sastanak.
It doesn't seem to be working.	Čini se da ne radi.
Or something was.	Ili je nešto bilo.
Anyone could do it.	Mogao bi to bilo ko uraditi.
I have no idea how to go on without him.	Nemam pojma kako dalje bez njega.
Nothing further happened.	Ništa se dalje nije dogodilo.
It's not as bad as you think.	Nije tako loše kao što mislite.
And good for him.	I dobro za njega.
I wouldn't expect it right away.	Ne bih to očekivao odmah.
It is something more than that.	To je nešto više od toga.
I'm not there yet.	Nisam već tamo.
I want to see them.	Želim da ih vidim.
I told him about you.	Rekao sam mu za tebe.
And he never did anything else.	I ništa više nikada nije uradio.
Some money, maybe.	Nešto novca, možda.
I hope it will be of help to you.	Nadam se da će vam biti od pomoći.
I already know when to ask.	Već znam koga da pitam.
Please tell me about yourself.	Molim te, reci mi o sebi.
I had it with him.	Imao sam to sa njim.
I have to go.	Moram ići.
But that's not true.	Ali to nije istina.
And he knows it.	I on to zna.
Now he wants to talk.	Sada želi da priča.
And that is it.	I to je to.
I thought this was a good thing.	Mislio sam da je ovo dobra stvar.
I've always wanted you.	Uvek sam te želeo.
Not so fast.	Ne tako brzo .
That's why you came.	Zbog toga si došao.
That's why we do this.	Zbog toga ovo radimo.
And you didn't tell me.	I nisi mi rekao.
I can do that, and I don't even want to know.	To mogu, a ni ne želim da znam.
It just wasn't good.	Samo to nije bilo dobro.
I tell him it should never have happened.	Kažem mu da nikada nije trebalo doći do toga.
I said no.	Rekao sam ne.
It didn't seem to work.	Činilo se da ne radi.
It's not enough.	Nije dovoljno.
But he was not the only one.	Ali on nije bio jedini.
We are not the problem.	Nismo mi problem.
That will be tomorrow.	To će biti sutra.
I don't think you ever will.	Mislim da nikad nećeš.
No one seems to know why.	Izgleda da niko ne zna zašto.
He heard them.	Čuo ih je.
They are all you need.	Oni su sve što ti treba.
He wouldn't tell me.	Ne bi mi rekao.
I love my life with you.	Volim svoj život sa tobom.
He doesn't want you.	On te ne želi.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
And he almost did.	I on je to skoro uradio.
But we had it.	Ali imali smo to.
So it might not be until tomorrow.	Tako da možda neće biti do sutra.
They had problems.	Imali su problema.
Today, that wouldn't be a problem at all.	Danas to uopšte ne bi bio problem.
He wasn't surprised.	Nije bio iznenađen.
He doesn't know much about anything.	On ne zna mnogo ni o čemu.
Not what you thought.	Ne ono što si mislio.
He didn't tell anyone.	Nikome nije rekao.
Do something about it.	Uradite nešto za to.
You shouldn't do that.	Ne bi trebalo to da radiš.
But now he knew he wouldn't, not right away.	Ali sada je znao da neće, ne odmah.
He never thought it would happen.	Nikad nije mislio da će do toga doći.
Like.	Kao .
He drives it himself.	On ga sam vozi.
As it should be.	Kako je trebalo biti.
I didn't want to be here.	Nisam htela da budem ovde.
That's never good.	To nikad nije dobro.
And everyone knows it.	I svi to znaju.
We can't do this.	Ne možemo ovo.
That's a really good thing.	To je zaista dobra stvar.
He did a lot.	Uradio je mnogo.
Except you're not.	Osim što nisi.
And neither does yours.	A ni tvoj.
We know everything and we know nothing.	Znamo sve, a ne znamo ništa.
Away from me.	Dalje od mene.
This is clearly not the case here.	Ovdje očigledno nije tako.
I haven't heard from anyone.	Nisam se čuo ni sa kim.
In fact, it should be.	U stvari, to bi trebalo da bude.
So it's safe.	Tako da je sigurno.
I could tell he was wondering.	Mogao sam reći da se pitao.
You just told me.	Upravo si mi rekao.
There just wasn't time.	Jednostavno nije bilo vremena.
All of this was fine.	Sve je ovo bilo u redu.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
I never asked.	Nikada nisam pitao.
He was always so sure of himself.	Uvek je bio tako siguran u sebe.
I asked her out on a date.	Zamolio sam je za sastanak.
He does what he wants.	Radi šta hoće.
There is always something more you can do.	Uvijek postoji nešto više što možete učiniti.
Just don't, that's all.	Samo nemoj, to je sve.
Or you can't.	Ili ne možete.
There seemed to be nothing here.	Činilo se da ovdje ništa nije bilo.
Just for me.	Samo za mene.
I knew and couldn’t see anything wrong.	Znao sam i nisam mogao vidjeti ništa loše.
And yes, they are here.	I da, ovdje su.
We have enough money.	Imamo dovoljno novca.
Besides, that's none of my business.	Osim toga, to nije moja stvar.
But he will come back to me.	Ali on će mi se vratiti.
I had no idea about it.	Nisam imao pojma o tome.
But here we are.	Ali tu smo.
It's just not me.	Samo nisam ja.
This wasn't supposed to work.	Ovo nije trebalo da ide.
Only one more of us will come.	Samo još jedan od nas će doći.
So many.	Tako mnogo.
He was still tired.	I dalje je bio umoran.
This will not be a problem.	Ovo neće biti problem.
We still have enough money.	Još uvek imamo dovoljno novca.
We knew where we were.	Znali smo gdje smo.
I thought you would tell him.	Mislio sam da bi mu rekao.
He did it.	On je to uradio.
But it still comes in handy.	Ali i dalje dobro dođe.
There is none.	Nema .
I have something to tell you.	Imam nešto da ti kažem.
It's just that he's always with you.	Samo što je on uvek sa tobom.
I don't want him to know.	Ne želim da zna.
Another, another, another.	Još jedan, još jedan, još jedan.
But you have to tell me what's going on.	Ali moraš mi reći šta se dešava.
He couldn't say anything.	Nije mogao ništa reći.
It was my first car.	Bio je moj prvi auto.
And no, you didn't.	I ne, nisi.
They would be in it for a long time.	Bili bi u tome dugo vremena.
I need to know why you're here.	Moram da znam zašto si ovde.
I had one more day.	Imao sam još jedan dan.
A lot of it is.	Mnogo toga jeste.
I don't do that.	Ja to ne radim.
That will say.	To će reći.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
Maybe it was both.	Možda je bilo oboje.
That seems like a lot.	To izgleda mnogo.
All right, all right.	U redu, u redu.
In fact, little could be done.	U stvari, malo se toga moglo učiniti.
And so the problem still exists.	I tako problem i dalje postoji.
And she knew it was true.	I znala je da je to istina.
Surely it won't be that bad.	Sigurno neće biti tako loše.
I think you will be happy.	Mislim da ćeš biti sretan.
Good for me.	Dobro za mene.
I've heard enough.	Čuo sam dovoljno.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
It all works.	Sve to radi.
I just can't.	Jednostavno ne mogu.
Maybe there wasn't much to say.	Možda nije bilo puno toga za reći.
Only .	Samo .
Why? 	Zašto?
Say what you want, do your job.	Reci šta hoćeš, radi svoj posao.
But this was never the case.	Ali ovo nikada nije bilo tako.
That's exactly why she didn't tell him.	Upravo zbog toga mu nije rekla.
We've done it all.	Sve smo to uradili.
He had nothing to do with anyone.	Nije imao ništa ni sa kim.
It sure is.	Sigurno jeste.
Maybe he would do it pretty well.	Možda bi je napravio prilično dobro.
I wouldn't know how to do that.	Ne bih znao kako to da uradim.
And he says for sure.	I on kaže sigurno.
Either way.	Bilo kako bilo.
Always and again.	Uvek i ponovo.
I've seen all this before.	Sve sam ovo već vidio.
Nothing, or nobody.	Ništa, ili niko.
He was not very well at the time.	Nije mu bilo baš dobro u to vrijeme.
Does anyone know if there is a way to do this.	Da li neko zna da li postoji način da se to uradi.
You better not tell anyone.	Bolje da nikome nisi rekao.
That was all he said.	To je bilo sve što je rekao.
This is true and not true.	Ovo je istina i nije istina.
I know why you thought you were.	Znam zašto si mislio da jesi.
We'll both know.	Oboje ćemo znati.
She is fine.	Ona je dobro.
That way we'll all be together, there.	Tako ćemo svi biti zajedno, tamo.
I love them a lot.	Mnogo ih volim.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
He doesn't do anything.	On ništa ne radi.
It's really that easy.	To je zaista tako lako.
I have them all.	Imam ih sve.
For now, better.	Za sada, bolje.
Please, please.	Molim te, molim te.
I needed that car.	Trebao mi je taj auto.
This is about doing the right thing.	Ovdje se radi o tome da radite pravu stvar.
I want to be a good guy.	Želim da budem dobar momak.
It's too much for me.	Previše je to za mene.
You are not bad.	Nisi loš.
I can't stay.	Ne mogu ostati.
Much more than any of us can know.	Mnogo više nego što bilo ko od nas može znati.
But he doesn't do anything with it.	Ali on ne radi ništa s tim.
It's a game.	To je igra.
It could be you.	To bi mogao biti ti.
It was a simple question.	Bilo je to jednostavno pitanje.
I'll go with you when we do.	Idem sa tobom kada to uradimo.
But you know too much.	Ali znaš previše.
He needed a way.	Trebao mu je put.
You will too.	I ti ćeš.
I'm sorry this is so long.	Žao mi je što je ovo tako dugo.
I should be good.	Trebao bih biti dobar.
He never had that, he never will.	To nikada nije imao, nikada neće.
Next year, maybe, maybe not.	Sljedeće godine, možda, možda i ne.
I've never seen so many people.	Nikad nisam video toliko ljudi.
You want to do it.	Želiš to da uradiš.
Really, really happy.	Zaista, stvarno sretan.
There was a lot.	Bilo je mnogo toga.
I'm never going there again.	Nikada više ne idem tamo.
I guess he's not a good person.	Pretpostavljam da nije dobra osoba.
What I know no one can know.	Ono što ja znam niko ne može znati.
But this was too much even for him.	Ali ovo je čak i za njega bilo previše.
I haven't told you all about it.	Nisam ti rekao sve o tome.
I didn't know what to do here.	Nisam znao šta da radim ovde.
I wouldn't get lost again.	Ne bih se više izgubio.
Another one may come.	Još jedan može doći.
I love them very much.	Ja ih jako volim.
We can't win.	Ne možemo pobijediti.
I would like to see more.	Voleo bih da vidim više.
There's a lot to it.	Ima mnogo toga.
One, and one only.	Jedan, i samo jedan.
But you were one for .	Ali ti si bio jedan za .
No one could tell.	Niko nije mogao reći.
I didn't want to know anymore.	Nisam više htela da znam.
Or it was raining.	Ili je bila kiša.
That's already him.	To je već on.
And that, yes.	I to, da.
I think that is very likely.	Mislim da je to vrlo vjerovatno.
But apparently a few people are.	Ali očigledno je nekoliko ljudi.
It was nothing more than that.	Nije bilo ništa više od toga.
It's that easy.	Tako je lako.
They are not there just for that.	Oni nisu tu samo zbog toga.
He probably should have.	Verovatno je trebao.
It's not the first time this has happened.	Nije prvi put da se to dogodilo.
Nothing is difficult for me.	Ništa mi nije teško.
There isn't just one way to do it.	Ne postoji samo jedan način da se to uradi.
I was glad she was there.	Bilo mi je drago što je bila tamo.
.	.
But so far it has not.	Ali do sada nije.
There are several.	Ima ih nekoliko.
He wanted anyone to love him.	Želeo je da ga bilo ko voli.
Not much, but it’s more than it used to be.	Nije mnogo, ali je više nego što je bilo.
Do what? 	Uraditi šta?
And if not.	A ako nije.
I'll say it.	Ja ću to reći.
Not very good for business.	Nije baš dobro za posao.
There were plenty of them last month.	Bilo ih je dosta prošlog mjeseca.
And life here is pretty good.	I život ovdje je prilično dobar.
I wanted to tell you myself.	Htio sam ti sam reći.
This has to be it.	Ovo mora da je to.
I hope not tonight.	Nadam se da ne večeras.
But they are not sure yet.	Ali još nisu sigurni.
He brought them back.	Vratio ih je.
Until next time!.	Do sljedećeg puta!.
But we should know better by now.	Ali trebali bismo znati bolje do sada.
There's still something.	Još ima nešto.
There is nothing to do.	Nema šta da se radi.
That works pretty well.	To radi prilično dobro.
I just lost my job.	Upravo sam izgubio posao.
No one she knows of has done that.	Niko za koga ona zna to nije uradio.
Now he knew for sure.	Sada je sigurno znao.
I still think about you.	I dalje mislim na tebe.
He has a job.	Ima posao.
Things she can't tell him.	Stvari koje ne može da mu kaže.
I can do that too.	I ja to mogu.
Don't do anything until you have to.	Ne radi ništa dok ne moraš.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
We can do it that way.	Možemo to i na taj način.
You didn't know until you came back.	Nisi znao dok se nisi vratio.
I really don’t want to be alone right now.	Zaista ne želim da budem sama trenutno.
And not just you.	I ne samo ti.
Does anyone know what the problem might be?	Zna li neko u čemu bi mogao biti problem?
It just seems that way.	To se jednostavno čini tako.
You must know.	Morate znati.
It should be simple.	Trebalo bi da bude jednostavno.
I went back to the meeting.	Vratio sam se na sastanak.
Nobody wants to live there.	Niko ne želi da živi tamo.
I wonder that.	Pitam se to.
But now he never plays with it.	Ali sada se nikad ne igra s tim.
But we need something more.	Ali treba nam nešto više.
Do it again.	Uradi to ponovo.
But that's the only reason.	Ali to je jedini razlog.
And she was not alone.	I nije bila sama.
I'm not about that.	Nisam o tome.
That's just the way it is.	To je jednostavno tako.
But we don't do that.	Ali mi to ne radimo.
I came to that.	Došao sam do toga.
You have to too.	Morate i vi.
That's what he said.	Tako je on rekao.
This is really something.	Ovo je stvarno nešto.
They didn't have it before.	Ranije ga nisu imali.
I think that's what he means.	Mislim da na to misli.
He had to know better than that.	Morao je znati bolje od toga.
But it can't go any further.	Ali to ne može dalje.
I was just wondering what we should do.	Samo sam se pitao šta da radimo.
No problem with me in any way.	Nema problema sa mnom na bilo koji način.
They did as he said.	Uradili su kako je rekao.
You can do this anywhere and anytime.	Ovo možete raditi bilo gdje i bilo kada.
Sorry about that.	Žao mi je zbog toga.
I finished them last night.	Završio sam ih sinoć.
But that just wasn't enough.	Ali to jednostavno nije bilo dovoljno.
I would buy anything.	Kupio bih bilo šta.
And he was not alone.	I nije bio sam.
And more, and more, and more.	I još, i još, i više.
A few thoughts.	Nekoliko misli.
And you don't want to know.	I ne želiš da znaš.
I've been here a long time.	Ja sam tu dugo vremena.
And he's there.	I on je tamo.
I can't tell you anything more.	Ne mogu vam reći ništa više.
i will you	ja ću tebe.
That didn't happen now.	To se sada nije dogodilo.
He is going.	On ide.
Like when he eats.	Kao kad jede.
Everyone will see it.	Svi će to vidjeti.
We work together.	Radimo zajedno.
He needed us.	Trebali smo mu.
This would not be so bad.	Ovo ne bi bilo tako loše.
We had this yesterday.	Imali smo ovo juče.
I didn't want to be.	Nisam htela da budem.
I must be doing something right.	Mora da radim nešto kako treba.
I would love to be there to see it.	Voleo bih da budem tamo da to vidim.
He works a lot.	On puno radi.
This time she was alone.	Ovaj put je bila sama.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
But that’s still too much.	Ali to je još uvijek previše.
That's not right.	To nije u redu.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
Nobody got a job there.	Tamo niko nije dobio posao.
Very good job.	Vrlo dobar posao.
Do not do that!.	Ne radi to!.
I got so much from him.	Toliko sam dobio od njega.
People are here.	Ljudi su ovdje.
I didn't want to ask.	Nisam htela da pitam.
And it's not always easy.	I nije uvijek jednostavno.
I can tell you a lot about how he feels.	Mogu vam reći mnogo o tome kako se osjeća.
I got my money.	Dobio sam svoj novac.
I should know better.	Trebalo bi da znam bolje.
She's right, obviously.	Ona je u pravu, očigledno.
I just can't see it.	Ja to jednostavno ne mogu vidjeti.
I have no time.	Nemam vremena.
I can't reach him.	Ne mogu do njega.
I just didn’t think it was going to be that fast.	Samo nisam mislio da će to biti tako brzo.
No one had to.	Niko nije morao.
It could be several things.	Moglo bi biti nekoliko stvari.
And so it was.	I tako je bilo.
I wish they would.	Voleo bih da hoće.
I'll tell you this.	Reći ću ti ovo.
It's not for everyone.	Nije za sve.
But it's not them.	Ali to nisu oni.
Or maybe it's the first of several.	Ili je možda prvi od nekoliko.
We have three.	Imamo tri.
He had to go.	Morao je da ode.
He came home.	Došao je kući.
But that is not the case.	Ali to nije tako.
I may never come back.	Možda se nikada neću vratiti.
My life was good.	Moj život je bio dobar.
I loved everything.	Voleo sam sve.
She's there.	Ona je tamo.
But in fact, they are not.	Ali u stvari, nisu.
I really didn't know what to do with it.	Zaista nisam znao šta da radim s tim.
We would know who they are.	Znali bismo ko su oni.
I work long hours.	Radim dugo.
Everything was like that.	Sve je bilo tako.
Maybe we should.	Možda bi trebali.
But that's okay.	Ali to je u redu.
They can help you.	Oni vam mogu pomoći.
See if this works.	Vidi da li ovo radi.
My job, you know.	Moj posao, znaš.
She was good at it when she needed to be.	Bila je dobra u tome kad je trebalo.
It's not that hard.	Nije tako teško.
I'm just me.	Ja sam samo ja.
I've always had a problem with that.	Uvek sam imao problem sa tim.
I hope you get this.	Nadam se da ćeš dobiti ovo.
Doing this would be difficult.	Uraditi ovo bi bilo teško.
I still can't really believe it.	Još uvijek ne mogu stvarno vjerovati.
That was what he was willing to do today.	To je bilo ono što je bio spreman da uradi danas.
She knew they weren't.	Znala je da nisu.
I didn't want to do anything.	Nisam htela ništa da radim.
That's really not a long time.	To zaista nije dugo vremena.
what will i do 	šta ću učiniti?
I'm so sorry .	Tako mi je žao .
She was fine.	Bila je dobro.
He was only three years old.	Imao je samo tri godine.
But that was all they had.	Ali to je bilo sve što su imali.
I'll tell you why.	Reći ću ti zašto.
That's what happened.	Tako se dogodilo.
For what you did tonight.	Za ono što si uradio večeras.
It's often all of those things.	Često su sve te stvari.
But there is still much to be done.	Ali ima još mnogo toga da se uradi.
It wasn't good, she told herself.	Nije bilo dobro, rekla je sebi.
But it happens often.	Ali to se često dešava.
It could have been almost anything.	Moglo je biti skoro sve.
But that's not good.	Ali to nije dobro.
I know him a little.	Znam ga malo.
He is one of us now.	On je sada jedan od nas.
That's why he was here, he told himself.	Zbog toga je bio ovdje, rekao je sebi.
You can't leave now.	Ne možete otići sada.
So, so good.	Toliko, tako dobro.
I have to pray for this.	Moram da se molim za ovo.
We have to do both.	Moramo uraditi oboje.
I won't say anything more than that.	Neću reći ništa više od toga.
In fact, you could say that.	U stvari, mogli biste to reći.
Don't say anything.	Ne govori ništa.
He just can't.	On jednostavno ne može.
I didn't actually see anything.	Zapravo ništa nisam video.
Not only that.	Ne samo to.
It's not working for now.	Za sada ne radi.
And so it continues.	I tako je i dalje.
There aren't many of us.	Nema nas mnogo.
Nothing really happened to me there.	Ništa mi se zapravo tamo nije dogodilo.
Something is happening here.	Nešto se ovde dešava.
But he is much more.	Ali on je mnogo više.
What, who knows.	Šta, ko zna.
But this was never meant to be.	Ali ovo nikada nije trebalo biti.
That's just me.	To sam samo ja.
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
Even more.	Čak i više.
I asked why.	Pitao sam zašto.
I was busy now.	Sada sam bio zauzet.
He didn't tell him anything.	Ništa mu nije rekao.
But that is not allowed.	Ali to nije dozvoljeno.
I lost money.	Izgubio sam novac.
We have to work together.	Moramo raditi zajedno.
But this does not seem to be true.	Ali izgleda da ovo nije tačno.
He wondered if everyone was like that.	Pitao se da li je svima tako.
I still think that's true.	I dalje mislim da je to istina.
Why are you still here?	Zašto si još uvijek ovdje?
It's not that hard.	Nije tako teško.
You know what you have to do.	Znaš šta moraš da uradiš.
That is true and correct.	To je tačno i tačno.
It’s not as simple as it seems.	Nije tako jednostavno kao što se čini.
This can't be good.	Ovo ne može biti dobro.
She is more than they told me.	Ona je više nego što su mi rekli.
I don't want too much of it.	Ne želim previše od toga.
I didn't really want anything.	Nisam baš ništa želeo.
Let me ask you.	Da te pitam.
I shouldn't have come back.	Nisam se trebao vratiti.
My father loved him.	Moj otac ga je volio.
Work, work.	Posao, posao.
Everyone knows we could.	Svi znaju da bismo mogli.
He will definitely be back.	Sigurno će se vratiti.
The money didn't seem real either.	Ni novac nije izgledao pravi.
I will come to you.	Doći ću kod tebe.
Nothing this time.	Ovaj put ništa.
I've been before.	Bio sam ranije.
He always knew what she was thinking.	Uvek je znao šta ona misli.
Just like a guy.	Baš kao momak.
And it's okay.	I u redu je.
But she knows that well enough.	Ali ona to dovoljno dobro zna.
This couldn't happen.	Ovo se nije moglo dogoditi.
You didn't lose.	Nisi izgubio.
We have, we have.	Imamo, imamo.
You won't be able to.	Nećeš moći.
I'm sorry, I can't help you there.	Žao mi je, tu vam ne mogu pomoći.
Good guy.	Dobar momak.
I was busy.	Bio sam zauzet.
I think it would be.	Mislim da bi bilo.
She doesn't need to.	Ona ne treba.
But not if he was busy.	Ali ne ako je bio zauzet.
I didn't understand at all.	Uopšte nisam shvatio.
She didn't want to like him, but she did.	Nije htela da mu se sviđa, ali jeste.
I know it was good.	Znam da je bilo dobro.
I can't say why.	Ne mogu reći zašto.
I'm just .	Ja sam samo .
She didn't know what he was thinking.	Nije znala šta on misli.
I had no idea what.	Nisam imao pojma šta.
We need to know what happened there.	Moramo znati šta se tamo dogodilo.
It used to be pretty good.	Prije je bilo prilično dobro.
They told him not to go.	Rekli su mu da ne ide.
I am this.	Ja sam ovo.
He just wants to see you.	On bi samo želio da te vidi.
Very, very fast.	Vrlo, vrlo brzo.
What, she didn't know.	Šta, nije znala.
I can't say anything more.	Ne mogu reći ništa više.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Nije želio razgovarati sa mnom.
She just wasn’t much.	Ona jednostavno nije bila mnogo.
I hope you know what that is.	Nadam se da znaš šta je to.
I'll tell you why.	Reći ću ti zašto.
He knew you would come back.	Znao je da ćeš se vratiti.
For a while nothing happened.	Neko vrijeme se ništa nije dogodilo.
He couldn't stay here.	Nije mogao ostati ovdje.
It just works.	To jednostavno radi.
All for more money.	Sve za više novca.
Maybe you too.	Možda i ti.
It just happened, that's all.	Jednostavno se dogodilo, to je sve.
It's time for work.	Vrijeme je za posao.
But there was no one.	Ali nije bilo nikoga.
It was a really good year for us.	Bila je to zaista dobra godina za nas.
Maybe it's both.	Možda je oboje.
That he should do it sometime.	Da bi to nekada trebalo da uradi.
That way you can know what to do.	Tako možete znati šta da radite.
As always.	Kao i uvek.
But we couldn't do that.	Ali, nismo to mogli.
He was surprised that he could still see.	Bio je iznenađen što još uvijek vidi.
Do what you will.	Uradi šta ćeš.
You don't have to do anything.	Ne moraš ništa da radiš.
New job now.	Novi posao odmah.
But just do it.	Ali samo uradi to.
But someone had to.	Ali neko je morao.
But he thought he knew.	Ali mislio je da zna.
I never understood why.	Nikad nisam shvatio zašto.
That's all we know for sure.	To je sve što sigurno znamo.
Something like you, really.	Nešto kao ti, zaista.
This doesn't look right.	Ovo ne izgleda u redu.
And you know, maybe you're right.	I znaš, možda si u pravu.
I have no problem with that.	Nemam problema u tome.
Maybe she knew it before he did.	Možda je ona to znala prije nego on sam.
And a little happy.	I malo sretan.
It was quite like that.	Bilo je dosta tako.
Tried again.	Pokušao ponovo.
I doubt it ever will be.	Sumnjam da li će ikada biti.
But that's not what we're here for.	Ali nismo zbog toga ovdje.
But it's not what you think.	Ali, nije ono što mislite.
But it didn't.	Ali, nije.
I got the job.	Dobio sam posao.
Work will do that to you.	Posao će vam to učiniti.
There was no one to be seen.	Nije bilo nikoga da se vidi.
That was all he had to say about himself.	To je bilo sve što je imao da kaže za sebe.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Mogao je raditi sve što je htio.
That was supposed to be me.	To sam trebao biti ja.
not who would know.	ne ko bi znao.
They both had money.	Oboje su imali novac.
But who can say.	Ali ko može da kaže.
It was a good year!.	Bila je to dobra godina!.
Except, probably, for you.	Osim, vjerovatno, za tebe.
Business is much better now.	Posao je sada mnogo bolji.
And you say yes.	A ti kažeš da.
There is only one good reason for this.	Za to postoji samo jedan dobar razlog.
I need someone here.	Treba mi neko ovde.
But only last year.	Ali samo prošle godine.
Not if.	Nije ako.
At that time it was.	U to vrijeme je bilo.
Yes, this is my lucky day.	Da, ovo je moj sretan dan.
Let me tell you.	Da ti kažem .
You should have seen me sooner.	Trebao si me vidjeti prije.
Long enough for both of us.	Dovoljno dugo za oboje.
But that's all.	Ali to je sve.
We can know many things.	Možemo znati mnogo stvari.
The question is how much has happened.	Pitanje je koliko se toga dogodilo.
That's how we did it.	Tako smo to uradili.
That was fast.	To je bilo brzo.
It's usually not fast enough.	Obično nije dovoljno brzo.
Or need help.	Ili treba pomoć.
It's just good.	Jednostavno je dobro.
I know nothing but that.	Ne znam ništa osim toga.
You know he meant what he said.	Znate da je mislio ono što je rekao.
Pretty good actually.	Prilično dobro u stvari.
Too much has happened here.	Previše toga se ovde dogodilo.
I don't see a way.	Ne vidim način.
I want to know what could be the problem.	Želim da znam šta može biti problem.
She just didn't know.	Ona jednostavno nije znala.
Are you like	Da li si kao
It could have been him.	Mogao je biti on.
You can do better than that.	Možeš i bolje od toga.
We've never been here.	Nikada nismo bili ovdje.
Where are you?.	Gdje si ti?.
Why yes, yes it is.	Zašto da, da jeste.
That obviously didn't happen.	To se očigledno nije dogodilo.
The truth is that no one knows.	Istina je da niko ne zna.
It has to be you.	Moraš biti ti.
But he saw that it could not happen.	Ali vidio je da se to ne može dogoditi.
That was all she said.	To je bilo sve što je rekla.
They are not here.	Oni nisu ovde.
But that, it seems, is no more.	Ali toga, čini se, više nema.
But that is at the moment.	Ali to je trenutno.
He knew we knew.	Znao je da znamo.
Never should have, until now.	Nikad nije trebalo, do sada.
Maybe that was the problem.	Možda je to bio problem.
He could work if he wanted to.	Mogao bi da radi ako to želi.
But let me tell you something.	Ali da ti kažem nešto.
She is no good.	Ona nije dobra.
He looked so happy.	Izgledao je tako sretan.
I'm sure he's right.	Siguran sam da je u pravu.
They had too much.	Imali su previše.
I never never will.	Nikada nikad neću.
But there is a reason.	Ali postoji razlog.
They won't come back.	Neće se vratiti.
He said yes.	On je rekao da.
They wouldn't tell me.	Ne bi mi rekli.
I didn't do that.	Nisam uradio tako.
But not so fast.	Ali ne tako brzo.
Just not her.	Samo ne ona.
We were in it.	Bili smo u tome.
We all know these things.	Svi znamo ove stvari.
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno si u pravu.
No one can help anyone.	Niko nikome ne može pomoći.
Everything you need, he can get.	Sve što ti treba, on može dobiti.
You were there.	Bio si tamo.
Such a thing could indeed be true.	Tako nešto bi zaista moglo biti istina.
They shouldn't.	Ne bi trebali.
My only problem is.	Moj jedini problem je.
Maybe it was the money.	Možda je to bio novac.
But for the first time it works well.	Ali po prvi put radi dobro.
There is no way.	Ne postoji način.
Few expected it.	Malo ko je to očekivao.
And why it didn't happen earlier.	I zašto se to ranije nije dogodilo.
Like you.	Kao i ti.
Neither you nor they are.	Nisi ni ti, a ni oni.
They didn't know about it.	Nisu znali za to.
I'd like to know what that is.	Voleo bih da znam šta je to.
I'm sure we won't.	Siguran sam da nećemo.
But you have to give me something.	Ali moraš mi nešto dati.
I'm not sure what that is.	Nisam siguran šta je to.
I feel sorry for you.	Žao mi je zbog tebe.
I've done it before.	Radio sam to ranije.
And no one can believe that it is true.	I niko ne može vjerovati da je to istina.
This is not real.	Ovo nije stvarno.
I can buy you anything you want.	Mogu ti kupiti sve što želiš.
You were the problem.	Ti si bio problem.
But he just couldn't seem to do it.	Ali činilo se da to jednostavno nije mogao učiniti.
You can bring them back here anytime.	Možete ih vratiti ovdje bilo kada.
This was not easy.	Ovo nije bilo lako.
He knew he could never go back.	Znao je da se nikada ne može vratiti.
You did so much for me.	Toliko si uradio za mene.
I expected that from him.	Očekivao sam to od njega.
He wasn't sure how he felt about that.	Nije bio siguran kako se osjeća zbog toga.
We have to do better.	Moramo biti bolji.
You're not ready.	Nisi spreman.
I just don't know how to do it.	Samo ne znam kako da to uradim.
He came to help.	Došao je da pomogne.
Now it's gone.	Sada ga nema.
.	.
I figured all this out on my own.	Sve sam ovo shvatio sam.
And apparently he heard nothing.	I očigledno ništa nije čuo.
Just like that.	Samo tako.
That was all they could do.	To je bilo sve što su mogli učiniti.
That's good enough.	To je dovoljno dobro.
I mean, like .	Mislim, kao .
He didn't seem surprised to see me.	Nije izgledao iznenađen što me vidi.
Nothing is ever simple with me.	Sa mnom nikad ništa nije jednostavno.
That was one.	To je bio jedan.
I should have done better than him.	Trebao sam bolje od njega.
One didn't.	Jedan nije.
I can't believe you're going to do anything.	Ne mogu ti vjerovati da ćeš ništa učiniti.
You can leave.	Možeš otići.
That will buy time.	To će kupiti vrijeme.
None of that would be right anymore.	Ništa od toga više ne bi bilo u redu.
We need to talk.	Moramo razgovarati.
I did it myself.	Uradio sam to sam.
It's all for you.	Sve je za vas.
She didn't know why.	Nije znala zašto.
They had money.	Imali su novac.
But yesterday was a good day for me.	Ali, juče je bio dobar dan za mene.
And they will see us.	I oni će nas vidjeti.
And this works.	I ovo radi.
It seems like yesterday.	Čini mi se kao juče.
I highly doubt it.	Veoma sumnjam u to.
I will definitely be back.	Sigurno ću se vratiti.
There were a lot of things.	Bilo je puno stvari.
Three times in thirty years.	Tri puta u trideset godina.
You, with me.	Ti, sa mnom.
He will come.	On će doći.
They were all there.	Svi su bili tamo.
That really happened.	To se zaista dogodilo.
It never is, and probably never will be.	Nikada nije, a vjerovatno nikada i neće.
It might help you.	Možda ti pomogne.
It wasn't yesterday.	Nije bilo juče.
Nobody here knows how to do it.	Niko ovde ne zna kako se to radi.
And what it's about.	I o čemu se radi.
That's what we know.	To je ono što znamo.
But it didn't.	Ali nije.
About any of that.	O bilo čemu od toga.
The only problem is .	Jedini problem je .
She knew he needed help.	Znala je da mu treba pomoć.
We just were.	Samo smo bili.
But it looks good.	Ali dobro izgleda.
I think that's true.	Mislim da je to istina.
He meant it.	Mislio je to.
For one day.	Za jedan dan.
This is very long.	Ovo je jako dugo.
I don't know what to do either.	Ne znam ni ja šta da radim.
That's what you should do.	To je ono što bi trebalo da uradiš.
I can say this.	Mogu reći ovo.
No one has to work for a living.	Niko ne mora da radi za život.
Yes, there is.	Da, ima.
It still seemed like a good idea.	I dalje se činilo kao dobra ideja.
He was everything to me.	On mi je bio sve.
Not for long, he realized.	Ne dugo, shvatio je.
Just what they should be.	Baš ono što bi trebali biti.
The only way to do it.	Jedini način da se to uradi.
That's all you do.	To je sve što radiš.
It was a little hard, but good.	Bilo je malo teško, ali dobro.
But we have many friends here.	Ali ovde imamo mnogo prijatelja.
But it really could be, it could be anyone.	Ali zaista može biti, može biti bilo ko.
You have to stay on it.	Moraš ostati na tome.
The work will always be there.	Posao će uvek biti tu.
I want to know if he's surprised to see me.	Želim da znam da li je iznenađen što me vidi.
You already lost.	Već si izgubio.
I still have it today.	Imam ga i danas.
But much of what he said was absolutely true.	Ali mnogo toga što je rekao bilo je potpuno tačno.
Like you said.	Kao što si rekao.
Maybe it was too much.	Možda je bilo previše.
He decided not to say anything.	Odlučio je da ništa ne kaže.
If so, it may still be there.	Ako je tako, možda je još uvijek tamo.
I can't reach him.	Ne mogu do njega.
Just do it, that's all.	Samo uradi, to je sve.
One came for him.	Jedan je došao po njega.
But he was here.	Ali on je bio ovde.
But he wasn't ready, not yet.	Ali nije bio spreman, ne još.
I don't think he's right.	Mislim da nije u pravu.
You are said to know a lot.	Kaže se da znaš mnogo.
Because of the things he has.	Zbog stvari koje ima.
You need help, we're here.	Treba vam pomoć, tu smo.
He is not alone.	On nije sam.
A few days, he said.	Nekoliko dana, rekao je.
For now, it works well for us.	Za sada dobro radi za nas.
And it took me a long time to say that.	I trebalo mi je mnogo da to kažem.
Usually that was not a problem.	Obično to nije bio problem.
Everyone should be safe.	Svi bi trebali biti sigurni.
The only problem is that it's not true.	Jedini problem je što to nije istina.
What happened wasn't because of you.	Ono što se dogodilo nije bilo zbog tebe.
Maybe it's not that.	Možda nije to.
Many times.	Mnogo puta.
I was sure he would come back.	Bio sam siguran da će se vratiti.
He'll be back soon.	Uskoro će se vratiti.
Not so this time.	Ovaj put nije tako.
I'm here now.	Sada sam ovde.
Maybe, but probably not.	Možda, ali vjerovatno ne.
You can't let him do that.	Ne možeš mu dozvoliti da to uradi.
Tell us how it goes.	Reci nam kako nam ide.
It works a little fast.	Radi malo brzo.
He'll find it okay.	Naći će to u redu.
It's really very simple.	Zaista je vrlo jednostavno.
But she's not that.	Ali ona nije to.
I don't even like it.	Čak mi se i ne sviđa.
But it doesn't have to.	Ali ne mora.
But she knows all that.	Ali ona sve to zna.
I was busy and he was busy.	Bio sam zauzet i on je bio zauzet.
We can do it here.	Možemo to ovdje.
But she didn't even say it was me.	Ali nije čak ni rekla da sam to ja.
The money is back.	Novac se vratio.
For now, no one can.	Za sada niko ne može.
He probably didn't realize how right he was.	Verovatno nije shvatio koliko je bio u pravu.
Let me see, he said.	Da vidim, rekao je.
You know, but it's my job.	Znaš, ali to je moj posao.
There were them.	Bilo ih je.
And he couldn't help but believe it.	I nije mogao ne vjerovati tome.
I could trust you, but now you're gone.	Mogao bi ti vjerovati, ali sada te nema.
It was good to see her again.	Bilo je dobro vidjeti je ponovo.
Probably for all of us soon.	Vjerovatno za sve nas uskoro.
I just think he will.	Samo mislim da hoće.
You can’t do it alone.	Ne možete to učiniti sami.
He would never admit it, but he is afraid of them.	Nikada to ne bi priznao, ali ih se boji.
I should be so happy.	Trebao bih biti tako sretan.
I know it wasn't easy.	Znam da nije bilo lako.
I doubt they know themselves.	Sumnjam da znaju sebe.
They are nothing.	Oni nisu ništa.
She knew where she was.	Znala je gdje je.
That's not you.	To nisi ti.
And, in fact, it is.	I, u stvari, jeste.
Probably never would.	Vjerovatno nikad ne bi.
See next question.	Vidi sljedeće pitanje.
But it wasn't time.	Ali nije bilo vrijeme.
It is not hard.	Nije teško.
It still wasn't enough.	I dalje nije bilo dovoljno.
I wish he was here to see this.	Voleo bih da je on ovde da vidi ovo.
On my three.	Na moja tri.
But that never happens.	Ali to se nikada ne dešava.
She never said anything.	Nikad ništa nije rekla.
It's not that hard.	To nije tako teško.
I actually have to.	Zapravo moram.
He wasn't doing anything right now.	Trenutno nije radio ništa.
I asked him to leave.	Zamolio sam ga da ode.
There would be no more.	Ne bi bilo više.
He said nothing was wrong.	Rekao je da ništa nije u redu.
You can never find them here.	Nikada ih ovdje ne možete naći.
Everyone knew why they were here.	Svi su znali zašto su ovdje.
He doesn't say that.	On to ne kaže.
Nothing was real.	Ništa nije bilo stvarno.
He's not a bad guy.	On nije loš momak.
It's like him.	To je kao on.
I don't want that for myself.	Ne želim to sebi.
I asked her to dance.	Pitao sam je da igra.
We have done a lot.	Uradili smo mnogo.
But there is more going on.	Ali, dešava se više.
Except he doesn't.	Osim što on to ne čini.
It could have been anyone, anywhere.	Mogao je biti bilo ko, bilo gdje.
This is no longer allowed.	Ovo više nije dozvoljeno.
I'm telling you.	Kažem ti.
We need a little more.	Treba nam još malo.
Only one will.	Samo jedan hoće.
We both needed that.	To nam je oboje trebalo.
But they don't know it.	Ali oni to ne znaju.
And it's not okay.	I nije u redu.
It's really quite easy.	Zaista je prilično lako.
Only there she must be all or nothing.	Samo tamo ona mora biti sve ili ništa.
Little better.	Malo bolje.
Maybe never.	Možda nikada.
We have a meeting.	Imamo sastanak.
And he's not the only one who said that.	I nije on jedini koji je to rekao.
It doesn't seem like anything to me, really.	Ne čini mi se ništa, zaista.
But that might not help me.	Ali to mi možda neće pomoći.
Except that can't be true.	Osim što to ne može biti tačno.
There must be something.	Nešto mora biti.
We should believe that.	Trebali bismo vjerovati u to.
I guess you are.	Pretpostavljam da jesi.
He knew a lot.	Znao je mnogo.
I have enough.	Imam dovoljno.
And it happened.	I to se dogodilo.
That was true last night.	To je bila istina sinoć.
As it is exactly my life.	Kao što je to tačno moj život.
Too many things.	Previše stvari.
I guess there is a first time for everything.	Pretpostavljam da za sve postoji prvi put.
I'm back.	Vratio sam se.
As a person.	Kao osoba.
I'm not sure it is.	Nisam siguran da jeste.
He even began to love himself.	Počeo je čak i sebe da voli.
That's what happened here.	To se dogodilo ovdje.
I know exactly what is what.	Znam tačno šta je šta.
My life has been busy.	Moj život je bio zauzet.
The problem was that it was not enough.	Problem je bio u tome što toga nije bilo dovoljno.
It's like.	To je kao .
Everything would be fine there.	Tamo bi bilo sve u redu.
He should have said that.	Trebao je to reći.
But is it a game.	Ali da li je to igra.
I have to say there were very few problems.	Moram reći da je bilo vrlo malo problema.
I would be happy.	Bio bih sretan.
And probably more than once.	I vjerovatno više puta.
No, we don't know that.	Ne, mi to ne znamo.
But a good one.	Ali dobar.
He's done it enough.	Uradio je to dovoljno.
And there's really no problem.	I zapravo nema problema.
But that was not the only problem.	Ali to nije bio jedini problem.
I have a job for you.	Imam posao za tebe.
You can buy them here.	Možete ih kupiti ovdje.
He said he did.	Rekao je da jeste.
He got help.	Dobio je pomoć.
And it would take many more years.	I još bi trebalo mnogo godina.
He did just that.	On je upravo to uradio.
He never returned home.	Nikad se nije vratio kući.
He seems to know too much.	Izgleda da zna previše.
Maybe he did.	Možda je to i učinio.
But it is neither here nor there.	Ali to nije ni ovdje ni tamo.
We needed more.	Trebalo nam je više.
Do it, please.	Uradi to, molim te.
And that is all.	I to je sve.
It drives well.	Dobro se vozi.
Not now.	Sada nije.
She doesn't want to talk.	Ona ne želi da priča.
Oh yes, you can believe that.	O, da, u to možeš vjerovati.
And it's not a bad thing.	I nije ništa loše.
She already knows about it.	Ona već zna za to.
I don't know why this is happening.	Ne znam zašto se to dešava.
We haven't done that yet.	Nismo to još uradili.
I was everything.	Bio sam sve.
Looks like there aren't any.	Izgleda da ih nema.
All together now.	Sada svi zajedno.
And that's a lot.	I to je puno.
He didn't tell me who he was.	Nije mi rekao ko je on.
He knows exactly.	On tačno zna.
Time is time.	Vrijeme je vrijeme.
That was probably at the time.	To je bilo vjerovatno u to vrijeme.
Everyone is very well.	Svi su jako dobro.
Better than ever.	Bolje nego ikada.
And, you know, they're better than us.	I, znate, bolji oni od nas.
You are alone.	Vi ste sami.
So probably not anymore.	Tako da vjerovatno ne više.
But he knew he was afraid for himself.	Ali znao je da se boji za sebe.
But it was not so.	Ali nije bilo tako.
In fact, it was okay.	U stvari, bilo je u redu.
That really happened.	To se zaista dogodilo.
Is that what you meant?	Jesi li to mislio?
I will tell the truth.	Reći ću istinu.
I've seen her before.	Video sam je ranije.
He also knew the way.	Znao je i put.
But that never happened.	Ali, to se nikada nije dogodilo.
You can stay at home.	Možete ostati kod kuće.
He shouldn't have done that.	Nije trebalo to da uradi.
I came to.	Došao sam da .
It would all be easy.	Sve bi to bilo lako.
He loves it, all of it.	On to voli, sve to.
You haven't been there that long.	Nisi bio tamo tako dugo.
I just wanted to do it right.	Samo sam htela da to uradim kako treba.
He just has to do it.	On to jednostavno mora da uradi.
Which was both good and bad.	Što je bilo i dobro i loše.
Who knows what might happen if he does.	Ko zna šta se može dogoditi ako to učini.
Too real.	Previše stvarno.
I never saw anything.	Nikad ništa nisam video.
Nobody knows what it is.	Niko ne zna šta je to.
But it's not good enough yet.	Ali još nije dovoljno dobro.
Maybe he could be too.	Možda bi i on mogao biti.
This is a difficult time for us.	Ovo je teško vrijeme za nas.
It’s all too much for one day.	Sve je to previše za jedan dan.
So is business.	Tako je i posao.
I didn't do this today.	Nisam ovo uradio danas.
It happened yesterday.	To se dogodilo juče.
We don't know what they are.	Ne znamo šta su.
More about us here.	Više o nama ovdje.
It is that, but it is also much more.	To je to, ali je i mnogo više.
Are you ready?.	Da li si spreman?.
We all knew it.	Svi smo mi to znali.
In good time.	U dobro vrijeme.
No, he couldn't.	Ne, nije mogao.
You know very well what it was.	Vi dobro znate šta je to bilo.
He would like the truth.	Želeo bi istinu.
If not, they won't.	Ako ne, neće.
And he heard it.	I on je to čuo.
And this code is not.	A ovaj kod nije.
Which was fine.	Što je bilo u redu.
I hope it was helpful.	Nadam se da je bilo od pomoći.
We need to talk some more.	Moramo još malo razgovarati.
While I'm doing nothing.	Dok ne radim ništa.
And it was, and it is.	I bilo je, i jeste.
That's why he was here.	Zbog toga je bio ovdje.
I've never seen that.	Nikad to nisam vidio.
Not good until you give up.	Nije dobro dok se ne da.
There was a lot of that.	Bilo je mnogo toga.
But it was hard to get to him.	Ali bilo je teško doći do njega.
He will have to do this.	Ovo će morati da uradi.
He would be right back.	Odmah bi se vratio.
Just like with us.	Baš kao što je i kod nas.
Now it’s probably something more.	Sada je vjerovatno nešto više.
We were a problem.	Bili smo problem.
I don't have any of that.	Nemam ništa od toga.
I know that, and you know it.	Ja to znam, a i ti znaš.
I was there, I did it, I know it well.	Bio sam tamo, uradio to, dobro znam.
But that is certainly not true.	Ali to sigurno nije istina.
In fact, we wouldn’t.	U stvari, ne bismo.
The car will be here by tomorrow.	Auto će biti ovdje do sutra.
I think he likes the idea.	Mislim da mu se sviđa ideja.
He probably expected this.	Verovatno je ovo očekivao.
He had no idea what she was thinking.	Nije imao pojma šta ona misli.
No, he wasn't here.	Ne, nije bio ovde.
Yes, very much.	Da, veoma.
It will come to me.	Doći će do mene.
I was there long enough to see it.	Bio sam tamo dovoljno dugo da to vidim.
He will do it.	On će to učiniti.
But it's okay.	Ali u redu je.
Nobody knew.	Niko nije znao.
He knew what it was about.	Znao je o čemu se radi.
He did it very well.	On je to uradio veoma dobro.
But don't take long.	Ali nemoj dugo.
Like he can see me.	Kao da me može vidjeti.
I do not work.	Ja ne radim.
And she knows that he knows it.	I ona zna da on to zna.
Apparently they have been there for several years.	Očigledno su tamo već nekoliko godina.
He couldn't say exactly why.	Nije mogao tačno reći zašto.
But this is anything but easy.	Ali ovo je sve samo ne lako.
I never know what to think about it.	Nikad ne znam šta da mislim o tome.
We know what this is.	Znamo šta je ovo.
I'm just not sure what.	Samo nisam siguran šta.
Lots of money.	Mnogo novca.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
What does that say?	Šta to govori.
I see it so often.	Vidim to tako često.
That's really not a problem.	To zaista nije problem.
She was like that.	Bila je tako.
I bought it for you.	Kupio sam ti ga.
Nobody saw anything.	Niko ništa nije video.
Yes, yes, exactly.	Da, da, tačno.
I have to work.	Moram da radim.
We know what's good for you.	Znamo šta je dobro za vas.
She told herself it wasn't real.	Rekla je sebi da to nije stvarno.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
Not even a little.	Čak ni malo.
Maybe no problem.	Možda i nema problema.
Nothing is wrong.	Ništa nije u redu.
I've never heard of it.	Nikad nisam čuo za to.
He would never see those things.	On nikada ne bi video te stvari.
Yes we can.	Da, možemo.
We will not do such a thing.	Nećemo uraditi tako nešto.
No one has a problem with that.	Niko nema problema sa tim.
It wasn't supposed to go that way.	Nije trebalo da ide tako.
John at the time.	John je u to vrijeme.
I had them all.	Imao sam ih sve.
But that's not true.	Ali to nije istina.
They were not themselves.	Oni nisu bili oni sami.
Do as you wish.	Radite kako želite.
Don't ever.	Nemoj nikad.
You still don't know what awaits you.	Još uvijek ne znaš šta te čeka.
Good reason.	Dobar razlog.
He always did.	Uvek je to radio.
But he tried.	Ali pokušao je.
In fact, he has already begun.	U stvari, on je već počeo.
I'm back.	Vratio sam se.
I've heard all about it.	Čuo sam sve o tome.
I had to know a lot more.	Morao sam znati mnogo više.
She wouldn't want this.	Ona ne bi htela ovo.
We'll find him.	Naći ćemo ga.
I don't want that either.	Ne želim ni to.
But it is more than that.	Ali to je više od toga.
He's right that it won't be easy.	U pravu je da neće biti lako.
Today in time.	Danas u vrijeme.
I know they're there.	Znam da su tamo.
I haven't been alone for a long time.	Nisam dugo bila sama.
We'll get to that here.	Doći ćemo do toga ovdje.
He didn't want to be here.	Nije želio biti ovdje.
If you can, it is.	Ako možete, to je.
We do it here.	Mi to radimo ovdje.
It couldn't be, but it was there.	Nije moglo biti, ali bilo je tu.
There are more of us and we are better.	Ima nas više i bolji smo.
But that's not it.	Ali to nije to.
It's real time.	To je stvarno vrijeme.
And who has it.	I ko je ima.
He knew she loved him.	Znao je da ga voli.
If you want.	Ako želite.
There are so many thoughts.	Ima toliko misli.
Nothing is allowed to live.	Ništa nije dozvoljeno da živi.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.	Činilo se da ništa nije u redu.
I've had enough of it tonight.	Večeras sam bio dosta s tim.
It was very fast.	Bilo je vrlo brzo.
But there are a few problems here.	Ali ovdje postoji nekoliko problema.
We wouldn't be here at all.	Ne bismo uopšte bili ovde.
But not all.	Ali ne sve.
But it will come soon.	Ali uskoro će doći.
Everything was fine there.	Sve je bilo u redu tamo.
They were there yesterday.	Bili su tamo juče.
Actually, you can't do that.	U stvari, to ne možete učiniti.
It was a good day.	Bio je to dobar dan.
But it cannot be.	Ali to ne može biti.
And nobody really knows.	I niko to zaista ne zna.
And it works easily enough.	I radi dovoljno lako.
I'm going to see him tonight.	Idem da ga vidim večeras.
That's good for that.	To je dobro za to.
There is a very good reason for this.	Postoji veoma dobar razlog za ovo.
He had a good reason for it.	Imao je dobar razlog za to.
You never know who you might love.	Nikad se ne zna ko bi mogao da voli.
It was very simple and very fast.	Bilo je vrlo jednostavno i vrlo brzo.
He just didn't like to say.	Jednostavno nije volio reći.
It can be worked with.	Sa njim se može raditi.
He was here at home.	Bio je ovdje kod kuće.
There were no days with him.	S njim nije bilo dana.
Maybe three, but no more than that.	Možda tri, ali ne više od toga.
Which could be good.	Što bi moglo biti dobro.
It won't be me.	To neću biti ja.
I'm doing a good job.	Ja radim dobar posao.
There is still much to be done.	Ima još mnogo toga da se uradi.
I could also see if it’s a game.	Mogao bih i vidjeti da li je igra.
But he can't.	Ali ne može.
She seemed afraid of him.	Činilo mi se da ga se boji.
I just couldn't believe it.	Jednostavno nisam mogao vjerovati.
He knew spells.	Znao je čini.
You did a very good job.	Uradio si veoma dobar posao.
It's hard to do that.	Teško je to učiniti.
That wasn't a problem.	To nije bio problem.
I think it will be fine.	Mislim da će biti u redu.
It was probably him.	Vjerovatno je to bio on.
That's not a good reason.	To nije dobar razlog.
She didn't want to see him.	Nije htela da ga vidi.
This was obvious and a real problem.	Ovo je bilo očigledno i pravi problem.
I'm fine with that.	Dobro sam s tim.
Yes, we can talk now.	Da, možemo razgovarati sada.
He said he knew.	Rekao je da zna.
We have to go now.	Moramo ići sada.
I hope it's better now.	Nadam se da je sada bolje.
I tried to tell him.	Pokušao sam da mu kažem.
We already knew that.	To smo već znali.
It happened very quickly.	Dogodilo se vrlo brzo.
She's still here.	Ona je još uvijek ovdje.
He is not happy.	On nije sretan.
For nothing or for when.	Ni za šta ili ni za koga.
You need to get to that quickly.	Morate brzo doći do toga.
Being alone is not a problem for me.	Biti sam nije mi problem.
I want it to work for everyone !.	Želim da radi za sve!.
He would do something.	Uradio bi nešto.
But he really knows what he wants.	Ali on zaista zna šta želi.
I hope you can go home soon.	Nadam se da ćeš moći uskoro kući.
That was so obvious.	To je bilo tako očigledno.
I actually did it.	Zapravo sam to uradio.
I said I could.	Rekao sam da mogu.
I hope he stays there.	Nadam se da će ostati tu.
Like all of them.	Kao i svi oni.
I couldn't say anything.	Nisam mogao ništa reći.
There was more.	Bilo je više.
If and when it happens.	Ako i kada bude.
John was not happy.	John nije bio sretan.
I've seen too much.	Video sam previše.
I should have done more.	Trebao sam učiniti više.
In fact, maybe you can help me.	Zapravo, možda mi možete pomoći.
He doesn't talk.	On ne govori.
Tell me they're here.	Reci mi da su ovde.
Or maybe it's me.	Ili sam to možda ja.
It's a happy life.	To je sretan život.
Such a thing should not exist.	Tako nešto ne bi trebalo da postoji.
He was my person.	On je bio moja osoba.
Everyone seems to know something.	Čini se da svi nešto znaju.
It's just not a good idea.	To jednostavno nije dobra ideja.
Do not do that.	Ne radi to.
And it's not a bad life.	I to nije loš život.
And a good thing.	I dobra stvar.
We would be better off without him.	Bilo bi nam bolje bez njega.
I can't believe it.	Ne mogu vjerovati u to.
Nobody ever does.	Niko nikada ne radi.
I'm not really sure what to do next.	Nisam baš siguran šta dalje.
It was hard to find.	Bilo je teško naći.
He didn't tell me what happened.	Nije mi rekao šta se dogodilo.
It took time.	Trebalo je vremena.
But it doesn't have to be that way.	Ali to ne mora biti tako.
And it's better.	I bolje je.
It does no good.	To ne čini dobro.
I'm doing my job.	Ja radim svoj posao.
He simply wanted to see it.	Jednostavno je to želio vidjeti.
It used to be so simple.	Prije je bilo tako jednostavno.
They're just people now.	Sada su samo ljudi.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Možda, možda, možda.
It was something he did often and he couldn't help it.	To je bilo nešto što je često radio i nije mogao pomoći.
But it was true.	Ali bilo je tačno.
You did it all.	Ti si sve uradio.
And this one.	I ovaj.
Everyone knew your job.	Svi su znali tvoj posao.
I began to doubt it.	Počeo sam da sumnjam u to.
But that's just me.	Ali to sam samo ja.
Little could be seen.	Malo se toga moglo vidjeti.
We have so little time.	Imamo tako malo vremena.
I have a meeting.	Imam sastanak.
And you were.	A ti si bio.
Often not.	Često nije.
You are the only one for me.	Ti si jedini za mene.
I hope it is still good for you today.	Nadam se da je i danas dobro za vas.
Not so, obviously.	Ne tako, očigledno.
Everything works, but there is a problem.	Sve radi, ali postoji problem.
And work on it some more.	I radi na tome još malo.
You might say that's good.	Mogli biste reći da je to dobro.
Which is pretty much exactly what happened.	Što se prilično tačno dogodilo.
That was enough for now.	Za sada je to bilo dovoljno.
I'm glad to see you.	Drago mi je da te vidim.
Hard for me.	Teško za mene.
He would never be again.	Nikada više ne bi bio.
And actually, it was three thirty.	A zapravo, bilo je tri i trideset.
I don't need your money.	Ne treba mi tvoj novac.
That was all.	To je bilo sve.
We know who they are.	Znamo ko su oni.
It was also time.	Bilo je i vrijeme.
She looks much better than any of us.	Ona mnogo bolje izgleda od bilo koga od nas.
But not at all.	Ali uopšte nije.
Can be.	Može biti.
With and.	Sa i.
Something you need to do more.	Nešto što treba da uradite više.
I just don't want to go now.	Samo ne želim da idem sada.
I don't think she's afraid.	Mislim da se ona ne boji.
I know what you must think.	Znam šta sigurno misliš.
It's probably there.	Verovatno je tamo.
I know what you want to talk about.	Znam o čemu želiš razgovarati.
And it seemed to me that it was.	I činilo mi se da jeste.
Which should have been there now.	Što je sada trebalo biti tu.
Today life was good.	Danas je život bio dobar.
So you can go.	Tako da možeš ići.
It's not something that happens quickly.	To nije nešto što se dešava brzo.
I mean, it's not just me.	Mislim, nisam samo ja.
This is not a new day.	Ovo nije novi dan.
So I didn't know that.	Tako da to nisam znao.
Not even her.	Čak ni ona.
That was it.	To je bilo to.
Maybe you were right.	Možda si bio u pravu.
And that's not what she's saying.	A to nije ono što ona govori.
Even this is not enough.	Ni ovo nije dovoljno.
You sure are.	Sigurno jesi.
Not that it would be good.	Nije da bi to bilo dobro.
He will be good.	On će biti dobar.
That was what was there.	To je bilo ono što je bilo tamo.
We were both on it, like.	Oboje smo bili na tome, kao.
Now he understood more how it could be.	Sada je više shvatio kako bi to moglo biti.
I know you can do it.	Znam da ti to možeš.
Day as you wish.	Dan kako želite.
But it's not real.	Ali nije stvarno.
No, it's not okay.	Ne, nije u redu.
We don't need that now.	Ne treba nam to sada.
Everyone knew, but they didn't tell me.	Svi su znali, a nisu mi rekli.
It's ready.	Spreman je.
But it doesn't.	Ali, to ne čini.
he needs it.	treba mu.
But you are the only one at home.	Ali ti si jedini kod kuće.
If you need to say something, say it.	Ako treba nešto da kažeš, reci.
You didn't say anything bad.	Ništa loše nisi rekao.
But we're still here.	Ali još smo tu.
It was just here, now.	Bilo je samo ovdje, sada.
Maybe they would never say anything.	Možda nikad ništa ne bi rekli.
How accurate can that be?	Koliko to može biti tačno?
But much remains to be done.	Ali još mnogo toga treba uraditi.
I hope you like it!	Nadam se da vam se sviđa!
That's why she was here.	Zbog toga je bila ovdje.
It's always like that.	Uvek je tako.
But they were there.	Ali oni su bili tamo.
She told me about it.	Rekla mi je o tome.
This could be bad.	Ovo bi moglo biti loše.
The question is really just about when.	Pitanje je zapravo samo o tome kada.
And so it was.	I tako je bilo.
Just me and him.	Samo ja i on.
It's not there yet.	To još nije.
And always would be.	I uvek bi bila.
I don't know how to love anyone.	Ne znam kako da volim nikoga.
I'm just one of you.	Ja sam samo jedan od vas.
He won't be a problem.	On neće biti problem.
I needed time alone.	Trebalo mi je vrijeme sam.
There are plenty of them.	Ima ih dosta.
That he still loves me.	Da me još voli.
It's totally fine.	Potpuno je u redu.
And there is another reason.	A postoji još jedan razlog.
He was really pretty tired.	Bio je zaista prilično umoran.
Now you know how it happened.	Sada znate kako se to dogodilo.
She will know everything.	Ona će sve znati.
Not exactly three.	Ne baš tri.
Will you tell me something.	Hoćeš li mi nešto reći.
It can't be that.	To ne može biti to.
We have that too.	Imamo i to.
It hasn't been there before.	To prije nije bilo tamo.
But he knew it was true.	Ali znao je da je to istina.
But that's just me.	Ali to sam samo ja.
She doesn't do it anymore.	Ona to više ne radi.
This time it happened.	Ovaj put se to dogodilo.
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije.
You can go to him.	Možeš otići do njega.
I need to see you.	Moram da te vidim.
I don't want to do that.	Ne želim to da radim.
It's still good, but .	I dalje je dobro, ali .
But everything was good.	Ali sve je bilo dobro.
And she wasn't home.	I nije bila kod kuće.
Let me tell you this.	Da ti kažem ovo.
He didn't want help.	Nije želio pomoć.
That would only be today.	To bi bilo samo danas.
So far so good.	Do sada je tako.
Looks like you didn't.	Izgleda da nisi.
I think it should be.	Mislim da bi trebalo da bude.
He must be tired.	Mora da je umoran.
They were, in fact, much more.	Oni su, u stvari, bili mnogo više.
And he said he would go get help.	I rekao je da će otići po pomoć.
You know what happened next.	Znaš šta se dalje dogodilo.
Looks good.	Izgleda dobro.
I know you can.	Znam da možeš.
I really hope you find it helpful.	Zaista se nadam da će vam biti od pomoći.
I thought it would help.	Mislio sam da će pomoći.
I'm not sure what that looks like yet.	Još nisam siguran kako to izgleda.
And he was sure he would come back again.	I bio je siguran da će se ponovo vratiti.
I won't talk like that.	Neće mi se tako razgovarati.
It wasn't that bad.	Nije bilo tako loše.
Do a good job please.	Uradite dobar posao molim.
Maybe a few too many of you.	Možda vas je nekoliko previše.
This seemed to happen more and more.	Činilo se da se ovo dešava sve više i više.
Everyone here knows that.	Svi ovde to znaju.
I'm the one who did it.	Ja sam taj koji je to uradio.
He could tell.	Mogao je reći.
Anyone will tell you.	Bilo ko će ti reći.
To be sure.	Da budem siguran.
I think we should.	Mislim da bi trebali.
None of us is ever alone.	Niko od nas nikada nije sam.
Nobody knows everything.	Niko ne zna sve.
But no more than myself.	Ali ne više od sebe.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Ne mogu, ne mogu, ne mogu.
That I love her.	Da je volim.
It was difficult for him.	Bilo mu je teško.
That was probably a good thing.	To je vjerovatno bilo dobro.
True, there is not much to see.	Istina, nema mnogo za vidjeti.
But he'll be back soon.	Ali uskoro će se vratiti.
He was here this morning.	Bio je ovdje jutros.
This is what my life is.	Ovo je ono što je moj život.
And there are many.	I ima mnogo toga.
They didn't seem to have been there before.	Činilo se da tamo ranije nisu bili.
I'm not sure what the reason is for this.	Nisam siguran šta je razlog za ovo.
Not very good, as it happened.	Nije baš dobro, kako se dogodilo.
He couldn't see the reason for one.	Nije mogao vidjeti razlog za jedan.
Apparently, nothing happened.	Očigledno, ništa se nije dogodilo.
But now was not the time.	Ali sada nije bilo vrijeme.
We can't do it alone.	Ne možemo to sami.
He did it, you know.	On je to uradio, znaš.
He was not the only one.	On nije bio jedini.
I thought you did.	Mislio sam da jesi.
I guess she was right.	Pretpostavljam da je bila u pravu.
I'm as happy as can be.	Sretan sam koliko mogu.
It was very bad.	Bilo je jako loše.
But not her.	Ali ne ona.
I know what the truth is.	Znam šta je istina.
I must have done something right.	Mora da sam uradio nešto kako treba.
Don't tell anyone.	Ne reci nikome.
I just have to say this.	Moram samo ovo reći.
And we know that.	I mi to znamo.
But it almost happened.	Ali skoro se dogodilo.
But not immediately.	Ali ne odmah.
I was a little surprised.	Bio sam malo iznenađen.
If so, there are a lot of us.	Ako jeste, ima nas puno.
And it certainly was.	I sigurno je bilo.
Nothing is that simple.	Nije ništa tako jednostavno.
This is simply not true.	Ovo jednostavno nije tačno.
And that's really hard.	A to je zaista teško.
I hope you will be happy someday.	Nadam se da ćeš nekada biti sretan.
Everything is played, but there is no time.	Sve se igra, ali nema vremena.
He decided he had had enough.	Odlučio je da mu je dosta.
That's exactly it.	To je upravo to.
He is very good.	On je veoma dobar.
Yes, that's right.	Da, tako je.
The truth will always return.	Uvijek će se vratiti istina.
We were there.	Bili smo tamo.
This is true to this day.	To je istina do danas.
And as he said, so it will be.	I kako je rekao, tako će i biti.
It may not happen quickly for you.	Možda vam se to neće dogoditi brzo.
It's just not going to happen.	To se jednostavno neće dogoditi.
And it was, and it was.	I bilo je, i bio je.
Ought.	Trebalo bi.
Yes, it can.	Da, može.
Someone has to know.	Neko mora znati.
I could not.	Nisam mogao.
Something bad is happening.	Nešto loše se dešava.
Not even anything.	Čak ni ništa.
And he was obviously right.	I očigledno je bio u pravu.
Things in the house.	Stvari u kući.
And it happened so fast.	I to se dogodilo tako brzo.
If that was enough, they could have left.	Ako je bilo dovoljno, mogli su otići.
And he would bring them back.	I vratio bi ih.
Yes, it was.	Da, bilo je.
You are no better than him.	Nisi bolji od njega.
But we really need to go beyond that.	Ali zaista treba ići dalje od toga.
And we knew what we had to do.	I znali smo šta treba da radimo.
That was my way.	To je bio moj put.
These were all.	Ovo su bili svi.
It is not enough in itself.	Nije dovoljno samo po sebi.
I guess he was right.	Pretpostavljam da je bio u pravu.
It seems to be.	Čini se da jeste.
But other than that it was him.	Ali osim toga to je bio on.
He's trying here.	On pokušava ovde.
It was.	Bilo je to.
They are not what they used to be and they know it.	Nisu ono što su bili i znaju to.
It can happen anywhere.	To se može dogoditi bilo gdje.
She was never alone.	Nikad nije bila sama.
He wondered how many he couldn't see.	Pitao se koliko ih ne vidi.
I thought for sure that was it.	Sigurno sam mislio da je to to.
No, that's not right.	Ne, to nije u redu.
He didn't look good this morning.	Jutros nije izgledao dobro.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
This can happen quite quickly.	Ovo se može dogoditi prilično brzo.
You're not doing anything.	Ništa ti ne radiš.
If so, that's a good idea.	Ako jeste, to je dobra ideja.
I didn't think so.	Nisam mislio.
But that was okay.	Ali to je bilo u redu.
Everyone needs that.	To treba svima.
I wasn't.	Nisam bio.
It was good.	Bilo je dobro.
He really didn't expect her to leave.	Zaista nije očekivao da će ona otići.
I suppose? 	Pretpostavljam?
They are better now.	Sada su bolji.
He really loved you.	Stvarno te je volio.
Maybe this seems a little long.	Možda ovo izgleda malo dugo.
And there's nothing you can do.	I ne možete ništa da uradite.
Where he is now, they did not know.	Gdje je sada, nisu znali.
You don't have to do everything yourself.	Ne morate sve da radite sami.
No one at all.	Uopšte niko.
Much, much more.	Mnogo, mnogo više.
You're not.	Nisi.
You need to talk to me.	Moraš razgovarati sa mnom.
He will be fine.	On će biti dobro.
Go to school.	Ići u školu.
Or we won't.	Ili nećemo.
And you don't have to do that.	I ne morate to da radite.
No, it doesn't work.	Ne, ne radi.
So much has happened.	Toliko se toga dogodilo.
But still unlikely.	Ali još uvijek malo vjerovatno.
There is no one here at all.	Ovde uopšte nema nikoga.
You know, and she was.	Znate, i bila je.
Only once in a while.	Samo s vremena na vrijeme.
What do you think?	Šta vi mislite?
If it's fast, just say so.	Ako je brzo, samo reci.
I wish none of us knew that.	Voleo bih da to niko od nas ne zna.
He was doing this.	On je ovo radio.
But we don't know.	Ali ne znamo.
They won't come back.	Neće se vratiti.
You have to do this for me.	Moraš ovo uraditi za mene.
He was very good there.	Bio je veoma dobar tamo.
I saw that he was starting to see me.	Vidio sam da je počeo da me vidi.
And who knows what else.	I ko zna šta još.
I need to get more.	Moram dobiti još.
None of us did.	Niko od nas nije.
But something tells me it's not.	Ali nešto mi govori da nije.
I want it to be.	Želim da bude.
The problem still exists.	Problem i dalje postoji.
We are never alone.	Nikad nismo sami.
It was long enough for that.	Bilo je dovoljno dugo za to.
Nothing too much.	Ništa previše.
It always goes and goes.	Uvek ide i ide.
I could talk to him about it.	Mogao bih o tome razgovarati s njim.
So far so good.	Za sada je dobro.
I really was into it.	Zaista sam bio u tome.
He could stay here.	Mogao bi ostati ovdje.
No one, really, was good enough.	Niko, zaista, nije bio dovoljno dobar.
He could do with it as he pleased.	Mogao je da radi s tim kako je htio.
He is both.	On je oboje.
Is it for you or for .	Da li je za vas ili za .
No idea how much.	Nema pojma koliko.
But that doesn't happen.	Ali to se ne dešava.
I'm with him.	Ja sam sa njim.
We were sure of you.	Bili smo sigurni u tebe.
He wasn't a bad guy.	Nije bio loš momak.
It couldn't have been better for us.	Nije moglo bolje za nas.
Maybe someone has worked with it and can help me.	Možda je neko radio s tim i može mi pomoći.
That's something, all right.	To je nešto, u redu.
That was not good of him.	To nije bilo dobro od njega.
Don't tell anyone about it.	Ne govori nikome o tome.
Yes, the weather is getting better.	Da, vrijeme je sve bolje.
They were nothing.	Oni su bili ništa.
People will say you did it just for yourself.	Ljudi će reći da ste to uradili samo za sebe.
We were a better team there.	Bili smo bolji tim tamo.
Look, he's not even here.	Vidi, on čak i nije ovdje.
Nothing strong here.	Ništa jako ovde.
Better than ever.	Bolje nego što je ikada bilo.
I would have.	Imao bih .
This was so easy.	Ovo je bilo tako lako.
I know a little what you mean.	Znam malo šta misliš.
So much is true.	Toliko toga je istina.
Which he probably had.	Što je vjerovatno i imao.
Everything is bad, bad, bad.	Sve je loše, loše, loše.
I think there should be more.	Mislim da bi trebalo biti više.
I need another one.	Treba mi još jedan.
Not at all.	Uopšte ne.
But he was right.	Ali je bio u pravu.
That will not be enough.	To neće biti dovoljno.
I heard him speak.	Čuo sam ga kako govori.
I hope that's okay.	Nadam se da je to u redu.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
They won't let me.	Neće mi dozvoliti.
He tries things.	On pokušava stvari.
I could see her.	Mogao sam da je vidim.
He needs something more.	Treba mu nešto više.
It's just none of my business.	To jednostavno nije moja stvar.
He couldn't believe it.	Nije mogao vjerovati.
But it wasn't like a person.	Ali to nije bilo kao osoba.
A friend said.	Prijatelj je rekao.
And that, it seemed, was it.	I to je, činilo se, bilo to.
I think it's the first time.	Mislim da je to prvi put.
I can't find it now.	Ne mogu ga sada naći.
Nobody will tell me anything.	Niko mi ništa neće reći.
What are we going to do with you?	Šta ćemo s tobom.
It's all completely real.	Sve je to potpuno stvarno.
That’s really what we have.	To je stvarno ono što imamo.
No one knows what you really think.	Niko ne zna šta zaista mislite.
That much is certain.	Toliko je sigurno.
No, no, that's not for me.	Ne, ne, to nije za mene.
We were always together.	Uvek smo bili zajedno.
He had to.	Morao je.
It was time for him to go.	Bilo je vrijeme da ode.
I want them to know who they are.	Želim da znaju ko su.
You are my good friend.	Ti si moj dobar prijatelj.
We'll be better for you soon.	Uskoro ćemo vam biti bolji.
He never came back.	Nikad se nije vratio.
It was just a matter of knowing everything.	Bilo je samo pitanje da se sve zna.
He doesn't even know what he wants.	On ni sam ne zna šta hoće.
This time I was the business.	Ovaj put sam bio posao.
Good job.	Dobar posao.
No, I won't.	Ne, neću.
I have more.	Imam više.
But he's still there.	Ali on je još uvek tamo.
Which it does, yes.	Što i radi, da.
I hope it's good for you.	Nadam se da je dobra za tebe.
Before that, you need to know a few things.	Prije toga, morate znati nekoliko stvari.
He must be here.	On mora biti ovdje.
But this wasn't work.	Ali ovo nije bio posao.
She said no.	Rekla je da nije.
He never wanted to talk about it.	Nikad nije želeo da priča o tome.
And now he's gone.	A sada ga nema.
Good to know.	Dobro je znati.
I need something better than that.	Treba mi nešto bolje od toga.
I want it very much.	Želim to mnogo.
I'm not doing bad.	Ne ide mi loše.
And he does it.	I on to radi.
Not so fast.	Ne tako brzo.
No, because of you.	Neće, zbog tebe.
I've never seen so much before.	Nikada ranije nisam video toliko.
But that's long enough.	Ali to je dovoljno dugo.
Nothing could have happened there.	Tamo se ništa nije moglo dogoditi.
It can't be.	Ne može biti.
That's one way.	To je jedan način.
We knew what we had.	Znali smo šta imamo.
More to come.	Još će doći.
Not as bad as you say.	Nije tako loše kao što kažeš.
Someone had to do something.	Neko je morao nešto da uradi.
That is much more than that.	To je mnogo više od toga.
You should come.	Trebali biste doći.
But they said there was nothing they could do.	Ali rekli su da ne mogu ništa učiniti.
Or are they still alive.	Ili da li su još uvek živi.
But if you don't, you won't.	Ali ako to ne uradiš, nećeš.
She knew exactly where she was.	Tačno je znala gdje je.
He never asked for it.	On to nikada nije tražio.
I need this for work.	Ovo mi treba za posao.
I saw how it could be.	Video sam kako bi to moglo biti.
But no, that wasn't true.	Ali ne, to nije bila istina.
He is just fine.	On je samo dobro.
And it never did.	I nikad nije.
They are still alive.	Još su živi.
They are people.	Oni su ljudi.
And he tried.	I on je pokušao.
I see it happening.	Vidim da se to dešava.
They'll just bring him back.	Samo će ga ponovo vratiti.
Everything is OK.	Sve je u redu.
You will do it.	Ti ćeš to uraditi.
It's easy for me.	Lako mi je.
What exactly he has, we do not know.	Šta on tačno ima, ne znamo.
He feels he knows what he means.	Osjeća da zna na šta misli.
We did it as a team.	Uradili smo to kao tim.
No one ever loved her.	Niko je nikada nije voleo.
I told him he could get it.	Rekao sam mu da ga može dobiti.
This is so hard.	Ovo je tako teško.
You should talk to him about it.	Morao bi razgovarati s njim o tome.
I didn't want to leave.	Nisam želio otići.
Something she knew she had to do.	Nešto što je znala da treba da uradi.
I was sorry.	Bilo mi je žao.
I do it to myself.	Ja to radim sebi.
He just doesn’t look good.	On jednostavno ne izgleda dobro.
He was still safe.	I dalje je bio siguran.
You have to be your own.	Moraš biti svoj.
He simply meant what he said.	On je jednostavno mislio ono što je rekao.
He said that.	On je to rekao.
He wanted nothing for himself.	Nije želio ništa za sebe.
That's not a good reason.	To nije dobar razlog.
Not good, but better.	Ne dobro, ali bolje.
But this was easy.	Ali ovo je bilo lako.
Not that it will always help.	Nije da će uvijek pomoći.
He is talking about himself.	On govori o sebi.
And maybe there were a few.	A možda ih je nekoliko i bilo.
That will .	To će .
He loved them both.	Voleo ih je oboje.
He must have known that.	On je to sigurno znao.
We can do it together.	Možemo to zajedno.
Nobody knew anything and nobody knew.	Niko ništa i niko nije znao.
You have me.	Imaš me.
I don't see, but good.	Ne vidim, ali dobro.
He immediately saw that it was bad.	Odmah je vidio da je loše.
He wanted everything.	Želeo je sve.
I've heard it all before.	Čuo sam sve ranije.
They needed us.	Trebali su nas.
Or maybe.	Ili možda.
That's a lot.	To je mnogo.
He didn't tell me.	Nije mi rekao.
We were there for a long time.	Bili smo tamo dugo vremena.
I'll tell you when.	Reći ću kada.
I'll give it to you.	Ja ću to dati.
How bad can it be? 	Koliko loše može biti?
He even started dinner.	Čak je počeo i večeru.
I think we all have.	Mislim da svi imamo.
But it's not safe there either.	Ali ni tamo nije sigurno.
Yes, it was good.	Da, bilo je dobro.
But that's not the real reason.	Ali to nije pravi razlog.
Maybe not.	Možda i nisu.
Maybe they didn't have time for that.	Možda nisu imali vremena za to.
Maybe he's gone.	Možda ga nema.
I'll find a way.	Naći ću način.
And the money is good.	A i novac je dobar.
Yes, he is all that.	Da, on je sve to.
Not everyone is like you.	Nisu svi kao ti.
Very few people know that.	Vrlo malo ljudi to zna.
I don't see exactly how to do this.	Ne vidim tačno kako da ovo uradim.
Few people know that.	Malo ljudi to zna.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
We can't do this.	Ne možemo ovo da uradimo.
So far so good.	Za sada je sve u redu.
We know who he works for.	Znamo za koga radi.
But not in this way.	Ali ne na ovaj način.
I still think so.	I dalje mislim tako.
I'm not sure.	Nisam baš siguran.
I really love my job.	Ja zaista volim svoj posao.
I didn't have time to say anything.	Nisam imao vremena ništa reći.
And we know it.	I mi to znamo.
And he said he could hardly believe it.	I rekao je da teško može vjerovati.
How can we do this.	Kako možemo ovo da uradimo.
Almost all people.	Skoro svi ljudi.
You can't say no.	Ne možete reći ne.
I think few of us do that at the moment.	Mislim da to trenutno malo nas čini.
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
Even if he asked me to.	Čak i kad bi me zamolio.
Right here and now.	Upravo ovdje i sada.
People are .	Ljudi su .
Without you there is no us.	Bez tebe nema nas.
We did not have.	Nismo imali.
So far, everything has been work.	Do sada je sve bilo posao.
What do you think about that?	Šta mislite o tome?
And you don't do that.	A ti to ne radiš.
Like, really really.	Kao, stvarno stvarno.
Something only she can see.	Nešto samo ona može vidjeti.
In what, he did not know.	U šta, nije znao.
I never go there.	Nikad ne idem tamo.
Not anymore.	Nije više.
I have it all.	Imam sve to.
I bought something for myself.	Kupio sam nešto za sebe.
I shouldn't be happy.	Ne bih trebao biti sretan.
It was so bad.	Bilo je tako loše.
That was the case until last month.	Tako je bilo do prošlog mjeseca.
You can't do it all right.	Ne možeš to sve kako treba.
Maybe he won't do it now.	Možda to sada neće učiniti.
You don't need money.	Ne treba ti novac.
But that was it.	Ali, to je bilo to.
But now he has no idea.	Ali sada nema pojma.
If not, that would be fine too.	Ako ne, i to bi bilo u redu.
They never knew about it.	Nikada nisu znali za to.
Tell me what you think about it.	Reci mi šta misliš o tome.
It can be helpful.	Može biti od pomoći.
And we've all done it.	I svi smo to uradili.
It seemed like the right way to go.	Činilo se da je to pravi put.
I thought there had to be more.	Mislio sam da mora biti još toga.
It's just like now.	Baš je kao sada.
I don't want you to work.	Ne želim da radiš.
The way it works.	Način na koji radi.
And I'm really sorry for you.	I zaista mi te je žao.
He was actually right.	Zapravo je bio u pravu.
He wanted to live that long.	Želeo je da živi toliko dugo.
But that almost didn't happen.	Ali to se skoro nije dogodilo.
It will always be there.	Uvek će biti tu.
He really likes that stuff.	On zaista voli te stvari.
She won't come.	Ona neće doći.
I couldn't do it anymore.	Nisam mogao više.
I need more.	Treba mi više.
He did really badly of you.	Zaista je loše uradio od tebe.
He never did these things.	Nikad nije radio ove stvari.
You're the one who did this.	Ti si taj koji je ovo uradio.
They just don't know why.	Samo ne znaju zašto.
She wanted, she wanted.	Htela je, htela je.
He lost his job.	Izgubio je posao.
I'll tell you something you don't know.	Reći ću ti nešto što ne znaš.
He didn't have to work tomorrow.	Nije morao da radi sutra.
I never told anyone that.	Nikad to nikome nisam rekao.
It's always like that.	Tako je uvek.
He wants to be with you.	On želi da bude sa tobom.
It's hard, it really is.	Teško je, zaista jeste.
They know what it's about.	Oni znaju o čemu se radi.
I see a lot.	Vidim mnogo.
It's pretty easy to leave.	Prilično je lako otići.
I can't say anything now.	Ne mogu ništa reći sada.
He didn't want what he had.	Ono što je imao nije želeo.
He doesn't want to be good.	On ne želi da bude dobar.
It can't be that good.	Ne može biti tako dobro.
I know it doesn't work.	Znam da ne radi.
That was a good job.	To je bio dobar posao.
Nobody knew anything.	Niko ništa nije znao.
Being here and now.	Biti ovdje i sada.
You won't talk to me.	Nećeš razgovarati sa mnom.
It doesn't have to be this way.	Ovo ne mora biti tako.
Very bad, actually.	Veoma loše, u stvari.
I didn't think he would.	Nisam mislio da hoće.
Probably more than me.	Vjerovatno više od mene.
She wanted to do everything.	Htela je da uradi sve.
They will never believe me.	Nikad mi neće vjerovati.
But here's the problem.	Ali ovdje je problem.
It's a job.	To je posao.
It works fine now.	Sada radi dobro.
Life was what you made it.	Život je bio ono što si ti napravio.
You can still come back.	Još uvijek se možeš vratiti.
What did you have to say?	Šta si imao da kažeš.
But that's not what he wants.	Ali to nije ono što on želi.
You have to work at it.	Morate raditi na tome.
I wouldn't, I couldn't.	Ja to ne bih, ne bih mogao.
It may not be what you think it is.	Možda nije ono što mislite da jeste.
Nice to see you again.	Drago mi je da vas ponovo vidim.
He tells us almost nothing.	Ne govori nam skoro ništa.
And who knows how old he is.	I ko zna koliko ima godina.
Or don't, usually.	Ili nemoj, obično.
You don't want us to know about him.	Ne želite da znamo za njega.
And they were only the first.	A oni su bili samo prvi.
I hope you will help!.	Nadam se da ćete pomoći!.
It was like coming home.	Bilo je kao da sam se vratio kući.
Good to see you again, man.	Drago mi je da te ponovo vidim, ovaj.
You should not do what you do.	Ne bi trebalo da radiš ono što radiš.
This is more than we had.	Ovo je više nego što smo imali.
We never would.	Ne bismo nikada.
He could live again.	Mogao bi ponovo da živi.
He almost didn't leave.	On je samo što nije otišao.
He was my father.	On je bio moj otac.
Like yesterday.	Kao juče.
How it happened.	Kako se to dogodilo.
She lives there.	Ona živi tamo.
I don't know if you can tell.	Ne znam da li možete reći.
Now we know.	Sada znamo.
He would like to know who the father is.	Želeo bi da zna ko je otac.
And they know about me.	I znaju za mene.
So far this has taken some work.	Do sada je za ovo trebalo malo raditi.
But this is not the way.	Ali ovo nije način.
There is nothing more to do.	Nema više šta da se uradi.
I asked him how long.	Pitao sam ga koliko dugo.
We don't know who they are.	Ne znamo ko su oni.
Yes, it would be.	Da, bilo bi.
Maybe it's true.	Možda je istina.
But they shouldn't be so sure.	Ali ne bi trebali biti tako sigurni.
I didn't expect it.	Nisam očekivao.
And it should be.	I trebalo bi da bude.
I just didn’t buy it.	Jednostavno ga nisam kupio.
I had no idea this could happen.	Nisam imao pojma da se ovo može dogoditi.
And it seems likely that it will.	I čini se vjerovatno da hoće.
I really mean it.	Zaista to mislim.
Yes, it was difficult.	Da, bilo je teško.
I usually work alone.	Obično radim sam.
He did it for us.	On je to uradio za nas.
Maybe it was just a story.	Možda je to bila samo priča.
Yes, that must be it.	Da, to mora da je to.
There must be time.	Mora da ima vremena.
He's gone too far.	Previše je otišao.
And it can be.	I može biti.
He drives a little more.	On vozi malo više.
He doesn't have a job.	On nema posao.
You are a person.	Vi ste osoba.
He loves you but .	On te voli ali .
I'm just doing my job.	Ja samo radim svoj posao.
That's always been my problem.	To je uvek bio moj problem.
I know what he means.	Znam šta on misli.
Where could this be, he wondered.	Gdje ovo može biti, pitao se.
I better not know.	Bolje da ne znam.
That was not the question.	To nije bilo pitanje.
You're not for me.	Za mene nisi.
In fact, a lot of it was still there.	U stvari, dosta toga je još uvijek bilo.
That's my idea, too.	To je i moja ideja.
That's bad for business.	To je loše za posao.
I have no idea.	Nemam pojma.
That's what's wrong.	To je ono što nije u redu.
That would never happen.	To se nikada ne bi dogodilo.
And that's exactly what you did.	I upravo ste to uradili.
I'm not sure what this is about.	Nisam siguran o čemu se radi.
They were always there.	Uvek su bili tu.
I had to do everything by myself.	Morao sam sve da radim sam.
He will most likely never see him again.	Vrlo vjerovatno ga nikada više neće vidjeti.
They are there and that is enough.	Oni su tu i to je dovoljno.
It could be just that.	To bi moglo biti upravo to.
We all know them.	Svi ih znamo.
But the real job won't come right away.	Ali pravi posao neće doći odmah.
There are few people.	Malo je ljudi.
On the right track.	Na pravi put.
I've never seen that before.	Nikada ranije to nisam vidio.
When it’s good, it’s really good.	Kad je dobro, zaista je dobro.
Until now.	Sve do sada.
It happened the day before.	To se dogodilo dan ranije.
I wanted it back.	Htio sam to vratiti.
We have to do better.	Moramo biti bolji.
I knew nothing about being a father.	Nisam znao ništa o tome da budem otac.
Maybe we still are.	Možda smo još uvijek.
And she will do it.	I ona će to učiniti.
I'm glad you're with us.	Drago mi je da si sa nama.
I also wonder how it will be.	Pitam se i kako će to biti.
All good enough.	Sve dovoljno dobro.
That's all we need to know.	To je sve što treba da znamo.
I would really love to see that.	Zaista bih to volio vidjeti.
But it wasn't.	Ali nije to bilo.
Everything is going as it should.	Sve ide kako treba.
It might even help you.	Možda ti čak i pomogne.
You can move on.	Možeš dalje.
You and I can talk.	Ti i ja možemo razgovarati.
I have to find her.	Moram je naći.
Maybe it was true that there was nothing to do.	Možda je bila istina da nije bilo šta da se radi.
It's simple enough.	Dovoljno je jednostavno.
I couldn't tell him anything more.	Nisam mu mogao reći ništa više.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
I really didn't.	Zaista nisam.
I like everything.	Sviđa mi se sve.
I hope to tomorrow.	Nadam se da ću sutra.
She will have to be for him.	Ona će morati da bude za njega.
I'm going there now.	Idem tamo sada.
But he knew, he knew.	Ali znao je, znao je.
Yes, a real car.	Da, pravi auto.
He was ready for it.	Bio je spreman za to.
If someone doesn't like me, fine.	Ako me neko ne voli, dobro.
Maybe he doesn't think so.	Možda on ne misli tako.
Which was this morning.	Što je bilo jutros.
But actually, pretty good.	Ali zapravo, prilično dobro.
He brought me back to life.	Vratio me je u život.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Nisam siguran šta se dešava.
I know what the truth is.	Znam šta je istina.
Except he still had to know.	Osim što je još morao znati.
He is here to tell the truth.	Ovdje je da govori istinu.
Maybe he doesn't know.	Možda ne zna.
In fact, it's easy.	U stvari, lako je.
If you think it will help, you can go.	Ako mislite da će pomoći, možete ići.
He could see it in any way.	Mogao je to vidjeti na bilo koji način.
Maybe just that.	Možda samo to.
And you never will.	I nikad nećeš.
He bought it.	On ga je kupio.
She knew he shouldn't.	Znala je da ne bi trebao.
He loves his job.	On voli svoj posao.
Yes, you too.	Da i ti.
I just didn't do anything.	Samo ništa nisam uradio.
But just to see.	Ali samo da vidim.
That's how it's known.	Tako se zna.
We simply cannot do anything.	Ne možemo jednostavno ništa.
So we still don't know what it is.	Tako da još uvijek ne znamo o čemu se radi.
Indeed, it is.	Zaista, jeste.
It could have been what he did last night.	Moglo je biti ono što je uradio sinoć.
I don’t see how he could do that.	Ne vidim kako bi to moglo učiniti.
It's true.	To je tačno.
He loves you very much.	On te mnogo voli.
What would you say.	Šta bi rekao.
I no longer needed what they could give me.	Nije mi više trebalo ono što su mi mogli dati.
This can't be real.	Ovo ne može biti stvarno.
Nothing nothing .	Ništa ništa .
I hope you will allow it.	Nadam se da ćeš dozvoliti.
This actually happened to me.	Ovo mi se zapravo dogodilo.
No, that would never happen.	Ne, to se nikada ne bi dogodilo.
The team works here.	Tim ovdje radi.
I can't be with you.	Ne mogu biti s tobom.
I wish it wasn't.	Voleo bih da nije.
She really was something.	Ona je zaista bila nešto.
Not even alone.	Čak ni sam.
You can too.	Možeš i ti.
You must know something.	Mora da znaš nešto.
I just loved them.	Jednostavno sam ih volio.
He never said anything.	Nikad ništa nije rekao.
I didn't expect that.	Nisam to očekivao.
We are all human.	Svi smo mi ljudi.
But he also told me something difficult.	Ali rekao mi je i nešto teško.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda nije.
Maybe we can help him.	Možda mu možemo pomoći.
I mean everything.	Mislim na sve.
You can go home now.	Možete ići kući sada.
Like you're not here.	Kao da nisi ovde.
I can't be with you in any way.	Ne mogu s tobom ni na koji način.
He obviously didn't do anything wrong.	Očigledno nije uradio ništa loše.
Maybe that's a better way.	Možda je to bolji način.
Yes, something is wrong.	Da, nešto nije u redu.
That's what she tells him.	Tako mu ona kaže.
I said that.	Rekao sam to.
This he can never do here.	Ovo on nikada ne može učiniti ovdje.
No problem from anyone.	Nema problema od bilo koga.
It's simple.	To je jednostavno.
I'm not sure of myself.	Nisam siguran u sebe.
You can find it there.	To možete naći tamo.
Even if they didn't before, they know now.	Čak i ako ranije nisu, sada znaju.
I think we both know.	Mislim da oboje znamo.
But that's not a good idea either.	Ali ni to nije dobra ideja.
He couldn't do it anymore.	Više nije mogao.
I don't want to be without you.	Ne želim da budem bez tebe.
It may or may not exist.	Može, a možda i ne postoji.
That really should be enough.	To bi zaista trebalo biti dovoljno.
Yes.	Da.
I have one with me.	Imam jedan kod sebe.
I want you to do this.	Želim da uradiš ovo.
Maybe he meant it.	Možda je mislio.
I thought it was just a story.	Mislio sam da je to samo priča.
Not really, but maybe he is.	Ne baš, ali možda i on.
I have a real problem with that.	Imam pravi problem sa tim.
No one seemed to.	Činilo se da niko nije.
That was for him.	To je bilo za njega.
You are never sure.	Nikad nisi siguran.
We have to get them back.	Moramo ih vratiti.
Not without you.	Ne bez tebe.
He likes to play.	Voli da se igra.
You can’t do everything, but you can do something.	Ne možete učiniti sve, ali možete učiniti nešto.
I didn't have.	Nisam imao.
Little did they know that he would help so much.	Nisu znali da će on toliko pomoći.
Now and here.	Sada i ovdje.
Behind me.	I za mene.
He had so much money.	Imao je toliko novca.
You had to do it that way.	Morao si to uraditi na taj način.
We are all human.	Svi smo mi ljudi.
He went and went.	Otišao je i otišao.
Which is completely true.	Što je potpuno tačno.
That's what we're going to do.	To je ono što ćemo uraditi.
And the first.	I prvi.
She's not going either.	Ni ona ne ide.
He is here this morning.	On je ovde jutros.
I just know you are.	Jednostavno znam da jesi.
Maybe he couldn't say anything.	Možda nije mogao ništa da kaže.
Not to that.	Ne na to.
Maybe more.	Možda i više.
But without money they can't do that.	Ali bez novca oni to ne mogu.
What can anyone say.	Šta neko može reći.
He said he would.	Rekao je da bi.
At that time it was.	U to vrijeme jeste.
That's all you need to know for now.	To je sve što treba da znate za sada.
He says he's busy.	Kaže da je zauzet.
I hope no one ever finds them.	Nadam se da ih niko nikada neće naći.
Just like that, he asked for more money.	Samo tako, tražio je još novca.
You were really, really good.	Bio si stvarno, stvarno dobar.
Indeed, he thought he was.	Zaista, mislio je da jeste.
When he wants.	Kad hoće.
But he is also my friend.	Ali on je i moj prijatelj.
I go to work.	idem na posao.
Probably unlikely.	Verovatno malo verovatno.
We are alone here.	Ovde smo sami.
He wants to know what you did.	Želi da zna šta si uradio.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda i nije.
Often they are not.	Često nisu.
I think I see the real problem now.	Mislim da sada vidim pravi problem.
Or even unlikely.	Ili čak malo vjerovatno.
It didn't take long.	Nije dugo trebalo.
But it seems not.	Ali izgleda da nije.
We had these.	Imali smo ove.
Tell me what you like and what you don't.	Reci mi šta ti se sviđa, a šta ne.
Something seems to be wrong.	Čini se da nešto nije u redu.
You have to trust me.	Moraš mi vjerovati.
The question is as follows.	Pitanje je sljedeće.
You are much better.	Mnogo ti je bolje.
We all know you.	Svi te znamo.
I just know it is.	Samo znam da jeste.
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
It started last year.	Počeo je prošle godine.
You must have done well.	Mora da si dobro uradio.
If that's what you want, that's what you'll get.	Ako je to ono što želite, to ćete i dobiti.
This is not.	Ovo nije.
And you can never tell anyone that.	I to nikada nikome ne možete reći.
It usually was.	Obično je bilo.
He didn't know, he wasn't sure.	Nije znao, nije bio siguran.
We would all know that it is only momentary.	Svi bismo znali da je to samo trenutno.
Nobody even tries.	Niko ni ne pokušava.
And it wasn't much.	I nije bilo mnogo.
He's just a friend.	On je samo prijatelj.
But it should not have been done.	Ali to nije trebalo učiniti.
Either you can or you can't.	Ili možeš ili ne možeš.
But there was always too much of me.	Ali uvek me je bilo previše.
They did well.	Dobro su uradili.
You know a little.	Znaš malo.
And one more.	I još jedan dalje.
There was no one to help me.	Nije bilo nikoga da mi pomogne.
It all happened fast.	Sve se dogodilo brzo.
It wasn't much for me.	Za mene to nije bilo mnogo.
Yes, that's it, that's right.	Da, to je to, tačno.
We are not allowed to do this.	Ovo nam nije dozvoljeno.
I did not know that.	Nisam to znao.
And further.	I dalje.
I just didn't know about him.	Samo nisam znao za njega.
That is not happening.	To se ne dešava.
If he could, he could do anything.	Ako je to mogao, može sve.
In addition, you can get help.	Osim toga, možete dobiti pomoć.
I always wondered that.	Uvek sam se to pitao.
I have a question for you.	Imam pitanje za tebe.
This seems to be fine.	Čini se da je ovo u redu.
This one wasn't.	Ovaj nije bio.
This is no longer my life.	Ovo više nije moj život.
Certainly not.	Sigurno nije.
I want to see everything.	Želim da vidim sve.
No one thought it would ever happen, but it did.	Niko nije mislio da će se to ikada dogoditi, ali jeste.
I mean, it can't be both.	Mislim, ne može biti oboje.
He wanted it again.	Želio je to ponovo.
She must have known that.	Sigurno je to znala.
He didn't say that.	On to nije rekao.
I need to know these things to do my job.	Moram znati ove stvari da bih radio svoj posao.
He won't come back.	Neće se više vratiti.
This was fine with me.	Ovo mi je bilo u redu.
See what you think.	Vidi šta misliš.
I was really surprised as.	Bio sam stvarno iznenađen kao.
I have to give something.	Moram nešto dati.
You didn't ask for this.	Nisi tražio ovo.
I really like it.	Stvarno mi se sviđa.
Or say the right thing and it would be.	Ili reci pravu stvar i bilo bi.
Only you will know what it is.	Samo ćete vi znati šta je to.
That's all for today.	To je sve za danas.
Nothing is happening.	Ništa se ne dešava.
We never had any problems.	Nikada nismo imali problema.
I couldn't say anything.	Nisam mogao ništa da kažem.
I never thought it would be so hard.	Nikad nisam mislio da će biti tako teško.
It was easy.	Bilo je to lako.
But it still doesn't work.	Ali još uvijek ne radi.
But that was probably all he would get.	Ali to je vjerovatno bilo sve što će dobiti.
In the House.	U kući.
I just don't see how.	Samo ne vidim kako.
What they had was time.	Ono što su imali bilo je vrijeme.
She has to be with me.	Ona mora biti sa mnom.
But no one did.	Ali niko to nije uradio.
She knew he would do something.	Znala je da će on nešto učiniti.
And there he was.	I tamo je bio.
But here she didn't know who to go with.	Ali ovdje nije znala s kim ići.
Or even some of that.	Ili čak nešto od toga.
So you can do it all.	Tako da možeš sve to.
Can you believe it.	Možeš li vjerovati.
I wanted so much.	Toliko sam želio.
Nothing so obvious.	Ništa tako očigledno.
It was just hard.	Samo je bilo teško.
Maybe I would.	Možda sam bi.
But I'm not sure how to do it.	Ali nisam siguran kako to učiniti.
It tells us how and who.	Govori nam kako i ko.
No one is safe.	Niko nije siguran.
Maybe you know too.	Možda i ti znaš.
And that was true enough.	I to je bilo dovoljno tačno.
I have them.	Imam ih.
They don't know we have it.	Oni ne znaju da ga imamo.
It exists with .	Postoji sa .
There was so much to live for.	Bilo je za toliko toga da se živi.
Why this is so, no one knows exactly.	Zašto je to tako, niko tačno ne zna.
It would be hard to go back now.	Sada bi se bilo teško vratiti.
There is still something wrong.	Još uvijek nešto nije u redu.
And she with me.	I ona sa mnom.
Yes, indeed.	Da, zaista.
It is time.	Vrijeme je.
In fact, there are more.	U stvari, ima više.
He didn't even see it.	Nije ni vidio.
I'm going to see him.	Idem da ga vidim.
I wonder what he's thinking.	Pitam se šta on misli.
I am the man of the house.	Ja sam čovjek u kući.
That's what she's for.	Za to je ona.
That should be enough for you.	To bi trebalo da bude dovoljno za tebe.
The truth often works.	Istina često radi.
Yes, that's exactly what I did.	Da, upravo sam to uradio.
You have to go.	Moraš otići.
He understood that.	On je to shvatio.
Nobody asked him.	Niko ga nije pitao.
That's what you'll get.	To je ono što ćeš dobiti.
I wasn't there.	Nisam bio tamo.
Not like before.	Ne kao nekada.
I tried to talk.	Pokušao sam razgovarati.
He wasn't really.	Nije baš bio.
Just question.	Samo pitanje.
Who doesn't have time.	Ko nema vremena.
All right.	Sve u redu.
He just wasn't sure how she really felt.	Samo nije bio siguran kako se ona zaista osjeća.
We needed him.	Trebao nam je.
But not in the way you think.	Ali ne na način na koji mislite.
I decided.	Odlučio sam.
You didn't come.	Nisi došao.
But there was nothing.	Ali nije bilo ništa.
It comes when it comes.	Dođe kad dođe.
But it's really easy.	Ali to je zaista lako.
But it's not because of you.	Ali to nije zbog tebe.
I went back to that.	Vratio sam se tome.
I ended up very strong.	Završio sam jako.
It didn't seem to be.	Činilo se da nije.
Maybe that's what it's all about.	Možda je to ono o čemu se radi.
Or do anything.	Ili uradi bilo šta.
The more people know about it.	Što više ljudi zna o tome.
I was happy!.	Bio sam sretan!.
Now we know why.	Sada znamo zašto.
But he could not be found here.	Ali on se ovdje nije mogao naći.
I'm doing a job.	Radim posao.
What do you think.	Šta ti misliš.
That's all it took.	To je sve što je trebalo.
You're doing well, well.	Radiš dobro, dobro.
But you don't know.	Ali ne znaš.
He wouldn't be here long enough.	Ne bi bio ovde dovoljno dugo.
What to do when you don't know what to do.	Šta da radite kada ne znate šta da radite.
And obviously this is.	I očigledno je ovo.
I already told you that.	Već sam ti to rekao.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
It happened so fast.	To se dogodilo tako brzo.
She's already said too much.	Već je rekla previše.
Maybe this meeting wouldn’t be so bad.	Možda ovaj sastanak ne bi bio tako loš.
My problem still doesn't work.	Moj problem i dalje ne radi.
Say you will.	Reci da hoćeš.
It was a good question.	Bilo je to dobro pitanje.
I wonder what's wrong.	Pitam se šta nije u redu.
They are there.	Oni su tamo.
But it may not be that difficult here.	Ali ovdje možda i nije tako teško.
Maybe that will be enough.	Možda će to biti dovoljno.
But in fact, that is not true.	Ali zapravo, to nije tačno.
I'm not surprised one bit.	Nisam iznenađen ni malo.
You'd be better off.	Bolje bi ti bilo.
I really like it.	Jako mi se sviđa.
That's all, really.	To je sve, zaista.
I can't seem to do that.	Čini se da to ne mogu učiniti.
He probably never could.	Vjerovatno nikad ne bi mogao.
It will do.	To će učiniti.
I've seen a lot of them in that.	Vidio sam ih u tome dosta.
Always, for everyone.	Uvek, za sve.
I'm still not sure it's good.	Još uvek nisam siguran da je dobro.
It would take you a while.	Trebalo bi ti neko vrijeme.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisam mogao vjerovati.
But it doesn't have to be that way.	Ali to ne mora biti tako.
Like she knew she didn't want to.	Kao što je znala da to ne želi.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
You already told me that.	Već si mi to rekao.
It's not my thing anymore.	To više nije moja stvar.
He can be his own.	On može biti svoj.
I like that .	Sviđa mi se to .
They were there.	Bili su tamo.
I mean bad.	Mislim loše.
But that is really not the case.	Ali to zaista nije tako.
But we needed more than that.	Ali trebalo nam je više od toga.
It could have been anything.	Mogao je biti bilo šta.
For the first time, we are doing the job properly.	Prvi put radimo posao kako treba.
They're all we've ever had.	Oni su sve što smo ikada imali.
Tonight he knew.	Večeras je znao.
She knew better now.	Sada je znala bolje.
Looks good.	Izgleda dobro.
I'm sorry I didn't want to.	Žao mi je što nisam želeo.
Just for one day.	Samo na jedan dan.
I don't want to say much.	Ne želim puno reći.
I could have won.	Mogao sam pobijediti.
Real work.	Pravi posao.
He never admitted.	Nikad nije priznao.
I want to talk to you about it.	Želim razgovarati s tobom o tome.
But if he wants to, that's fine.	Ali ako želi, u redu je.
it will do.	to će učiniti.
That's one.	To je jedan.
That's all of them.	To su svi oni.
He said he wanted to talk to me.	Rekao je da želi razgovarati sa mnom.
It was tomorrow.	Bila je sutra.
No no, no yes.	Ne ne, ne da.
He can beat you.	Može te pobijediti.
And everything will be better.	I sve će biti bolje.
No, he couldn't.	Ne, nije mogao.
Not what we said.	Nije ono što smo rekli.
I want much more.	Želim mnogo više.
But not before.	Ali ne prije.
He didn't want anything.	Nije htio ništa.
But there is more, much more.	Ali ima još, mnogo više.
I'm the only one here.	Ja sam jedini ovdje.
No one asked them.	Niko ih nije pitao.
I think he's better than that.	Mislim da je bolji od toga.
Something was wrong.	Nešto nije bilo u redu.
As well as.	Kao i .
I understood completely.	Shvatio sam potpuno.
I thought he did a good job.	Mislio sam da je uradio dobar posao.
Just you and me.	Samo ti i ja.
With you there.	Sa tobom tamo.
It can't.	To ne može.
Just like my life.	Baš kao i moj život.
And there were many of them.	A bilo ih je mnogo.
That's how he wanted it.	Tako je on to želio.
You should come see it.	Trebao bi doći vidjeti.
Everything you need to know.	Sve što treba da znaš.
Not much is known about it.	O tome se ne zna mnogo.
That would be the day he said enough.	To bi bio dan kada bi rekao dovoljno.
He is one of us.	On je jedan od nas.
You didn't know.	Nisi znao.
They were too many.	Bili su previše.
You just need a little, not a lot.	Treba vam samo malo, a ne puno.
And he could get that too.	A i on bi to mogao dobiti.
She is right.	U pravu je.
And he was there.	I on je bio tamo.
Not from us.	Ne od nas.
He was, but he didn't think he looked like that.	Bio je, ali nije mislio da izgleda tako.
He hasn't seen her yet.	Još je nije vidio.
Maybe it is.	Možda jeste.
It's pretty simple.	Prilično je jednostavno.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
And if anyone else has a problem with that.	I ako još neko ima problem sa tim.
We know them.	Znamo ih.
You need someone there to tell you that.	Treba ti neko tamo da ti to kaže.
Yes, it's true.	Da, to je istina.
I think we'll go home now.	Mislim da ćemo sada ići kući.
He's not doing anything now.	Sada ništa ne radi.
That's what they did to themselves.	To su sebi uradili.
I hope that will be enough.	Nadam se da će to biti dovoljno.
But she loves me, she is not like my father.	Ali ona me voli, nije kao moj otac.
Now it's gone.	Sada ga nema.
Or maybe it was just him.	Ili je to možda bio samo on.
He arrived on time.	Stigao je na vrijeme.
And he would know, all right.	I on bi znao, u redu.
Yes, little.	Da, malo.
It wasn't good for business.	Nije bilo dobro za posao.
You will never see us again.	Nikada nas više nećeš vidjeti.
It couldn't go on.	Nije moglo dalje.
This is still a good deal.	Ovo je još uvijek dobar posao.
And there you are.	I tu si.
I'm still not sure how.	Još nisam siguran kako.
As if so.	Kao da je tako.
Or you could stay in the house.	Ili biste mogli ostati u kući.
That's how it should be.	Tako treba da bude.
I was tired of it.	Bio sam umoran od toga.
Now it's true.	Sada je istina.
It really couldn't happen.	To se zaista nije moglo dogoditi.
Nobody did anything.	Niko ništa nije uradio.
I do not think.	Ne mislim.
My father was not surprised at all.	Moj otac uopšte nije bio iznenađen.
I can't talk to anyone.	Ne mogu razgovarati ni sa kim.
It may seem small.	Možda izgleda malo.
The more who works, the better.	Što više ko radi, to bolje.
He really was.	On je zaista bio.
It never does anything.	Nikad ništa ne radi.
If you were the one.	Da si ti bio taj.
But we are here together.	Ali mi smo ovde zajedno.
But this is not happening.	Ali ovo se ne dešava.
And maybe they won't.	A možda i neće.
Father has to go.	Otac mora da ide.
He was fine.	Bio je dobro.
Maybe it doesn't have to be that way.	Možda to ne mora biti tako.
They are safe with him.	Sa njim su sigurni.
And at that time it was.	I u to vrijeme je bilo.
She says that's not the point.	Ona kaže da to nije stvar.
It's not that they're not there.	Nije da nisu tamo.
We're working now.	Sada radimo.
It will always be so.	Tako će uvijek biti.
It was all real.	Sve je to bilo stvarno.
I wanted to do it for so long.	Želeo sam to da uradim tako dugo.
Let's see what we can do.	Da vidim šta možemo da uradimo.
Maybe he didn't have it.	Možda ga nije imao.
I didn't say anything either.	Ni ja nisam rekao ništa.
Something happened back home.	Nešto se dogodilo kući.
No one asked who they were with.	Niko nije pitao s kim su.
It took me a long time to say that.	Trebalo mi je dosta vremena da to kažem.
It always comes.	Uvek dođe.
It couldn't be done.	To se nije moglo uraditi.
He didn't need to know, he told himself.	Nije morao da zna, rekao je sebi.
There really aren't many at all.	Zaista ih uopšte nije mnogo.
You got it.	Imaš ga.
I am here.	Ja sam ovde.
She told me that today.	Rekla mi je to danas.
Is that enough.	Da li je dovoljno.
He said they didn't.	Rekao je da nisu.
To be sure.	Da budem siguran.
I love this team.	Volim ovaj tim.
I love you all very much.	Sve vas mnogo volim.
It can't be okay.	Ne može biti u redu.
And that's exactly what he did.	I upravo je to uradio.
People can go much further today.	Ljudi to danas mogu mnogo dalje.
There is something in that.	Ima nešto u tome.
But they will do it.	Ali oni će to učiniti.
Maybe a little.	Možda malo.
And that is true.	I to je tačno.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
That won't happen to us.	To se nama neće dogoditi.
The problem is it doesn't work.	Problem je što ne radi.
That's not everyone.	To nisu svi.
This will not be true.	Ovo neće biti tačno.
But she was there.	Ali tamo je bila.
Yes, you can do it yourself.	Da, možete to učiniti sami.
I shouldn't know all this.	Ne bi trebalo da znam sve ovo.
You look like you need it.	Izgledaš kao da ti treba.
What was better today than yesterday.	Šta je bilo bolje danas nego juče.
Nobody can see anything.	Niko ne može ništa da vidi.
I wouldn't have heard of it.	Ne bih čuo za to.
We will find a way.	Naći ćemo način.
Yesterday and today and tomorrow.	Jučer i danas i sutra.
I know that's true.	Znam da je to istina.
We have everything you need right here.	Imamo sve što vam treba upravo ovdje.
He's still here.	On je još uvijek ovdje.
I do not see.	Ne vidim.
But now you're doing it.	Ali sada to radiš.
It's very fast.	Vrlo je brzo.
Very bad for you.	Veoma loše za tebe.
They will believe me.	Oni će mi vjerovati.
That was until he saw her.	Tako je bilo sve dok je nije vidio.
Maybe that was too obvious.	Možda je to bilo previše očigledno.
That's a lot.	To je puno toga.
That's exactly what they were.	To su upravo oni bili.
It's not that hard.	Nije tako teško.
He has to.	Mora .
He didn't have time for this.	Nije imao vremena za ovo.
I hope to be back soon.	Nadam se da ću se uskoro vratiti.
She wants a new life.	Ona želi novi život.
I'm more than glad.	Više mi je nego drago.
We all have to move on.	Svi moramo ići dalje.
No one seemed to want to do anything.	Činilo se da niko ne želi ništa da uradi.
I'm not very good with it even now.	Nisam baš dobar sa tim čak ni sada.
This is a really good thing.	Ovo je stvarno dobra stvar.
I could see it.	Mogao sam to vidjeti.
It's not the first time.	Nije tako prvi put.
There should be more.	Trebalo bi da je bude više.
I guess there's a little in it.	Pretpostavljam da ima malo u tome.
I've never seen him before.	Nikad ga ranije nisam video.
He didn't hear anything.	Nije čuo ništa.
He always has to say it.	On to uvek mora da kaže.
I heard about it.	Čuo sam za to.
You definitely have to trust him.	Sigurno mu moraš vjerovati.
She usually was.	Obično je bila.
You always are.	Uvijek jesi.
I do what you tell me.	Radim ono što mi kažeš.
If it is not good, you can return things.	Ako nije dobro, možete vratiti stvari.
And, as you know, you can do it.	I, kao što znate, to možete učiniti.
It’s so simple and so simple.	To je tako jednostavno i tako jednostavno.
No, I actually love them.	Ne, zapravo ih volim.
She didn't even know why she was here.	Nije ni znala zašto je ovdje.
He loves them too much.	Previše ih voli.
We work here often.	Često radimo ovdje.
I mean, maybe it's not what it used to be.	Mislim, možda više nije ono što je nekada bio.
Maybe they don't know anything better.	Možda ne znaju ništa bolje.
I had nothing to say.	Nisam imao šta da kažem.
Not now, maybe never again.	Ne sada, možda nikad više.
I am your father.	Ja sam tvoj otac.
That will be too much.	To će biti previše.
But now it's time for me to go.	Ali sada je vrijeme da idem.
Yes, you can do that.	Da, možete i to.
Everything will come in handy.	Sve će ti dobro doći.
He told him.	Rekao mu je.
I'm glad he's here.	Drago mi je da je ovdje.
That says a lot.	To mnogo govori.
Nothing for me.	Za mene ništa.
I'm not sure why that would be.	Nisam siguran zašto bi to bilo.
No, he never loved me.	Ne, nikad me nije volio.
Not if they had anything on it.	Ne ako su oni imali nešto o tome.
I decided that was enough.	Odlučio sam da je dosta.
Not you.	Ne i ti.
And this time it will be so.	I ovaj put će biti tako.
And it should exist.	I trebalo bi da postoji.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Nisam siguran kako da to uradim.
I ask if everything is okay.	Pitam da li je sve u redu.
I just can't be happy.	Jednostavno ne mogu biti sretan.
No, maybe more.	Ne, možda više.
It’s a story about why.	To je priča o tome zašto.
This is going well.	Ovo ide dobro.
It's not easy to get.	Nije lako dobiti.
It was because of me.	To je bilo zbog mene.
Neither is she.	Nije ni ona.
But they didn't today.	Ali danas nisu.
Few still do.	I dalje malo ko to radi.
Or maybe not.	Ili možda i nije.
I had to see.	Morao sam da vidim.
As always.	Kao i uvek.
It is simply a matter of time.	To je jednostavno pitanje vremena.
It was so bad.	Bilo je tako loše.
Very guy.	Veoma momak.
I mean, you can, but you shouldn't.	Mislim, možeš, ali ne bi trebao.
I don't know about that.	Ne znam za to.
Really, you should go now.	Zaista, trebao bi ići sada.
I hope we see a few things.	Nadam se da ćemo vidjeti nekoliko stvari.
It would just take a lot of time.	Samo bi trebalo puno vremena.
It was very difficult to talk to him.	Bilo je veoma teško razgovarati s njim.
Yes, all right, all right.	Da, u redu, u redu.
I wasn't sure what.	Nisam bio siguran šta.
In fact, no one expected that to happen.	Zapravo, niko nije očekivao da će se to dogoditi.
Now it's like a job.	Sada je to kao posao.
That's all he needs to know.	To je sve što treba da zna.
That was not enough for me.	To mi nije bilo dovoljno.
I hope you stay.	Nadam se da ćeš ostati.
It's like it's not allowed to be human.	Kao da nije dozvoljeno biti čovjek.
We don't know what is what.	Ne znamo šta je šta.
The job was mine.	Posao je bio moj.
Is this a bad deal.	Da li je ovo loš posao.
Actually, no, no, it's not.	Zapravo, ne, ne, nije.
I'm not sure how.	Nisam siguran kako.
I think he's the right man for the job.	Mislim da je on pravi čovjek za taj posao.
I have nothing more to say to you today.	Nemam više šta da vam kažem danas.
It's something you shouldn't do.	To je nešto što ne bi trebalo da radite.
He's here with you.	On je tu sa tobom.
You are with me.	Ti si sa mnom.
That's what she does.	To je ono što ona radi.
You told me about yourself.	Rekli ste mi o sebi.
She knew what was there.	Znala je šta je tamo.
How right they were.	Kako su bili u pravu.
And he seems to have done both.	I čini se da je uradio oboje.
Maybe right away.	Možda odmah.
Life is good.	Život je dobar.
I don't see a problem with that.	Ne vidim problem u tome.
It's not a question of whether it will happen.	Nije pitanje da li će se to dogoditi.
That's none of your business.	To nije tvoj posao.
I know you're really busy.	Znam da si stvarno zauzet.
That's what she thinks now.	Tako ona sada misli.
And what.	I šta .
I can't bring it back.	Ne mogu to vratiti.
I have you now.	Imam te sada.
Maybe that's what he thinks.	Možda to i misli.
He didn't give me anything.	Ništa mi nije dao.
So we were all together.	Tako da smo svi bili zajedno.
They are already here.	Oni su već ovde.
But that's how we all work.	Ali tako svi mi radimo.
Usually all three.	Obično sve tri.
And no you didn't.	I ne nisi.
Thinking of you!.	Mislim na tebe!.
I saw him.	Video sam ga.
We know it happened.	Znamo da se to dogodilo.
But it never is.	Ali nikad nije.
Even if we couldn't see anything wrong.	Čak i ako nismo mogli vidjeti ništa loše.
Yes, you heard me.	Da, čuo si me.
How much, no one knows.	Koliko, niko ne zna.
You told us.	Rekao si nam.
You have to do it for yourself.	Morate to učiniti za sebe.
It was hard to say.	Bilo je teško reći.
Do it at home.	Radite to kod kuće.
I won't believe him even now.	Neću mu vjerovati ni sada.
I'll tell him something.	Reći ću mu nešto.
This could really be it.	Ovo bi zaista moglo biti to.
I was the one they could reach.	Ja sam bio taj do koga su mogli doći.
She knew he was good.	Znala je da je dobar.
You want something from me.	Želiš nešto od mene.
That's the way to do it.	To je način da se to uradi.
He also knew the truth.	Znao je i istinu.
Yes yes yes.	Da da da.
He could have been there.	Mogao je biti tamo.
He couldn't be human.	Nije mogao biti čovjek.
It can be done.	To se može uraditi.
They couldn't.	Nisu mogli.
How can this be?	Kako ovo može biti?
That may not be what you want.	To možda nije ono što želite.
They are neither here nor there.	Nisu ni ovdje ni tamo.
We just won't be.	Jednostavno nećemo biti.
He does it to everyone.	On to radi svima.
I have a lot.	Imam mnogo.
I'll help.	Ja ću pomoći.
No one but me.	Niko osim mene.
It always is and always will be.	Uvek jeste i uvek će biti.
He was so good to us.	Bio je tako dobar za nas.
Just a guy.	Samo momak.
He didn't want her to leave.	Nije želio da ona ode.
She didn't know if she was right or not.	Nije znala da li je u pravu ili ne.
Except there was more to it than that.	Osim što je bilo više od toga.
We need that.	Treba nam to.
I love him as much as you do.	Volim ga, kao i ti.
He was obviously happy.	Očigledno je bio sretan.
He is right.	On je u pravu.
He obviously didn't have to drive.	Očigledno nije trebalo da vozi.
It's hard to say now.	Teško je to sada reći.
He didn't need it.	Nije mu trebalo.
Nobody tells me what to do.	Niko mi ne govori šta da radim.
And they didn't.	A nisu.
It was already too much.	Već je bilo previše.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu imali.
I'm just tired, that's all.	Samo sam umoran, to je sve.
I lost so much.	Izgubio sam toliko toga.
This was not a good idea.	Ovo nije bila dobra ideja.
I could.	Mogao sam.
Mine, he said.	Moja, rekao je on.
You did your job.	Uradio si svoj posao.
I could do much better.	Mogao bih mnogo bolje.
It didn’t seem to have happened for a while.	Činilo se da se to nije dogodilo već neko vrijeme.
He doesn't need to say anything.	On ne treba ništa da kaže.
Do what you love.	Radite ono što vam je drago.
But this would not be easy.	Ali ovo ne bi bilo lako.
We still have a lot to do.	Imamo još dosta toga da radimo.
I began to doubt myself.	Počeo sam da sumnjam u sebe.
We all have them, there's nothing wrong with that.	Svi ih imamo, nema ništa loše u tome.
It doesn't seem right.	Izgleda da nije u redu.
He didn't need them.	Nisu mu trebali.
That will happen tonight as well.	To će se dogoditi i večeras.
We needed that.	To nam je trebalo.
The way he said it.	Način na koji je to rekao.
I don't mean that.	Ne mislim to.
He does for us what we could never do.	On za nas čini ono što nikada nismo mogli učiniti.
I can't even say you were right.	Ne mogu reći ni da ste bili u pravu.
Maybe he was the father.	Možda je on bio otac.
In order to.	Da bi se .
But last night.	Ali sinoć.
Not even yourself.	Čak ni sebe.
He told me so.	On mi je tako rekao.
It's like you or me.	To je kao ti ili ja.
Not just an idea.	Ne samo ideja.
We should have known right away that something was wrong.	Trebali smo odmah znati da nešto nije u redu.
Someone has to be.	Neko mora biti.
That's the way.	To je način.
This is for sure.	Ovo je sigurno.
There is none of that here.	Ovde nema ništa od toga.
And he lost me.	I izgubio me.
Better than all right.	Bolje nego sve u redu.
You were so good tonight.	Bila si tako dobra večeras.
I want to go home.	Želim kući.
It's okay for a bit.	U redu je za malo.
He must be the one.	On mora da je taj.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
We have everything.	Imamo sve.
We all do that.	Svi mi to radimo.
Today was not that day.	Danas nije bio taj dan.
It really works.	Zaista radi.
It just won't work.	Samo to neće ići.
You will be safe with us.	Sa nama ćete biti sigurni.
He was working that day.	Taj dan je radio.
I couldn't find him before.	Nisam ga mogao naći ranije.
We can't believe anything here.	Ne možemo ništa vjerovati ovdje.
It happened fast.	Dogodilo se brzo.
He didn't finish it.	Nije ga završio.
You don't know anything.	Ti ne znaš ništa.
Is your friend.	Je li tvoj prijatelj.
But it was enough.	Ali bilo je dovoljno.
It was up to us.	Na nama je bilo.
That's what's wrong.	To je ono što nije u redu.
But we'll know more tomorrow.	Ali sutra ćemo znati više.
That needs to be discussed.	O tome treba razgovarati.
You can get that.	To možete i dobiti.
Not from anyone at all.	Uopšte ne od bilo koga.
They won't find us.	Neće nas naći.
He just wouldn't have it in him.	On to jednostavno ne bi imao u sebi.
Apparently things won't be so bad here.	Očigledno stvari ovdje neće biti tako loše.
I wouldn't say that now.	Ne bih to sada rekao.
Everything is OK.	Sve je u redu.
I want to say you .	Želim ti reći .
I never asked you what you were doing here.	Nikad te nisam pitao šta radiš ovde.
But that's me.	Ali to sam ja.
Too much time.	Previše vremena.
It has to be what it is.	Mora biti ono što jeste.
I wish he was with us again.	Voleo bih da je ponovo sa nama.
He's already tired.	Već je umoran.
There is no one there.	Tamo nema nikoga.
Nothing for now.	Za sada ništa.
We would.	Bismo .
How long ago he had no idea.	Koliko dugo prije nije imao pojma.
Any way to do this.	Bilo koji način da se ovo uradi.
I promised.	Obećao sam.
I am like that.	Ja sam tako.
My job is just me.	Moj posao sam samo ja.
There is no moon.	Nema mjeseca.
In fact, I didn't like them very much.	U stvari, nisam ih mnogo voleo.
If it was easy, we would do it, easy.	Da je lako, uradili bismo to, lako.
I want you as much as you want me.	Želim te koliko i ti mene.
I think he was tired.	Mislim da je bio umoran.
I don't really know.	Ja zapravo ne znam.
I wanted to be something too.	I ja sam htio biti nešto.
They are gone.	Nema ih više.
That's what they are for.	Za to su oni.
Obviously, there is nothing you can do now.	Očigledno, sada ništa ne možete učiniti.
He had it.	Imao ga je.
If you want to do it, do it.	Ako želiš to da uradiš, uradi to.
And maybe he was right.	I možda je bio u pravu.
I just didn't want to trust him.	Jednostavno mu nisam htio vjerovati.
Neither is this one.	Nije ni ovaj.
I'm pretty sure it's just that.	Prilično sam siguran da je to samo to.
That's really, really bad.	To je stvarno, jako loše.
Alone, she may never be.	Sama, možda nikada neće biti.
There was very little time to do anything.	Bilo je vrlo malo vremena da se nešto uradi.
I'm so glad you didn't.	Tako mi je drago da nisi.
This one had too much.	Ovaj je imao previše.
I don't know what to tell him.	Ne znam šta da mu kažem.
I know how to play.	Znam kako se igra.
No one is alone.	Niko nije sam.
No more power over me.	Nema više moći nada mnom.
I'll tell you that.	Reći ću ti to.
This was not true.	Ovo nije bila istina.
He was good at it.	Bio je dobar u tome.
But we didn't need it.	Ali nije nam trebao.
That certainly wouldn't be me.	To sigurno ne bih bio ja.
That's pretty good.	To je prilično dobro.
I'm not sure.	Nisam baš siguran.
You're just doing too much.	Samo radiš previše.
The car doesn't work there.	Tamo ne radi auto.
I would still love her, she would love me.	I dalje bih je volio, ona mene.
You know he couldn't.	Znaš da nije mogao.
I brought them back for tomorrow.	Vratio sam ih za sutra.
It was too much.	Bilo je previše.
Neither of us said anything.	Niko od nas nije ništa rekao.
But you don't want to do that.	Ali ti to ne želiš da uradiš.
We don't work this way.	Ne radimo na ovaj način.
No one will know but us.	Niko neće znati osim nas.
She will be fine.	Ona će biti dobro.
He was always there for me.	Uvek je bio tu za mene.
Came and went, came and went.	Došao i otišao, došao i otišao.
He didn't want her to know that he knew.	Nije želio da ona zna da on zna.
he said.	on je rekao.
And it is.	I jeste.
I was one too.	I ja sam bio jedan.
There could be more.	Moglo bi biti više.
Until they were.	Sve dok nisu bili.
I never heard them.	Nikad ih nisam čuo.
He never arrived.	Nikad nije stigao.
He worked more for us.	Radio je više za nas.
She was not alone.	Nije bila sama.
She knew this.	Znala je ovo.
It's not there.	To nije tamo.
You should have come and told me.	Trebao si doći i reći mi.
You are what you can be.	Vi ste to što možete biti.
When you do it, do it right.	Kada to uradite, uradite to kako treba.
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
But you are ready.	Ali ti si spreman.
He knew exactly what to do.	Tačno je znao šta da radi.
Everything was still there.	Sve je još bilo tu.
But they didn't tell you that.	Ali ti to nisu rekli.
He was the only person who said that.	On je bio jedina osoba koja je to rekla.
He was a good person.	Bio je dobra osoba.
Maybe he's telling the truth.	Možda govori istinu.
And he must know what they were.	I on mora znati šta su bili.
He still feels good.	I dalje se osjeća dobro.
I'm sure they'll find him.	Siguran sam da će ga naći.
I prefer it to be long.	Više volim da je dugo.
He didn't know what to think.	Nije znao šta da misli.
We couldn't trust anyone.	Nismo mogli nikome vjerovati.
Someone said it could be, you know.	Neko je rekao da bi mogao biti, znate.
Besides, they might not trust him.	Osim toga, možda mu neće vjerovati.
I wish he did.	Voleo bih da on .
And my father.	I moj otac.
He could, but he didn't want to.	Mogao je, ali nije htio.
Maybe he doesn't even have it.	Možda ga čak i nema.
And she doesn't seem to be alone.	I čini se da nije sama.
I never thought that would happen.	Nikad nisam mislio da će se to dogoditi.
He thinks too much that he should.	Previše misli da bi trebalo.
We'll probably never get any of that.	Vjerovatno nikada nećemo dobiti ništa od toga.
You always thought there would be more time.	Uvek si mislio da će biti više vremena.
But we can't.	Ali ne možemo.
And that is what he wants for all of us.	I to je ono što on želi za sve nas.
That may or may not be true.	To može biti istina, a možda i nije.
He won't really say.	Neće stvarno reći.
They are people too.	I oni su ljudi.
But not everyone.	Ali ne svima.
Not there yet.	Ne još tamo.
This does not happen often, but it does happen.	Ovo se ne dešava često, ali se dešava.
Maybe not.	Možda neće.
He didn't really give anything.	On zapravo nije ništa dao.
She doesn't know how right she is.	Ona ne zna koliko je u pravu.
He didn't want you.	On te nije želeo.
I know enough to do that.	Znam dovoljno da to uradim.
Probably not enough.	Verovatno nije dovoljno.
There is always someone.	Uvek postoji neko.
I know he won't come at me.	Znam da neće doći na mene.
He knew how to play.	Znao je kako da igra.
Someone he loves.	Neko koga voli.
Maybe I have a friend to come too.	Možda i ja imam prijatelja da dođe.
You're not there.	Nisi tamo.
What is a door, you think.	Šta su vrata, mislite.
I'm just on it.	Upravo sam na tome.
Not everyone.	Nisu svi.
He never could.	Nikada nije mogao.
We had nothing to do with it.	Nismo imali ništa s tim.
It is for me.	Za mene je.
And he knew it.	I on je to znao.
It's not that.	Nije to.
He couldn't help himself.	Nije si mogao pomoći.
He couldn't know anything about it.	Nije mogao znati ništa o tome.
I follow him quickly.	Idem brzo za njim.
It's here.	To je ovdje.
I was good at it.	Bio sam dobar u tome.
This is all.	Ovo je sve.
It is.	Da jeste.
I'm busy here.	Zauzet sam ovdje.
There is a story.	Postoji priča.
But that's a good question.	Ali to je dobro pitanje.
This doesn't look good on you.	Ovo ti ne izgleda dobro.
It was as if he had never been.	Kao da nikad nije bio.
Anyone will tell you that.	Bilo ko će ti to reći.
You won't tell me.	Nećeš mi reći.
We're doing it again.	Ponovo to radimo.
But she is.	Ali ona je .
Maybe he will.	Možda hoće.
He saw everything.	On je sve video.
For everything they've done.	Za sve što su uradili.
Not for everyone.	Ne za sve.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
That's how it would be.	Tako bi to bilo.
He knew it wasn't real.	Znao je da to nije stvarno.
And how he loved life.	I kako je volio život.
He saw a lot of it.	Video je dosta toga.
I thought so too.	I ja sam tako mislio.
She didn't want to live this way.	Nije htela da živi na ovaj način.
Not so fast.	Ne tako brzo.
We have to do this.	Moramo ovo uraditi.
You are absolutely right.	Potpuno si u pravu.
Okay, okay, very good.	U redu, u redu, vrlo dobro.
That was yesterday and this is today.	To je bilo juče, a ovo je danas.
I still have that problem.	I dalje imam taj problem.
And that's .	I to je .
I saw him tonight.	Video sam ga večeras.
He loved the car.	Voleo je auto.
It was either them or all of us.	Bili su to ili oni, ili svi mi.
You never know !.	Nikad ne znaš!.
But nothing was just like that.	Ali ništa jednostavno nije bilo tako.
I shouldn't have been here.	Nisam ni trebao biti ovdje.
I've never heard of you.	Nikad nisam čuo za tebe.
Not bad, not bad at all.	Nije loše, uopšte nije loše.
Speaking of which, we have to go.	Kad smo već kod toga, moramo ići.
He thought he would.	Mislio je da hoće.
Let me just tell you.	Samo da ti kažem.
It's that simple for me.	Za mene je to tako jednostavno.
Maybe they'll let me.	Možda će mi dozvoliti.
I was glad about that.	Bilo mi je drago zbog toga.
He said it was too much for us.	Rekao je da je to previše za nas.
This code works.	Ovaj kod radi.
Oh yes, they said.	O da, rekli su.
I got back in the car.	Vratio sam se u auto.
I am moving on.	Idem dalje.
We are all.	Svi smo mi.
She is so good.	Ona je tako dobra.
But today is the day it happened.	Ali danas je dan kada se to dogodilo.
I don't want to see him tonight.	Ne želim da ga vidim večeras.
Today is .	Danas je .
Few days.	Nekoliko dana.
Maybe that's all he says.	Možda samo to govori.
He loves me.	On me voli .
She said no.	Rekla je da nije.
.	.
He's just playing with you.	On se samo igra sa tobom.
I was good.	Ja sam bio dobar.
It is not hard.	Nije teško.
I'm pretty good at it.	Prilično sam dobar u tome.
It's your lucky day too.	I tvoj je sretan dan.
I would buy again.	Kupio bih ponovo.
But it was never you.	Ali to nikada nisi bio ti.
This is just the way it is.	Ovo je jednostavno tako.
You should know.	Trebao bi znati.
That would be a problem.	To bi bio problem.
And so it should be.	I tako treba da bude.
It could be.	Mogao bi i biti.
You are life to me.	Ti si za mene sam život.
They did everything.	Uradili su sve.
I was always ready.	Uvek sam bio spreman.
Obviously I don't want to do this.	Očigledno ne želim ovo da radim.
Of several.	Od nekoliko.
We never knew what really happened to him.	Nikada nismo znali šta mu se zaista dogodilo.
We just have to stay safe.	Samo moramo ostati sigurni.
He always did.	Uvek je to radio.
And even.	I čak .
We had no one.	Nismo imali nikoga.
He will return to work there.	Tamo će se vratiti na posao.
And not just for a few people.	I to ne samo za nekoliko ljudi.
There were a lot of them.	Bilo ih je puno.
He was sure it was the only thing.	Bio je siguran da je to bila jedina stvar.
It could be anyone.	To može biti bilo ko.
So you could be on it.	Da bi ti mogao biti na tome.
We should be pretty sure.	Trebali bismo biti prilično sigurni.
I was there to see.	Bio sam tamo da vidim.
I loved her.	Voleo sam je.
But it won't be easy.	Ali to neće biti jednostavno.
I can't help it now.	Ne mogu si pomoći sada.
Just for him.	Samo za njega.
He said it was mine.	Rekao je da je moj.
They are there for you and me.	Oni su tu za tebe i mene.
Today we can do much better.	Danas možemo mnogo bolje.
He knew where my father was.	Znao je gdje je moj otac.
I just finished it.	Samo sam ga završio.
I'm glad you're here.	Drago mi je da si ovdje.
The question is here.	Pitanje je ovdje.
I'm going to see her tomorrow.	Idem da je vidim sutra.
It cannot be allowed to work.	Ne može se dozvoliti da radi.
That's long enough.	To je dovoljno dugo.
We can do it anywhere.	Možemo to bilo gdje.
It doesn't seem to work.	Izgleda da ne radi.
This happens a lot.	Ovo se često dešava.
I was still working.	Radio sam i dalje.
I wondered what to do with him.	Pitao sam se šta da radim s njim.
Think of him, and only him.	Misli na njega, i samo na njega.
It's not always okay.	Nije uvijek u redu.
That he will not return home.	Da se neće vratiti kući.
Now he realized he was right.	Sada je shvatio da je u pravu.
Like too much.	Kao previše.
That in itself is neither good nor bad.	To je samo po sebi ni dobro ni loše.
That might be too much for him.	To bi moglo biti previše za njega.
I mean, he can't help it.	Mislim, on ne može pomoći.
You can do it too.	I ti to možeš.
It's really okay.	Zaista je u redu.
I certainly wouldn't.	Ja sigurno ne bih.
Nothing there either.	Ni tu ništa.
No one would know it was us.	Niko ne bi znao da smo to mi.
As he always did.	Kao što je uvek radio.
We will say.	Reći ćemo.
This might help you.	Ovo bi vam moglo pomoći.
So far so good.	Do sada je bilo jako dobro.
If you want something bad enough, just do it.	Ako želiš nešto dovoljno jako, samo to uradi.
You can tell me now.	Možete mi reći sada.
And not for the first time.	I to ne prvi put.
That's better.	To je bolje.
It wasn't good.	Nije bilo dobro.
It still needs to be done.	Još treba da se uradi.
There is only this.	Postoji samo ovo.
It can happen and it can happen now.	To se može dogoditi i može se dogoditi sada.
I can't say which.	Ne mogu reći koje.
I've never worked here.	Nikada nisam radio ovdje.
Now he saw it.	Sada je to video.
Busy but happy.	Zauzet, ali sretan.
That's what he does.	To je ono što on radi.
Why might that be?	Zašto bi to moglo biti?
We have to do it now.	Moramo to uraditi sada.
And not just me, everyone.	I ne samo ja, svi.
It's not just about what you do.	Nije stvar samo u tome šta radite.
But I couldn't.	Ali nisam mogao.
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
You did it to yourself.	Uradio si to sebi.
I thought it was a very bad job.	Mislio sam da je to jako loš posao.
No one seems to know what happened.	Izgleda da niko ne zna šta se dogodilo.
Nothing bad.	Ništa loše.
Just that one.	Samo taj.
That's what it isn't.	To je ono što nije.
Not people, that's for sure.	Ne ljudi, to je sigurno.
.	.
Money is not everything.	Novac nije sve.
I think we all know that.	Mislim da to svi znamo.
But he is not.	Ali on to nije.
I'm pretty sure that's it.	Prilično sam siguran da je to to.
You can see them here.	Možete ih vidjeti ovdje.
We all do this.	Svi radimo ovo.
I would like to know.	Voleo bih da znam.
He's doing so well.	Tako mu dobro ide.
He left as quickly as he came.	Otišao je brzo kao što je došao.
It always is.	Uvek jeste.
It doesn’t feel that way anymore.	To se više ne osjeća tako.
Maybe he couldn't either.	Možda ni on nije mogao.
I have a little of that.	Imam malo toga.
I hope that never has to happen.	Nadam se da do toga nikada neće morati doći.
I just want to say.	Samo želim reći.
Like you said.	Kao što si rekao.
We will say no more about it.	Nećemo više reći o tome.
I'm not ready to party.	Nisam spreman za zabavu.
I couldn't help it.	Nisam mogao pomoći.
And why now.	I zašto sada.
It must work well.	Mora da radi dobro.
You could too.	Mogao bi i ti.
I'm working so far.	Do sada radim.
I must like it.	Mora da mi se sviđa.
It really shows.	Zaista se vidi.
He saw me first.	On me je prvi video.
We were real.	Bili smo pravi.
Maybe he's already there.	Možda je već tamo.
I knew a better way.	Znao sam bolji način.
I can't do that now.	Ne mogu to sada.
Lots of people there.	Mnogo ljudi tamo.
He saw things.	Video je stvari.
He does not know.	On ne zna.
Like, alone.	Kao, sam.
And here.	I ovde.
But it was something he didn't want.	Ali to je bilo nešto što on nije želio.
But even that is not as simple as it seems.	Ali ni to nije tako jednostavno kao što izgleda.
I didn't have it in me.	Nisam to imao u sebi.
I'm glad you're happy.	Drago mi je da si sretan.
I wish someone could help me here.	Volio bih da mi neko može pomoći ovdje.
People there are just like us.	Ljudi tamo su kao i mi.
Everything was very simple.	Sve je bilo vrlo jednostavno.
And there is much more you can do.	I još mnogo toga možete učiniti.
Really, so simple.	Zaista, tako jednostavno.
Except when it isn't.	Osim kada nije.
I just work here.	Ja samo radim ovde.
I can see them like it was yesterday.	Mogu da ih vidim kao da je bilo juče.
Everything works now.	Sada sve radi.
That's the idea.	To je ideja.
I wasn't sorry.	Nije mi bilo žao.
You could tell him to leave.	Mogao bi mu reći da ode.
And it didn't.	I nije.
He is ready.	On je spreman.
That's what they did.	To je ono što su oni uradili.
It's not right.	Nije u redu.
This is actually her.	Ovo je zapravo ona.
I wouldn't want that.	Ne bih to želio.
I didn't have time for that.	Nisam imao vremena za to.
Yesterday there was nothing.	Jučer nije bilo ništa.
But that might not be a good idea.	Ali to možda nije dobra ideja.
Not too much, but a little.	Ne previše, ali malo.
Or we'll be back.	Ili ćemo se vratiti.
This is all I want.	Ovo je sve što želim.
Very simple and works well.	Vrlo jednostavno i dobro radi.
That's all it does.	To je sve što radi.
He was usually pretty good at it.	Obično je bio prilično dobar u tome.
Yes, but not always.	Da, ali ne uvek.
He knew nothing.	Nije znao ništa.
And he should know.	I trebalo bi da zna.
I wouldn't be happy there.	Ne bih bio sretan tamo.
You can return home if you wish.	Možete se vratiti kući ako želite.
But he didn't come to school today.	Ali danas nije došao u školu.
It does not always exist.	Ne postoji uvek.
He didn't have to.	Nije morao.
I never, ever want to see them.	Nikada, nikad ne želim da ih vidim.
You gave him money last week.	Prošle sedmice si mu dao novac.
It's money, money, money.	To je novac, novac, novac.
I would love to see you there !.	Voleo bih da te vidim tamo!.
I hope it still will be.	Nadam se da će i dalje biti.
He had nothing for himself.	Nije imao ništa za sebe.
I love you too.	Volim i ja tebe.
I ask her why.	Pitam je zašto.
And that was a very good thing.	I to je bila jako dobra stvar.
And there's the problem.	I tu je problem.
I saw you do that.	Video sam te kako to radiš.
He said what he thought.	Rekao je šta je mislio.
As if nothing had happened.	Kao da se ništa nije dogodilo.
We don't need him.	On nam ne treba.
This is a really good job.	Ovo je zaista dobar posao.
Yes he is.	Da on je.
I'm not good at all.	Uopšte nisam dobar.
If you can.	Ako može.
Nothing so simple, you can tell.	Ništa tako jednostavno, možete reći.
I'm going for it. '	Idem na to'.
And they won't.	I neće.
I don't like it at all.	Uopšte mi se ne sviđa.
We had more than we had problems.	Imali smo više nego što smo imali problema.
I'm always ready.	Uvek sam spreman.
Now that's true.	Sada je to tačno.
No problem.	Nema problema.
That is not the case at all.	To uopšte nije tako.
And he goes for it.	I ide na to.
They are not like us.	Oni nisu kao mi.
He'll just stay home.	Samo će ostati kod kuće.
That in itself is pretty good.	To je samo po sebi prilično dobro.
I even bought it.	Čak sam i kupio.
You should see them.	Trebao bi ih vidjeti.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
But it doesn't work now.	Ali sada ne radi.
I'm not good.	Nisam dobar.
I just don't love you anymore.	Jednostavno te više ne volim.
I just want to be alone.	Samo želim da budem sama.
Now he understood everything.	Sada je sve shvatio.
Neither is he.	Nije ni on.
You just never know exactly when.	Samo nikad ne znaš tačno kada.
I realized something.	Shvatio sam nešto.
Today things are much better.	Danas su stvari mnogo bolje.
You really don't need all that.	Stvarno ti ne treba sve to.
That's not an idea.	To nije ideja.
I really would.	Zaista bi.
They just want to.	Samo hoće.
They are always there for you.	Oni su uvek tu za vas.
You are no longer what you were.	Nisi više ono što si bio.
And now we know we can.	A sada znamo da možemo.
Or, you don't have to.	Ili, ne morate.
I was ready to tell you everything.	Bio sam spreman da ti kažem sve.
But no one did something like that.	Ali niko tako nešto nije uradio.
Right here.	Upravo ovdje.
So, so, so good.	Tako, tako, tako dobro.
I'm telling you now.	Kažem ti sada.
And there never will be.	I nikada ga neće biti.
Everything is fine there.	Sve je u redu tamo.
He was busy.	Bio je zauzet.
Like they could.	Kao što bi mogli.
I wouldn't know how to do it.	Ne bih znao kako da to uradim.
I am, I was very good.	Ja sam, ja sam bio mnogo dobar.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.	Ne mogu vam reći ništa što ne znate.
It's always been that way.	Uvek je bilo tako.
You knew you couldn't.	Znao si da ne možeš.
It was hard to know what to say.	Bilo je teško znati šta reći.
That way we would know for sure.	Tako bismo sigurno znali.
In fact, we already know that's not happening.	Zapravo već znamo da se to ne dešava.
Probably never will.	Vjerovatno nikada neće.
In fact, something was wrong.	U stvari, nešto nije bilo u redu.
Is that .	Je li to .
He knew the question.	Znao je pitanje.
She really is.	Ona zaista jeste.
Like mine.	Kao moj.
And now he has come.	A sada je došao.
He doesn't want to go home with me.	Ne želi sa mnom kući.
Please, she said.	Molim te, rekla je.
True, he thought it would happen last night.	Istina, mislio je da će se to dogoditi sinoć.
He had no idea who these people were.	Nije imao pojma ko su ti ljudi.
There was something wrong with what happened.	Nešto nije bilo u tome što se dogodilo.
He had to talk to him.	Morao je razgovarati s njim.
Something that shouldn't work.	Nešto što ne bi trebalo raditi.
And that could not be done.	I to se nije moglo uraditi.
It's you and me.	To smo ti i ja.
Not that that happened to me.	Nije da mi se to dogodilo.
We were here this morning.	Bili smo ovdje jutros.
But this was okay.	Ali ovo je bilo u redu.
He would never do such a thing.	On nikada ne bi uradio tako nešto.
And so it is now.	I tako je sada to.
There was usually nothing.	Obično nije bilo ništa.
That has to be where he is.	To mora biti tamo gdje je on.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
He did for you exactly what he did for me.	Uradio je za tebe tačno ono što je uradio za mene.
It's working for us right now.	Trenutno nam radi.
But that is not the case today.	Ali danas nije tako.
But not today.	Ali nije danas.
I had a.	Imao sam.
No one should be able to do that.	To niko ne bi trebao moći.
I'm sorry, he says.	Žao mi je, kaže.
The idea itself.	Sama ideja.
And he was better.	I bio je bolji.
Happy to do the job.	Sretan što radim posao.
We are there tonight.	Večeras smo tamo.
It doesn't look that hard.	Ne izgleda tako teško.
Today we know better.	Danas znamo bolje.
You have to really work at it.	Morate stvarno raditi na tome.
He says he knows.	Kaže da zna.
These are people.	Ovo su ljudi.
We can't work together anymore.	Ne možemo više da radimo zajedno.
I doubt it a little.	Malo sumnjam u to.
This has happened to me before.	Ovo mi se već dogodilo.
It probably should.	Verovatno bi trebalo.
You know me better than that.	Znaš me bolje od toga.
I'm glad I have them.	Drago mi je da ih imam.
But not often.	Ali ne često.
He doesn't talk anymore.	On više ne govori.
I didn't ask for her.	Nisam je tražio.
That's good for him.	To je dobro za njega.
But it's always there.	Ali uvek je tu.
He said no.	Rekao je ne.
Yes, that's right.	Da, tako je.
And that's good.	I to je dobro.
We haven't and we won't.	Nismo i nećemo.
That was almost three weeks ago.	To je bilo prije skoro tri sedmice.
He will be fine.	On će biti dobro.
It's good to be back.	Dobro je vratiti se.
It wasn't always so easy.	Nije uvijek bilo tako lako.
Now tell the truth.	Sada reci istinu.
The question itself is simple.	Samo pitanje je jednostavno.
But if that's all you can do.	Ali ako je to sve što možeš da uradiš.
I was glad for that.	Bilo mi je drago zbog toga.
I'm not sure it will ever be.	Nisam siguran da će ikada biti.
But only for a while.	Ali samo na neko vrijeme.
She knew she didn't want to.	Znala je da to ne želi.
Just to be sure.	Samo da budem siguran .
I'll tell you something.	Reći ću ti nešto.
But today it is easy.	Ali danas je to lako.
It doesn't do anything to you.	To ti ništa ne čini.
But now more than that.	Ali sada više od toga.
Please don't do that.	Nemoj, molim te, to da radiš.
You did them.	Ti si ih uradio.
She can be more.	Ona može biti više.
This didn't get any better for me.	Ovo mi nije bilo bolje.
You were so right.	Bio si tako u pravu.
Maybe she knows.	Možda ona zna.
I have no doubt about this.	Ne sumnjam u ovo.
Not so here.	Ovdje nije tako.
This is all you know.	Ovo je sve što znaš.
So real, so real.	Tako stvarno, tako stvarno.
He seems to be able to talk.	Čini se da može da priča.
In fact, nothing is.	U stvari, ništa nije.
She doesn't really have to work.	Ona zapravo ne mora da radi.
It was enough that it was.	Bilo je dovoljno da jeste.
That was what you had to do.	To je bilo ono što si morao da uradiš.
I saw them.	Video sam ih.
I could.	Ja bih mogao .
If you want to work you can come here.	Ako želite da radite možete doći ovdje.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
It never did.	Nikad nije.
Maybe it will be good.	Možda će biti dobro.
Was there anyone else there.	Da li je tamo bilo još nekoga.
It's not like a job or anything.	To nije kao posao ili tako nešto.
I will tell him.	Reći ću mu.
I hope he gets a job.	Nadam se da će dobiti posao.
How can I do that.	Kako mogu to da uradim.
I was so tired.	Bio sam tako umoran.
She was in the house.	Bila je u kući.
He is completely in it.	On je potpuno u tome.
And that is what we have to do.	I to je ono što moramo učiniti.
I still think so.	I dalje to mislim.
Do not speak! 	Ne govori!
.	.
I think that was a good idea.	Mislim da je to bila dobra ideja.
Maybe you can help.	Možda možete pomoći.
Maybe he could have done something more here.	Možda je mogao da uradi nešto više ovde.
This is a bit of a problem.	Ovo je malo problem.
I never knew it could be so good.	Nikad nisam znao da može biti tako dobro.
That is something that is difficult to do.	To je nešto što je teško uraditi.
Not there.	Ne tamo.
Everyone will know you did it.	Svi će znati da ste to uradili.
I didn't want to know anything.	Nisam htela ništa da znam.
He wants it.	On to želi.
It was too easy.	Bilo je previše lako.
They were always here.	Uvijek su bili ovdje.
Just for fun.	Samo za zabavu.
He has arrived.	Stigao je.
We don't know if that ever happened.	Ne znamo da li se to ikada dogodilo.
And we shouldn't.	I ne bismo trebali.
This was a problem.	Ovo je bio problem.
You can see them.	Možete ih vidjeti.
I need you now.	Treba te sada.
Soon, she knew, she would be here soon.	Uskoro, znala je, uskoro će biti ovdje.
We should have time.	Trebalo bi da imamo vremena.
It could go either way, really.	Moglo bi ići na bilo koji način, zaista.
And now he was gone.	A sada ga više nije bilo.
Nobody expected anything from him.	Od njega niko ništa nije očekivao.
How do you not know that, how it was.	Kako to ne znaš, kako je to bilo.
You should have known that too.	I ti si to trebao znati.
He probably didn't even buy this himself.	Ovo vjerovatno nije ni sam kupio.
I didn't lose her.	Nisam je izgubio.
That's who he was.	To je ko je bio.
I just have to do a few things.	Moram da uradim samo nekoliko stvari.
You meant so well.	Mislio si tako dobro.
I could help him.	Mogao bih mu pomoći.
It's really all here.	Zaista je sve ovdje.
No, nothing like that.	Ne, ništa tako.
But okay if not.	Ali dobro ako ne.
I wouldn't give a damn to know.	Ne bih dao malo da znam.
And you never know.	I nikad se ne zna.
It's not safe.	Nije sigurno.
I thought, just maybe.	Mislio sam, samo možda.
But it is.	Ali jeste.
She didn't say anything.	Nije rekla ništa.
We don't have to talk.	Ne moramo razgovarati.
He must have it.	Sigurno ga ima.
But this one does.	Ali ovaj ima.
I wasn't sure what to do or think.	Nisam bio siguran šta da radim ili da mislim.
You didn't promise to do this or that.	Nisi obećao da ćeš uraditi ovo ili ono.
Or do something good without anyone knowing.	Ili uradite nešto dobro, a da niko ne zna.
I asked if he could help me.	Pitao sam da li mi može pomoći.
It was good to do that.	Bilo je dobro raditi to.
That's how it's always done.	Tako se to uvijek radi.
He speaks, and it is so.	On govori, i to je tako.
I mean, we can say it is.	Mislim, možemo reći da jeste.
She was never right.	Nikad nije bila u pravu.
Can you believe it? ' 	Možete li vjerovati?'
But he never was.	Ali nikada nije bio.
We needed both.	Trebao nam je oboje.
I didn't want to tell you earlier.	Nisam htela da ti kažem ranije.
I might have a problem.	Možda imam problema.
And you can see it.	I to možete vidjeti.
John got three of them.	John ih je dobio tri.
As far as she knew, it was the first time.	Koliko je znala, bilo je to prvi put.
Yes, he thought he would.	Da, mislio je da će to učiniti.
More than me.	Više od mene.
This tells you what to do.	Ovo vam govori šta da radite.
I thought about it.	Mislio sam na to.
I loved going there.	Voleo sam da idem tamo.
Who were these people?	Ko su bili ti ljudi?
More people have jobs than ever before.	Više ljudi ima posao nego ikada prije.
And not just anyone.	I to ne bilo ko.
Or even a meeting.	Ili čak i sastanak.
No, you are not alone.	Ne, niste sami.
I won't do anything.	Neću ništa učiniti.
Which no one was.	Što niko nije bio.
He got it right this time.	Ovaj put je dobro shvatio.
Nobody wanted to give you anything.	Niko ti ništa nije htio dati.
That was what he would do.	To je bilo ono što bi on uradio.
You don't think so.	Vi ne mislite tako.
We have a little more time.	Imamo još malo vremena.
And he is a good father.	I on je dobar otac.
There is nothing you can do.	Ne možete ništa učiniti.
I said that just for the sake of it.	Rekao sam to samo zbog toga.
He didn't do anything.	Ništa nije uradio.
And maybe a few more.	I možda još nekoliko.
I don't think so.	Mislim da nije.
You said you don't want that for yourself.	Rekli ste da to ne želite za sebe.
Now is .	Sada je .
Nothing was right for me yet.	Još mi ništa nije bilo kako treba.
They didn't have time for this.	Nisu imali vremena za ovo.
I'm happy now.	Sada sam sretan.
It could be anyone.	Mogao bi biti bilo ko.
That's how it has been, so far.	Tako je bilo, do sada.
They will always be with us.	Oni će uvek biti sa nama.
That's what he wanted.	To je ono što je želio.
And he told me everything.	I sve mi je rekao.
I'm sure we probably have.	Siguran sam da ih vjerovatno imamo.
It could be done easily and immediately.	Moglo je to lako i odmah.
It wasn't enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno.
But you actually want to do something.	Ali vi zapravo želite nešto da uradite.
But there seemed to be more to be said.	Ali činilo se da ima još toga da se kaže.
I would have to tell you.	Morao bih da ti kažem.
Not everything was bad.	Nije sve bilo loše.
That's a lot of time.	To je puno vremena.
You have to tell me everything.	Moraš mi sve reći.
Someone isn't trying.	Neko ne pokušava.
It was always easy with him.	Sa njim je uvek bilo lako.
I just don't know why.	Samo ne znam zašto.
But my friend did.	Ali uradio moj prijatelj.
I never knew who.	Nikad nisam znao ko.
It just doesn't happen.	To se jednostavno ne dešava.
Hope someone can help.	Nadam se da neko može pomoći.
If there is nothing better.	Ako nema ništa bolje.
That's what we need.	To je ono što nam treba.
We know it works.	Znamo da radi.
But we shouldn't.	Ali ne bismo trebali.
If .	Ako .
But he tries.	Ali on pokušava.
In fact, I have to ask him many things.	U stvari moram da ga pitam mnogo stvari.
I don't know when.	Ne znam kada.
They were all there.	Svi su bili tamo.
Apparently everything was fine.	Očigledno je sve bilo u redu.
No, it was really good.	Ne, bilo je stvarno dobro.
It still hasn't happened.	Još uvijek se nije dogodilo.
I pray that will happen soon.	Molim se da će se to uskoro dogoditi.
I've always been good.	Uvek sam bio dobro.
But we do it.	Ali mi to radimo.
That's all.	To samo .
That’s probably what’s going to happen.	To je vjerovatno ono što će se dogoditi.
I think it has to be.	Mislim da mora biti.
I just want to know what you think.	Samo želim da znam šta misliš.
But that is unlikely.	Ali to je malo vjerovatno.
Not even next month.	Ni sljedećeg mjeseca.
You're not really here.	Ti zapravo nisi ovdje.
I got there first.	Ja sam prvi stigao tamo.
Tomorrow is tomorrow.	Sutra je sutra.
I could see why he would prefer that.	Mogao sam vidjeti zašto bi to više volio.
Even if you .	Čak i ako ti .
And certainly not anything he did.	I sigurno ne bilo šta što je uradio.
I thought you figured that out too.	I ja sam mislio da si to shvatio.
I hope they never do.	Nadam se da nikad neće.
I have no idea what this is about.	Nemam pojma o čemu se radi.
She doesn't talk to me anymore.	Ona više ne priča sa mnom.
This is not just a game.	Ovo nije samo igra.
It has to work.	Mora da radi.
He wouldn't come back.	Ne bi se vratio.
Now it's gone.	Sada ga nema.
That we are here is good.	To što smo ovde je dobro.
You said it yourself.	I sam si to rekao.
Will it be easy, no.	Hoće li biti lako, ne.
Indeed, they did.	Zaista, to su i uradili.
I'm alone.	Sama sam.
I tried to do everything you say.	Pokušao sam da uradim sve što kažeš.
He would know you were there.	Znao bi da si tamo.
As if nothing had happened.	Kao da se ništa nije dogodilo.
That really wasn’t my problem.	To zaista nije bio moj problem.
And he probably knew that.	I vjerovatno je to znao.
He thinks he knows.	On misli da zna.
We know nothing about it.	Ne znamo ništa o tome.
I love working there.	Volim raditi tamo.
It was just them or me.	Bili smo jednostavno oni ili ja.
Yes, that must be it.	Da, to mora biti to.
They shouldn't do that.	Oni to ne bi trebali raditi.
I'm afraid it was me.	Bojim se da sam to bio ja.
And they should know.	I trebalo bi da znaju.
Often it is not a problem of money, but a problem of time.	Često to nije problem novca, već problem vremena.
Everything was very difficult.	Sve je bilo veoma teško.
He was here, he was there.	Bio je ovdje, bio je tamo.
Looks like he's going to leave.	Čini se da će otići.
She is here with me.	Ona je ovde sa mnom.
Maybe there's nothing anyone can do.	Možda niko ništa ne može da uradi.
they would say.	rekli bi.
He would never.	Nikada ne bi.
I hope so.	Nadam se da jeste.
It wasn't right.	Nije bilo u redu.
He never loved me like you did.	Nikad me nije volio kao ti.
Did he realize that he probably didn't.	Da li je shvatio da verovatno nije.
He didn't, but he could have.	Nije, ali je mogao.
You didn't mean that.	Nisi to mislio.
It must have been my father.	Mora da je to bio moj otac.
He doesn't have something like that.	On nema tako nešto.
Only we will both be better.	Samo će nam oboje biti bolje.
she will say.	ona će reći.
So you can do anything with it.	Tako da možete učiniti bilo šta s njim.
Not even a little bit.	Kao ni malo.
Someone had to say something.	Neko je morao nešto reći.
But you know.	Ali znaš.
There are three others besides us.	Tu su još tri osim nas.
All right.	U redu.
Is there a better way.	Postoji li bolji način.
I don't want you on that.	Ne želim te na tome.
And neither is he.	A nije ni on.
You're good.	Dobar si.
Not everything works.	Ne radi sve.
I didn't hear correctly.	Nisam dobro čuo.
I couldn't find anything to say.	Nisam mogao naći šta da kažem.
This is now.	Ovo je sada.
Nothing for now.	Za sada ništa.
We did the job for you.	Mi smo uradili posao za vas.
I should have known better.	Trebao sam znati bolje.
And it's good.	I dobro je.
I've seen this happen.	Video sam da se ovo dešava.
I could do this.	Mogao bih ovo da uradim.
It shouldn't be.	To ne bi trebalo da bude.
I just don't know what's next.	Samo ne znam šta dalje.
You told me about this.	Rekao si mi za ovo.
He will come back to you.	On će ti se vratiti.
We are not who we are.	Nismo to ko smo.
He wondered where she was now.	Pitao se gdje je ona sada.
This was not like her.	Ovo nije bilo kao ona.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Nisam siguran kako da to uradim.
He needs something.	Treba nešto.
Mine is fine.	Moj je u redu.
He is ready.	On je spreman.
Probably even a little earlier.	Verovatno čak i malo ranije.
I lost everything.	Izgubio sam sve.
Yes, she knew.	Da, znala je.
Something more was needed.	Trebalo je nešto više.
Will this happen?	Hoće li se ovo dogoditi?
I know it was.	Znam da je bilo.
I just want to help.	Samo želim pomoći.
Don't ever do that to me.	Nemoj mi to nikada raditi.
That was fine for now.	To je bilo u redu za sada.
He couldn't help but say something about himself.	Nije moglo a da ne kaže nešto za sebe.
So probably not.	Tako da vjerovatno ne.
That will probably happen next week.	To će se vjerovatno dogoditi sljedeće sedmice.
This is your friend.	Ovo je tvoj prijatelj.
I won't do it this time.	Neću to učiniti ovaj put.
He knew where they were.	Znao je gdje su.
I think we are better off.	Mislim da nam je bolje.
He was and is a man.	Bio je i jeste čovjek.
And it looks like we'll get that too.	A izgleda da ćemo i mi to dobiti.
We had no idea how we were going to do this.	Nismo imali pojma kako ćemo ovo uraditi.
I do not have money.	Nemam novca.
It can't come fast enough.	Ne može doći dovoljno brzo.
In fact, it never happened.	U stvari, to se nikada nije dogodilo.
It's like it all happened before.	Kao da se sve to ranije dogodilo.
Things are wrong.	Stvari nisu u redu.
There will be a lot of people there.	Tamo će biti puno ljudi.
I won't tell anyone.	Neću nikome ništa reći.
You not.	Ti ne.
It's for me.	Za mene je to.
He loved too much.	Previše je voleo.
And so few of us.	I tako malo nas.
I feel sorry for him.	Žao mi je zbog njega.
There were more people than there should have been.	Bilo je više ljudi nego što je trebalo.
Not until this is done.	Ne dok se ovo ne uradi.
And never would.	I nikada ne bi.
I have no one to talk to.	Nemam s kim razgovarati.
I got there this afternoon.	Stigao sam do danas popodne.
.	.
No, just too many years.	Ne, samo previše godina.
I didn't want to do this.	Nisam htela ovo da uradim.
As if we don't already know that.	Kao da to već ne znamo.
We can't do enough.	Ne možemo učiniti dovoljno.
I'd say it works.	Rekao bih da i radi.
You should have come alone.	Trebao si doći sam.
We all had a little.	Svi smo imali po malo.
I will stay here.	Ja ću ostati ovdje.
It doesn't have to be real.	Ne mora biti stvarno.
In a good way.	Na dobar način.
The problem is he doesn't know how.	Problem je što on ne zna kako.
No one has heard of it.	Niko nije čuo za to.
And maybe we won't.	A možda i nećemo.
I'm better.	Bolje mi je.
You will tell me about yourself.	Reći ćeš mi o sebi.
We know this too.	Znamo i ovo.
That's enough for him.	To je dovoljno za njega.
But you know all that.	Ali ti znaš sve to.
It may never be.	Možda nikada neće biti.
He did his job.	Uradio je svoj posao.
I think we did it pretty well.	Mislim da smo to uradili prilično dobro.
That's all she does, you know.	To je sve što ona radi, znaš.
We do what we can.	Radimo šta možemo.
Good day.	Dobar dan.
We won't let him.	Nećemo mu dozvoliti.
But when she really does, nothing happens.	Ali kada ona to zaista uradi, ništa se ne dešava.
That’s all she ever eats.	To je sve što ona ikada jede.
We can all do better.	Svi možemo bolje.
He asked if he could talk to me.	Pitao je da li može razgovarati sa mnom.
But even that was not certain.	Ali ni to nije bilo sigurno.
For now you can come to me.	Za sada možete doći kod mene.
But that doesn't seem to be coming.	Ali izgleda da to neće doći.
Nobody knew that.	Niko to nije znao.
No, none of that.	Ne, ništa od toga.
probably.	vjerovatno.
Or maybe it was him.	Ili je to možda bio on.
I'm not sorry.	Nije mi žao.
You shouldn't say that.	Ne bi trebalo to da kažeš.
For now, he was right.	Za sada je bio u pravu.
He never returned to work.	Nikad se nije vratio na posao.
And today it is even more true.	A danas je to još više tačno.
It’s all too much for me.	Sve je to previše za mene.
He needed help.	Trebalo mu je pomoći.
And so it was.	I tako je bilo.
It never was.	Nikada nije bilo.
Nothing was easy anymore.	Ništa više nije bilo lako.
Yes, that's enough.	Da, dosta je.
I will find time.	Naći ću vremena.
Today is not that day.	Danas nije taj dan.
But it's true.	Ali, istina je.
That's a lot.	To je mnogo.
It's not them.	To nisu oni.
I could do this.	Mogao bih ovo.
Other than that, it looks good.	Osim toga, izgleda dobro.
I love him so much already.	Već ga mnogo volim.
But that's okay.	Ali to je u redu.
That is not the case at all.	To uopšte nije tako.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Ne mora biti tako.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
That could never happen here.	To se ovdje nikada ne bi moglo dogoditi.
They can’t help us more than we can ourselves.	Oni nam ne mogu pomoći više nego mi sami sebi.
It's happening.	To se dešava.
Yes, that cannot be done.	Da, to se ne može uraditi.
Good, good for you.	Dobro, dobro za tebe.
But no one bought it.	Ali niko ga nije kupio.
It must be small.	Mora da je malo.
I know it shouldn't be that.	Znam da ne bi trebalo da bude to.
There was too much to do for it.	Bilo je previše toga da se uradi za to.
It works several times.	Radi nekoliko puta.
This time it was much better.	Ovaj put je bilo mnogo bolje.
That was really very good.	To je zaista bilo jako dobro.
This works fine.	Ovo radi dobro.
He might not be able to come back now.	Možda se sada ne bi mogao vratiti.
He talks to me a lot.	Mnogo priča sa mnom.
Except he didn't leave or anything.	Osim što nije otišao ili tako nešto.
I don't know why exactly.	Ne znam zašto tačno.
He was here.	Bio je ovdje.
You know, it can be very difficult.	Znate, to može biti jako teško.
Just say what you think.	Reci samo ono što misliš.
You have enough time.	Imaš dovoljno vremena.
Please do this.	Molim te, uradi ovo.
The truth is .	Istina je .
And it often works.	I često radi.
You know it's not going well.	Znaš da ne ide dobro.
She wants you to know that.	Ona želi da to znaš.
But she didn't say that either.	Ali ni ona to nije rekla.
You have something about you.	Imaš nešto o sebi.
I got the job.	Dobio sam posao.
He couldn't see yet.	Još nije mogao da vidi.
I know what you're thinking.	Znam šta misliš.
But you did it for me.	Ali ti si to uradio za mene.
If it were real, everyone would know.	Da je stvarno, svi bi znali.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
I can not tell you.	Ne mogu ti reći.
That's exactly it.	To je upravo to.
This afternoon, actually.	Danas popodne, zapravo.
I have no idea what to do now.	Nemam pojma šta da radim sada.
It works fine now.	Sada radi dobro.
Without people.	Bez ljudi.
He wants more money.	Želi više novca.
That in fact happened exactly what happened.	To se u stvari dogodilo upravo ono što se dogodilo.
She said she didn't know.	Rekla je da ne zna.
I'd like to see some of that.	Voleo bih da vidim nešto od toga.
One could say that it goes further than that.	Moglo bi se reći da ide i dalje od toga.
Tim knew it.	Tim je to znao.
I have to give it to you.	Moram ti to dati.
Is this nothing should.	Da li je ovo ništa ne bi trebalo.
Why? 	Zašto?
No, no and no.	Ne, ne i ne.
I see he might be better off here.	Vidim da mu je možda bolje ovdje.
I know this can't be easy for you.	Znam da ti ovo ne može biti lako.
I was not a friend.	Nisam bio prijatelj.
That is what is difficult.	To je ono što je teško.
Maybe you can tell me.	Možda mi možeš reći.
What is true for you is not true for everyone.	Ono što je istina za vas nije istina za sve.
I was never in favor of that.	Nikada nisam bio za to.
Or he thought he could.	Ili je mislio da može.
But it's not all bad either.	Ali nije ni sve loše.
I think that's all.	Mislim da je to sve.
But it seems not.	Ali izgleda da nije.
But nothing came of it.	Ali ništa nije bilo od toga.
Still haven't and never will.	Još uvijek nema i nikad neće.
It's not day.	Nije dan.
We do so much together now.	Sada radimo toliko toga zajedno.
This could be a problem.	Ovo bi mogao biti problem.
And it's not a very good story.	I nije baš dobra priča.
Oh that's good.	O to je dobro.
But they couldn't do it.	Ali oni to nisu mogli.
And they were right.	I bili su u pravu.
He never thought he would be.	Nikad nije mislio da će biti.
He knew he was human.	Znao je da je čovjek.
They will tell you.	Oni će ti reći.
He said he couldn't know.	Rekao je da ne može znati.
I was glad to see him.	Bilo mi je drago što sam ga vidio.
I'm so good now.	Sada sam tako dobar.
No money right now.	Trenutno nema novca.
Yes, and we're better off without it.	Da, i bolje nam je bez toga.
But maybe we should.	Ali možda bi trebali.
But usually it didn't.	Ali obično to nije činilo.
You can see it happening.	Možete vidjeti kako se to dešava.
He sees it now.	On to sada vidi.
We couldn't do that today.	Danas to nismo mogli.
What did they do to me?	Šta su mi uradili.
It may not always be easy.	Možda nije uvek lako.
He didn't expect that.	On to nije očekivao.
Now you know your father would do that.	Sada znaš da bi tvoj otac to uradio.
And he has something to say.	I ima šta da kaže.
He is not one and it never will be.	On nije jedan i to nikada neće biti.
You may get more money there.	Tamo ćete možda dobiti više novca.
This does not always happen.	Ovo se ne dešava uvek.
I would never want to see you.	Nikada te ne bih želio vidjeti.
You don't know what you're doing.	To ne znaš kao da radiš.
There is always tomorrow.	Uvek postoji sutra.
There and there and there.	Tamo i tamo i tamo.
Maybe she'll come to you.	Možda će ona doći kod tebe.
Pretty good, actually.	Prilično dobro, u stvari.
Your car was here.	Tvoj auto je bio ovdje.
You don't have to say it's okay.	Ne moraš reći da je to u redu.
I should know that by now.	Trebao bih to znati do sada.
This time he heard.	Ovaj put je čuo.
Nothing will ever be like that again.	Ništa više nikada neće biti tako.
You are in the house.	Vi ste u kući.
You can see it now.	Sada je možete vidjeti.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
Maybe it's just that.	Možda je to jednostavno tako.
And he obviously doesn't think there's anything wrong with that.	I očigledno ne misli da u tome nema ništa loše.
He's here as much as you are.	On ovde ima koliko i ti.
So we all knew what to do.	Tako da smo svi znali šta da radimo.
This happens often.	To se dešava često.
Just what you want.	Samo ono što želiš.
Life was good.	Život je bio dobar.
You're absolutely right, you are.	Potpuno si u pravu, jesi.
We could do that much better.	Mogli bismo to mnogo bolje.
No problem.	Nema problema.
I still have a lot of friends there.	I dalje imam mnogo prijatelja tamo.
More than just a few things.	Više od samo nekoliko stvari.
It's in us.	To je u nama.
But no one has done that yet.	Ali to još niko nije uradio.
It should now work properly.	Sada bi trebalo da radi kako treba.
They should have won.	Trebali su pobijediti.
That is no longer the case.	To više nije tako.
Not good.	Nije dobro.
I still want it.	I dalje to želim.
Usually no one was.	Obično niko nije bio.
I'm not sure either.	Ni ja nisam siguran.
Why are you even here?	Zašto si uopšte ovde?
I will help you.	Ja ću ti pomoći.
Neither are you.	Nisi ni ti.
It happened again.	Ponovo se dogodilo.
Who knows when he'll be back.	Ko zna kada će se vratiti.
But more can be done.	Ali više se može učiniti.
This is not a question of money.	Ovo nije pitanje novca.
I've never done this.	Nikad ovo nisam radio.
I have no idea about that.	Nemam pojma o tome.
Apparently not.	Očigledno nije.
It's hard to tell what's going on.	Teško je reći šta se dešava.
Something was wrong, he was sure.	Nešto nije u redu, bio je siguran.
I wonder what he wants.	Pitam se šta hoće.
He is doing something.	On nešto radi.
And nothing will bring you back.	I ništa te više neće vratiti.
Yes, yes, she knew what she had to do now.	Da, da, znala je šta sada treba da uradi.
But I saw something.	Ali video sam nešto.
I really like the guy.	Zaista mi se sviđa momak.
Like he's afraid of me or something.	Kao da se boji mene ili tako nešto.
She has what you need.	Ona ima ono što ti treba.
And something will be difficult.	A nešto će biti teško.
But they are there.	Ali oni su tamo.
It wasn't much.	Nije bilo mnogo.
That's what you tell him.	To je ono što mu ti kažeš.
Do as you wish.	Radite kako želite.
This was good.	Ovo je bilo dobro.
I know myself.	Znam sebe.
They didn't know many things.	Mnogo stvari nisu znali.
What they did and why.	Šta su uradili i zašto.
I think it's there now.	Mislim da je sada tamo.
Just not now.	Samo ne sada.
I didn't have to wonder why.	Nisam morao da se pitam zašto.
My friend meant well.	Moj prijatelj je mislio dobro.
If you only knew what it was.	Kad bi samo znao šta je to.
You must have known about it.	Mora da ste znali za to.
Or what is the truth.	Ili šta je istina.
I love being there.	Volim biti tamo.
He didn't need them anymore.	Nisu mu više trebali.
It doesn't look like much.	Ne izgleda mnogo.
But it couldn't be.	Ali to nije moglo biti.
I did it.	Ja sam to uradio.
It can be done quickly.	Može se brzo uraditi.
No one here could say what he thought.	Ovde niko nije mogao da kaže šta misli.
I thought you might have seen him.	Mislio sam da si ga možda vidio.
I am ready to work for you.	Spreman sam da radim za vas.
And another one soon.	A uskoro još jedan.
Maybe it was better here.	Možda je ovdje bilo bolje.
Maybe we won't.	Možda nećemo.
I just need to know how it happens.	Samo moram da znam kako se to dešava.
But it was never easy.	Ali to nikada nije bilo jednostavno.
Obviously not.	Očigledno je da nisu.
It’s not all work, but it’s not a game either.	Nije sve posao, ali ni igra.
And you are mine.	A ti si moj.
I hope he stays.	Nadam se da će ostati.
He said he could be.	Rekao je da bi mogao biti.
But maybe it is.	Ali, možda i jeste.
Your work, you did it last night.	Tvoj posao, uradio si ga sinoć.
Yes, it's not good.	Da, nije dobro.
I can't do it again.	Ne mogu ponovo.
I want to do it for myself.	Želim to učiniti za sebe.
I didn't know what to say about that either.	Ni ja nisam znao šta da kažem o tome.
They don't know what the truth is.	Oni ne znaju šta je istina.
I can't find it either.	Ni ja ga ne mogu naći.
If only he could see her now.	Kad bi samo mogao da je vidi sada.
Not all is bad.	Nije sve loše.
You're not anymore.	Nisi više.
No, you have to work on it.	Ne, moraš raditi na tome.
You just need to know.	Samo treba znati.
I'll go first.	Ja ću prvi.
I thought he was lost.	Mislio sam da se izgubio.
It doesn't just happen that way.	To se ne dešava samo tako.
There is no one like him.	Ne postoji niko kao on.
He says he'll be right back.	Kaže da će se odmah vratiti.
And now we know why.	A sada znamo zašto.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
You don't even know how it happened.	Ne znaš ni kako se to dogodilo.
That is not so.	To nije tako.
He never came back.	Nikad se nije vratio.
He was what he was.	Bio je ono što je bio.
He is safe here.	On je siguran ovdje.
And a lot of it is pretty good.	I dosta toga je prilično dobro.
I didn't always do that.	Nisam to uvek radio.
Easy enough to say that.	Dovoljno lako da to kažeš.
No, just don't do anything.	Ne, samo nemoj ništa raditi.
Everything but money.	Sve osim novca.
She loves him very much.	Ona ga jako voli.
We have to do both.	Moramo da uradimo oboje.
It seems to work.	Izgleda da radi.
They could be like you and me.	Mogli bi biti kao ja i ti.
But we know what to do.	Ali znamo šta da radimo.
And he's right.	I on je u pravu.
She works for me now.	Ona sada radi za mene.
They should be back already.	Trebali bi se već vratiti.
Not that it was good.	Nije da je bilo dobro.
They just don't know.	Oni jednostavno ne znaju.
But it is what it is.	Ali to je ono što jeste.
If you want.	Ako hoćeš.
That would be bad for business.	To bi bilo loše za posao.
You were helpful.	Bio si od pomoći.
There's something there.	Nešto je tamo.
If she's there.	Ako je ona tamo.
In fact, he never did.	U stvari, on to nikada nije uradio.
I won't have to be alone.	Neću morati sam.
He hasn't received it yet.	Još ga nije dobio.
The money is still there.	Novac je još tu.
I wonder if that is not true.	Pitam se da li to nije istina.
Everyone knew.	Svi su znali.
Even one is too many.	Čak i jedan je previše.
Even if she doesn't want to.	Čak i ako ona to ne želi.
But he can't.	Ali ne može.
Not often enough.	Ne dovoljno često.
No, no, not just a game.	Ne, ne, ne samo igra.
Which .	Koji .
And that is it.	I to je to.
How few of us.	Kako nas je malo.
This would take a long time.	Za ovo bi trebalo mnogo vremena.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
It doesn't work that way.	To ne radi tako.
But he would look like that.	Ali on bi tako izgledao.
This was not.	Ovo nije bilo.
Now with that.	Sada sa tim.
Except it is.	Osim što jeste.
This is not like from time to time.	Ovo nije kao s vremena na vrijeme.
You just have to know how.	Samo moraš znati kako.
That's none of your business.	To nije tvoj posao.
In a way that has never been the case before.	Na način na koji to nikada ranije nije bilo.
Yes, he is good.	Da, on je dobar.
That was not what he expected.	To nije bilo ono što je očekivao.
But we don't know what it is.	Ali ne znamo šta je to.
The man was looking for what he could get.	Čovjek je tražio ono što je mogao dobiti.
You didn't say that.	Nisi to rekao.
I like that one too.	Sviđa mi se i taj.
Or, better yet, both.	Ili, još bolje, oboje.
And we do more than that.	I radimo više od toga.
It must be soon.	Mora biti uskoro.
He has everything he needs to do.	Ima sve što treba da uradi.
She would never be.	Nikada ne bi bila.
I understood immediately.	Odmah sam shvatio.
Maybe it's not there.	Možda nije tamo.
He told me he was fine.	Rekao mi je da je dobro.
But it does no good.	Ali to ne čini dobro.
We can't trust him.	Ne možemo mu vjerovati.
I love you, but you are not mine.	Volim te, ali nisi moj.
But we know what we have to do.	Ali znamo šta treba da radimo.
Who could talk.	Ko bi mogao da priča.
It was, now, a little before three.	Bilo je, sada, nešto prije tri.
Why didn't he come home last night.	Zašto nije došao kući sinoć.
Not yet, and maybe never.	Ne još, a možda nikad.
I should tell you tonight.	Trebao bih ti reći večeras.
And the man will say.	I čovjek će reći.
It's not right.	Nije u redu.
I am working on that.	Radim na tome.
You can tell me tomorrow.	Možeš mi reći sutra.
I'm not sure why this is happening.	Nisam siguran zašto se to dešava.
I want it now.	Želim sada.
This is not a game.	Ovo nije igra.
You look good.	Izgledaš dobro.
You can only do what you can do.	Možeš samo ono što možeš.
He was right and she knew it.	Bio je u pravu i ona je to znala.
Not a day more.	Ni dan više.
The job is not.	Posao nije.
In fact, it's all of us.	U stvari, to smo svi mi.
I don't want to say.	Ne želim reći.
And it should have been.	I trebao je biti.
They had tonight.	Imali su večeras.
As we shall see, this is indeed the case.	Kao što ćemo vidjeti, to je zaista tako.
But there was very little time.	Ali bilo je vrlo malo vremena.
I mean, somebody had to do it.	Mislim, neko je to morao da uradi.
This was not good.	Ovo nije bilo dobro.
It's not life either.	Nije ni život.
He was fine.	Bio je dobro.
He'll just say no.	Samo će reći ne.
I haven't seen much.	Nisam mnogo vidio.
I wonder who that might be.	Pitam se ko bi to mogao biti.
I was better at it.	Bio sam bolji u tome.
There weren't many of them there.	Nije ih bilo mnogo tamo.
None of that is true now.	Ništa od toga sada nije istina.
Nothing was ever good enough.	Nikad ništa nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
It doesn't say anymore.	To više ne govori.
Will go again this week.	Ići će ponovo ove sedmice.
And someone came back and asked.	I neko se vratio i tražio.
But more people could do it than now.	Ali više ljudi bi to moglo učiniti nego sada.
I've seen her many times, you know.	Vidio sam je više puta, znaš.
It's always day.	Uvek je dan.
But that is not true at all.	Ali to uopšte nije istina.
No, we wouldn't.	Ne, ne bismo.
But there were a few problems.	Ali bilo je nekoliko problema.
No one came for us.	Niko nije došao po nas.
I always work.	Ja uvek radim.
And it was there ,.	I bilo je tamo,.
You should see her.	Trebali bi je vidjeti.
Maybe it was yesterday.	Možda je to bilo juče.
I did a pretty good job.	Uradio sam prilično dobar posao.
Yeah, he's a pretty good guy.	Da, on je prilično dobar momak.
If only it were a job.	Samo da je to bio posao.
I don't anymore.	Ja više ne.
And much more.	I mnogo više.
Nobody but you.	Niko osim tebe.
I didn't want to go there.	Nisam htela da idem tamo.
But there is more.	Ali ima još toga.
She knew she couldn't stay.	Znala je da ne može ostati.
Yes, you haven't said anything for a long time.	Da, dugo niste ništa rekli.
Maybe there's something there.	Možda ima nešto tamo.
I want help.	Želim pomoć.
He's just doing it to say he tried.	On to radi samo da kaže da je pokušao.
Everything works fine.	Sve radi dobro.
They did it.	Oni su to uradili.
Yes, we are here too.	Da, i mi smo tu.
I decided.	Odlučio sam se.
I mean, someone you can talk to.	Mislim, neko sa kim možeš razgovarati.
Let's do this again.	Uradimo ovo ponovo.
Like it was his first time.	Kao da mu je to bio prvi put.
He likes to do those things.	Voli da radi te stvari.
I ask him to be safe.	Molim ga da bude siguran.
But even that is often quite a bit.	Ali, i to je često prilično malo.
But only a little.	Ali samo malo.
That was before.	To je bilo prije.
I decided to be alone.	Odlučio sam da budem sam.
I love you and I have always loved you.	Volim te i uvek sam te voleo.
But it never works.	Ali to nikad ne radi.
Yesterday I felt a little down.	Jučer mi je bilo malo.
And that is very good to know.	I to je jako dobro znati.
I want to go.	Želim ići.
You don't need anything from me.	Ne treba ti ništa od mene.
Actually, no one was quite sure.	Zapravo, niko nije bio baš siguran.
True, that's all.	Istina, to je sve.
It had to be done quickly.	To je trebalo brzo da se uradi.
I have to do all that.	Moram da uradim sve to.
We must work together for what may yet be.	Moramo raditi zajedno za ono što još može biti.
What will come will come.	Šta će doći, doći će.
I won't be here long.	Neću dugo biti ovdje.
He has a friend who wants it.	Ima prijatelja koji to želi.
And no one did anything.	I niko ništa nije uradio.
And with you.	I kod tebe.
Who, why, how.	Ko, zašto, kako.
One day was just one day.	Jedan dan je bio samo jedan dan.
I may not see him.	Možda ga neću vidjeti.
This may or may not be a problem.	To može ili ne mora biti problem.
He realized that himself.	To je sam shvatio.
There is nothing to see there.	Tamo nema šta da se vidi.
But he could still see.	Ali i dalje je mogao da vidi.
He came to me.	Došao je do mene.
He asked for more.	Tražio je više.
I'm done with you from now on.	Završio sam s tobom od sada.
He said he hoped everything would be fine.	Rekao je da se nada da će sve biti u redu.
There are so many people.	Ima toliko ljudi.
Another one might be coming.	Još jedan bi mogao doći.
You could say that now.	Mogao bi to reći i sada.
Yes and me.	Da, i ja.
He saw it happen.	Video je da se to dešava.
But you can't do anything.	Ali ne možete ništa učiniti.
I really don't know anymore.	Zaista više ne znam.
Maybe for him it is.	Možda za njega i jeste.
But the problem is.	Ali problem je.
He had a bad day.	Imao je loš dan.
That's just the way it is.	To je jednostavno tako.
I don't think we know.	Mislim da ne znamo.
And you just know.	A ti jednostavno znaš.
But that doesn't happen.	Ali to se ne dešava.
And again, and again, and again.	I ponovo, i ponovo, i ponovo.
It was good to be home.	Bilo je dobro biti kod kuće.
That's not it.	To nije to.
That's exactly what he did.	To je upravo ono što je uradio.
We have to do things, but we can't.	Moramo da radimo stvari, ali ne možemo.
He had no idea if that was the right path.	Nije imao pojma da li je to pravi put.
This was so easy now.	Ovo je sada bilo tako lako.
She was no longer a person.	Ona više nije bila osoba.
This really may not be easy for you.	Ovo vam zaista možda neće biti lako.
He told me he was sorry.	Rekao mi je da mu je žao.
Life goes on.	Život ide dalje.
That's good and good.	To je dobro i dobro.
That's exactly what you want.	To je ono što tačno želite.
That's how he should have known me.	Po tome me je trebao znati.
John was that.	John je bio to.
But it will not be easy.	Ali to neće biti lako.
She didn't know any better.	Nije znala za bolje.
He would never tell anyone.	Nikad nikome ne bi rekao.
So everything is fine.	Tako da je sve u redu.
It might even come in handy.	Moglo bi ti čak i dobro doći.
He thinks this is a good idea.	On misli da je ovo dobra ideja.
There is so much to see and do.	Ima toliko toga da se vidi i uradi.
But it's not going well.	Ali ne ide dobro.
What is that.	Što je to.
That’s more than it seems.	To je više nego što se čini.
I wish we had time.	Voleo bih da smo imali vremena.
Very, very few people do that.	Vrlo, vrlo malo ljudi to radi.
She knew that now.	Sada je to znala.
I do not work.	Ne radim.
You couldn't say why.	Nisi mogao reći zašto.
He was really there.	On je zaista bio tamo.
Yes, it takes time.	Da, treba vremena.
They had a party.	Imali su zabavu.
The way he thinks.	Način na koji on misli.
But he thought he was.	Ali on je mislio da jeste.
But that's how it often seemed to me.	Ali tako mi se često činilo.
I don't know anything.	Ne znam ništa.
Today was obviously not a good day.	Danas očigledno nije bio dobar dan.
I thought you should see it.	Mislio sam da bi trebao to vidjeti.
If only you were.	Samo da jesi.
I know what you're thinking.	Znam šta misliš.
Really, really.	Zaista, stvarno.
That's not a good way.	To nije dobar put.
I've always been here.	Uvijek sam bio ovdje.
But that may not be enough.	Ali to možda neće biti dovoljno.
There were more of them than us.	Bilo ih je više nego nas.
I'm just ready.	Upravo sam spreman.
It's for us.	Za nas je.
How much time do you have?	Koliko vremena imaš.
Good thing you did.	Dobro je da jeste.
It will come soon.	Doći će uskoro.
And it's so good.	I tako je dobro.
I never really know.	Nikad stvarno ne znam.
That was something.	To je bilo nešto.
He expected this.	Očekivao je ovo.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ne znam šta je bilo s njim.
I will believe you.	Ja ću ti vjerovati.
We can leave when the time comes.	Možemo otići kad dođe vrijeme.
I didn't even see that coming.	Nisam ni vidio da će to doći.
It was really easy.	Bilo je zaista lako.
Now we know what they are.	Sada znamo šta su.
This is the first.	Ovo je prvi.
You can go back to dinner.	Možeš se vratiti na večeru.
I don't know how that can be.	Ne znam kako to može biti.
Nothing yet, he decided.	Još ništa, odlučio je.
It's just good business.	To je samo dobar posao.
Someone will probably be there soon.	Neko će verovatno uskoro biti tamo.
Simple is always better.	Jednostavno je uvijek bolje.
And he would have to.	I morao bi.
That makes us.	To nas čini .
I'm just wondering if anyone can help me.	Samo se pitam može li mi neko pomoći.
They will never work.	Oni nikada neće raditi.
She's been there before.	Bila je tamo ranije.
Now no one can help.	Sada niko ne može pomoći.
All this time no one said anything.	Sve ovo vrijeme niko ništa nije rekao.
He always wants to do things the right way.	On uvek želi da uradi stvari na pravi način.
It's this one.	To je ovaj.
I'll find one for you.	Naći ću jedan za tebe.
But that was not enough.	Ali to nije bilo dovoljno.
We could go to school tonight.	Mogli bi i školu večeras.
Much more can and should be done.	Mnogo više se može i treba uraditi.
And we will be better for it.	I za to ćemo biti sve bolji.
No, he said, he was sorry.	Ne, rekao je, žao mu je.
I like to know much better.	Volim da znam mnogo bolje.
It didn't happen that way.	Nije se tako dogodilo.
Or they could have both.	Ili su mogli oboje.
I felt sorry for him.	Bilo mi je žao zbog njega.
It's much better.	Mnogo je bolje.
That must have been fast.	To je sigurno bilo brzo.
Nothing for that.	Ništa za to.
We just have to say.	Moramo samo reći.
I can't do that.	Ne mogu to učiniti.
He doesn't say anything.	On ne govori ništa.
I know a lot of things.	Znam puno stvari.
I knew there would be more.	Znao sam da će biti još.
It just didn't seem right.	Samo se nije činilo u redu.
We have a really good team.	Imamo zaista dobar tim.
We know we can trust him.	Znamo da možemo vjerovati u njega.
I want my best.	Želim sve od sebe.
He wanted more.	Želio je više.
Not now.	Sada nije.
He better not know.	Bolje da ne zna.
Like around the house.	Kao po kući.
This time, not so much.	Ovaj put, ne toliko.
We both knew.	Oboje smo znali.
It seemed unlikely.	Činilo se malo vjerovatno.
So far I've done both.	Do sada sam radio oboje.
He came so hard this morning.	Jutros je došao tako teško.
That should be it for me.	To bi trebalo da bude za mene.
He went to work.	Otišao je na posao.
He probably thinks that no one is good enough for me.	Verovatno misli da niko nije dovoljno dobar za mene.
Again, and again, and again.	Ponovo, i ponovo i ponovo.
They always have.	Uvek su imali.
That's a good thing.	To je dobra stvar.
I really want to see him again before he leaves.	Zaista ga želim ponovo vidjeti prije nego što ode.
Last night, three times.	Sinoć, tri puta.
It was like I was back in school again.	Bilo je kao da sam se ponovo vratio u školu.
They can still be a team.	Oni i dalje mogu biti tim.
It was also good.	Bilo je i dobro.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Činilo se da sve ide kako treba.
It's better than before.	Bolje je nego prije.
Much more my thing.	Mnogo više moja stvar.
But you had to come back.	Ali morao si se vratiti.
You are nothing.	Ti nisi ništa.
We didn't have anything to do for a while.	Neko vrijeme nismo imali šta dalje.
And, indeed, you could have done better.	I, zaista, mogao si bolje.
There was no money.	Nije bilo novca.
That's very good.	To je veoma dobro.
She can't let him see.	Ne može mu dozvoliti da vidi.
They said yes.	Oni su rekli da.
Yes, he tried.	Da, pokušao je.
He doesn't seem to want to help anyone.	Čini se da on nikome ne želi pomoći.
He should do something.	Trebalo bi da uradi nešto.
He knows what we're doing.	On zna šta radimo.
You really should.	Zaista bi trebalo.
Just a little longer.	Samo još malo.
Maybe it was time.	Možda je to bilo vrijeme.
You don't need a car here.	Ovdje vam ne treba auto.
I don't think so.	Ne mislim ni malo.
It looks bad.	Izgleda loše.
Nobody like that anymore.	Niko više tako.
But that won't happen.	Ali to se neće dogoditi.
He only has you.	On samo tebe ima.
This is both good and bad for you.	Ovo je i dobro i loše za vas.
It's just not done anymore.	To se jednostavno više ne radi.
He was always with us.	Uvek je bio sa nama.
He had never seen him look like this before.	Nikad ga prije nije vidio tako da izgleda.
We like it a lot.	Jako nam se sviđa.
Indeed, there.	Zaista, tu.
I think so.	Mislim da je to tako.
They are just people.	Oni su samo ljudi.
He heard everything.	Čuo je sve.
I really did my best.	Zaista sam dao sve od sebe.
He didn't know which one.	Nije znao koje.
You started it.	Ti si počeo.
I'm the new guy.	Ja sam novi momak.
I gave you a few.	Dao sam ti nekoliko.
All of this works well.	Sve ovo dobro radi.
But that's not exactly true.	Ali to baš i nije tačno.
Now it's easy.	Sada je lako.
Speaking of which.	Kad smo kod toga.
I see no reason why not.	Ne vidim razlog zašto ne.
He seemed to have nothing more to say.	Činilo se da više nema šta da kaže.
Nothing ever happened.	Nikad se ništa nije dogodilo.
They are already on it.	Već su na tome.
That's him, all right.	To je on, u redu.
But it can't be helped.	Ali ne može se pomoći.
And more and more.	I sve više i više.
He is alone.	On je sam.
This we know.	Ovo znamo.
We are here alone.	Ovdje smo sami.
You haven't seen anything yet.	Još ništa nisi video.
That's why you do it.	Zbog toga to radiš.
In fact, everyone should be here soon.	U stvari, svi bi uskoro trebali biti ovdje.
And now it's not.	A sada nije.
It will always be yours.	Uvek će biti tvoj.
It was, and is, a question of power.	Bilo je, i jeste pitanje moći.
Who did it, she said.	Ko je to uradio, rekla je.
I want to see him.	Želim da ga vidim.
He promised me so much.	Obećao mi je toliko toga.
She told herself she was not alone.	Rekla je sebi da nije sama.
But not here and not now.	Ali ne ovdje i ne sada.
The reason we're here.	Razlog zašto smo ovdje.
He doesn't want to be given anything.	Ne želi ništa da mu se da.
I can't see him.	Ne mogu da ga vidim.
They shouldn't be together.	Ne bi trebali biti zajedno.
Long, but easy.	Dugo, ali lako.
And she wants her life.	I ona želi svoj život.
Like I can see it.	Kao da vidim to.
I was glad it was her.	Bilo mi je drago da je to ona.
I've had it before.	Imao sam to ranije.
But she knew.	Ali znala je.
That's the only way.	To je jedini način.
He came back to me.	Vratio se kod mene.
He was sure it was her.	Bio je siguran da je to ona.
It's a job.	To je posao.
And that is true.	I to je istina.
I like the job.	Sviđa mi se posao.
It's true.	To je tačno.
I'm not sure what to think about that.	Nisam siguran šta da mislim o tome.
He loves you so much.	On te toliko voli.
Never, or almost never.	Nikad, ili skoro nikad.
But not for a while.	Ali ne još neko vrijeme.
It looks easy enough.	Izgleda dovoljno lako.
We are all working on it.	Svi radimo na tome.
Back in the day, that was a thing.	U ono vrijeme, to je bila stvar.
Where are they now?.	Gdje su oni sada?.
But they are of no help to anyone.	Ali nikome nisu od pomoći.
Like him.	Kao i on.
Maybe that's true.	Možda je to istina.
It was really bad.	Bilo je stvarno loše.
That's just not what they were about.	To jednostavno nije ono o čemu su bili.
I don't mean to do that.	Ne mislim to da uradim.
I can do what I like.	Mogu raditi ono što mi je drago.
This is obviously very bad.	Ovo je očigledno veoma loše.
I have to do this.	Moram ovo da uradim.
I love to see that one.	Volim vidjeti taj.
Everything is by itself.	Sve je samo po sebi.
Or just one.	Ili samo jedan.
He just told the truth.	Samo je rekao istinu.
It's totally fine.	Potpuno je u redu.
They knew we could be trusted.	Znali su da nam se može vjerovati.
You would do it, you said.	Ti bi to uradio, rekao si.
I'm ready for anything.	Spreman sam na sve.
Let me see .	Da vidim .
She didn't tell him she loved him anymore.	Više mu nije rekla da ga voli.
Can you ever see this happening.	Možete li ikada vidjeti da se ovo dešava.
It may be simple, but it is not easy.	Možda je jednostavno, ali nije lako.
I guess that's something to do.	Pretpostavljam da je to nešto za uraditi.
He liked to be good at it.	Voleo je da bude dobar u tome.
It's not for me.	Nije za mene.
I don't see the car.	Ne vidim auto.
I have nothing to do.	Nemam šta raditi.
Maybe nothing at all.	Možda baš ništa.
And there was nothing we could do.	I nismo mogli ništa učiniti.
I wouldn't know what to say.	Ne bih znao šta da kažem.
But she didn't say anything about it.	Ali nije rekla ništa o tome.
He loves us both.	On nas oboje voli.
There's something wrong.	Nešto nije u redu.
Like never before.	Kao nikad.
You can't tell anyone.	Ne možete nikome reći.
Everything works fine.	Sve radi dobro.
I love that we don't know.	Volim to što ne znamo.
That will be all for today.	To će biti sve za danas.
We are still new.	Još smo novi.
I can't be sure.	Ne mogu biti siguran.
They knew about it.	Znali su za to.
She still looks good.	Ona i dalje dobro izgleda.
That just wouldn’t be right.	To jednostavno ne bi bilo u redu.
It shouldn't be a problem for you.	Ne bi trebao biti problem za tebe.
They told me to tell you.	Rekli su mi da ti kažem.
Any.	Bilo koji.
So we didn't tell anyone.	Tako da nikome nismo rekli.
We are glad.	Drago nam je.
And, there is nothing wrong with that.	I, nema ništa loše u tome.
Only a few people can do that.	Samo nekoliko ljudi to može.
And much more.	I još mnogo toga.
I only know a little.	Znam samo malo.
Now you have to go back.	Sada se moraš vratiti.
I'm really for him.	Zaista sam za njega.
It's not hard to find.	Nije je teško naći.
I'm a little alone.	Malo sam.
And they should have.	I trebali su.
Nobody really said anything.	Niko zaista ništa nije rekao.
I didn't know why.	Nisam znao zašto.
I thought that was not a good idea.	Mislio sam da to nije dobra ideja.
More soon.	Uskoro više.
I loved that it was.	Voleo sam da jeste.
He doesn't do that.	On to ne radi.
Little by little.	Malo po malo.
That would be pretty good now.	Sada bi to bilo prilično dobro.
I know you and I already love you.	Znam te i već te volim.
This was yesterday.	Ovo je bilo juče.
He would be a good guy to work for.	Bio bi dobar momak za koga bi radio.
Maybe it was all real.	Možda je sve bilo stvarno.
He knew what to do.	Znao je šta treba da uradi.
This is usually not a problem.	To obično nije problem.
To the house.	Do kuće.
He had had enough.	Bilo mu je dosta.
Nothing with you.	Ništa sa tobom.
If there are any.	Ako ih ima.
I just want to know sooner.	Samo želim da znam ranije.
I don't know for sure.	Ne znam sigurno.
I didn't mean to buy it either.	Ni ja to nisam mislio kupiti.
He wants to do it himself.	Želi da to uradi sam.
I just had to come.	Jednostavno sam morao doći.
She told me all about it.	Rekla mi je sve o tome.
Everyone would be better off.	Svima bi bilo bolje.
It wasn't all right.	Nije bilo sve u redu.
I never said that.	Nikad to nisam rekao.
But that can no longer be helped.	Ali tome se više ne može pomoći.
He made one.	Napravio je jedan.
And that this is true.	I da je ovo istina.
I wish this had happened many years ago.	Volio bih da se ovo dogodilo prije mnogo godina.
They are wrong, and we are right.	Oni nisu u pravu, a mi smo u pravu.
But there is much more here.	Ali ovdje ima mnogo više.
She works harder.	Ona radi više.
I should have helped.	Trebao sam pomoći.
No one ever talks about it.	Niko nikad ne priča o tome.
She has no time for me.	Ona nema vremena za mene.
And they know better.	I oni znaju bolje.
It's not real.	Nije stvarno.
It’s not as simple as you think.	Nije tako jednostavno kao što mislite.
Either it would or it wouldn't.	Ili bi ili ne bi.
A lot of things.	Puno stvari.
Just to be sure.	Samo da budem siguran.
There were too many of them.	Bilo ih je previše.
Even you can see it.	Čak i ti to možeš vidjeti.
So far so good.	Za sada je sve u redu.
He likes to talk.	On voli da priča.
It is what it was.	To je ono što je bilo.
What is a.	Šta je a.
Except maybe not so much.	Osim možda ne toliko.
But he has me.	Ali on ima mene.
No one talks to him.	Niko ne priča sa njim.
But he would never admit it.	Ali on to nikada ne bi priznao.
No one ever said they saw this.	Niko nikada nije rekao da je video ovo.
More than before.	Više nego ranije.
It's not like that.	Nije baš tako.
We know things are bad.	Znamo da su stvari loše.
That was a lot for me.	To je bilo puno za mene.
But this is a good story.	Ali ovo je dobra priča.
So many people.	Toliko ljudi.
They won't.	Neće.
I still think he can do it.	I dalje mislim da on to može.
That was me.	To sam bio ja.
Apparently that was it.	Očigledno je to bilo to.
Like, a long time.	Kao, dugo.
Maybe he's fine.	Možda je on dobro.
It doesn't need to be done anymore.	Ne treba više da se radi.
Three powers.	Tri moći.
Only he would have returned by now unless .	Samo bi se on do sada vratio osim ako .
All we have is money.	Sve što imamo je novac.
But not very fast.	Ali nije jako brzo.
This was more.	Ovo je bilo više.
But that's the way it is for now.	Ali to je tako za sada.
It is.	Da jeste.
I can't get to it.	Ne mogu doći do toga.
Actually, I can't.	U stvari, ne mogu.
I love everything.	Volim sve.
All alone.	Sve sami.
I know you're there.	Znam da si tamo.
That's what I need.	Tako mi treba.
That's the problem, he decided.	To je problem, odlučio je.
Now he had his money.	Sada je imao svoj novac.
Just so people know it's still there.	Samo da ljudi znaju da je još uvijek tu.
They know more than I do.	Oni znaju više od mene.
It just took time.	Jednostavno je trebalo vremena.
And they did.	I to su uradili.
The more the better.	Što više, to bolje.
I'd have enough trouble.	Imao bih dovoljno problema.
I didn't expect to see you here.	Nisam očekivao da ću te vidjeti ovdje.
It often was.	Često je bilo.
I was pretty good at it.	Bio sam prilično dobar u tome.
You were right the first time.	Bio si u pravu prvi put.
It's for everything, or it's nothing.	To je za sve, ili nije ništa.
But everything works.	Ali sve radi.
Even that is too much.	Čak je i to previše.
I certainly don't want that again.	To sigurno ne želim ponovo.
And, actually, it was.	I, zapravo, bilo je.
Now he knew everything.	Sada je znao sve.
That's it.	To je to.
Like her.	Kao i ona.
This is what.	Ovo je šta.
Wear it like it's me.	Nosi ga kao da sam ja.
I could tell he didn't know what to say.	Mogao sam reći da ne zna šta da kaže.
Not very good.	Nije baš dobar.
There were more problems.	Bilo je više problema.
We really did it.	Zaista smo to uradili.
It was so good to be with him again.	Bilo je tako dobro ponovo biti s njim.
He just isn’t ready for it.	On jednostavno nije spreman za to.
You can't help me.	Ne možeš mi pomoći.
It better be good.	Bolje da je dobro.
Many people live there.	Tamo živi mnogo ljudi.
He would leave.	On bi otišao.
This is for me.	Ovo je za mene.
It was anything but that.	Bilo je sve samo ne to.
But only me.	Ali samo ja.
No one saw him again.	Niko ga više nije video.
She wants it for herself.	Ona to želi za sebe.
But it never is.	Ali nikada nije.
But that was small.	Ali to je bilo malo.
He left today too! 	I danas je otišao!
But not always.	Ali nije uvek.
I have too much money for work.	Imam previše novca za posao.
I didn't want to.	Nisam htela.
He should say without doing anything.	Trebalo bi da kaže a da ništa ne uradi.
That's a problem for me.	Za mene je to problem.
It is now.	Sada jeste.
No, this was not the way.	Ne, ovo nije bio put.
She was always there.	Ona je uvek bila tu.
I love them too.	I ja ih volim.
And that's not right.	A to nije u redu.
Or just a little of both !.	Ili samo po malo od oboje!.
He told me that many times.	Rekao mi je to mnogo puta.
She tells everyone.	Ona govori svima.
He should have lived.	Trebao je da živi.
Maybe that was the problem.	Možda je to bio problem.
I can't find anything here.	Ne mogu naći ništa ovdje.
But she was right.	Ali bila je u pravu.
Certainly the first.	Sigurno prvi.
You can reach a lot of people.	Možete doći do mnogo ljudi.
He was never good at it.	Nikada nije bio dobar u tome.
But she knew enough.	Ali znala je dovoljno.
And we have.	I imamo.
He knows it, but he doesn't.	On to zna, ali ne zna.
Yes, it's as good as the first one.	Da, dobar je kao i prvi.
We must and must work together.	Moramo i moramo raditi zajedno.
She didn't want me anymore.	Nije me više htela.
But he wouldn't.	Ali on ne bi.
Or maybe we won't.	Ili možda nećemo.
You shouldn't come to me.	Ne bi trebao doći kod mene.
Who wants, wants.	Ko hoće, hoće.
We would be if we had to.	Bili bismo da moramo.
He decided to do it.	Odlučio je to učiniti.
We know so little.	Tako malo znamo.
That's something, isn't it?	To je nešto, zar ne?
Maybe nothing would have happened.	Možda se ništa ne bi dogodilo.
I had to move on.	Morao sam da idem dalje.
I had enough money.	Imao sam dovoljno novca.
But there is.	Ali postoji.
It's too much.	Previše je.
Apparently both happened.	Očigledno se dogodilo oboje.
We didn't know anything.	Nismo znali ništa.
I made it yesterday.	Jučer sam ga napravio.
I don't want to work.	Ne želim da radim.
Not anything, actually.	Ne ništa, u stvari.
We were all supposed to meet here.	Svi smo se trebali naći ovdje.
We have so many friends there.	Imamo toliko prijatelja tamo.
I didn't say this.	Nisam ovo rekao.
I want fast.	Želim brzo.
He would do it.	On bi to uradio.
You just have to trust me.	Samo mi moraš vjerovati.
You're the one.	Ti si taj.
Yes, it's true, yes.	Da, istina je, da.
People are ideas.	Ljudi su ideja.
You have to know they were.	Morate znati da su bili.
She can't say no.	Ona ne može reći ne.
The car has arrived.	Auto je stigao.
Maybe in a day.	Možda za koji dan.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.	Siguran sam da će uskoro doći.
I really thought that for a long time.	Zaista sam to dugo mislio.
I didn't say that.	Nisam to rekao.
And maybe he just needs a job.	A možda mu samo treba posao.
He shouldn't do that.	Ne bi trebao to da radi.
It wasn't a problem.	Nije bio problem.
Someone had to be it.	Neko je to morao biti.
This will not be easy in any way.	Ovo ni na koji način neće biti lako.
Really good.	Zaista dobro.
I think the truth will prevail.	Mislim da će istina pobijediti.
He wanted to be nothing.	Želeo je da bude ništa.
He wasn't at home.	Nije bio kod kuće.
She is a good person.	Ona je dobra osoba.
She can drive again.	Ona može ponovo da vozi.
And no.	I ne.
It's fine for you.	U redu je za tebe.
I don't like many people.	Ne volim mnogo ljudi.
He wants to come home.	On se želi vratiti kući.
Nobody loves you yet.	Još te niko ne voli.
I'm sorry, but it's not working.	Žao mi je, ali ne radi.
It might not be this year, but it will.	Možda neće biti ove godine, ali hoće.
They can too.	Mogu i oni.
You know this.	Znaš ovo.
That's what I told myself.	To sam sebi rekao.
At the time that was all.	U to vrijeme to je bilo sve.
There was so much.	Bilo je toliko toga.
Actually, it's not me.	Zapravo nisam ja.
He wears them to school for a few days.	Nosi ih nekoliko dana u školu.
John would have none of that.	John ne bi imao ništa od toga.
But yes, he is right.	Ali da, on je u pravu.
In fact, it's neither good nor bad.	U stvari, nije ni dobro ni loše.
It's all about power.	Sve je u moći.
Maybe it's more.	Možda je i više.
Now we need someone new.	Sada nam treba neko novi.
But they seemed sure of it.	Ali činilo se da su sigurni u to.
He didn't know she was here.	Nije znao da je ona ovdje.
Probably not.	Verovatno nije.
I didn't always know that.	Nisam to uvijek znao.
There really wasn't much to it.	Zaista nije bilo puno toga.
I saw you weren't sure.	Vidio sam da nisi siguran.
It should never have happened.	To se nikada nije trebalo dogoditi.
What is happening to me.	Šta mi se dešava.
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
He had never seen them before.	Nikad ih prije nije vidio.
Indeed, he probably was.	Zaista, vjerovatno je i bio.
It should be fine.	Trebao bi biti dobro.
I thought you knew.	Mislio sam da znaš.
We do not know.	Ne znamo.
The car came.	Auto je došao.
He was .	On je bio .
He does what he wants.	Radi šta želi.
I have everything to do.	Imam sve da uradim.
They could do no wrong for him.	Za njega nisu mogli učiniti ništa loše.
It happens so many times.	To se dešava toliko puta.
But not this time.	Ali, ne ovaj put.
But it wasn't like work.	Ali to nije bilo kao posao.
Is it true.	Da li je tačno.
I bought a lot of things for you.	Kupio sam puno stvari za tebe.
He didn't like him.	Nije ga volio.
And nothing will be done.	I ništa se neće uraditi.
I love them.	Ja ih volim.
You have what you want.	Imaš šta želiš.
I can't be with you anymore.	Ne mogu više sa tobom.
I will work for you.	Ja ću raditi za tebe.
To this day she has not said anything about it.	Do danas nije ništa rekla o tome.
Now you like it.	Sada ti se sviđa.
It's not even right.	Nije ni u redu.
But he wasn't sure he could.	Ali nije bio siguran da bi mogao.
A lot has happened so far.	Do sada se mnogo toga dogodilo.
Only, not everything is so simple.	Samo, nije sve tako jednostavno.
They could not give.	Nisu mogli dati.
But do it quickly.	Ali uradi to brzo.
In his own way.	Na svoj način.
And maybe they're right.	I možda su u pravu.
I hope someone can help.	Nadam se da neko može pomoći.
There were no thoughts.	Nije bilo misli.
I mean, nobody.	Mislim, niko.
I have to have this car.	Moram da imam ovaj auto.
I was about it.	Bio sam o tome.
He can't trust anyone.	Ne može nikome vjerovati.
I have something to do.	Imam nešto da radim.
He is a very good friend.	On je veoma dobar prijatelj.
Does anyone know why? 	Zna li neko zašto?
It's so easy for you.	To je tako lako za tebe.
There is nothing, but everything seems.	Nema ništa, ali sve izgleda.
I couldn't do it.	Nisam mogao to da uradim.
He's never heard of you.	Nikad nije čuo za tebe.
None of us speak.	Niko od nas ne govori.
I wish it was real.	Voleo bih da je stvarno.
And that's exactly what you're going to have to do.	I to je upravo ono što ćete morati da uradite.
She has to see for herself what's here.	Mora sama da vidi šta je ovde.
You know you would.	Znaš da bi.
But there is much more here.	Ali ovdje ima još mnogo toga.
He would say that.	On bi to rekao.
Something like what's here.	Nešto kao ono što je ovdje.
We need more than that.	Treba nam više od toga.
You either work or you don't.	Ili radiš ili ne.
I already know you're bad.	Već znam da si loš.
But we can't say which one goes first.	Ali ne možemo reći koji ide prvi.
He seems to know how to play.	Izgleda da zna da igra.
I think he can play on.	Mislim da može da igra dalje.
I wouldn't say no.	Ne bih rekao ne.
And they are just the ones we know about.	A oni su samo oni za koje znamo.
I'm sure of that.	Siguran sam u to.
Without that, they wouldn't exist.	Bez toga ih ne bi bilo.
You don't have to be so bad.	Ne moraš biti tako loš.
I wouldn't do that.	Ne bih to uradio.
We cannot be sure of that.	U to ne možemo biti sigurni.
Everything would be fine.	Sve bi bilo u redu.
She wasn't home enough.	Nije bila dovoljno kod kuće.
They knew there was nothing they could do, not yet.	Znali su da ne mogu ništa učiniti, još ne.
So far, not bad.	Za sada, nije loše.
But nothing happens.	Ali ništa se ne dešava.
We will find a way.	Naći ćemo način.
He loves you.	Voli te.
And not in the way you think.	I to ne na način na koji mislite.
Nobody loves Me.	Niko me ne voli.
We all have them.	Svi ih imamo.
He knows better than that.	On zna bolje od toga.
There is no one to help us.	Nema ko da nam pomogne.
He probably likes it.	Vjerovatno mu se sviđa.
I have my life.	Imam svoj život.
The problem was that he didn't like it.	Problem je bio u tome što on to nije volio.
It was more than that.	Bilo je više od toga.
I couldn't see properly.	Nisam mogao da vidim kako treba.
But you know you have a lot more in you.	Ali znaš da imaš mnogo više u sebi.
I mean very well.	Mislim veoma dobro.
It was nothing more than that.	Nije bilo ništa više od toga.
I'm not afraid of money.	Ne bojim se novca.
Not good for now.	Za sada nije dobro.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Možda ne želi.
She didn't say how it happened.	Nije rekla kako se to dogodilo.
No, it was even better than that.	Ne, bilo je čak i bolje od toga.
He was the first.	On je bio prvi.
As it should be.	Kako treba.
This father is not a father.	Ovaj otac nije otac.
Or you don't have to.	Ili ne morate.
But that wasn't true.	Ali to nije bila istina.
We should do that.	Trebalo bi to da uradimo.
And I saw you.	I video sam te.
There was another meeting.	Bio je još jedan sastanak.
They don't know what you're doing.	Oni ne znaju šta radiš.
And wouldn't you know it.	I zar to ne bi znao.
But, no, she's right.	Ali, ne, ona je u pravu.
He can't say what he wants.	Ne može da kaže šta želi.
Yes, even that one.	Da, čak i taj.
He couldn't do without it.	Nije mogao bez toga.
You are so right.	Tako si u pravu.
He couldn't believe any of it.	Nije mogao vjerovati ništa od toga.
That's how you got me.	Tako si me shvatio.
What to do next ?.	Šta dalje treba učiniti?.
He doesn't even speak.	On čak i ne govori.
But not now.	Ali sada nije.
I really hope it will be good.	Zaista se nadam da će biti dobro.
Like, really okay.	Kao, stvarno u redu.
I'd really like to see her.	Stvarno bih je volio vidjeti.
We just have to work on it.	Samo treba da radimo na tome.
Life doesn't get any better than that.	Život ne može biti bolji od toga.
Someone is doing it.	Neko to radi.
That was much better.	To je bilo mnogo bolje.
But it was fast.	Ali bilo je brzo.
But I have a question.	Ali imam pitanje.
He's right, and he knows it.	On je u pravu, i on to zna.
In the party.	U zabavi.
You could buy anything if you had enough money.	Mogao si kupiti bilo šta, ako imaš dovoljno novca.
Nobody had it.	Niko to nije imao.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
I doubt it ever will be.	Sumnjam da će uvijek biti.
I just don't want that.	Ja to jednostavno ne želim.
But that did not happen.	Ali to se nije dogodilo.
I thought it was them.	Mislio sam da su to oni.
I hope yours was better.	Nadam se da je tvoj bio bolji.
That will do it.	To će to učiniti.
Or not really.	Ili ne baš.
It was complete.	Bilo je potpuno .
There is always something to be done.	Uvek ima nešto da se uradi.
Me too.	I ja sam.
Everything works.	Sve radi.
That was last year.	To je bilo prošle godine.
And everyone knows that.	I to svi znaju.
I thought he was right.	Mislio sam da je u pravu.
We knew what was what.	Znali smo šta je šta.
I would never know.	Nikad ne bih znao.
I need to know what happens next.	Moram da znam šta se dalje dešava.
All on me.	Svi na mene.
But I don't know why, but it doesn't work.	Ali ne znam zašto, ali ne radi.
He has to see her.	Mora da je vidi.
Good for a few times.	Dobro za nekoliko puta.
It's good you're back now.	Dobro je što si se sada vratio.
I wish it wasn't so.	Voleo bih da nije tako.
He has, he didn't have.	Ima, nije imao.
I did everything here.	Sve sam napravio ovdje.
That's what we did.	To smo i uradili.
They are for us and only for us.	Oni su za nas i samo za nas.
That's what my father wants.	To je ono što moj otac želi.
But they weren't last week.	Ali nisu bili prošle sedmice.
There are several of them.	Ima ih nekoliko.
You know, don't say yes or no.	Znaš, nemoj reći da ili ne.
But it cannot be.	Ali to ne može biti.
I wanted to see it.	Htio sam to vidjeti.
He hasn't arrived yet.	Još nije stigao.
I was sorry about that.	Bilo mi je žao zbog toga.
To be so happy.	Da budem tako sretan.
No, that would be my job, and he knew it.	Ne, to bi bio moj posao, i on je to znao.
I'll go and bring it back right away.	Odmah ću otići i vratiti ga.
Maybe never again.	Možda nikad više.
And he would be the first to say so.	I on bi bio prvi koji bi to rekao.
That could be good.	To bi moglo biti dobro.
It didn't take me long.	Nije mi dugo trebalo.
It's so little time.	Tako je malo vremena.
I would like to do that.	Voleo bih to da uradim.
But there is still much to be done.	Ali ima još mnogo toga da se uradi.
The team feels much better now.	Tim se sada osjeća mnogo više.
But he knew he would, sometime.	Ali znao je da hoće, nekada.
I've heard them all.	Sve sam ih čuo.
She wouldn't even know you were here.	Ne bi ni znala da si ovdje.
I know right away what he's doing.	Odmah znam šta to radi.
He's in the car.	Na auto je.
There was nothing more to say.	Nije bilo šta više da se kaže.
She is she.	Ona je ona.
I don't want any more.	Ne želim više.
I'm sure it's not that.	Siguran sam da nije to.
He probably shouldn't have.	Verovatno nije trebao.
He had a job now, a real one.	Sada je imao posao, pravi.
And obviously he wanted something.	I očigledno je nešto želeo.
I've never worked, never will.	Nikad nisam radio, nikad neću.
I decided not to.	Odlučio sam da neću.
Everything was good.	Sve je bilo dobro.
You had to.	Morao si.
I thought he was something like that.	Mislio sam da je on tako nešto.
Just this once.	Samo ovaj put.
Nobody knows about this.	Niko ne zna za ovo.
But it will come.	Ali doći će.
No problem.	Nema problema.
Money is not.	Novac nije.
I hope you find this helpful.	Nadam se da će vam ovo biti od pomoći.
I came to that myself.	I sam sam došao do toga.
And this one.	I ovaj.
This may be true.	Ovo je možda tačno.
And no, it's not.	I ne, nije.
Looks good.	Izgleda dobro.
As if he knew.	Kao da je znao.
There were a lot of people there.	Tamo je bilo mnogo ljudi.
He preferred to come home.	Više je volio da dođe kući.
No, he didn't come.	Ne, nije došao.
Can it be.	Može li biti.
It was too much for me.	Bilo je to previše za mene.
Why, he wasn't sure.	Zašto, nije bio siguran.
This is today.	Ovo je danas.
She was very good at it.	Bila je jako dobra u tome.
You should be happy too.	I ti bi trebao biti sretan.
It can't be money.	To ne može biti novac.
Nothing to see here.	Ovde nema šta da se vidi.
This will usually be helpful.	Ovo će obično biti od pomoći.
When none of that is true.	Kada ništa od toga nije istina.
But there is nothing to be done.	Ali nema šta da se uradi.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
I would never see that.	Nikada to ne bih vidio.
I know this as well as anyone.	Znam ovo koliko i bilo ko.
I have to find her.	Moram je naći.
It's that simple.	To je tako jednostavno.
For that what you have to do is quite simple.	Za to je ono što morate učiniti prilično jednostavno.
Maybe he'll tell us something.	Možda će nam nešto reći.
Those people.	Ti ljudi.
She's been there a long time.	Ona je tamo dugo vremena.
That's bad for you.	To je loše za tebe.
That is probably true.	To je vjerovatno istina.
If you're after us, you are.	Ako si po nama, ti.
That's okay.	To je u redu.
I just want to make sure you come back.	Samo želim da budem siguran da ćeš se vratiti.
That and much more.	To i još mnogo toga.
I didn't have time to do anything.	Nisam imao vremena ništa da uradim.
Yes, but that's right.	Da, ali tako je.
Like you're not doing enough.	Kao da ne radiš dovoljno.
You won't give me anything.	Nećeš mi dati ništa.
That was next.	To je bilo sljedeće.
I expected much better.	Očekivao sam mnogo bolje.
And it's not hard.	I to nije teško.
Okay, maybe not yet.	Dobro, možda još ne.
They didn't have much time.	Nisu imali mnogo vremena.
Even if you don't.	Čak i ako to ne uradiš.
It's not like.	Nije kao .
And he is very happy.	I veoma je sretan.
I made it.	Ja sam to napravio.
Do it often.	Radite to često.
I felt very good.	Bilo mi je jako dobro.
That was not the only reason.	To nije bio jedini razlog.
He returned it without doing anything.	Vratio ga je, a da ništa nije uradio.
Not unless it isn't.	Ne osim ako nije.
It doesn't do anything for me.	Ne radi mi ništa.
We were very into it.	Bili smo veoma u tome.
He asked why.	Pitao je zašto.
Not so much, I guess.	Pretpostavljam, ne baš toliko.
Tomorrow we won't.	Sutra nećemo.
Very, very.	Veoma, veoma.
That is a good idea.	To je dobra ideja.
It's better than it was.	Bolje je nego što je bilo.
Anytime, anywhere.	Bilo kada, bilo gdje.
And he obviously knows a lot more than we do.	A on očigledno zna mnogo više od nas.
Never was, never will be.	Nikada nije bilo, nikada neće biti.
And not just a little, but a lot.	I to ne samo malo, nego dosta.
Bad for you.	Loše za tebe.
No one seemed to know what to say.	Činilo se da niko nije znao šta da kaže.
I just want to say.	Samo želim da kažem.
I didn't know what to do next.	Nisam znao šta dalje.
I didn't do it.	Nisam to uradio.
Went to dinner.	Otišao na večeru.
The problem was that there was so little.	Problem je bio u tome što je bilo tako malo toga.
He didn't think he really wanted to know.	Nije mislio da zaista želi znati.
We both know what's going to happen.	Oboje znamo šta će se dogoditi.
There were plenty of them.	Bilo ih je dosta.
Now we have another problem.	Sada imamo još jedan problem.
I wonder how good this will be.	Pitam se koliko će ovo biti dobro.
He was looking for himself.	Tražio je za sebe.
Not so soon.	Ne tako skoro.
I'm not sure what he'll do.	Nisam siguran šta će uraditi.
They were last Monday.	Prošlog ponedjeljka su bili.
I can't bring it back now.	Ne mogu to sada vratiti.
I was there often.	Često sam bio tamo.
But maybe not now.	Ali možda ne sada.
You know you're there.	Znaš da si tamo.
I have nothing.	Nemam ništa.
But he is not alone.	Ali on nije sam.
I have no idea either.	Ni ja nemam pojma.
I'm not happy today.	Nisam sretan danas.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
I do this just for myself.	Radim ovo samo za sebe.
It's really not a good thing.	Zaista nije dobra stvar.
But we can't do without you.	Ali ne možemo bez vas.
For us, this is actually a good thing.	Za nas je ovo zapravo dobra stvar.
Not too much.	Ne previše.
I have many, many thoughts.	Imam mnogo, mnogo misli.
He didn't tell me anything.	Nije mi ništa rekao.
I loved her very much.	Mnogo sam je voleo.
I would do anything.	Uradio bih sve.
It does not work.	Ne ide.
He was fine yesterday.	Juče je bio dobro.
That was me.	To sam bio ja.
That must be good enough.	To mora biti dovoljno dobro.
I didn't want to go there.	Nisam htela da idem tamo.
This is a difficult time for all of you.	Ovo je teško vrijeme za sve vas.
He didn't want her to see him.	Nije želio da ga ona vidi.
No, we won't.	Ne, nećemo.
If it was, you would know about it.	Da jeste, ti bi znao za to.
But they can help.	Ali oni mogu pomoći.
I can't say why now.	Ne mogu sada reći zašto.
She just didn't know what.	Samo nije znala šta.
Oh no! 	O ne!
Everything goes by itself.	Sve ide samo od sebe.
And she knew it well.	I ona je to dobro znala.
That car has been with me for so long.	Taj auto je bio sa mnom tako dugo.
Not any of you.	Ne bilo ko od vas.
And it can be anyone.	A to može biti bilo ko.
And they should know what you think.	I oni bi trebali znati šta mislite.
I didn't do anything.	Ništa nisam uradio.
Without him we would have nothing.	Bez njega ne bismo imali ništa.
We can't go back there now.	Sada se ne možemo vratiti tamo.
He said that a lot.	To je mnogo rekao.
Now he knows even better.	Sada zna još bolje.
He couldn't say that.	On to nije mogao reći.
Even if it is.	Čak i ako je tako.
I'm just saying' .	Samo kažem' .
Today is today, that is life.	Danas je danas, to je život.
But now that he was here, he wasn't so sure.	Ali sada kada je bio ovdje, nije bio tako siguran.
You can stay with me.	Možeš ostati kod mene.
But that was not a problem with us.	Ali, kod nas to nije bio problem.
That's all we have.	To je sve što imamo.
I hope you are doing well.	Nadam se da radiš dobro.
A person who.	Osoba koja .
He thinks you are.	On misli da jesi.
She said nothing about it.	Nije rekla ništa o tome.
This is not something difficult to do today.	Ovo danas nije nešto teško uraditi.
He was good.	Bio je dobar.
I can do anything.	Mogu sve.
But he doesn't look good.	Ali on ne izgleda dobro.
What could have been.	Šta je moglo biti.
I just want people to know the truth.	Samo želim da ljudi znaju istinu.
There is a lot to do.	Ima mnogo toga da se uradi.
It's a job.	To je posao.
We can do better now.	Sada možemo bolje.
In fact, he heard nothing.	U stvari, nije ništa čuo.
Or even if she will tell you.	Ili čak i ako će vam ona reći.
I know it's easy for him.	Znam da mu je to lako.
We knew it could happen at any time.	Znali smo da se to može dogoditi bilo kada.
The problem is we can't see it.	Problem je što to ne možemo vidjeti.
This was pretty easy.	Ovo je bilo prilično lako.
It is what it is, right?	To je ono što jeste, zar ne?
I heard about you.	Čuo sam za tebe.
You just work better that way.	Samo bolje radiš na taj način.
He couldn't believe how tired he was.	Nije mogao vjerovati koliko je umoran.
I have money.	Imam novca.
I wish you here.	Želim vam ovdje.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
Too much trouble, you know.	Previše problema, znaš.
But that would take time and money.	Ali za to bi trebalo vremena i novca.
I asked him to come.	Zamolio sam ga da dođe.
I thought he needed help.	Mislio sam da mu treba pomoć.
That was too much.	To je bilo previše.
It was much better today.	Danas je bilo mnogo bolje.
Not with him.	Ne sa njim.
He made up his mind immediately.	Odmah se odlučio.
That was much better.	To je bilo mnogo bolje.
I have so much.	Imam toliko toga.
That was enough.	To je bilo dovoljno.
It's simple.	To je jednostavno.
There weren't too many people.	Nije bilo previše ljudi.
I don't want any of that.	Ne želim ništa od toga.
Maybe he doesn't live here anymore.	Možda više ne živi ovdje.
Everything just works.	Sve jednostavno radi.
They are right, but they are wrong.	Oni su u pravu, ali nisu u pravu.
She didn't want to talk.	Nije htela da govori.
It can only be me.	Mogu biti samo ja.
This is fast.	Ovo je brzo.
It was okay.	Bilo je u redu.
And he always seemed tired.	I uvijek se činilo da je umoran.
Are you really	Da li si zaista
It really was.	Zaista je bilo.
No one ever gave him anything.	Niko mu nikad ništa nije dao.
She said that many times.	Rekla je to više puta.
You're right, but no.	U pravu si, ali ne.
I won't be a problem.	Neću biti problema.
he decided.	odlučio je.
No if only here.	Nema ako samo ovdje.
People know something is wrong.	Ljudi znaju da nešto nije u redu.
Maybe I don't know today.	Možda ne znam danas.
Everything is OK.	Sve je u redu.
No, that's not true.	Ne, to nije istina.
And do it yourself.	I uradi to sam.
Now I really needed a friend.	Sada mi je zaista trebao prijatelj.
And it still is.	I još uvijek je.
I guess it'll be you after me.	Pretpostavljam da ćeš to biti ti za mnom.
You can win or she can win.	Ti možeš pobijediti ili ona može pobijediti.
It was something.	Bilo je to nešto.
I had to go back alone.	Morao sam se sam vratiti.
In fact, it is not.	U stvari, nije.
I made everything.	Sve sam napravio.
But it won't be that simple.	Ali to neće biti tako jednostavno.
You know what you need.	Znaš šta ti treba.
If only he could see me now.	Da me samo sada vidi.
It's not difficult at all.	Uopšte nije teško.
I'll be fine now.	Sada ću biti dobro.
It's very difficult for me.	Jako mi je teško.
Soon everyone will know who he is.	Uskoro će svi znati ko je on.
He just thought.	Samo je mislio.
I better not know.	Bolje da ne znam.
There is something wrong.	Tu nešto nije u redu.
I had to do that too.	I ja sam to morao da uradim.
But she is.	Ali ona jeste.
It's hard for me today.	Danas mi je teško.
And it goes beyond that.	I to ide dalje od toga.
I do things myself.	Sam radim stvari.
I know you will too.	Znam da ćeš i ti.
.	.
We all knew he did it.	Svi smo znali da je to uradio.
I don't mean to do that.	Ne mislim to da uradim.
They just can.	Oni jednostavno mogu.
You can still be better.	Još uvijek možeš biti bolji.
That should be all you need.	To bi trebalo biti sve što ti treba.
But it doesn't look good.	Ali ne izgleda dobro.
This was not true at all.	Ovo uopšte nije bilo tačno.
And she's not even trying.	A ona ni ne pokušava.
It didn't take him long.	Nije mu dugo trebalo.
But that’s not what we have here.	Ali to nije ono što imamo ovdje.
Today it is.	Danas jeste.
Several times.	Nekoliko puta.
And there is a problem.	I postoji problem.
He didn't have time.	Nije imao vremena.
If not sorry.	Ako nije žao.
There may not be time soon.	Možda neće biti vremena uskoro.
Seen there, heard that.	Vidio tamo, čuo to.
And we will talk about that further.	I o tome ćemo dalje razgovarati.
Obviously, there isn't much.	Očigledno, nema mnogo toga.
I really don't know anymore.	Zaista više ne znam.
He would know everything.	On bi sve znao.
Something happened and .	Nešto se dogodilo i .
There was nothing for it.	Nije bilo ništa za to.
You can do it all here.	Sve to možete uraditi ovdje.
We can't allow that.	Ne možemo to dozvoliti.
Not for a few years.	Ne za nekoliko godina.
You know, everything we haven't done yet.	Znate, sve što još nismo uradili.
It wasn't long.	Nije bilo dugo.
And something needs to be said about that.	I za to treba nešto reći.
He was much better.	Bio je mnogo bolji.
Those who could not.	Oni koji nisu mogli.
He wouldn't do it for himself.	Ne bi to uradio za sebe.
It can't be.	Ne može to biti.
It's none of that.	To nije ništa od toga.
We will be able to help you quickly.	Moći ćemo vam brzo pomoći.
He didn't leave at all.	On uopšte nije otišao.
Maybe much more.	Možda mnogo više.
But he can't do it alone.	Ali on to ne može sam.
He tells me he's sorry.	Kaže mi da mu je žao.
Simple, easy and fast.	Jednostavno, lako i brzo.
I think of you often.	Često mislim na tebe.
She knows this business better than any of us.	Ona zna ovaj posao bolje od bilo koga od nas.
And you are not alone.	I niste sami.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
That's what he says.	Tako on to kaže.
She's with a friend.	Ona je kod prijatelja.
He needs someone to help him.	Treba mu neko da mu pomogne.
This is so real.	Ovo je tako stvarno.
So are we.	Tako da smo i mi.
As they were for all of us.	Kao što su bili za sve nas.
There is only this.	Ima samo ovo.
There were problems.	Bilo je problema.
We should .	Trebali bi .
I just think there's more.	Samo mislim da ima još toga.
That couldn't be helped.	To se nije moglo pomoći.
Not for three days.	Ne tri dana.
It would take him a while.	Trebalo bi mu neko vrijeme.
Like he has no idea.	Kao da nema pojma.
I'm just surprised, that's all.	Samo sam iznenađen, to je sve.
We still don't know enough to be sure.	Još uvek ne znamo dovoljno da bismo bili sigurni.
There were problems.	Bilo je problema.
Not a lot of people, but a few.	Ne puno ljudi, ali nekoliko.
I think it's so good.	Mislim da je tako dobro.
From time to time.	S vremena na vrijeme.
We didn't know.	Nismo znali.
I have a friend over for dinner, actually.	Imam prijatelja na večeru, zapravo.
He always did everything right.	Uvek je sve radio kako treba.
And that cannot be.	A to ne može biti.
There is good and bad.	Postoji dobro i loše.
She can help you.	Ona ti može pomoći.
It's just a job.	To je samo posao.
Now I need my father.	Sada mi treba moj otac.
People who know we can do better.	Ljudi koji znaju da možemo bolje.
That's what they're here for.	Oni su ovdje za to.
There is another problem.	Postoji još jedan problem.
She was never here.	Ona nikada nije bila ovde.
You have to work well with that.	Morate dobro raditi s tim.
I should tell him to leave.	Trebao bih mu reći da ode.
At the time, it was probably the right path.	U to vrijeme je to vjerovatno bio pravi put.
I wasn't alone either.	Ni ja nisam bio sam.
She says you didn't.	Ona kaže da nisi.
But she was mine too.	Ali i ona je bila moja.
That's a tough question.	To je teško pitanje.
I still want it.	Još ga želim.
And they did just that.	I uradili su upravo to.
He said he wanted something more.	Rekao je da želi nešto više.
We still have a little way to go.	Imamo još malo puta.
I've heard all that, and more.	Čuo sam sve to, i više.
But it's good to be prepared.	Ali dobro je biti spreman.
That would soon be me.	To bih uskoro bio ja.
I never really wanted to come.	Nikad stvarno nisam želio doći.
He really is that good.	On je zaista tako dobar.
I won't do that to you.	Neću ti to učiniti.
I didn't need to know before.	Nisam morao da znam ranije.
Not all of them.	Nisu svi.
There's not much we can do.	Ne možemo mnogo da uradimo.
I haven't seen you since yesterday.	Nisam te vidio od juče.
You really are.	Ti zaista jesi.
Something really bad is happening.	Nešto se stvarno loše dešava.
I have a job.	Imam posao.
We have to get the money.	Moramo dobiti novac.
If at all.	Ako uopšte.
That may be true.	To je možda istina.
Or maybe he's wrong.	Ili možda nije u pravu.
That was not like me.	To nije bilo kao ja.
Those people are there.	Ti ljudi su tamo.
I should put it that way.	Trebao bih to tako reći.
That would be just like this one.	To bi bilo baš kao ovaj.
But it looks like someone got there before me.	Ali izgleda da je neko stigao prije mene.
We all had time.	Svi smo imali vremena.
Why does this have to be so hard?	Zašto ovo mora biti tako teško?
I should really go home.	Stvarno bih trebao ići kući.
It does things right.	Radi stvari kako treba.
I didn't hear what happened.	Nisam čuo šta je bilo.
When it's there, it's there.	Kad je tu, tu je.
I say, do both!	Kažem, uradi oboje!
That was the way.	To je bio put.
But that's not exactly the case.	Ali to nije baš tako.
He is my person.	On je moja osoba.
She knew how to play.	Znala je kako se igra.
If he would do that.	Ako bi to uradio.
I told you that before.	Rekao sam ti to ranije.
And it's all true.	I sve je to istina.
No one asked how he got there.	Niko nije pitao kako je došao tamo.
This is even good.	Ovo je čak i dobro.
And he will.	I hoće.
But she does nothing.	Ali ona ne radi ništa.
But we don't really know how to do it.	Ali mi zapravo ne znamo kako to učiniti.
But something was wrong.	Ali nešto nije bilo u redu.
He was just busy.	Samo je bio zauzet.
Not in the house.	Ne u kući.
But he knew better than that.	Ali znao je i bolje od toga.
He asked what he should do.	Pitao je šta treba da uradi.
I just didn't mean it.	Samo nisam mislio.
We didn't do anything wrong.	Nismo uradili ništa loše.
He knew what he wanted to say.	Znao je šta želi da kaže.
Usually very quickly.	Obično vrlo brzo.
You do what you are told.	Radiš ono što ti se kaže.
I have a job.	Imam posao.
He decided that was enough for now.	Odlučio je da je za sada dosta.
No one could bring him back.	Niko ga nije mogao vratiti.
He lost many friends there.	Tamo je izgubio mnogo prijatelja.
We don't, but he does.	Mi to ne radimo, ali on jeste.
But he was with me immediately.	Ali on je odmah bio sa mnom.
That's really what you need to work on.	To je zaista ono na čemu treba da radite.
That is not true at all.	To uopšte nije istina.
Everything was there.	Tu je sve bilo.
I loved them and loved them.	Voleo sam ih i voleo ih.
I gave it to him.	Dao sam mu to.
Only one needs to do.	Samo jedan treba da uradi.
She didn't want to know who was with him.	Nije htela da zna ko je sa njim.
No, it's not always like that.	Ne, nije uvijek tako.
He knew he couldn't go back.	Znao je da se ne može vratiti.
It never was and never will be.	Nikada nije bilo i nikada neće biti.
To do that.	Da bi to uradio.
Just like he told you.	Baš kao što ti je rekao.
I didn't quite understand them.	Nisam ih baš shvatio.
Do a little more than you think you could.	Uradite malo više nego što mislite da biste mogli.
He'll be right back.	Odmah će se vratiti.
You look good.	Dobro izgledaš.
It wasn't for me.	Nije bilo za mene.
He tells me things.	On mi govori stvari.
Was.	Bilo je.
I didn't say anything.	Nisam ništa rekao.
She was probably right.	Verovatno je bila u pravu.
He had it all now.	Sada je imao sve.
You all do such a good job.	Svi radite tako dobar posao.
Lots of problems.	Mnogo problema.
I couldn't say anything.	Nisam mogao ništa reći.
If not now.	Ako ne sada.
And that is it.	I to je to.
It's not easy.	Nije lako.
A friend asked how he was.	Prijatelj je pitao kako je.
But it is also much more than that.	Ali to je i mnogo više od toga.
I know about you.	Znam za tebe.
Not all is bad.	Nije sve loše.
No, it was too much.	Ne, bilo je previše.
I think he wanted to talk to me.	Mislim da je htio razgovarati sa mnom.
I think this is the only way.	Mislim da je ovo jedini put.
Just a little.	Samo malo.
I was expecting a good job, but not that.	Očekivao sam dobar posao, ali ne to.
You want to help him, actually, but you won't.	Želiš mu pomoći, zapravo, ali nećeš.
You always want to know where the person is.	Uvijek želite znati gdje je osoba.
He liked to talk.	Voleo je da priča.
He was the first, you know.	On je bio prvi, znate.
You still have to do the right thing.	I dalje moraš da uradiš pravu stvar.
Where are they.	Gdje su oni.
We may not have to.	Možda nećemo morati.
You will never be like us.	Nikad nećeš biti kao mi.
He will have to give something.	Nešto će morati dati.
I have so much to say.	Imam toliko toga za reći.
That was a little good.	To je bilo malo dobro.
There was too much to do.	Bilo je previše toga da se uradi.
If so, that's fine.	Ako je tako, to je dobro.
You too? 	I ti?
.	.
That's so good.	To je tako dobro.
We have to do it.	Moramo to uraditi.
Before that, actually.	Prije toga, zapravo.
There is still one way.	Još uvijek postoji jedan način.
People know, you know.	Ljudi znaju, znate.
The day is too much.	Dan je previše.
I should never talk to you again.	Nikada više ne bih trebao razgovarati s tobom.
Besides, she will be alone.	Osim toga, ona će biti sama.
Yes, that's him.	Da, to je on.
But he had to be sure.	Ali morao je biti siguran.
I thought when you left last night.	Mislio sam kada si otišao sinoć.
He made it.	On je to napravio.
I'm doing this for you as much as for myself.	Ovo radim za tebe koliko i za sebe.
Like, really simple.	Kao, stvarno jednostavno.
He wants to leave.	On želi da ode.
She didn't tell me anything.	Nije mi ništa rekla.
As it should be.	Kako bi trebalo da bude.
There was no one here.	Ovdje nije bilo nikoga.
And that's it, you know.	I to je to, znaš.
But maybe not.	Ali možda i neće.
And they would.	I oni bi.
We're glad you're here.	Drago nam je što ste ovdje.
They will do no good.	Oni neće učiniti ništa dobro.
And it doesn't work.	I ne radi.
You probably already know that.	Vjerovatno to već znate.
I think this would be pretty obvious.	Mislim da bi ovo bilo prilično očigledno.
Not from him.	Ne od njega.
Maybe she never even knew that.	Možda to nikada nije ni znala.
It was something he would try from time to time.	Bilo je to nešto što bi s vremena na vrijeme pokušao.
Like a job.	Kao i posao.
He didn't have to do this.	Nije morao ovo da uradi.
I really want to work with him.	Zaista želim da radim sa njim.
We knew we could do it.	Znali smo da to možemo.
It seemed like a thing to do.	Činilo se kao stvar koju treba uraditi.
He seems to be doing much better.	Čini se da mu ide mnogo bolje.
Nobody says what they think.	Niko ne kaže šta misli.
He wanted to be alone.	Želeo je da bude sam.
But something is wrong.	Ali nešto nije u redu.
I know exactly what this is.	Znam tačno šta je ovo.
For what, he didn't say.	Za šta, nije rekao.
They didn't tell me anything.	Ništa mi nisu rekli.
These are.	Ovo su.
He decided to give.	Odlučio je dati.
Do so.	Uraditi tako.
We know what needs to be done.	Znamo šta treba da se uradi.
There's plenty for you, too.	Ima dosta toga i za tebe.
You all knew.	Svi ste znali.
He didn't have to see.	Nije morao da vidi.
This is bad, no this is more than bad.	Ovo je loše, ne ovo je više nego loše.
Everyone knew who they were.	Svi su znali ko su.
The truth is that it was not difficult for us.	Istina je da nam nije bilo teško.
That's bad.	To je loše.
You didn't do anything wrong.	Niste uradili ništa loše.
Never anything right.	Nikad ništa kako treba.
That's not what we have here.	To nije ono što imamo ovdje.
It's already happening.	To se već dešava.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
Only it was more than that.	Samo što je to bilo više od toga.
He just didn't know how to do it yet.	Samo još nije znao kako to da uradi.
But none of the money.	Ali ništa od novca.
Or maybe he doesn't.	Ili ga možda nema.
I have very little idea.	Imam jako malo pojma.
I hope he lets me see that.	Nadam se da će mi dozvoliti da to vidim.
Me with him.	Ja sa njim.
She said little.	Malo je rekla.
Yes, we have everything.	Da, imamo sve.
It shouldn't be.	To ne bi trebalo biti.
And it's really not that hard.	I zaista nije tako teško.
It's really not hard.	Zaista nije teško.
I'm sorry, really, really.	Žao mi je, stvarno, stvarno.
He didn't work alone.	Nije radio sam.
I had to see him.	Morao sam da ga vidim.
This for him.	Ovo za njega.
He was happy.	Bio je sretan.
I love doing it.	Volim to raditi.
They can only help themselves.	Oni samo sebi mogu pomoći.
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
Not so much.	Ne toliko.
I don't have that problem.	Ja nemam taj problem.
Is there a way to do this?	Postoji li način da se ovo uradi?
He seems like a good guy.	Izgleda kao dobar momak.
I thought there would only be one.	Mislio sam da će biti samo jedan.
I really meant it.	Stvarno sam to mislio.
Life was pretty good.	Život je bio prilično dobar.
I don't even want to say that.	Ne želim to ni reći.
I can do anything.	Mogu sve.
You can see mine here.	Možete vidjeti moj, ovdje.
I'm so afraid of him.	Tako ga se bojim.
I'm no good anymore.	Nisam više dobar.
Certainly not.	Sigurno nije.
Besides, it should be fine.	Osim toga, trebalo bi da bude u redu.
Maybe he came at you first.	Možda je on prvi došao na tebe.
U.	U .
Nobody talks about it.	Niko ne priča o tome.
This life is no longer life.	Ovaj život više nije život.
What is he afraid of me.	Šta se on mene boji.
We had so little time.	Imali smo tako malo vremena.
Alone is still alone.	Sam je i dalje sam.
But we could do a lot better, couldn't we.	Ali mogli bismo mnogo bolje, zar ne.
This is real code that works well.	Ovo je pravi kod koji dobro radi.
He is waiting for me.	On me čeka.
I don't think that's good.	Mislim da to nije dobro.
Too many problems.	Previše problema.
Everything was right here, now.	Sve je bilo tačno ovde, sada.
There was no one in the house.	U kući nije bilo nikoga.
We had three.	Imali smo tri.
A lot more people know who he is this time.	Mnogo više ljudi zna ko je ovaj put.
We have money.	Imamo novac.
You could know it right now.	Mogli biste to znati upravo sada.
But yes, this is good.	Ali da, ovo je dobro.
Yes, that's all.	Da, samo to.
I'll give it to you.	Ja ću to dati.
You will help us with that.	Vi ćete nam pomoći u tome.
They probably don't even know about it.	Verovatno ni ne znaju za to.
I'm sure everything will be fine.	Siguran sam da će sve biti u redu.
Maybe he already knows we're here.	Možda već zna da smo ovdje.
Looks good.	Izgleda, dobro.
That was for sure.	To je bilo sigurno.
You can do it.	Možete to učiniti.
They are more like people.	Oni su više kao ljudi.
What next?	Šta dalje?
I'm still working.	I dalje radim.
I went to him.	Otišao sam do njega.
I'll give them all to you.	Sve ću ti ih dati.
He said he had to go.	Rekao je da mora da ide.
He wasn't there often.	Često nije bio tamo.
And it should be here.	I trebao bi biti ovdje.
And maybe that's true even today.	A možda je to istina i danas.
No, you know that.	Ne, ti to znaš.
They didn't have any.	Nisu ni imali.
He left.	Otišao je.
But now there seems to be a question.	Ali sada izgleda da postoji neko pitanje.
I was there.	Bio sam tamo.
This guy was a real guy.	Ovaj momak je bio pravi momak.
This is such a good day.	Ovo je tako dobar dan.
He says yes.	On kaže da.
It still works.	Još uvijek radi.
Nobody knows what is true.	Niko ne zna šta je istina.
You do things right.	Radiš stvari kako treba.
I'll come alone.	Doći ću sam.
And I was happy to work with him.	I ja sam bio sretan što sam radio s njim.
Yes, you really are here.	Da, stvarno si ovdje.
It can be both.	Može biti oboje.
Everyone knew about him.	Svi su znali za njega.
It's for everyone.	To je za sve.
And that's me.	I to sam ja.
He didn't ask us.	Nije nas pitao.
I wish you could stay.	Voleo bih da možeš ostati.
It shouldn't be happening here.	Ne bi trebalo da se dešava ovde.
What's not to like.	Šta se ne sviđa.
It never did.	Nikad nije.
This could be very bad.	Ovo bi moglo biti jako loše.
This is all.	To je sve.
Everything would be fine when needed.	Sve bi bilo u redu kada je trebalo.
Maybe I won't.	Možda i neću.
But it's true.	Ali to je istina.
That will never happen.	To se nikada neće dogoditi.
Or even really asked for it.	Ili ga čak zaista tražio.
I've seen it work.	Video sam da radi.
I just had to ask.	Samo sam morao da pitam.
I have to see him.	Moram da ga vidim.
It's fine with me.	U redu je sa mnom.
True, it is not.	Istina, nije.
One man could not do it alone.	Jedan čovjek ne bi mogao sam.
I still have no idea who it was.	Još nemam pojma ko je to bio.
I just wish it was here already.	Samo želim da je već ovdje.
For a long time.	Već dugo vremena.
But that's how you do it.	Ali tako to radite.
It will never happen.	Nikada se neće dogoditi.
She knew it and told him.	Ona je to znala i rekla mu je.
All he can see is her.	Sve što može da vidi je ona.
I need that.	Treba mi to.
Next year you can.	Sljedeće godine možete.
Maybe they were never there.	Možda nikada nisu bili tamo.
He really did it.	On je to zaista uradio.
He knew something.	Znao je nešto.
That was all.	To je bilo sve.
I saw it last night.	Video sam to sinoć.
Maybe they don't even know.	Možda ni ne znaju.
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
Yes, that would be it.	Da, to bi bilo to.
Years and years of that.	Godine i godine toga.
I knew right away.	Odmah sam znao.
He knows it and we know it.	On to zna i mi to znamo.
I'm not saying you have to.	Ne kažem da moraš.
She didn't know what to do.	Nije znala šta bi trebalo da uradi.
It really didn't take much at all.	Zaista uopšte nije trebalo mnogo.
She told him the truth.	Rekla mu je istinu.
But there are none.	Ali ih nema.
I know you really don't want to do that.	Znam da to zaista ne želiš da uradiš.
He does what she doesn't want to do.	On radi ono što ona ne želi da radi.
It felt so good to do that.	Bilo je tako dobro to uraditi.
Please don't do that.	Molim te nemoj to raditi.
That speaks.	To govori.
You didn't do any of that.	Nisi uradio ništa od toga.
He did not want to return.	On se nije htio vratiti.
I wasn't sorry at all.	Uopšte mi nije bilo žao.
There was no one to see.	Nije bilo nikoga da vidi.
This should not happen.	Ovo se ne bi trebalo dogoditi.
I will know where you work and for whom.	Ja ću znati gdje radiš i za koga.
But he can't go back, not yet.	Ali ne može se vratiti, ne još.
And they know it.	I oni to znaju.
That will be true.	To će biti istina.
So is your father.	Kao i tvoj otac.
I'm back home.	Vratio sam se kući.
He was all she knew.	On je bio sve što je znala.
But it was still difficult.	Ali i dalje je bilo teško.
He should have.	Trebao je.
This is good and bad.	Ovo je dobro i loše.
But as you wish.	Ali kako hoćeš.
It was mine, all right.	Bio je moj, u redu.
Nothing was real.	Ništa nije bilo stvarno.
He seems to like it there.	Izgleda da mu se tamo sviđa.
She doesn't see him.	Ona ga ne vidi.
She didn't know what was true anymore either.	Ni ona više nije znala šta je istina.
And it was all good.	I sve je to bilo dobro.
But that's the problem.	Ali to je problem.
I don't have it.	Ja ga nemam.
Maybe he's still there.	Možda je još tamo.
They are real people.	Oni su pravi ljudi.
How you want.	Kako želiš.
They said they couldn't tell me.	Rekli su da mi ne mogu reći.
A lot of people.	Puno ljudi.
But maybe this wasn’t the way to go.	Ali možda ovo nije bio način.
It happens many times.	Dešava se više puta.
She was like, not really.	Bila je kao, ne stvarno.
I would work.	Ja bih radio.
Yes, it can and it can.	Da, može i može.
Yes, it's that easy now.	Da, sada je tako lako.
It's real and it's not real.	Stvarno je i nije stvarno.
I don't know why anyone would be there.	Ne znam zašto bi neko bio tamo.
I don't have it.	Ja ga nemam.
Sam doesn't love you.	Sam te ne voli.
I didn't say we never would.	Nisam rekao da nikada nećemo.
Being human.	Biti čovjek .
There is much more.	Ima još mnogo toga.
It's better now.	Sada je bolje.
It seems to work a lot.	Čini se da radi mnogo.
And as long as you can.	I sve dok možete.
And now you must go.	A sada morate otići.
They already know the truth.	Oni već znaju istinu.
I'm just wondering about it.	Samo se pitam o tome.
You can be sure of that.	Možete biti sigurni u to.
There is always a good reason.	Uvek postoji dobar razlog.
He knows he should be glad.	Zna da bi mu trebalo biti drago.
We needed them alive.	Trebali su nam živi.
Do it or do even more.	To ili raditi još više.
We can certainly do better, can't we?	Sigurno možemo bolje, zar ne?
It will probably be some more time.	Vjerovatno će biti još neko vrijeme.
That's all you want it to be.	To je sve što želiš da bude.
Usually it could be that way.	Obično bi to moglo biti tako.
I could do that.	Mogao bih to učiniti.
And she really wants me.	I ona me zaista želi.
I'm just saying.	Samo kažem.
I love you, but that's not enough.	Volim te, ali to nije dovoljno.
I would never go back there again.	Nikad se više ne bih vratio tamo.
I would confess to you.	Priznao bih ti.
That was the way he did it.	To je bio način na koji je to uradio.
She was here.	Bila je ovdje.
The code works properly.	Kod radi kako treba.
Yes, it can be.	Da, može se.
I do not like that.	Ne volim to.
If you want.	Ako želite.
It wouldn't.	Ne bi.
You always think you're doing the right thing.	Uvek mislite da radite pravu stvar.
Which was not the case.	Što nije bilo.
It's like we have a lot more.	Kao da imamo još mnogo toga.
I said no.	Rekao sam da neće.
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
But that was good for me.	Ali to je bilo dobro za mene.
Which is not happening.	Što se ne dešava.
It's easy to say.	Lako je reći.
Or this.	Ili ovo.
That was likely.	To je bilo vjerovatno.
I finished everything.	Sve sam završio.
She has a question.	Ona ima pitanje.
Do even more.	Uradite još više.
I just thought.	Samo sam mislio.
Okay, you said.	Dobro, rekao si.
This will not be easy.	Ovo neće biti lako.
But this should not be.	Ali ovo ne bi trebalo biti.
They are not there.	Oni nisu tamo.
I'm done, like you said.	Završio sam, kao što si rekao.
And there seems to be only one way to do it.	I čini se da postoji samo jedan način da se to uradi.
It was a difficult time for him.	Bilo je to teško vrijeme za njega.
You said it wouldn't happen.	Rekao si da se to neće dogoditi.
Everything you can be you have already been.	Sve što možeš biti već si bio.
More than ready.	Više nego spreman.
It can't come fast enough.	Ne može doći dovoljno brzo.
This was much better.	Ovo je bilo mnogo bolje.
But we can do better.	Ali, možemo bolje.
It's okay, she says.	U redu je, kaže ona.
I didn't want to do it anymore.	Nisam to više želio da radim.
And he looked good.	I izgledao je dobro.
There are too many of them.	Previše ih je.
You should trust me.	Trebao bi mi vjerovati.
We had a little.	Imali smo malo.
Yes, that was better, much better.	Da, to je bilo bolje, mnogo bolje.
It's not always easy.	Nije uvijek lako.
Again and again and again.	Ponovo i ponovo i ponovo.
He was a father.	Bio je otac.
It's hard for me to say.	Teško mi je reći.
Not yet, and maybe never.	Ne još, a možda i nikada.
I wouldn't expect it to be a problem.	Ne bih očekivao da će biti problema.
It's certainly not that hard.	Sigurno nije tako teško.
He probably had a good reason.	Verovatno je imao dobar razlog.
Maybe it's more than that.	Možda je i više od toga.
And, yes, there is a lot going on for you.	I, da, mnogo toga se dešava za vas.
I could do this right now.	Mogao bih ovo uraditi odmah.
When he comes, he's fine.	Kad dođe, dobro je.
It might even happen.	Možda čak i dođe do toga.
But no one could live here.	Ali niko ne bi mogao da živi ovde.
For a long time she said nothing more.	Dugo vremena ništa više nije rekla.
For the car.	Za auto.
I have it.	Imam je.
He's a good guy.	On je dobar momak.
I see what you mean.	Vidim na šta misliš.
I could go home.	Mogao bih ići kući.
And he wants to do just that.	I on želi da uradi upravo to.
I've seen it before.	Već sam ga vidio.
He saw something.	Video je nešto.
That is just a game.	To je samo igra.
We just know.	Samo znamo.
I did this.	Uradio sam ovo.
He went and saw them.	Otišao je i vidio ih.
I have no idea what he thinks.	Nemam pojma šta on misli.
Maybe this wasn't good.	Možda ovo nije bilo dobro.
Everyone knew about it.	Svi su znali za to.
I do not know what to say.	Ne znam šta da ti kažem.
He could live with that.	S tim bi mogao da živi.
I was expecting him today, but he didn’t come.	Danas sam ga očekivao, ali nije došao.
Nobody knows what this is.	Šta je ovo niko ne zna.
I do not like.	Ne sviđa mi se.
And it was good.	I bilo je dobro.
He asked for it.	On je to tražio.
I can see that.	Vidim to.
And what not.	A šta ne.
He had no idea where he was.	Nije imao pojma gdje je.
We don't know what it's about.	Ne znamo o čemu se radi.
Yes, it looks bad.	Da, izgleda loše.
We have to go.	Moramo otići.
I just had to be there.	Samo sam morao biti tamo.
No, go on.	Ne, dalje.
Everyone knew why.	Svi su znali zašto.
They were fine with that.	Oni su bili u redu sa tim.
I have no idea.	Nemam pojma.
But they really weren't there.	Ali ih zaista nije bilo.
Yes, just one.	Da, samo jedan.
This is who we are and what we are.	Ovo je ko smo i šta smo.
There were many things he should not have seen yet.	Bilo je mnogo stvari koje još nije trebao vidjeti.
I think we'll be fine.	Mislim da ćemo biti dobro.
Maybe not.	Možda i ne bi.
And it's good for business.	A dobro je i za posao.
And because of that, he no longer knew how to feel.	I zbog toga više nije znao kako da se osjeća.
I saw him.	Video sam ga.
We could do that.	Mogli bismo to da uradimo.
But there were three.	Ali bila su tri.
Maybe it's that simple.	Možda je tako jednostavno.
I will go if you want.	Ja ću otići ako želiš.
I didn't even finish it.	Nisam ga ni završio.
We know exactly what she means.	Znamo tačno šta ona misli.
In fact, it was better than good.	U stvari, bilo je bolje nego dobro.
This is the one.	Ovo je taj.
It's hard not to be.	Teško je ne biti.
I came with it.	Došao sam s tim.
But something is wrong.	Ali nešto nije u redu.
The only one yet.	Jedini još.
I'm not afraid today.	Danas se ne bojim.
I love you too.	Volim i ja tebe.
It's just so good.	To je samo tako dobro.
Pretty long.	Prilično dugo.
And he never had.	I nikada nije imao.
That was something people said.	To je bilo nešto što su ljudi rekli.
It's not what he did.	Nije to što je uradio.
The only thing is.	Jedina stvar je.
I'm just not doing anything.	Samo ne radim ništa.
Which won't be difficult.	Što neće biti teško.
Don't say things.	Ne govori stvari.
It certainly would be.	Sigurno bi bilo.
And it happens.	I to se dešava.
A friend drives in.	Prijatelj vozi u.
But there is nothing that will not be wrong.	Ali ne postoji ništa što neće biti u redu.
She said nothing today.	Danas nije rekla ništa.
I think there is something in that.	Mislim da ima nešto u tome.
We had a good team.	Imali smo dobar tim.
But there is nothing more we can do.	Ali ništa više ne možemo učiniti.
Not many, but several.	Ne mnogo, ali nekoliko.
So far so good.	Do sada je danas bilo dobro.
Like we need more trouble.	Kao da nam treba još problema.
Pretty good job if you can get it.	Prilično dobar posao ako ga možete dobiti.
It wasn't the first time either.	Nije bilo ni prvi put.
she told herself.	rekla je sebi.
He knew he wouldn't.	Znao je da neće.
Are you and she.	Jeste li ti i ona.
There is much more for you.	Ima još mnogo toga za tebe.
That's not your problem.	To nije tvoj problem.
But we can do it.	Ali mi to možemo.
She said she could find you.	Rekla je da te može naći.
She was from home.	Bila je od kuće.
I am working on that.	Radim na tome.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
I wouldn't know how.	Ne bih znao kako.
I didn't do much.	Nisam puno uradio.
No one really tells us what to do.	Niko nam zaista ne govori šta da radimo.
I know everything here.	Znam sve ovde.
No one can say how long.	Niko ne može reći koliko dugo.
I really like it.	Stvarno mi se sviđa.
And that could be a problem.	I to bi mogao biti problem.
It was a very good year.	Bila je to jako dobra godina.
Always would.	Uvijek bi.
You can't do that here.	Ne možete to učiniti ovdje.
No one saw her.	Niko je nije video.
That's where he heard me for the first time.	Tamo me je prvi put čuo.
I would give anything to be here.	Sve bih dao da sam bio ovde.
And even more.	I još više.
There is a way.	Postoji način.
You know exactly why he's here.	Znaš tačno zašto je ovde.
They did something to you.	Oni su ti nešto uradili.
In fact, it is.	U stvari jeste.
And there was something else.	A bilo je još nešto.
I want to go too.	I ja želim da idem.
I would like to say.	Želeo bih da kažem .
I do not have to.	Ne moram.
And there is another problem.	I postoji još jedan problem.
I hope you like this.	Nadam se da vam se ovo sviđa.
I think you're absolutely right.	Mislim da si potpuno u pravu.
He went there.	Otišao je tamo.
I have everything.	Imam sve.
Or not much.	Ili ne mnogo.
They know why.	Oni znaju zašto.
But it's true.	Ali istina je.
But she wasn't.	Ali nije bila.
I'm good.	Ja sam dobro.
He didn't have it, that's all.	Nije ga imao, to je sve.
They are no longer in it.	Oni više nisu u tome.
And maybe you will.	A možda hoćeš.
But not anymore.	Ali, ne više.
He brought me back.	Vratio me je.
This is not what you want.	Ovo nije ono što želiš.
But not any dinner.	Ali ne bilo koju večeru.
I wonder what that could be.	Pitam se šta bi to moglo biti.
I loved him completely and utterly.	Voleo ga potpuno i potpuno.
But that's the thing.	Ali to je stvar.
The more people who know about this, the better.	Što više ljudi zna za ovo, to bolje.
This is going to be so good.	Ovo će biti tako dobro.
In which we can believe.	U koje možemo vjerovati.
Maybe he already did.	Možda je to već uradio.
I've never done anything like that.	Nikada nisam uradio tako nešto.
It will be next.	To će biti sljedeće.
I want someone.	Želim nekoga.
A lot is happening.	Mnogo toga se dešava.
I'm going fast.	idem brzo.
There were only a few more people there.	Tamo je bilo još samo nekoliko ljudi.
Time is money.	Vrijeme je novac.
They never were.	Nikada nisu bili.
I hope so.	Nadam se.
But it wasn't like that.	Ali nije bilo tako.
Better to say it never happened.	Bolje je reći da se to nikada nije dogodilo.
But there is not much.	Ali nema toga puno.
He could do that for a long time.	Mogao je to raditi dosta dugo.
It wouldn't be all right.	Ne bi bilo sve u redu.
I needed something more.	Trebalo mi je nešto više.
Now you can see it for yourself.	Sada to možete i sami vidjeti.
You never told me anything.	Nikad mi ništa nisi rekao.
Or if needed.	Ili ako treba.
But he was fine.	Ali on je bio dobro.
He always had to work.	Uvek je morao da radi.
It just isn't.	Jednostavno nije.
Pretty good job.	Prilično dobar posao.
And that is all.	I to je sve.
He's just not sure.	On jednostavno nije siguran.
He brought us back to now.	Vratio nas je do sada.
There was something else.	Bilo je još nešto.
Like the real thing.	Kao pravi.
I see them first.	Ja ih prvi vidim.
No one was surprised.	Niko nije bio iznenađen.
They knew it was him.	Znali su da je to on.
Except he likes it.	Osim što se sviđa.
I don't want to see him do that.	Ne želim da ga vidim kako to radi.
Everything works.	Sve radi.
You needed more.	Trebalo ti je više.
It does several things.	Radi nekoliko stvari.
I think it's good.	Mislim da je dobro.
Yes, you heard me.	Da, čuo si me.
Or maybe just tired.	Ili možda samo umoran.
But it won't happen.	Ali neće doći do toga.
He was completely alone.	Bio je potpuno sam.
How long will he be there.	Koliko dugo će biti tamo.
Money was everything to him.	Novac mu je bio sve.
That was always the problem.	To je uvijek bio problem.
I just love it.	Samo volim to.
He didn't say anything.	Ništa nije rekao.
We are in it.	Mi smo u tome.
But right now that's not enough.	Ali trenutno to nije dovoljno.
I'm glad you came.	Drago mi je što si došao.
She didn't know where she was.	Nije znala gdje je.
You're bad too.	I ti si loš.
I got it too, but maybe not as much.	I ja sam dobio, ali možda ne toliko.
I know that's not true.	Znam da to nije istina.
We couldn't get much more.	Nismo mogli dobiti mnogo više.
Why would you do that?	Zašto bi to uradio?
It wasn't good enough anymore.	Više nije bilo dovoljno dobro.
We will go together.	Otići ćemo zajedno.
You are here with me.	Ovdje si sa mnom.
He never asked me about it again.	Nikada me više o tome nije pitao.
But they didn't.	Ali nisu.
If only she knew.	Da je samo znala.
She doesn't know yet.	Ona još ne zna.
I've been there before.	Već sam bio tamo.
I'm a little tired.	Malo sam umoran.
It never was, never would be.	Nikada nije bilo, nikad ne bi bilo.
It's true.	To je istina.
Maybe very soon.	Možda vrlo brzo.
He wasn't even sure if they were alive.	Nije čak bio siguran ni da li su živi.
We all will.	Svi ćemo.
We don't know anything anymore.	Ne znamo više ništa.
No one should know that he is not the father.	Niko ne bi trebao znati da on nije otac.
I don't want it now.	Ne želim to sada.
No, that wasn't good.	Ne, to nije bilo dobro.
I have to go.	Moram da idem.
No, no, you didn't.	Ne, ne, nisi.
Everyone's into it.	Svi su u tome.
You didn't do anything wrong to me.	Nisi mi učinio ništa loše.
I wonder what he thinks.	Pitam se šta on misli.
More and more.	Sve više i više.
It seems to do just that.	Čini se da upravo to radi.
That’s all it works, but that’s enough.	To je sve što radi, ali to je dovoljno.
But no one knew.	Ali niko nije znao.
Yes, there is one.	Da, postoji jedan.
Lots of them, as usual.	Mnogo ih, kao i obično.
I am glad.	Drago mi je.
But there was no help for that.	Ali nije bilo pomoći za to.
That was one problem.	To je bio jedan problem.
Yes and yes and yes.	Da i da i da.
A few more things, not many.	Još nekoliko stvari, ne mnogo.
I can not.	Ne mogu.
I hope you're well.	Nadam se da si dobro.
But he didn't see it.	Ali on to nije video.
I had to go home.	Morao sam da idem kući.
Maybe he was right.	Možda je bio u pravu.
But there is no one there.	Ali tamo nema nikoga.
It was the same with me.	Tako je bilo i sa mnom.
Maybe even too obvious for me to say.	Možda čak i previše očigledno da bih morao reći.
You are the only one.	Ti si jedini.
I have a few more.	Imam još nekoliko.
Maybe she knew it wouldn't be.	Možda je znala da neće biti.
There he was now.	Tamo je sada bio.
Only better, much better.	Samo bolje, mnogo bolje.
I can get it.	Mogu to dobiti.
But it is something we can all do.	Ali to je nešto što svi mi možemo.
It's just things.	To su samo stvari.
I just want my new one.	Želim samo svoj novi.
They did that last year.	To su uradili prošle godine.
It really is.	To je zaista.
He had to know about it.	Morao je da zna za to.
We are everything.	Mi smo sve.
I hope that will be enough for you long enough.	Nadam se da će vam to biti dovoljno dugo.
He lost them.	Izgubio ih je.
You've had better than that so far.	Do sada ste imali bolje od toga.
I should have known that.	Trebao sam to znati.
Only it wasn't, it seemed.	Samo što nije, činilo se.
This cannot be what it seems.	Ovo ne može biti ono što se čini.
This can't be right.	Ovo ne može biti u redu.
But it doesn't work.	Ali to ne radi.
And now they are gone.	A sada ih nema.
This can be done very easily.	Ovo se može uraditi vrlo lako.
But she knew she had to do better than that.	Ali znala je da mora bolje od toga.
There are too many of them.	Ima ih previše.
You have to leave.	Moraš otići.
I'm sure you'll do your best.	Siguran sam da ćeš dati sve od sebe.
Okay, it was unlikely.	U redu, bilo je malo vjerovatno.
I actually have no idea.	Zapravo nemam pojma.
Just a little more.	Samo još malo.
We should go and help.	Trebali bi otići i pomoći.
But that's not all they were.	Ali to nije sve što su bili.
That's all it does.	To je sve što radi.
I'm still not sure which one.	Još nisam siguran koji.
Say we said that.	Reci da smo to rekli.
I told you that afternoon.	Rekao sam ti to popodne.
It could be.	Moglo bi biti.
Nobody wants them.	Niko ih ne želi.
.	.
I heard about him.	Čuo sam za njega.
I have them, for sure, for sure.	Imam ih, sigurno, sigurno.
She was nothing to him.	Ona mu nije bila ništa.
I know he will.	Znam da hoće.
So that won't be a problem.	Tako da to neće biti problem.
Maybe there's no one there.	Možda tamo nema nikoga.
It took me a long time to do that.	Trebalo mi je dosta vremena da to uradim.
She knew she couldn't stay there long.	Znala je da ne može dugo ostati tamo.
The money was needed quickly.	Novac je trebao brzo.
I wonder if they are all right.	Pitam se da li su dobro.
They had nothing, they had nothing.	Nisu imali ništa, nisu imali ništa.
No, it wasn't like that.	Ne, nije bilo tako.
I've been to all of them.	Bio sam na svima.
He talks about it.	On govori o tome.
If we can leave early, so much the better for us.	Ako možemo ranije otići, tim bolje za nas.
I am nothing.	Ja nisam ništa.
I still thought it was you.	I dalje sam mislio da si to ti.
This is not good.	To nije dobro.
He doesn't have a car.	On nema auto.
And often.	I to često.
I was alone, as usual.	Bio sam sam, kao i obično.
That could be good.	To bi moglo biti dobro.
You certainly wouldn't be able to do that if it wasn't true.	Sigurno ne biste to mogli da uradite da to nije istina.
It's not a good road.	Nije dobar put.
It was better that way.	Tako je bilo bolje.
You gave me my life back.	Vratio si mi život.
But what he thought he did not say.	Ali ono što je mislio nije rekao.
Don't do it right.	Ne čini to kako treba.
It may help, but it doesn’t have to.	To može pomoći, ali ne mora.
He came.	Došao je.
They will get their day.	Oni će dobiti svoj dan.
And no one said anything.	I niko ništa nije rekao.
I am everything.	Sve sam.
But it won't do that.	Ali to neće učiniti.
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
You will help me.	Ti ćeš mi pomoći.
This seems likely.	Ovo izgleda vjerovatno.
I don't think so.	Mislim da neće.
But there is something else.	Ali postoji još nešto.
You feel sorry for them.	Žao vam ih je.
One day, one day.	Jedan dan, jedan dan.
I wanted nothing to do with it.	Nisam želio ništa s tim.
I mean, there was a time when he was.	Mislim, bilo je vremena kada je bio.
And it is.	I jeste.
We have it in us to do it.	Imamo to u sebi da to uradimo.
It really wasn't that bad.	Zaista nije bilo tako loše.
Mary would be pleased.	Mary bi bilo drago.
But she does.	Ali ona to radi.
You are my friend.	Ti si moj prijatelj.
The question is how to do it.	Pitanje je kako to učiniti.
I thought you should know.	Mislio sam da bi trebao znati.
No, that can't be true.	Ne, to ne može biti istina.
I hope that's true.	Nadam se da je to istina.
You always are.	Uvek jesi.
Nobody knows it's there but me.	Niko ne zna da je tu osim mene.
They never knew we were there.	Nikada nisu znali da smo tamo.
Things people said.	Stvari koje su ljudi rekli.
As if that would be good.	Kao da bi to bilo dobro.
He had no money.	Nije imao novca.
She said .	Ona je rekla .
You're good so far.	Dobar si do sada.
If only for a few days.	Ako samo na nekoliko dana.
Maybe he is.	Možda i on jeste.
You know it is.	Znaš da jeste.
There always seems to be a good year for something.	Čini se da uvijek postoji dobra godina za nešto.
Not so much anymore.	Ne više toliko.
It's true, really.	Istina je, zaista.
None of this is real.	Ništa od toga nije stvarno.
So much is happening to me.	Toliko toga mi se dešava.
I guess you shouldn't.	Pretpostavljam da ne bi trebalo.
He will always tell you what to do.	Uvek će vam reći šta da radite.
They never were and never will be.	Nikada nisu bili i nikada neće biti.
I don't want any more.	Ne želim više.
Even if the job is busy.	Čak i ako je posao zauzet.
You may have to say no to yourself.	Možda ćete morati reći ne i sebi.
It seems to be true.	Čini se da je istina.
I would do everything right.	Uradio bih sve kako treba.
That's just not the case.	To jednostavno nije tako.
It is very difficult.	To je jako teško.
Now I’m not so sure about that.	Sada nisam tako siguran u to.
Do what you say you will do.	Uradi ono što kažeš da ćeš uraditi.
I think this one is real.	Mislim da je ovaj pravi.
And it could.	I moglo bi.
Nobody thought it would be, but it is.	Niko nije mislio da će biti, ali jeste.
But you don't have to do that.	Ali ne morate to da radite.
It's not as hard as you think.	Nije tako teško kao što mislite.
But that was all he could do.	Ali to je bilo sve što je mogao učiniti.
So he couldn't see.	Tako da nije mogao da vidi.
Maybe it was because of the weather.	Možda je to bilo zbog vremena.
He wondered where she was.	Pitao se gdje je.
That's what he should have said.	To je trebalo da kaže.
I could never find it.	Nikad ga nisam mogao naći.
You will come and meet me tomorrow.	Doći ćeš sutra i naći se sa mnom.
I have everything you asked for.	Imam sve što si tražio.
That's the real you.	To si pravi ti.
Someone is telling us all this.	Neko nam sve ovo govori.
He lives a few doors down.	Živi nekoliko vrata dalje.
Apparently not.	Očigledno nije.
And nothing better to do.	I ništa bolje za uraditi.
Or who actually did what.	Ili ko je šta zapravo uradio.
I know enough to know he's right.	Znam dovoljno da znam da je u pravu.
That just wasn't true.	To jednostavno nije bila istina.
Except he was.	Osim što je bio.
He can say what he wants.	Može da kaže šta hoće.
The business was bad.	Posao je bio loš.
But it will be soon.	Ali uskoro će biti.
So it looks like yes.	Tako da izgleda da.
Bad, bad, very bad.	Loše, loše, veoma loše.
I mean, no, not really.	Mislim, ne, ne baš.
That's what we did, if that happens.	Tako smo i uradili, ako dođe do toga.
How can this be done.	Kako se to može uraditi.
But not him.	Ali ne on.
He had much more to say.	Imao je još mnogo toga da kaže.
I would love to see her.	Voleo bih da je vidim.
And he looked good.	I izgledao je dobro.
I do it all myself.	Sve to radim sam.
Pretty simple, it seems to me.	Prilično jednostavno, čini mi se.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
It would not be enough to do much good.	Ne bi bilo dovoljno da se učini mnogo dobra.
I didn't have that either.	Ni to nisam imao.
The only way, the only way.	Jedini način, jedini način.
You can never tell.	Nikad ne možeš reći.
Someone must have seen it before.	Neko je to morao ranije da vidi.
He didn't come back.	Nije se vratio.
He was always at home, we were always together.	Uvijek je bio kod kuće, uvijek smo bili zajedno.
Not for the life of me.	Ne za moj život.
That is really helpful.	To je zaista od pomoći.
Maybe she didn't want to.	Možda to nije htela.
.	.
Now there is this, and this, and this and much more.	Sada ima ovo, i ovo, i ovo i još mnogo toga.
We can be sure of that.	U to možemo biti sigurni.
Certainly not.	Sigurno ne bi.
This time is for you.	Ovo vrijeme je za vas.
And they are like us.	I oni su kao mi.
Okay, one more.	U redu, još jedan.
He was very happy to be back soon.	Bio je veoma sretan što će se uskoro vratiti.
I wouldn't do it now.	Ne bih to sada uradio.
I would lose my job.	Izgubio bih posao.
I didn't see anyone with him.	Nisam video nikoga sa njim.
But that's the way it is.	Ali to je tako.
You just didn't hear me.	Samo me nisi čuo.
She does everything.	Ona sve radi.
You have to give it to him the way he wants it.	Morate mu dati kako on to želi.
That's how it is with me.	Tako je to sa mnom.
Maybe he knows now.	Možda sada zna.
They just knew he was coming.	Znali su samo da će doći.
He said it never happened.	Rekao je da se to nikada nije dogodilo.
I must have a problem.	Mora da imam problem.
Came and went.	Došao i otišao.
I told him he had to help me.	Rekao sam mu da mi mora pomoći.
And that will happen.	I to će se dogoditi.
That was her.	To je ona bila.
No one should ever know.	Niko nikada ne bi trebao znati.
We were often there together.	Često smo bili tamo zajedno.
I have no idea about so many things.	Nemam pojma o toliko stvari.
He expected what he got.	Očekivao je ono što je dobio.
We don't even know who they are.	Ne znamo ni ko su oni.
I know it's not, it's not.	Znam da nije, nije baš.
But now you're home, with us.	Ali sada si kod kuće, sa nama.
He is absolutely right.	Potpuno je u pravu.
It certainly wasn't for me.	To sigurno nije bilo za mene.
Not that he was working.	Nije da je radio.
I didn't see any of that.	Nisam video ništa od toga.
I'm telling you.	Kažem ti.
It was a long time before I came home.	Bilo je to dugo vremena da se nisam vratio kući.
There was no way he could do that.	Ni na koji način to nije mogao učiniti.
Maybe it's better that way.	Možda je tako bolje.
But now he was alone.	Ali sada je bio sam.
I see it now, for the first time.	Vidim to sada, prvi put.
They could help us.	Mogli bi nam pomoći.
This cannot be returned.	Ovo se ne može vratiti.
It's pretty easy to do.	To je prilično lako učiniti.
Okay, so far so good.	U redu, za sada je dobro.
Don't tell me it doesn't exist.	Nemoj mi reći da ne postoji.
I hope he gets better soon.	Nadam se da će mu uskoro biti bolje.
That doesn't happen to anyone.	To se nikome ne dešava.
I really should have known.	Stvarno sam trebao znati.
It's a job.	To je posao.
Not even this alone.	Ni ovo samo.
This should be as it should be.	Ovo bi trebalo biti kako treba.
He is here to help.	On je tu da pomogne.
He wants us all.	On želi sve nas.
But only for today.	Ali samo za danas.
It's really not that bad.	Zaista nije tako loše.
That's all you have.	To je sve što imaš.
Just for a second.	Samo za malo.
I mean, how could he.	Mislim, kako je mogao.
Just nothing happens.	Samo se ništa ne dešava.
You have to leave.	Moraš otići.
And there are more.	A ima ih još.
We couldn't find anyone.	Nismo mogli nikoga naći.
I'm sure there is one.	Siguran sam da postoji jedan.
No one seemed to be home.	Činilo se da niko nije bio kod kuće.
This is what we all can and must do.	To je ono što svi možemo i moramo učiniti.
I see him playing.	Vidim ga kako igra.
This happened very quickly.	Ovo se dogodilo vrlo brzo.
and obviously it was.	i očigledno je bilo.
We all know there is money.	Svi znamo da ima novca.
From month to month.	Od mjeseca do mjeseca.
You can not.	Ne možeš.
I think we should do this now.	Mislim da ovo treba da uradimo sada.
Maybe she would know something.	Možda bi ona nešto znala.
And in that.	I u tome.
It's hard to say more.	Teško je više reći.
It's just good or bad.	To je samo dobro ili loše.
I want to know who knew.	Želim da znam ko je znao.
It doesn't even exist anymore.	Više čak i ne postoji.
I work from home.	Radim od kuće.
But he knew he wasn't.	Ali znao je da nije.
The question is not about us.	Pitanje nije o nama.
And he will get it.	I on će ga dobiti.
I hope not.	Nadam se da ne bi.
No one can do this.	Niko ne može ovo da uradi.
But that's all she said.	Ali to je sve što je rekla.
Maybe there are more by now.	Možda ih je do sada više.
We have plenty of that.	Imamo dosta toga.
I need to talk to him right away.	Moram odmah razgovarati s njim.
I thought.	Mislio sam.
It's easy and fast.	Lako je i brzo.
We did this.	Uradili smo ovo.
She doesn’t know when, but she knows it’s going to happen.	Ona ne zna kada, ali zna da će se to dogoditi.
It was all just not.	Bilo je sve samo ne.
I would love to see him more.	Voleo bih da ga vidim više.
You all are.	Svi ste.
It could no longer be said.	Više se nije moglo reći.
That's okay with me.	To je u redu sa mnom.
And so far it has been.	I do sada je bilo tako.
But so far it looks good.	Ali za sada izgleda dobro.
But you know what.	Ali znaš šta.
I'm afraid we can't tell you much.	Bojim se da vam ne možemo puno reći.
I'm still tired.	I dalje sam umoran.
You are good person.	Ti si dobra osoba.
Maybe that wasn't right.	Možda to nije bilo u redu.
I see it now.	Vidim to sada.
This one will see you okay.	Ovaj će te vidjeti u redu.
And there is plenty of time.	I ima dovoljno vremena.
Now there could be a problem.	Sada bi mogao biti problem.
He wondered if he could tell him.	Pitao se može li mu reći.
There was something about .	Bilo je nešto o .
I couldn't tell.	Ne bih mogao reći.
Yeah, looks like it's going to happen now.	Da, kao da će se to sada dogoditi.
And she didn't want him either.	A ni ona ga nije htela.
With me, as always.	Kod mene, kao i uvek.
Don't say anything now.	Ne govori ništa sada.
That simply cannot be true.	To jednostavno ne može biti istina.
He came right away.	Odmah je došao.
He would be the first.	On bi bio prvi.
She really has no idea.	Ona zaista nema pojma.
If she said it was, it was.	Ako je rekla da je tako, bilo je tako.
That's what it's all about.	To je ono o čemu se radi.
I think it was just one.	Mislim da je to bio samo jedan.
He knew it wouldn't be.	Znao je da neće biti.
I've never had to before.	Nikada ranije nisam morao.
This man and what he knew.	Ovaj čovjek i ono što je znao.
That's how he saw me.	Tako me je video.
He seems to be a good man.	Čini se da je dobar čovjek.
But it should be neither here nor there.	Ali to ne bi trebalo biti ni ovdje ni tamo.
I love you.	Volim te.
They immediately said no.	Odmah su rekli ne.
I hope to see you soon.	Nadam se da ću uskoro od vas.
Not good at all.	Uopšte nije dobro.
That's how you know.	Tako znaš.
Apparently there was more to it.	Očigledno je bilo više toga.
We do no such thing.	Ne radimo tako nešto.
I need a car.	Treba mi auto.
I really can't believe it.	Zaista ne mogu vjerovati.
He is a real man.	On je pravi čovjek.
I'm just not sure how.	Samo nisam siguran kako.
It never should be.	Nikada ne bi trebalo biti.
He's that for me.	On je to za mene.
I don't want that to anyone or myself anymore.	Ne želim to više nikome ni sebi.
I wouldn't much earlier.	Ne bih mnogo ranije.
You know, for me.	Znaš, za mene.
You need it now.	Treba ti odmah.
That's just not enough.	To jednostavno nije dovoljno.
I thought no.	Mislio sam ne.
We couldn't be found there.	Tamo nas nije moglo naći.
Someone would surely see us.	Neko bi nas sigurno vidio.
I know why.	Znam zašto.
That should be done today.	To bi trebalo da se uradi danas.
This may not be so obvious.	Ovo možda nije toliko očigledno.
Not yet.	Još nije.
There is nothing simple about that.	U tome nema ništa jednostavno.
But maybe not.	Ali možda i nije.
They probably should.	Vjerovatno bi trebali.
I totally can.	Mogu potpuno.
But he seemed to want to say more.	Ali izgledao je kao da želi reći više.
Everything you want.	Sve što želite.
That's why we're here.	Zbog toga smo ovdje.
You are not bad.	Nisi loš.
It could be me.	Mogao bih biti i ja.
Obviously, you didn't.	Očigledno, nisi.
Yes, this is the first time.	Da, to je prvi put.
But you do it together.	Ali vi to radite zajedno.
I'm not sure about that.	Nisam siguran u to.
But there is a problem.	Ali tu postoji problem.
I don't need one.	Ne treba mi jedan.
He must have been with me.	Sigurno je bio kod mene.
We have to win.	Moramo pobijediti.
And we didn't need it.	I nije nam trebao.
She won't come to you.	Ona neće doći do tebe.
It wasn't meant to be.	Nije trebalo da bude.
Not allowed.	Nije dozvoljeno.
No one will give it to you.	Niko ti to neće dati.
He even said.	Čak je i rekao.
Do to him what you want, but not that.	Radite mu šta želite, ali ne to.
There is no help for you.	Nema pomoći za tebe.
Were there a lot of people.	Da li je bilo mnogo ljudi.
Just see how it goes.	Samo vidi kako ide.
Do something there.	Uradite nešto tamo.
This is the only way.	Ovo je jedini način.
In addition, there was .	Osim toga, bilo je .
I have a job.	Imam posao.
He did his best.	Dao je sve od sebe.
This is a lot of money.	Ovo je dosta novca.
It's not about being better than anyone.	Ne radi se o tome da si bolji od bilo koga.
And so it was.	I tako je bilo.
Much more than that is happening here.	Ovde se dešava mnogo više od toga.
We do everything for you.	Sve radimo za vas.
Not like before.	Ne kao nekada.
And he didn't get any of us.	I nije dobio nikoga od nas.
I would never know it was them.	Nikad ne bih znao da su to oni.
One time three.	Jedan puta tri.
Not even this way.	Čak ni na ovaj način.
You have to say it your way.	Moraš to reći na svoj način.
I think it takes time.	Mislim da treba vremena.
There is no code for that.	Za to ne postoji kod.
That is not true.	To nije tačno.
No one really knows what will happen.	Niko zaista ne zna šta će se dogoditi.
And say it.	I reci to.
You were good, but not now.	Bio si dobar, ali ne sada.
Looks good.	Izgleda dobro.
I thought it was better not to say anything.	Mislio sam da je bolje da ne kažem ništa.
That wasn't it.	To nije bilo to.
And maybe that was a good thing.	A možda je to bila dobra stvar.
Very few people could do that.	Vrlo malo ljudi bi to moglo učiniti.
I'm just not sure what it is.	Samo nisam siguran šta je to.
That alone tells you everything.	Samo to ti sve govori.
I mean, he can be, when he has to.	Mislim, on može biti, kad mora.
He liked to make a party out of it.	Voleo je da pravi zabavu od toga.
It's really quite simple.	Zaista je prilično jednostavno.
I don't know about that.	Ne znam za to.
Do a lot with a little.	Uradite puno sa malo.
He's not here right now.	Trenutno nije ovdje.
The code exists.	Kod postoji.
I loved all those things.	Voleo sam sve te stvari.
I will never say.	Nikad neću reći.
This took time, years.	Za ovo je trebalo vremena, godine.
He could have done it today if he had wanted to.	Mogao bi to učiniti danas da je htio.
If you want to talk, you'll come to me.	Ako želiš razgovarati, doći ćeš kod mene.
As before.	Kao nekada.
I already know we will work together.	Već znam da ćemo raditi zajedno.
I really love you, you know.	Stvarno te volim, znaš.
That should be me.	To bih trebao biti ja.
Now he understood why.	Sada je shvatio zašto.
You can work here.	Ovdje možete raditi.
But it doesn't have to be with you.	Ali to ne mora biti s tobom.
You don't know.	Vi ne znate.
It's so real.	Tako je stvarno.
But it's hard to say anything.	Ali teško je nešto reći.
We've done so much together.	Toliko smo toga uradili zajedno.
It's no longer true.	Više nije istina.
Nobody tells me anything.	Niko mi ništa ne govori.
I don't know what could happen.	Ne znam šta bi se moglo dogoditi.
I hope this will be good for you.	Nadam se da će vam ovo biti dobro.
Maybe he thought he didn't have time.	Možda je mislio da nema vremena.
Just what we need.	Baš ono što nam treba.
For now, it seems to be working.	Za sada se čini da radi.
He had his way.	Imao je svoj put.
He should know why he did what he did.	Trebalo bi da zna zašto je uradio to što je uradio.
It's okay, you're fine.	U redu je, ti si dobro.
But he's a guy.	Ali on je momak.
Now he had to know why.	Sada je morao znati zašto.
I'm sure he will.	Siguran sam da hoće.
But you know about it.	Ali ti znaš o tome.
You didn't know that.	Nisi to znao.
I hope it works well.	Nadam se da to dobro radi.
There! 	Tamo!
there! 	tamo!
She is not.	Ona nije.
But she is, you are.	Ali ona jeste, ti jesi.
I couldn't see her anymore.	Više je nisam mogao vidjeti.
We know how to do it.	Znamo kako da to uradimo.
I should tell him.	Trebao bih mu reći.
I saw him.	Vidio sam ga.
Not what she just said.	Ne ono što je upravo rekla.
He couldn't do enough.	Nije mogao učiniti dovoljno.
Not much.	Nije puno.
I still have some of that.	Još uvek imam nešto od toga.
I want you to know something.	Želim da znaš nešto.
Everything she said was true.	Sve što je rekla bilo je tačno.
But it didn't.	Ali nije.
He said that.	On je to rekao.
I couldn't believe it.	Nisam mogao vjerovati.
What to do?	Šta da radim?
If not it is still very easy.	Ako ne i dalje vrlo je lako.
This is not true.	To nije istina.
What was good about that, he wasn't sure.	Šta je dobro od toga, nije bio siguran.
We didn't have much time.	Nismo imali previše vremena.
She can't do anything about it.	Ona ne može ništa s tim.
I'm not sure how to do that.	Nisam siguran kako to da uradim.
The man said no.	Čovjek je rekao ne.
Maybe he knows something.	Možda zna nešto.
That's just not right.	To jednostavno nije u redu.
It's not true, but it works.	Nije tačno, ali radi.
You and him.	Ti i on.
It takes time.	Treba vremena.
Many, many years.	Mnogo, mnogo godina.
I couldn't find anything real.	Nisam mogao naći ništa stvarno.
I told him a lot.	Rekao sam mu puno.
That's a pretty good man.	To je prilično dobar čovjek.
None of us know.	Niko od nas ne zna.
And everything is very fast.	I sve je veoma brzo.
This is not a problem.	Ovo nije problem.
He didn't leave.	Nije otišao.
I will stay here.	Ja ću ostati ovdje.
Maybe you're not good either.	Možda ni ti nisi dobar.
It never was and never will be.	Nikada nije bilo i nikada neće biti.
I think this is so true.	Mislim da je ovo tako istina.
A lot.	Mnogo .
When you tell me all these things.	Kad mi kažeš sve ove stvari.
No, better than that.	Ne, bolje od toga.
We had something to talk about.	Imali smo o čemu razgovarati.
It wasn't much.	Nije bilo puno.
What is he.	Što je on.
I don't want that anymore.	Ne želim više tako.
I didn't think so.	Nisam mislio.
It was a few years ago.	Bilo je to prije nekoliko godina.
I need him to leave today.	Treba mi da ode danas.
It won't be the first.	Neće biti prvi.
But that's your problem.	Ali to je tvoj problem.
It was for me.	Za mene je bio.
He probably was.	Vjerovatno je bio.
You know, a long time.	Znate, dugo vremena.
None of that works.	Ništa od toga ne radi.
I'll just say this.	Reći ću samo ovo.
He just didn't have much to say.	Jednostavno nije imao puno toga da kaže.
You should do that.	To bi trebalo da uradite.
He asked them yesterday.	Pitao ih je juče.
This can't happen.	Ovo se ne može dogoditi.
That says a lot.	To govori puno.
They will not be seen again.	Neće se više vidjeti.
Either you can or you can't.	Ili možeš ili ne možeš.
But that's not what he means.	Ali to nije ono što on misli.
Not with him either.	Ni sa njim.
They should be.	Trebali bi biti.
But we don't do that.	Ali mi to ne radimo.
I don't love myself.	Ne volim sebe.
Yesterday was that day.	Jučer je bio taj dan.
I did not see you.	Nisam te vidio.
It could happen very soon.	Moglo bi se dogoditi vrlo brzo.
Yes, there were.	Da, bilo ih je.
I knew a lot more.	Znao sam mnogo više.
And you are .	A ti si .
That doesn't look right.	To ne izgleda u redu.
It's like that here.	Ovdje je tako.
Maybe he could be trusted.	Možda bi mu se moglo vjerovati.
No time for that.	Nema vremena za to.
Maybe too much.	Možda previše.
They did very well.	Uradili su veoma dobro.
I've never actually been there.	Zapravo nikad nisam bio tamo.
I think it will be next week.	Mislim da će to biti sljedeće sedmice.
Yes, we will do that.	Da, to ćemo učiniti.
I do not know what to say.	Ne znam šta da ti kažem.
He had never seen it before.	Nikad ga prije nije vidio.
One life must go.	Jedan život mora otići.
They were better, maybe.	Bili su bolji, možda.
But obviously not.	Ali očigledno, ne.
And there is.	I postoji.
I didn’t know until he said he needed the money.	Nisam znao dok nije rekao da treba novac.
There is nothing now.	Sada nema ništa.
No, not much.	Ne, ne mnogo.
I still think he's wrong.	I dalje mislim da nije u pravu.
I can't go back to it.	Ne mogu se vratiti na to.
It was very bad at home.	Kod kuće je bilo jako loše.
We'll know soon enough.	Uskoro ćemo znati.
I know that can be difficult in itself.	Znam da to može biti teško samo po sebi.
Before that it works very well.	Prije toga radi vrlo dobro.
All he wanted was money.	Sve što je želio je novac.
I've never seen her do that before.	Nikada je ranije nisam video da to radi.
Someone is waiting for me.	Neko me čeka.
I do all that.	Sve to radim.
It always has been, always will be.	Uvek je bio, uvek će biti.
She said she couldn't tell.	Rekla je da ne može reći.
Tell me why you like it.	Reci zašto ti se sviđa.
But not in the way you probably think.	Ali ne na način na koji vjerovatno mislite.
And that happened.	I to se dogodilo.
No one knew what had happened yet.	Niko još nije znao šta se dogodilo.
And you know he got it.	I znaš da je dobio.
You and me, it can still happen.	Ti i ja, to se još uvijek može dogoditi.
Someone he could talk to.	Neko s kim bi mogao razgovarati.
I'm here often.	Često sam ovde.
They are always there.	Oni su uvek tu.
It's just none of my business.	To jednostavno nije moja stvar.
That's what we need.	To je ono što nam treba.
There is nothing wrong with that either.	Ni tu ništa nije u redu.
There is .	Postoji .
He can't see.	Ne može da vidi.
If he did, he probably knew everything.	Ako jeste, vjerovatno je znao sve.
I want to be happy.	Ja želim biti sretan.
I couldn't work yet.	Još nisam mogao raditi.
He doesn't want to go home.	Ne želi da ide kući.
You can't do that.	Ne možeš to učiniti.
This is not life, you know.	Ovo nije život, znaš.
This should have been done for now.	Ovo je trebalo uraditi za sada.
It is the same today.	I danas je tako.
He doesn't seem to have any friends.	Izgleda da nema prijatelja.
I like that.	Sviđa mi se to.
I had to tell myself that.	Morao sam to sebi reći.
But she's not thinking of me.	Ali ona ne misli na mene.
That is to say, bad.	To će reći, loše.
I have no idea what.	Nemam pojma šta.
We should.	Trebali bismo.
I have a few.	Imam nekoliko.
And you don't need it.	I ne treba ti.
I thought that was it.	Mislio sam da je to to.
It probably is.	Verovatno jeste.
It's always like that.	Uvek je tako.
Don't say anything.	Ne govori ništa.
Or they are, you know.	Ili su, znate.
You can trust me.	Možeš mi vjerovati .
For everything that happened to me.	Za sve što mi se dogodilo.
These are people.	To su ljudi.
It could be.	Moglo bi biti.
Everything works fine now.	Sada sve radi dobro.
Better than it already was.	Bolje nego što je već bilo.
I know what you mean.	Znam na šta misliš.
But they are alive.	Ali oni su živi.
I wanted her.	Želeo sam je.
That was a few years ago.	To je bilo prije nekoliko godina.
Besides, no one knew.	Osim toga, niko nije znao.
Right now, no problem.	Odmah, nema problema.
That's what she says.	To je ono što ona kaže.
I'm not sure how to do that.	Nisam baš siguran kako to da uradim.
It couldn't be him.	To nije mogao biti on.
You can do whatever you want with it.	Možete raditi šta želite s njim.
I didn't mean anything like that.	Nisam mislio na tako nešto.
There he was.	Tu je bio.
But that's probably why.	Ali vjerovatno je to razlog zašto.
I asked to know.	Tražio sam da znam.
Tom loved you.	Tom te je volio.
Now he's back.	Sada se vratio.
I don't have much of a clue.	Nemam mnogo pojma.
I can do a lot.	Mogu mnogo.
He knows better.	On zna bolje.
He sees me.	On me vidi.
He's fine.	On je dobro.
I'm not sure what's going on next.	Nisam siguran šta se dalje dešava.
And right away.	I to odmah.
I don't know what to say about myself.	Ne znam šta da kažem o sebi.
And we really can.	I zaista možemo.
But there is much more.	Ali tu je još mnogo toga.
And it is now.	I to je sada.
That's the real reason.	To je pravi razlog.
And no one saw them.	I niko ih nije video.
We really needed the money.	Jako nam je trebao novac.
Quick and easy as we said.	Brzo i jednostavno kao što smo rekli.
It's something you simply have to see for yourself.	To je nešto što jednostavno morate sami vidjeti.
That's all it ever was.	To je sve što je ikada bilo.
It looks like he will stay.	Čini se da će ostati.
He didn't mind going to work.	Nije mu bilo loše što je otišao na posao.
They are not together.	Nisu zajedno.
Another life.	Još jedan život.
I might work tonight.	Možda radim večeras.
And nobody saw anything.	I niko ništa nije video.
There were so many people there.	Tamo je bilo toliko ljudi.
It's small, but you should do it too.	To je malo, ali i vi to treba da uradite.
Problem .	Problem .
But she knows.	Ali ona zna.
But that was many years ago.	Ali to je bilo prije mnogo godina.
He's in the house with you.	On je u kući sa tobom.
I don't think you should go.	Mislim da ne bi trebao ići.
But they didn't know the truth about it.	Ali nisu znali istinu o tome.
They can be anyone.	Oni mogu biti bilo ko.
We can go back to what was before.	Možemo se vratiti na ono što je bilo prije.
How are you.	Kako si.
You can say what you like.	Možete reći šta vam se sviđa.
But they are always human.	Ali oni su uvek ljudi.
I don't know where the problem might be.	Ne znam gdje bi mogao biti problem.
He should, you're his friend.	Trebao bi, ti si mu prijatelj.
It’s not that hard but it’s long.	Nije tako teško ali je dugo.
And there are a lot of them.	A ima ih puno.
In a little while.	Za malo.
And they could.	I mogli su.
But you just don’t do it.	Ali to jednostavno ne radite.
He didn't say no.	Nije rekao ne.
He's too busy.	Previše je zauzet.
No one asked about me.	Niko nije pitao za mene.
Yesterday he did just that.	Juče je upravo to uradio.
That can't be right.	To ne može biti tačno.
He couldn't really believe he would do that.	Nije mogao stvarno vjerovati da će to učiniti.
You don't need any more.	Ne treba ti više.
He loves her even more because of it.	On je voli još više zbog toga.
If something feels right, it probably is.	Ako se nešto čini kako treba, vjerovatno je tako.
But that wasn't my problem.	Ali to nije bio moj problem.
It's about all of us together.	Radi se o svima nama zajedno.
Simply put, no one does it better.	Jednostavno, niko to ne radi bolje.
But that won't happen.	Ali to se neće dogoditi.
You were there a long time.	Bio si tamo dugo vremena.
No, that's not it.	Ne, to nije to.
We had more power.	Imali smo više moći.
I should.	Trebao bi.
Who was all that?	Ko je sve to bio.
I love this too.	Volim i ovo.
We are working now.	Sada radimo.
You don't have to tell me that.	Ne moraš mi to reći.
It just doesn't do anything.	Jednostavno ne radi ništa.
Do you really think there.	Da li stvarno mislite tamo.
I could do this.	Mogao bih ovo da uradim.
I ask them if that is so.	Pitam ih da li je to tako.
I will never buy it.	Nikad ga neću kupiti.
I'm very well.	Ja sam vrlo dobro.
That's my boyfriend.	To je moj momak.
I don't see how that can happen.	Ne vidim kako se to može dogoditi.
You probably already know how difficult it was.	Verovatno već znate koliko je bilo teško.
Maybe this is safe.	Možda je ovo sigurno.
He never asked me anything about it.	Nikada me nije pitao ništa o tome.
Really, I really would.	Zaista, stvarno bih.
Probably is.	Verovatno jeste.
It's a good thing we did.	Baš je dobro što smo uradili.
She knew it would come.	Znala je da će doći.
Now! 	Odmah!
.	.
And I'm very happy to see you.	I veoma sam sretan što te vidim.
It's that easy.	To je tako lako.
They were both safe.	Oboje su bili sigurni.
I have a door.	Imam vrata.
The truth is they didn't.	Istina je da nisu.
It wasn't her.	To nije bila ona.
You know how this is done.	Znate kako se ovo radi.
None of that.	Ništa od toga.
It's good.	To je dobro.
Are you even going to be.	Hoćeš li uopšte biti.
And that was just a year.	I to je bila samo godina.
Maybe it shouldn't be.	Možda ne bi trebalo da bude.
I have nothing.	Nemam ništa.
And she knew it.	I ona je to znala.
That's not always a good thing.	To nije uvijek dobra stvar.
I'm really sorry.	Zaista mi je jako žao.
He didn't know where he was.	Nije znao gdje je.
It's not that simple.	Nije baš jednostavno.
Maybe a lot more.	Možda mnogo više.
Who is there? 	Ko je tamo?
.	.
He was always there.	Uvek je bio tu.
She will stay here.	Ona će ostati ovdje.
I do not know exactly.	Ne znam tačno.
I could do that.	Mogao bih to učiniti.
It might help him.	Moglo bi mu pomoći.
I will say no more.	Neću više reći.
I know you're there.	Znam da si tamo.
He did, and the man didn't come back.	Jeste, a čovjek se nije vratio.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nema ništa loše u tome.
He shouldn't see something like that.	Ne bi trebao da vidi tako nešto.
And this is it.	I to je ovo.
He knew that he knew that he knew.	Znao je da je znao da zna.
I didn't have to do that.	Nisam morao to da radim.
He must be here.	On mora biti ovdje.
Probably not much is happening there.	Verovatno se tamo ne dešava mnogo.
It’s not that bad right now, but it still exists.	Trenutno nije tako loše, ali još uvijek postoji.
Just like that, he left.	Samo tako, on je otišao.
He could see everything.	Mogao je sve da vidi.
He doesn't mean anything bad.	On ne misli ništa loše.
Something that never works.	Nešto što nikad ne radi.
I'm not even tired.	Nisam čak ni umoran.
She was alone here.	Bila je sama ovdje.
But that cannot be done.	Ali to se ne može učiniti.
You didn't say what the problem was.	Niste rekli u čemu je problem.
Something is about to happen.	Nešto će se uskoro dogoditi.
He would surely have known earlier.	Sigurno bi znao ranije.
He should have seen it.	Trebao je to vidjeti.
He'll tell you when he's ready.	Reći će ti kad bude spreman.
She wouldn't tell me anything more than that.	Ne bi mi rekla ništa više od toga.
And a lot of that.	I dosta toga.
But he says nothing.	Ali on ne govori ništa.
It was very good.	Bilo je veoma dobro.
That wouldn't be a good job.	To ne bi bio dobar posao.
I think that can happen.	Mislim da se to može dogoditi.
And now we know there is a better way.	A sada znamo da postoji bolji način.
But tell me.	Ali reci mi.
Sure it is, but not in the way you think.	Sigurno jeste, ali ne na način na koji mislite.
That was all he knew.	To je bilo sve što je znao.
But the truth is, yes.	Ali istina je, da.
asked.	pitao.
Either it happened or it didn’t happen.	Ili se dogodilo ili se nije dogodilo.
I gave it my all.	Dao sam sve.
The problem is we can't.	Problem je što ne možemo.
You can tell when it works.	Možete reći kada radi.
He is ready for it.	On je spreman za to.
And I love it all.	I ja volim sve to.
So we had her at home.	Tako da smo je imali kod kuće.
She didn't say much.	Nije rekla puno.
Not for myself, but for me.	Ne za sebe, nego za mene.
This can happen.	Ovo se može dogoditi.
It's not long.	Nije dugo.
And he is.	I on je.
I know you have to do this.	Znam da moraš ovo da uradiš.
Another, and another, and another.	Još jedan, i još jedan, i još jedan.
Maybe he was fine.	Možda je bio u redu.
Do this for yourself.	Uradite ovo za sebe.
By no means.	Ni na koji način.
I have little or nothing to say about it.	Imam malo ili ništa da kažem o tome.
It is not me.	Nisam ja.
I am happy to have seen both.	Sretan sam što sam vidio oboje.
You have to tell me everything.	Moraš mi sve reći.
I'm more afraid that I won't.	Više se bojim da neću.
He's usually right.	Obično je u pravu.
And he's never home.	I nikad nije kod kuće.
I think tomorrow.	Mislim da sutra.
I really like talking to you.	Zaista volim razgovarati s tobom.
I want to talk.	Želim razgovarati.
But we didn't know what to do.	Ali nismo znali šta da radimo.
Next year, yes.	Sljedeće godine, da.
We know that to be true.	Znamo da je to istina.
It can happen to you.	Može ti se dogoditi.
But he knows things.	Ali on zna stvari.
My father was not happy about that.	Moj otac nije bio sretan zbog toga.
Nothing seems to be going right.	Čini se da ništa ne ide kako treba.
How does it work.	Kako radi.
I need help now.	Treba mi pomoć sada.
And no she never was.	I ne nikad nije bila.
If not this year, maybe next.	Ako ne ove godine, možda sljedeće.
Maybe you could talk to him.	Možda bi mogao razgovarati s njim.
You just are.	Ti jednostavno jesi.
I made this myself.	Napravio sam ovo sam.
I don't need any more.	Ne treba mi više.
It's for fun.	To je za zabavu.
You know you will.	Znaš da hoćeš.
But he means no harm.	Ali on ne misli ništa loše.
If it's there, you're fine.	Ako je tamo, u redu si.
Get back on track.	Vratiti na pravi put.
But you can tell me anything you want.	Ali možeš mi reći sve što želiš.
It can be good or bad.	To može biti dobro ili loše.
He knew he could.	Znao je da je mogao.
I won't be the first.	Neću biti prvi.
Maybe there aren't any.	Možda ih i nema.
Nobody did anything.	Niko ništa nije uradio.
Don't ever tell him that.	Nemoj mu to nikada reći.
I know how to do it.	Znam kako se to radi.
I want it done right.	Želim da se uradi kako treba.
You did it well.	Dobro si to uradio.
They are like me.	Oni su kao ja.
She didn't say anything bad.	Nije rekla ništa loše.
She never looks my way.	Ona nikad ne izgleda na moj način.
I will never believe it.	Nikad neću vjerovati.
In fact, it probably wasn't safe.	Zapravo vjerovatno nije bilo sigurno.
He wouldn't do something like that.	On ne bi uradio tako nešto.
And she wanted to be.	I htela je da bude.
I can't say why.	Ne mogu reći zašto.
I wasn't very good.	Nisam bio mnogo dobar.
You have to do the right thing.	Morate uraditi pravu stvar.
I know they are right.	Znam da su u pravu.
And it was.	I bilo je.
She will never come home.	Ona se nikada neće vratiti kući.
But we had plenty of time.	Ali imali smo dosta vremena.
That's it.	To je to.
Maybe another one.	Možda još jedan.
It wasn't always like that.	Nije uvijek bilo tako.
This is pretty good.	Ovo je prilično dobro.
He just.	On samo.
Not just code.	Ne samo kod.
But that was what he heard.	Ali to je bilo ono što je čuo.
This is actually pretty simple.	Ovo je zapravo prilično jednostavno.
That time was supposed to be now.	To vrijeme je trebalo biti sada.
Being all there.	Biti sve tu.
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
I've never heard this before.	Nikada ranije nisam čuo ovo.
It never worked for me either.	Ni kod mene nikad nije radio.
Tell me exactly what's going on.	Reci mi šta se tačno dešava.
But it's hard for him to be with us.	Ali teško mu je biti sa nama.
I know he can do it.	Znam da on to može.
Not all there.	Ne sve tamo.
But what he told me.	Ali ono što mi je rekao.
That's the way you want it, isn't it.	To je način na koji to želiš, zar ne.
Maybe it happened.	Možda se to dogodilo.
But now, no.	Ali sada, ne.
And so it should be.	I tako bi trebalo da bude.
And maybe for a few days he really was.	A možda je nekoliko dana zaista i bio.
I made it for you.	Napravio sam za tebe.
But we can talk now if you want.	Ali možemo sada razgovarati ako želiš.
You may have to do this more than once.	Možda ćete to morati učiniti više puta.
There is something we all need to know.	Postoji nešto što svi moramo znati.
This would be the first time.	Ovo bi bilo prvi put.
This was not right.	Ovo nije bilo u redu.
I will come to see you soon.	Doći ću da te vidim uskoro.
That won't help.	To neće pomoći.
You can never win.	Nikad ne možeš pobijediti.
Do you know where it is? 	Znaš li gdje je?
.	.
You don't have to be.	Ne morate biti.
That's what I told him.	To sam mu rekao.
I wasn't sure about you.	Nisam bio siguran u tebe.
He could be anyone.	On može biti bilo ko.
But it doesn't work very well.	Ali ne radi baš dobro.
He didn't do anything in the house.	Ništa nije radio u kući.
I thought it existed.	Mislio sam da postoji.
There is something there.	Ima tu nešto.
How often do I already know.	Koliko često već znam.
Maybe he was looking for me.	Možda je tražio mene.
Now everything goes.	Sada sve ide.
There is still time.	Još ima vremena.
Except it obviously is.	Osim što očigledno jeste.
He didn't say why.	Nije rekao zašto.
This is much better for you.	Ovo je mnogo bolje za tebe.
But that's too much.	Ali to je previše.
That's none of my business.	To nije moja stvar.
She knew he wouldn't say anything.	Znala je da neće ništa reći.
That was a good way to do it.	To je bio dobar način da se to uradi.
But what if it isn't.	Ali šta ako nije.
But she knew she needed to eat.	Ali znala je da treba da jede.
I don't think there's anything you can do.	Mislim da ne možete ništa učiniti.
I have something to say.	Imam nešto da kažem.
Still nothing happens.	I dalje se ništa ne dešava.
Besides, we can do it.	Osim toga, mi to možemo.
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
And the way he said it.	I način na koji je to rekao.
They are always together.	Oni su uvek zajedno.
You can't say that.	Ne možeš to reći.
We will find you help.	Naći ćemo vam pomoć.
Not sure how to proceed.	Nisam siguran kako dalje.
And we do this together.	I ovo radimo zajedno.
I need to know that you want it.	Moram da znam da ti to želiš.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
It's working fine without you right now.	Trenutno radi dobro i bez tebe.
I had no problem with that.	Nisam imao problema s tim.
I didn't expect this to happen so soon.	Nisam očekivao da će se ovo dogoditi tako brzo.
That's not my idea.	To nije moja ideja.
What's happening.	Šta se dešava.
I want you to have it.	Želim da ga imaš.
When will you come home.	Kada ćeš se vratiti kući.
We were also without money.	Bili smo i bez novca.
Just for tonight.	Samo za večeras.
I hope someone could help.	Nadam se da bi neko mogao da pomogne.
Please tell him what you told me.	Molim te reci mu šta si mi rekao.
We were just alone.	Bili smo samo sami.
He knew he wouldn't.	Znao je da neće.
That's a pretty good thing.	To je prilično dobra stvar.
No, no, everything is fine.	Ne, ne, sve je u redu.
That's exactly why we're here.	Upravo zbog toga smo ovdje.
I really want to know.	Stvarno želim da znam.
I don't think that's true.	Mislim da to nije istina.
But he was there.	Ali on je bio tamo.
Which is a good thing.	Što je dobra stvar.
Yes or no.	Da ili ne.
They will be me.	Oni će biti ja.
It could be anything.	Moglo bi biti sve.
Everything will be as usual.	Sve će biti kao i obično.
Not even this year.	Čak ni ove godine.
Obviously we can't trust you.	Očigledno vam ne možemo vjerovati.
We will say no more.	Nećemo reći više.
I had everything and everything wasn't enough.	Imao sam sve i sve nije bilo dovoljno.
That's something, that's all.	To je nešto, to je sve.
She can neither leave nor stay.	Ona ne može ni otići ni ostati.
You had to know.	Morao si znati.
He didn't know what they were.	Nije znao šta su.
It's just a job.	To je samo posao.
That's how it should go.	Tako treba ići.
He did what he had to.	Uradio je ono što je morao.
That was the idea.	To je bila ideja.
Like you, like it's simple.	Kao ti, kao da je jednostavno.
This is a job.	Ovo je posao.
There could be a lot more.	Može biti još mnogo toga.
It's a job.	To je posao.
How he loves her.	Kako je voli.
Maybe just this.	Možda upravo ovo.
But, well, that just didn’t happen.	Ali, dobro, to se jednostavno nije dogodilo.
We have to do this.	Moramo ovo da uradimo.
I had this problem too.	I ja sam imao ovaj problem.
There is a reason for that.	Postoji razlog za to.
That's enough, right.	To je dovoljno, tačno.
No one can find him.	Niko ga ne može naći.
And they know it.	I oni to znaju.
But this was more than that.	Ali ovo je bilo više od toga.
We won't.	Nećemo.
But maybe it was more than that.	Ali možda je to bilo više od toga.
The sooner you do it, the better.	Što prije to uradite, to bolje.
No, we didn't.	Ne, nismo.
But in fact, there was very little to see.	Ali u stvari, bilo je vrlo malo toga za vidjeti.
Timing is everything.	Vrijeme je sve.
But him too.	Ali i njega.
But it was meant to be.	Ali trebalo je biti.
I know we know.	Znam da znamo.
Someone to see.	Neko da vidi.
She knows she has to.	Ona zna da mora.
But that does not exist.	Ali to ne postoji.
Either, or, or.	Ili, ili, ili.
Good day to all.	Dobar dan svima.
I was no longer my man.	Nisam više bio svoj čovjek.
How could we say no?	Kako bismo mogli reći ne?
Everything would be fine.	Sve bi bilo u redu.
I didn't have this problem until yesterday.	Nisam imao ovaj problem do juče.
We could not say what could have happened today.	Nismo mogli reći šta se danas moglo dogoditi.
We are fine together.	Dobro nam je zajedno.
You look nice.	Izgledaš drago.
He still looked like he always did.	I dalje je izgledao kao i uvijek.
It was here.	Bilo je ovdje.
It's really good of you.	Zaista je dobro od tebe.
I know, I'd like something more.	Znam, voleo bi nešto više.
He still goes when he can.	I dalje ide kad može.
It could have been much more.	Moglo je biti mnogo više.
He wasn't alone in that.	Nije bio sam u tome.
He just got back.	Upravo se vratio.
He really came.	On je stvarno došao.
It really is.	Zaista jeste.
That's exactly what we need.	To je upravo ono što nam treba.
And you really can't.	I stvarno ne možeš.
More than that.	Više od toga.
I've been before.	Ja sam prije.
I know you mean well.	Znam da misliš dobro.
She knew nothing.	Nije znala ništa.
No one was on it.	Niko nije bio na tome.
Even go there.	Čak i otići tamo.
I wonder how much.	Pitam se koliko.
What we should do is not what we always do.	Ono što treba da radimo nije ono što uvek radimo.
I can't say enough.	Ne mogu reći dovoljno.
Like the video.	Kao i video.
And we had too much of it.	I imali smo previše toga.
How to proceed.	Kako dalje.
And it's not good.	I nije dobro.
This really works.	Ovo stvarno radi.
If he said so, it must be true.	Ako je tako rekao, mora da je istina.
He didn't love her anymore.	Nije je više volio.
In fact, we know.	U stvari, znamo.
I like it so far.	Sviđa mi se do sada.
This was not the way to live.	Ovo nije bio način da se živi.
It's all true.	Sve je to istina.
That's not me.	To nisam ja.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
It shouldn't have been.	Nije trebalo.
We will be.	Ćemo biti .
They are all.	Svi su oni.
I thought it was her.	Mislio sam da je ona.
They could not return.	Nisu se mogli vratiti.
I'd like to tell him that.	Voleo bih da mu to kažem.
He didn't mean to buy everything you want.	Nije mislio kupiti sve što želiš.
I'm nothing to you.	Nisam ti ništa.
I'm here for you.	Tu sam za tebe.
She didn't say anything about it.	Nije rekla ništa o tome.
That tells you a lot.	To ti puno govori.
I should have found him there already.	Već sam ga tamo trebao naći.
He left.	Otišao je.
What is the story.	Šta je priča.
Maybe that's okay.	Možda je to u redu.
I hope you like it.	Nadam se da ti se sviđa.
I would always ask.	Uvek bih pitao.
We didn't do that.	Mi to nismo uradili.
I know it is.	Znam da jeste.
I would like to .	Volio bih .
Indeed, many times this is true.	Zaista, mnogo puta je to istina.
I thought that was a lot.	Mislio sam da je to mnogo.
You can say that if you want.	Možete to reći ako želite.
This will help everyone.	Ovo će biti od pomoći svima.
He must have been thinking of you.	Mora da je mislio na tebe.
That's what people don't know.	To je ono što ljudi ne znaju.
He didn't say that, but he didn't have to.	Nije to rekao, ali nije morao.
But for that.	Ali za to.
Everything will be fine.	Sve će biti u redu.
But you might be right.	Ali možda ste u pravu.
And that's just not going to happen.	A to se jednostavno neće dogoditi.
You've said it all before.	Sve ste to već rekli.
Someone probably has to go.	Neko verovatno mora da ode.
I saw everything.	Video sam sve.
That was all they could do.	To je bilo sve što su mogli učiniti.
In order to.	Da bi.
We were there for a while.	Bili smo tamo neko vrijeme.
She's still there.	Ona je još uvek tu.
She was almost like me.	Bila je skoro kao ja.
And she'll be fine.	I ona će biti dobro.
I can't just tell you.	Ne mogu samo da ti kažem.
This is all.	To je sve.
But there could have been so many things.	Ali moglo je biti toliko stvari.
Only humans can.	Samo ljudi mogu.
I should have been more.	Trebao sam biti više.
And he would be right.	I bio bi u pravu.
Now do it really.	Sada uradi to stvarno.
She's waiting for him to do something, anything.	Ona čeka da on uradi nešto, bilo šta.
I love you for that.	Volim te zbog toga.
Or maybe earlier.	Ili možda ranije.
He had to do something.	Morao je nešto da uradi.
But he knew what to do.	Ali znao je šta da radi.
He is completely alone here.	Ovdje je potpuno sam.
Something bad is going to happen.	Nešto loše će se dogoditi.
He even wants me to do it.	Čak i želi da to uradim.
I said, good job.	Rekao sam, dobar posao.
He just wanted a little something.	Samo je htio nešto malo.
No more time.	Nema više vremena.
He was tired.	Bio je umoran.
But it doesn't have to.	Ali ne mora.
I was willing to do almost anything.	Bio sam spreman da uradim skoro sve.
He could.	Mogao je.
But now there is more.	Ali sada ima još toga.
They couldn't find anything.	Ništa nisu mogli naći.
If there were any.	Ako ih je bilo.
In fact, we said as much.	U stvari, toliko smo i rekli.
But what happened happened.	Ali dogodilo se ono što se dogodilo.
It was me, just me.	Bio sam ja, samo ja.
He's not ready.	On nije spreman.
You could have done more.	Mogao si uraditi više.
I didn't want you to know the truth.	Nisam želeo da znaš istinu.
Nobody asked about it.	Niko nije pitao za to.
He said for sure.	Rekao je sigurno.
But there was nothing to eat there.	Ali tamo nije bilo šta da se jede.
There is not much help from anyone.	Nema puno pomoći od bilo koga.
That was good.	To je bilo dobro.
I hope you enjoy staying here.	Nadam se da vam se sviđa ostati ovdje.
Neither did I.	Nisam ni ja.
She can't say anything either.	Ni ona ne može ništa da kaže.
But he isn't there.	Ali nema ga.
I know it was hard.	Znam da je bilo teško.
He was so very .	Bio je tako veoma .
That's not the question.	To nije pitanje.
I think a lot.	Mislim puno.
Someone has to know something.	Neko mora nešto da zna.
She didn't know for a long time.	Dugo vremena nije znala.
Now is the time.	Sada je vrijeme.
He said no.	Rekao je da nije.
He couldn't go back now.	Sada se nije mogao vratiti.
She will be there.	Ona će biti tamo.
I just want to see her home.	Samo je želim vidjeti kući.
I love you, I love you, I love you.	Volim te, volim te, volim te.
This is really happening.	Ovo se zaista dešava.
To be really ready.	Da budem zaista spreman.
He wondered why he did it.	Pitao se zašto je to uradio.
He told us about it.	Rekao nam je o tome.
That's bad.	To je loše.
I felt a little sorry for him.	Bilo mi ga je malo žao.
Not like him.	Ne kao on.
I just see everything.	Samo vidim sve.
Everything that was here would not be too much.	Sve što je bilo ovdje ne bi bilo previše.
It was something he was not prepared for.	To je bilo nešto za šta nije bio spreman.
We do that quite often.	To radimo prilično često.
We have it here.	Imamo ga ovde.
You know what you want to do and why.	Znate šta želite da radite i zašto.
Everything is good.	Sve je dobro.
It is now.	Sada jeste.
That's all we have.	To je sve što imamo.
I'm going I'm going	Idem idem.
And that is not difficult.	A to nije teško.
She's nothing to me.	Ona mi nije ništa.
He likes to talk.	On voli da priča.
One is clearly a very bad job.	Jedan je očigledno jako loš posao.
In fact, we can go further.	U stvari, možemo ići i dalje.
Not even a little good at it.	Čak ni malo dobar u tome.
And talk to you if you want.	I razgovarati s tobom ako želiš.
It's not always so obvious.	Nije uvijek tako očigledno.
But only a little.	Ali samo malo.
We know them well.	Znamo ih dobro.
He never needed it.	Nikad mu nije trebalo.
He is the only one.	On je jedini.
He can see.	On može vidjeti.
They were not, not exactly, not alone.	Nisu bili, ne baš, ne sami.
How could it not.	Kako i ne bi.
And I do it for myself.	I ja to radim zbog sebe.
Nothing here.	Ništa ovde.
It's about anything.	Radi se o bilo čemu.
She was there.	Bila je tamo.
You'd never know when.	Nikad ne biste znali kada.
I should have known.	Trebao sam znati.
Everything was fine.	Sve je bilo u redu.
Everything looks good.	Sve izgleda dobro.
Or maybe me.	Ili možda ja.
It can be seen.	To se vidi.
We only know that they do.	Znamo samo da znaju.
I want this.	Želim ovo.
It takes time.	Za to treba vremena.
He did what he knew how to do.	Uradio je ono što zna.
He's there.	On je tamo.
He never thought anything would come of it.	Nikad nije mislio da će od toga nešto biti.
They won't let you.	Neće ti dozvoliti.
It's good, he said.	Dobro je, rekao je.
I still loved him.	I dalje sam ga voleo.
But there is one.	Ali postoji jedan.
Maybe they don't know.	Možda ne znaju.
A new day has come.	Novi dan je došao.
I have to say yes.	Moram da kažem da.
He didn't even have one for himself.	Nije imao ni za sebe.
That's still not all.	To još uvijek nije sve.
I guess you haven't been there yet.	Pretpostavljam da još nisi bio tamo.
Even better, actually.	Čak i bolje, zapravo.
And if so, good for you.	I ako jeste, dobro za vas.
You can't tell anyone this.	Ne možeš ovo nikome reći.
I'm sure you know that.	Siguran sam da to znaš.
We have to allow it.	Moramo to dozvoliti.
And there's only one way to do it.	A postoji samo jedan način da se to uradi.
He actually said that about himself.	On je to zapravo rekao za sebe.
I'm not in.	Nisam u .
They couldn't be here.	Oni nisu mogli biti ovdje.
I want this .	Želim ovo .
We're pretty sure.	Prilično smo sigurni.
We need to talk to ourselves.	Moramo razgovarati sa nama.
We all know what she means.	Svi znamo na šta ona misli.
Not fast enough, for sure.	Ne dovoljno brzo, sigurno.
And certainly not my father.	I sigurno ne moj otac.
Me more than you, she said.	Ja više nego ti, rekla je.
Those who can't.	Oni koji ne mogu.
But not tonight.	Ali ne večeras.
Is it that bad.	Zar je tako loše.
It's not like that.	Nije tako.
My life is much better now.	Moj život je sada mnogo bolji.
It has never been like that before.	Prije nikad nije bilo tako.
She knew what it was.	Znala je šta je.
I wasn't that surprised.	Nisam bio toliko iznenađen.
I wish we still had it.	Voleo bih da ga još uvek imamo.
That in itself is difficult.	To je samo po sebi teško.
Can we have a little? 	Možemo li malo?
I never did.	Nikad nisam.
I had a question.	Imao sam pitanje.
As if everything is going to be okay now.	Kao da će sada sve biti u redu.
Maybe they knew.	Možda su znali.
We can't do without it.	Ne možemo bez toga.
We have enough now.	Sada imamo dovoljno.
It was obviously good.	Očigledno je bilo dobro.
More than he expected or wanted.	Više nego što je očekivao ili želio.
No, that's not happening.	Ne, to se ne dešava.
I have no idea about that.	Nemam pojma o tome.
You can know.	Možeš znati.
We know more.	Znamo više.
That they are me, that they are me.	Da su ja, da su ja.
He knows what's what.	On zna šta je šta.
I didn't even know.	Nisam ni znao.
I hope he still has it.	Nadam se da ga još ima.
She said it's good for you.	Rekla je da je dobro za tebe.
Maybe there weren't any.	Možda ih nije bilo.
Or you, apparently.	Ili ti, očigledno.
I guess he has to.	Pretpostavljam da mora.
I can come back all right.	Mogu se vratiti u redu.
He wasn't expecting us.	Nije nas očekivao.
You're happy too.	I ti si sretan.
Neither did my father.	Ni moj otac nije.
And she was in it.	I ona je bila u tome.
There is nothing, but everything is there.	Ništa nema, ali sve je tu.
He couldn't go any further.	Nije mogao dalje.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Ne želi da priča o tome.
It's not a job.	To nije posao.
He wanted her to know.	Želio je da ona zna.
I never wanted to see him again.	Nikada više nisam želeo da ga vidim.
Not sure what, exactly.	Nisam siguran šta, tačno.
He didn't expect to stay long.	Nije očekivao da će dugo ostati.
Now let me ask you something.	Sada da te pitam nešto.
We could.	Mogli smo.
But you have to be here.	Ali ovdje moraš biti.
I said you wouldn't come.	Rekao sam da nećeš doći.
That is not happening.	To se ne dešava.
He probably already knows if he got it.	Verovatno već zna da li ga je dobio.
No one can find us here.	Ovde nas niko ne može naći.
And there was something else.	A bilo je još nešto.
I actually feel sorry for you.	Zapravo mi te je žao.
I'm having trouble with that.	Imam problema sa tim.
It's something that works, and it works fast.	To je nešto što radi i radi brzo.
He loved you all.	Voleo je sve vas.
That's where he goes.	Tamo on ide.
But he can't drive.	Ali on ne može da vozi.
At the moment it is.	Trenutno je to.
It would be good to be home.	Bilo bi dobro biti kod kuće.
I doubt you ever will.	Sumnjam da ćeš ikada.
He had done it before.	Radio je to ranije.
Not me .	Ne ja .
You knew that before you came.	Znao si to prije nego što si došao.
I didn't do anything.	Nisam ništa uradio.
The radio was not seen.	Radio se nije vidio.
I hope he buys something.	Nadam se da će nešto kupiti.
He never said it would be easy.	Nikad nije rekao da će biti lako.
That's how things were.	Tako je bilo stvari.
I really love you.	Zaista te volim.
But you have to work.	Ali morate raditi.
That, that, he didn't know.	To, to, taj nije znao.
We can never get together again.	Nikada više ne možemo doći zajedno.
Maybe more than that.	Možda i više od toga.
And he was looking for me tonight.	I večeras me je tražio.
Everything looks good to me.	Sve mi izgleda dobro.
We have too.	Imamo i mi.
How? 	Kako?
It just couldn't happen.	To se jednostavno nije moglo dogoditi.
He would bring her back.	On bi je vratio.
It's not okay, but it's true.	Nije u redu, ali tako je.
I wanted more.	Htio sam još.
He would never return.	Nikad se ne bi vratio.
I love them a lot.	Mnogo ih volim.
I have no idea why that is.	Nemam pojma zašto je to tako.
Not without me.	Ne bez mene.
Can anyone help me please.	Može li mi neko pomoći molim vas.
Probably is.	Verovatno jeste.
Even they know it.	Čak i oni to znaju.
All he had to do was play it safe.	Sve što je trebao da uradi je da igra na sigurno.
Indeed, this is true.	Zaista, ovo je tačno.
I thought as you want to know.	Mislio sam kao što želiš da znaš.
I don't see this.	Ne vidim ovo.
And besides, she didn't even know if it was real.	A, osim toga, nije ni znala da li je to stvarno.
The money is there.	Novac je tamo.
But that was no good.	Ali to nije bilo dobro.
How to be good.	Kako biti dobar.
But you never can tell.	Ali nikad ne možeš reći.
It's true.	To je tačno.
But it's not quite like that.	Ali nije baš tako.
That's none of your business.	To nije tvoj posao.
To love myself.	Da volim sebe.
That's not long.	To nije dugo.
We have them.	Imamo ih.
I did something about it.	Učinio sam nešto na tome.
If only we had more time.	Da smo samo imali više vremena.
It was really hard for me.	Bilo mi je zaista teško.
And he's not done yet.	I još nije završio.
It shouldn't take long now.	Sada ne bi trebalo dugo.
But actually it was like that.	Ali zapravo je bilo tako.
It still doesn't work.	I dalje ne radi.
I never needed more than that.	Nikad mi nije trebalo više od toga.
They won't be able to tell you that either.	Ni to vam neće moći reći.
So far it's working fine.	Za sada radi dobro.
If they can do it, so can you.	Ako oni to mogu, možete i vi.
I wish everyone would.	Voleo bih da bi svi.
I'd like to see you there.	Volio bih te vidjeti tamo.
There was a lot.	Bilo je mnogo toga.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
I know what you did.	Znam šta si uradio.
You may find this helpful.	Možda će vam ovo biti od pomoći.
And if it doesn't, it should.	A ako nije, trebalo bi.
It really was them.	To su zaista bili oni.
He didn't get what he should have gotten.	Nije dobio ono što je trebao dobiti.
They weren't together long.	Nisu bili dugo zajedno.
I thought we didn't do that anymore.	Mislio sam da to više ne radimo.
I said again.	Ponovo sam rekao.
I don't like this at all.	Ne sviđa mi se ovo uopšte.
This is a good thing for both of you.	Ovo je dobra stvar za vas oboje.
He wanted it bad.	Želio je to loše.
Even more, really.	Čak i više, zaista.
He said he would stay.	Rekao je da će ostati.
She said okay, okay.	Rekla je u redu, u redu.
She does it for all of us.	Ona to radi za sve nas.
She said it wasn't just her.	Rekla je da nije samo ona.
I hope that was okay.	Nadam se da je to bilo u redu.
You really don't know.	Zaista ne znaš.
This would be very obvious.	Ovo bi bilo veoma očigledno.
If you’re up for it, he’s a game.	Ako ste za to, on je igra.
Tomorrow will be better.	Sutra će biti bolje.
What do we have here? 	Šta imamo ovde?
He knows he will have to.	Zna da će morati.
They're all here now.	Sada su svi ovdje.
She was there.	Bila je tamo.
I really love it !.	Zaista volim!.
And now it works.	I sada radi.
Apparently no one was.	Očigledno niko nije bio.
But she doesn't work that way.	Ali ona ne radi na taj način.
And he's with you.	I on sa tobom.
Maybe completely.	Možda potpuno.
She will do both.	Ona će uraditi oboje.
I can't say which ones.	Ne mogu reći koje.
But not so often.	Ali ne tako često.
They are good.	Dobro su.
If anyone can do it, we can do it.	Ako neko to može, mi to možemo.
As always.	Kao i uvek.
You can leave now.	Sada možete otići.
It should never have been done.	To nikada nije trebalo uraditi.
Or so he said.	Ili je to tako rekao.
Maybe they don't know anything better.	Možda ne znaju ništa bolje.
But he couldn't help it.	Ali nije mogao pomoći.
Right now, you can see that.	Upravo sada, to možete vidjeti.
They don't know what's wrong with that.	Oni ne znaju šta nije u redu s tim.
Maybe it was simple enough.	Možda je bilo dovoljno jednostavno.
He always worked exactly as he said.	Uvek je radio tačno kako je rekao.
Or, perhaps, just a little right.	Ili, možda, samo malo u pravu.
Today has not been a bad day.	Danas nije bio loš dan.
We knew right away.	Odmah smo znali.
Maybe he's right, and maybe he's not.	Možda je u pravu, a možda i nije.
This is not hard to see.	Ovo nije teško vidjeti.
It was never there.	Nikada ga nije bilo.
She's throwing a party.	Ona pravi zabavu.
He didn't come to me.	Nije došao kod mene.
But we didn't.	Ali nismo.
We could go further than that.	Mogli bismo i dalje od toga.
If this is done, the better.	Ako se to uradi, tim bolje.
I'm glad to have you.	Drago mi je da te imam.
There goes your money.	Ode tvoj novac.
It works for us.	Radi za nas.
People aren't even there yet.	Ljudi još nisu ni tamo.
There's more.	Ima još toga.
You're all he has now.	Ti si sve što sada ima.
Something will happen.	Nešto će se dogoditi.
I want this.	Želim ovo.
And he is right about that.	I u tome je u pravu.
Yes, sure .	Da sigurno .
It would never be again.	Nikada više ne bi bilo.
To no one.	Nikome.
No, no, she says.	Ne, ne, kaže ona.
You know you want to.	Znaš da želiš.
Maybe she was, a little.	Možda je bila, malo.
That's all that's happening right now.	To je sve što se trenutno dešava.
But they are more than that.	Ali oni su više od toga.
You didn't have to be there to know.	Nisi morao biti tamo da znaš.
This was not small.	Ovo nije bilo malo.
I love you too!.	Volim i ja tebe!.
Who will believe this.	Ko će ovo vjerovati.
It's quite difficult.	Prilično je teško.
And it's yours.	A tvoj je.
I'm sure you're right.	Siguran sam da si u pravu.
He knows what you look like.	On zna kako izgledaš.
Once upon a time, it wouldn't have been difficult.	Nekada to ne bi bilo teško.
Which they were.	Što su i bili.
I know it is.	Znam da jeste.
And good.	I dobro.
That can be said for it.	To se može reći za to.
That would not be a good thing.	To ne bi bila dobra stvar.
Say something.	Reci nešto.
All she says is no.	Sve što ona kaže je ne.
This will happen.	Ovo će se dogoditi.
You don't have to do anything.	Ne morate ništa da radite.
This works.	Ovo radi.
He had no money.	Nije imao novca.
You should do this now.	Ovo treba da uradite odmah.
This team worked.	Ovaj tim je radio.
That's what he thinks.	To je ono što on misli.
She hasn't been with me in a long time.	Dugo me nije bila kod mene.
He probably knew why he was here.	Vjerovatno je znao zašto je ovdje.
It just doesn’t have to be that way.	To jednostavno ne mora biti tako.
I'm good.	Ja sam dobro.
He really loves her, you know.	On je stvarno voli, znaš.
We're all fine here at home.	Svima nam je dobro ovde kod kuće.
But so real.	Ali tako stvarno.
It could have been almost anything.	Moglo je biti skoro sve.
It's real.	To je stvarno.
Nobody told him to do that.	Niko mu nije rekao da to uradi.
Or maybe, that wasn’t it.	Ili možda, to nije bilo to.
We just ever had each other.	Samo smo se ikada imali.
That was the story.	To je bila priča.
And he knows it.	I zna to.
Good and good.	Dobro i dobro.
But we can't do that.	Ali mi to ne možemo.
Surely you could have said something about it by now.	Sigurno ste mogli nešto reći o tome do sada.
No, it's much more than that.	Ne, to je mnogo više od toga.
He just thinks.	On samo misli.
I don't know from whom.	Ne znam od koga.
I shouldn't be here, it's not safe.	Ne bih trebao biti ovdje, nije sigurno.
And you told me that.	I to si mi rekao.
He is still here with us.	Još uvijek je ovdje sa nama.
No, it can't be.	Ne, ne može biti.
That's fine with me.	To je u redu sa mnom.
I tried.	Pokušao sam.
This is all we need.	Ovo je sve što nam treba.
I could.	Mogao bih.
I had no problem with that.	Nisam imao problema sa tim.
And so it should.	I tako bi trebalo.
There is something to be said for that.	Ima nešto da se kaže za to.
Even more than a few.	Čak i više od nekoliko.
He has something to tell you.	Ima nešto da ti kaže.
You both want something from me.	Oboje želite nešto od mene.
It will all happen.	Sve će se to dogoditi.
I hope this helps !.	Nadam se da će ovo pomoći!.
But when it works, it works.	Ali kada radi, radi.
And they did nothing.	I ništa nisu uradili.
I couldn't either.	Ni ja nisam mogao.
Only three more weeks.	Još samo tri sedmice.
You didn't need me at all, as you said yourself.	Uopšte ti nisam trebao, kao što si sam rekao.
I know them, almost all of them.	Znam ih, skoro sve.
They did it.	Oni su to uradili.
You can just be.	Možeš samo biti.
Or not immediately.	Ili ne odmah.
She probably knows that herself.	Vjerovatno to i sama zna.
He had to do something.	Morao je nešto da uradi.
To be seen.	Da se vidi.
I'm so happy to be here.	Tako sam sretan što sam ovdje.
Now he knows what to do.	Sada zna šta da radi.
The more the better.	Što više to bolje.
I like.	Sviđa mi se.
Nothing will ever be right again.	Ništa više nikada neće biti u redu.
Just like life.	Baš kao život.
They are just.	Oni su samo .
Just do it your way.	Samo uradi na svoj način.
The one with you, I'm sure.	Ona sa tobom, siguran sam.
That was three years ago and now.	To je bilo prije tri godine i sada.
This is hardly a new problem.	Teško da je to novi problem.
There must be a lot of them.	Mora da ih ima mnogo.
We will get them now.	Sada ćemo ih dobiti.
You don't want to know.	Ne želiš da znaš.
As he knows.	Kako on zna.
Nothing was wrong.	Ništa nije bilo u redu.
That didn't happen either.	Ni to se nije dogodilo.
But what is good.	Ali šta je dobro.
She'll know you're there.	Ona će znati da si tamo.
You were busy at the time.	Bio si zauzet u to vrijeme.
But this was not all.	Ali ni ovo nije bilo sve.
I guess this might help you.	Pretpostavljam da bi ti ovo moglo pomoći.
But here's the thing.	Ali ovo je stvar.
And he was very tired.	I on je bio veoma umoran.
No it's not.	Ne, nije.
I loved this car.	Volio sam ovaj auto.
I should say.	Trebalo bi da kažem.
We'll get to that.	Doći ćemo do toga.
I have to help.	Moram pomoći.
The question is how.	Pitanje je kako.
And so is the door.	Kao i vrata.
This had to be him.	Ovo je morao biti on.
There was something wrong with him.	Nešto nije bilo u redu s njim.
I'm afraid for you.	Bojim se za tebe.
That will be allowed.	To će biti dozvoljeno.
Much of what he did could not be discussed.	O mnogo čemu što je uradio nije se moglo razgovarati.
Everything was simple.	Sve je bilo jednostavno.
I have enough.	Imam dosta.
I mean, not only can it be.	Mislim, ne samo da može biti.
I wonder if that's true.	Pitam se da li je to istina.
That's what you think.	To ti misliš.
There is still a problem.	Još uvijek postoji problem.
If not, you won't.	Ako ne, nećeš.
It's just you, here and now.	Samo si ti, ovde i sada.
That must be seen.	To se mora vidjeti.
No, this can't be that.	Ne, ovo ne može biti to.
She knew it was true, and it was enough.	Znala je da je to istina, i bilo je dovoljno.
But easy is not always good.	Ali lako nije uvijek dobro.
I had to get to him.	Morao sam doći do njega.
He just didn't see her that way.	On je jednostavno nije tako vidio.
Or not.	Ili ne.
That will be difficult for you.	To će vam biti teško.
he thought.	mislio je.
I wanted a job.	Želeo sam posao.
This was my first.	Ovo je bio moj prvi.
Not only here.	Ne samo ovdje.
Just what we needed.	Baš ono što nam je trebalo.
Probably none of us know.	Verovatno niko od nas ne zna.
I have no problem doing that.	Nemam problema da to uradim.
He can't see anything.	Ne može ništa da vidi.
Not this morning.	Ne jutros.
We need to know what it is.	Moramo znati šta je to.
You saw it tonight.	Video si večeras.
There was always only one.	Uvek je bio samo jedan.
This is obviously not good.	Ovo očigledno nije dobro.
He said he would.	Rekao je da hoće.
I wouldn't say what it's about.	Ne bi rekao o čemu se radi.
But it couldn't go on.	Ali nije moglo dalje.
We have too many.	Imamo ih previše.
You are your own man.	Ti si svoj čovjek.
It's just me.	Ja sam samo ja.
Like, really something.	Kao, stvarno nešto.
This is happening now.	Ovo se sada dešava.
That is no longer certain either.	Ni to više nije sigurno.
You always have problems.	Uvek imaš problema.
That should have been said.	Trebalo je to reći.
He will meet me there.	Tamo će se naći sa mnom.
We are much further.	Mi smo mnogo dalje.
That, in fact, happened.	To se, u stvari, dogodilo.
She was not the only one.	Ona nije bila jedina.
That's exactly what happened.	Upravo se to dogodilo.
They and us.	Oni i mi.
We all know it and we all do it.	Svi to znamo i svi to radimo.
This almost never happens.	Ovo se skoro nikada ne dešava.
It doesn't take long to see that.	Ne treba dugo da se to vidi.
I would never do this.	Nikada ne bih ovo radio.
Not even that.	Čak ni to.
There must be something wrong with that.	Mora da nešto nije u redu s tim.
He looked like that.	On je tako izgledao.
We did it and that was it.	Uradili smo to i to je bilo to.
Do everything you can.	Uradi sve što možeš.
It’s simply what a person does.	To je jednostavno ono što osoba radi.
They are nothing to me.	Oni mi nisu ništa.
I see it's hard.	Vidim da je teško.
But, really, it looks like that.	Ali, zaista, izgleda tako.
I like to think we are more or better.	Volim da mislim da smo više ili bolji.
It was true.	Bila je istina.
But it happened so fast.	Ali to se dogodilo tako brzo.
Maybe not.	Možda i nije.
Now there were more of them.	Sada ih je bilo više.
But that's just my way.	Ali to je samo moj način.
That's okay.	To je u redu.
I can't help this time.	Ne mogu pomoći ovaj put.
Why no one knows.	Zašto niko ne zna.
It's not safe to leave yet.	Još nije sigurno otići.
He never finished the job.	Nikada nije završio posao.
In fact, one could say bad.	U stvari, moglo bi se reći loše.
Everything is just like that.	Sve je jednostavno tako.
I heard about you.	Čuo sam za tebe.
This will not happen this time.	Ovo se neće dogoditi ovaj put.
Nothing would ever be enough.	Nikada ništa ne bi bilo dovoljno.
In fact, there is no money.	Zapravo, novca nema.
You never know what you're going to get.	Nikad ne znaš šta ćeš dobiti.
And it should be.	I treba da bude.
You got it.	Shvatio si.
I've never been there before.	Nikada ranije nisam bio tamo.
He had nothing in him.	Nije imao ništa u sebi.
You have to go.	Moraš ići.
If he likes it.	Ako mu je tako.
She still has it in her.	Ona to još uvijek ima u sebi.
They were absolutely right.	Bili su potpuno u pravu.
Yes, it is very difficult.	Da, veoma je teško.
You're already me.	Ti si već ja.
This happened a few days ago.	Ovo se dogodilo prije nekoliko dana.
And he really meant it.	I stvarno je to mislio.
This is all.	To je sve.
It can go for almost anything and still work.	Može ići za skoro sve i još uvijek radi.
I have to say that.	Moram to reći.
He plays with it a lot.	Puno se igra s tim.
I'm not doing anything wrong.	Ne radim ništa loše.
He arrived first.	On je stigao prvi.
It never was.	Nikada nije bilo.
As always.	Kao i uvek.
Probably always would.	Verovatno bi uvek.
And he really wants that.	I on to jako želi.
It is now or never.	Sada je ili nikad.
All or nothing.	Sve ili ništa.
This was enough for now.	Ovo je bilo dovoljno za sada.
I wish you wouldn't do that.	Voleo bih da to ne radiš.
That it may never be.	Da možda nikada neće biti.
Bad is bad.	Loše je loše.
Not quite that.	Ne baš to.
I've known that for a long time.	Znam to dugo vremena.
You never have to be alone.	Nikad ne moraš biti sam.
You have to go now.	Moraš ići sada.
You just know what to do.	Samo znaš šta da radiš.
I can tell you please if it will help.	Mogu reći molim vas ako će pomoći.
It was no longer life at all.	To više uopšte nije bio život.
It's easy enough to do.	To je dovoljno lako učiniti.
But he can't.	Ali ne može.
When will you get it.	Kada ćeš dobiti.
But there is something else.	Ali, postoji još nešto.
You are already here.	Već ste ovdje.
Indeed they were.	Zaista su bili.
It's not that hard.	Nije tako teško.
He promised he would.	Obećao je da hoće.
Probably more than you have.	Vjerovatno više nego što imaš.
This was not the time.	Ovo nije bilo vrijeme.
It is good.	Dobro je.
He is so good.	On je tako dobar.
He seems to be fine.	Izgleda da je dobro.
It seems like there should be more.	Čini se da bi trebalo biti više.
One works, one doesn't.	Jedan radi, jedan ne.
But you often know.	Ali često znate.
There is so much to it.	Toliko toga ima u tome.
I always do that.	Uvek to radim.
They said he was a good man.	Rekli su da je bio dobar čovjek.
We can see that now.	To sada možemo vidjeti.
In fact, do it now.	U stvari, uradi to sada.
I doubt not.	Sumnjam da nije.
You told me.	Rekao si mi.
This is the way home.	Ovo je put kući.
Everyone would know.	Svi bi znali.
Yes, you know that.	Da, ti to znaš.
Nobody wants to play with us.	Niko ne želi da se igra sa nama.
I was at home.	Bio sam kod kuće.
He saw all this.	On je sve ovo video.
I never want to see you again.	Nikada te više ne želim vidjeti.
I can do my job well.	Mogu dobro da radim svoj posao.
We do it together.	Radimo to zajedno.
And not without you.	I ne bez tebe.
I am so glad.	Tako mi je drago.
I need to know the truth.	Moram da znam istinu.
I hope you're right.	Nadam se da si u pravu.
This is often a good thing.	Ovo je često dobra stvar.
I think you will, you're fine.	Mislim da hoćeš, dobro si.
No more.	Nema više.
This has to be it.	Ovo mora biti to.
And so it happened.	I tako se dogodilo.
I love him very, very much.	Volim ga veoma, mnogo.
It's just your way.	To je samo tvoj način.
But that wasn't true.	Ali to nije bila istina.
If only we were together.	Samo da smo zajedno.
A.	A .
Can't be found.	Ne može se naći.
Now he has done it.	Sada je to uradio.
It is easy to make and easy to eat.	Lako se pravi i lako se jede.
I haven't seen them.	Nisam ih vidio.
It had to work.	Trebalo je raditi.
It was much better today.	Danas je bilo mnogo bolje.
The thing is.	Stvar je u tome.
He lost.	Izgubio je.
And he was.	I on je bio.
I really would.	Zaista bih.
It was too much.	Bilo je previše.
He can go.	Može da ide.
He did everything right.	Uradio je sve kako treba.
I know you're already doing it.	Znam da to već radite.
And this was now.	A ovo je bilo sada.
He was the one who did it.	On je bio taj koji je to uradio.
That would be something.	To bi bilo nešto.
Yes, he could.	Da, mogao bi.
I didn't quite understand.	Nisam baš shvatio.
I can't do both.	Ne mogu oboje.
And bad things can happen.	A mogu i loše stvari.
But that's not the only problem.	Ali to nije jedini problem.
I would never return them.	Nikad ih ne bih vratio.
I will be with you.	Ja ću biti s tobom.
You don’t have to tell us why it happened.	Ne morate nam reći zašto se to dogodilo.
Nobody really knew what it was.	Niko zapravo nije znao šta je to.
This is your new life.	Ovo je tvoj novi život.
He said it would help.	Rekao je da će to pomoći.
And you came.	I došao si.
I had to be there.	Morao sam biti tamo.
You must have had a really good day.	Sigurno ste imali jako dobar dan.
He knew full well that she could not help.	Dobro je znao da ona ne može pomoći.
I have no idea who she is.	Nemam pojma ko je ona.
Like, really bad, so this was hard.	Kao, stvarno loše, tako da je ovo bilo teško.
That one is mine.	Taj je moj.
You can also see this.	Možete vidjeti i ovo.
We can't even talk about it.	Ne možemo ni razgovarati o tome.
We will go.	Otići ćemo.
He would want her again.	Želeo bi je ponovo.
I do not know what to say.	Ne znam šta da kažem.
I hope only one.	Nadam se i samo jedan.
Which is the real problem here.	Što je ovdje pravi problem.
While we were there, no one heard about it.	Dok smo bili tamo, niko nije čuo za to.
Indeed, he is already working on it.	Zaista, on već radi na tome.
.	.
The day started well.	Dan je dobro počeo.
We did everything we could.	Uradili smo sve što smo mogli.
But there aren't many here.	Ali nema ih mnogo ovdje.
No, she's fine.	Ne, ona je dobro.
Not that he will be able to for much longer.	Nije da će moći još dugo.
I could never do that.	Nikad to nisam mogao.
I was so surprised.	Bio sam tako iznenađen.
They won't come back.	Neće se vratiti.
And we can't stay.	I ne možemo ostati.
I do not have to.	Ne moram.
I can't do anything.	Ne mogu ništa.
I don't know why not.	Ne znam zašto ne.
Isn't that right? 	Zar nije tako?
I didn't even seem to be my own.	Činilo se da nisam ni svoj.
But what without him? 	Ali šta bez njega?
.	.
We have to do it.	Moramo to uraditi.
It was very bad.	Bilo je jako loše.
And never will.	I nikada neće.
This is unlikely.	Ovo je malo vjerovatno.
More and more, more is more.	Sve više i više, više je više.
I need to talk to you.	Moram razgovarati s tobom.
I can help more.	Mogu pomoći više.
He knew he would not be allowed to live.	Znao je da mu neće biti dozvoljeno da živi.
And now they were together.	A sada su bili zajedno.
I mean, probably.	Mislim, vjerovatno.
It's not just a good idea.	To nije samo dobra ideja.
He will always stay with me.	Uvek će ostati sa mnom.
I thought they were right.	Mislio sam da su u pravu.
There is nothing wrong with you.	Ništa nije u redu s tobom.
I think of all of you often.	Često mislim na sve vas.
I thought you were one of us.	Mislio sam da si jedan od nas.
They were fine.	Bili su u redu.
And it never will be again.	I nikad više neće biti.
It was so good.	Bilo je tako dobro.
Please.	Molim te.
That really happened.	To se, zaista, dogodilo.
I'm here for you.	Ovdje sam zbog tebe.
I'm afraid not.	Bojim se da ne.
.	.
But he wouldn't do that tonight.	Ali on to ne bi uradio večeras.
You just have to trust me.	Moraš mi samo vjerovati.
Even to this day.	Čak i do danas.
There you are.	Tu si.
I decided not to do this.	Odlučio sam da ne radim ovo.
And it seems to be.	I izgleda da jeste.
That's bad enough, and all anyone needs to know.	To je dovoljno loše, i sve što neko treba da zna.
I guess you didn't know.	Pretpostavljam da nisi znao.
That's it by the door.	To je to kod vrata.
I don't know why, everything seems fine to me.	Ne znam zašto, sve mi izgleda dobro.
She was as good as ever.	Bila je dobra kao i uvijek.
She doesn't even have to try.	Ona to ne mora ni da pokušava.
He says he knows nothing about it.	Kaže da ne zna ništa o tome.
We are hope.	Mi smo nada.
I really hope that's true.	Zaista se nadam da je to istina.
But she's right.	Ali ona je u pravu.
Here a man can do anything.	Ovdje čovjek može sve.
It wouldn't be difficult.	Ne bi bilo teško.
You can do that too.	Možete i to.
So safe at home.	Tako sigurno kod kuće.
This is the person you need.	Ovo je osoba koja vam treba.
He's never been before.	Nikad prije nije bio.
We all have.	Svi imamo .
And no one will come.	I niko neće doći.
She didn't know what to say.	Nije znala šta da kaže.
It's a new life.	To je novi život.
They just aren’t for me.	Oni jednostavno nisu za mene.
She said she didn't want to see you again tonight.	Rekla je da te ne želi više vidjeti večeras.
But she doesn't speak.	Ali ona ne govori.
And maybe it is.	A možda i jeste.
She knows that now.	Ona to sada zna.
She said she was so scared.	Rekla je da se tako boji.
But only one.	Ali samo jedan.
Usually something he didn't want to do.	Obično nešto što nije želeo da uradi.
I have no idea.	Nemam pojma.
And you know who said that.	I znate ko je to rekao.
I don't have much to tell you.	Nemam mnogo da ti kažem.
I just don't know that.	Samo to ne znam.
I would never do that now.	Nikad to sada ne bih uradio.
It seemed to me that something was wrong.	Činilo mi se da nešto nije u redu.
It's always like that.	Uvek je tako.
And this will happen.	I ovo će se dogoditi.
And everyone knows.	I svi znaju.
Could someone help me.	Neko bi mi mogao pomoći.
As they should be.	Kao što bi trebali biti.
But he didn't come to help me.	Ali nije došao da mi pomogne.
It really isn't.	Zaista nije.
I can't help it.	Ne mogu to da ne uradim.
Anyone could do that.	Bilo ko je to mogao učiniti.
I really hope they don't come back.	Zaista se nadam da se neće vratiti.
It was very very bad.	Bilo je jako jako loše.
We have a lot.	Imamo veoma.
It feels like home.	Osjeća se kao kod kuće.
He just doesn't play anything.	Jednostavno ne svira ništa.
I actually expected a little more.	Zapravo sam očekivao malo više.
I'd like to know what that is.	Voleo bih da znam šta je to.
What it actually was was this.	Ono što je zapravo bilo, bilo je ovo.
The question was not simple.	Pitanje nije bilo jednostavno.
People are here.	Ljudi su ovdje.
I wouldn't know.	Ne bih znao.
That happens really often.	To se zaista često dešava.
I should be happy.	Trebao bih biti sretan.
It's always there.	Uvijek je tu.
We know what we did.	Znamo šta smo uradili.
And that they both did.	I da su oboje uradili.
Do something for me.	Učini nešto za mene.
But something was wrong, it all happened quite quickly.	Ali nešto nije bilo u redu, sve se to dogodilo prilično brzo.
He always will be.	On će uvijek biti.
Maybe you can help us.	Možda nam možete pomoći.
This is self-evident.	Ovo je samo po sebi očigledno.
But something has to give.	Ali, nešto se mora dati.
And that is not so.	A to nije tako.
We have a lot of problems.	Imamo mnogo problema.
I can help him.	Mogu mu pomoći.
I'm just begging you.	Molim te samo.
It's hard to go back.	Teško je vratiti se.
But I don't think you will.	Ali mislim da nećeš.
But you.	Ali ti .
That's not the way to do it.	To nije način da se uradi.
I know it still exists.	Znam da i dalje postoji.
We were there.	Bili smo tamo.
He had never seen that before.	To nikada ranije nije video.
But you know something.	Ali ti znaš nešto.
If he feels good, he does it.	Ako se osjeća dobro, on to radi.
She says she won't.	Ona kaže da neće.
He knows that now.	On to sada zna.
Really very good question.	Zaista veoma dobro pitanje.
I would love you.	Voleo bi te.
I know you don't like it.	Znam da ti se ne sviđa.
I hope your things get better.	Nadam se da će ti stvari biti bolje.
We won't talk about it anymore.	Nećemo sada više o tome.
You can't win.	Ne možeš pobijediti.
Okay, I have to go.	U redu, moram ići.
Or bad weather.	Ili loše vrijeme.
Nobody knows how he does it.	Niko ne zna kako to radi.
Now it's just me.	Sada sam samo ja.
I didn't see that.	Nisam to vidio.
I've been.	Bio sam.
I told him no.	Rekao sam mu ne.
He needed that.	To mu je trebalo.
It just doesn't happen as much.	Samo se ne dešava toliko.
And not even now.	A čak ni sada nije.
He would work harder and so on.	Radio bi više i tako dalje.
She knows a lot.	Ona zna mnogo toga.
He must have known that.	On je to sigurno znao.
If not more.	Ako ne i više.
Not much is happening here.	Ne dešava se mnogo ovde.
Very few people do that.	Vrlo malo ljudi to radi.
They said that was probably not likely.	Rekli su da to vjerovatno nije vjerovatno.
You've done enough tonight.	Uradio si dovoljno večeras.
I thought you liked me being here.	Mislio sam da ti se sviđa što sam ovdje.
They know what's next.	Oni znaju šta dalje.
I haven't heard that yet.	Nisam to još čuo.
But that's what they did.	Ali to je ono što su oni uradili.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
In fact, he did nothing.	U stvari, nije ništa uradio.
Just like the first time.	Kao i prvi put.
They weren't before.	Prije nisu bili.
I'm almost done.	Skoro sam završio.
And bring you back to him.	I vratiti mu te.
The real problem.	Pravi problem.
I would tell him that right away.	To bih mu odmah rekao.
But he knows, really.	Ali on zna, zaista.
I'd say it's pretty tough.	Rekao bih da je prilično teško.
I'm not begging for your life.	Ne molim te život.
And I didn't mean that.	I nisam mislio na to.
I don't know why they would do that.	Ne znam zašto bi to uradili.
Maybe even if it is.	Možda čak i ako jeste.
It’s nothing, but it’s everything.	To nije ništa, ali je sve.
You just have to believe.	Samo treba vjerovati.
It's hard to say how old.	Teško je reći koliko godina.
He simply.	On jednostavno.
Everything can be bought.	Sve se može kupiti.
I should never.	Nikada ne bih trebao.
He would go.	On bi otišao.
These were .	Ovo su bili .
I just heard.	Upravo sam čuo.
More time could help.	Više vremena bi moglo pomoći.
Besides, you can't.	Osim toga, ne možeš.
That would not be right.	To ne bi bilo u redu.
And we can do anything.	I možemo sve.
It’s just something that’s there when you want it.	To je samo nešto što je tu kada to želiš.
This is all.	To je sve.
But he is right.	Ali, on je u pravu.
She's still talking.	Ona još priča.
I think.	ja mislim.
I hope we can do that.	Nadam se da ćemo to moći.
People are the reason everything exists.	Ljudi su razlog zašto sve postoji.
I have something to ask.	Imam nešto da pitam.
But not for myself.	Ali ne zbog sebe.
If only it were true.	Samo da je istina.
I want to do this properly.	Želim ovo da uradim kako treba.
You need to know about these things.	Morate znati za ove stvari.
I know it was.	Znam da je bilo.
Please tell me more.	Molim te reci mi više.
It could work better.	Moglo bi bolje raditi.
And it is.	I jeste.
I just, you know.	Ja samo, znaš.
You can't come to us yet.	Ne možete još doći kod nas.
You know that.	Ti znaš to.
It works better than before.	Radi bolje nego prije.
I mean, you look like her.	Mislim, izgledaš kao ona.
You are home.	Kući ste.
About what to do next.	O tome šta dalje.
Yes, that's the one.	Da, to je taj.
But it still doesn't work.	Ali još uvijek ne radi.
Money is good.	Novac je dobar.
You know what you're doing well.	Znaš šta dobro radiš.
True, he didn't need it.	Istina, nije mu trebalo.
He had never seen so many of them.	Nikada ih nije vidio toliko.
How much to give.	Koliko dati.
We should go back.	Trebali bismo se vratiti.
That's what a father can do.	To je ono što otac može.
It could have been more than that.	Moglo je biti i više od toga.
But we had a meeting.	Ali imali smo sastanak.
But he would never hear of it.	Ali on nikada ne bi čuo za to.
I never wanted anything.	Nikad ništa nisam želeo.
It will be a day and it will be a day.	To će biti dan i to će biti jedan dan.
But that life is not me.	Ali taj život nisam ja.
I want to be so good.	Želim da budem tako dobar.
I really have to go home.	Stvarno moram ići kući.
You shouldn't allow that.	Ne bi trebao to dozvoliti.
I needed people.	Trebali su mi ljudi.
But that's just the way it is.	Ali to je samo put.
He heard enough.	Čuo je dovoljno.
But there was no more time.	Ali nije bilo više vremena.
Maybe it already is.	Možda već jeste.
What you don't know.	Ono što ne znate.
But now he can't go back.	Ali sada se ne može vratiti.
They were probably safe for tonight.	Za večeras su vjerovatno bili sigurni.
I say you wouldn't.	Ja kažem da ne bi.
That was not a good idea.	To nije bila dobra ideja.
Actually, no, that's not true.	Zapravo, ne, to nije tačno.
I don’t know why more people don’t see it.	Ne znam zašto više ljudi to ne vidi.
And as always.	I kao i uvek.
I have never had this problem before.	Nikada ranije nisam imao taj problem.
There is someone else.	Postoji još neko.
Not just as a friend.	Ne samo kao prijatelj.
Those thoughts will surely come.	Te misli će sigurno doći.
We really did it.	Zaista smo to uradili.
He was safe enough there.	Tamo je bio dovoljno siguran.
I thought it would happen before today.	Mislio sam da će se to dogoditi prije danas.
He was never heard from again.	Nikad se više nije čuo za njega.
And it's not even true, if it comes to that.	A nije ni tačno, ako do toga dođe.
Mine didn't.	Moj nije.
But it's more than looks.	Ali to je više od izgleda.
He is the only one with us.	On je jedini kod nas.
There was nothing.	Nije bilo ništa.
We know it's there.	Znamo da je tamo.
But that's not why they're there.	Ali nisu zbog toga tamo.
And that was a good thing.	I to je bila dobra stvar.
But now you're here.	Ali sada si tu.
Or maybe they will come to us first.	Ili će možda oni prvi doći kod nas.
We need to talk to him.	Moramo razgovarati s njim.
He went back further.	Vratio se dalje.
And it almost works as it should.	I skoro da radi kako treba.
I just saw him.	Upravo sam ga vidio.
I know who these people are.	Znam ko su ti ljudi.
They don't.	Oni ne .
I said right.	Rekao sam tačno.
You know.	Znaš sa.
That was really hard.	To je bilo zaista teško.
You were someone.	Bio si neko.
Can you tell.	Možeš li reći .
Sam was with us.	Sam je bio sa nama.
He might never see her again.	Možda je više nikada neće vidjeti.
I started to get good at it.	Počeo sam da budem dobar u tome.
He will find his way home.	Naći će put kući.
And that was true.	I to je bila istina.
Not a problem for us.	Nije problem za nas.
It's just.	To je samo.
You can go further if you want.	Možete ići dalje ako želite.
It's really simple.	Zaista je jednostavno.
But he really didn't want to.	Ali on to zaista nije želio.
They were not helpful.	Nisu bili od pomoći.
Or maybe she was.	Ili je možda bila.
I wasn't sure what to do.	Nisam bio siguran šta da radim.
In time to see them.	Na vrijeme da ih vidim.
It's easy when you know how.	Lako je kad znaš kako.
But a lot of people.	Ali puno ljudi.
No one speaks, they shouldn't.	Ni jedan ne govori, ne treba.
And probably never will.	I vjerovatno nikada neće.
But it's not about sorry or not sorry.	Ali ne radi se o žao ili ne žao.
She doesn't look real to me.	Ona mi ne izgleda stvarno.
Which he loved.	Koje je voleo.
He could go to school.	Mogao bi da ide u školu.
Something else .	Još nešto .
Nothing more can be done.	Ništa se više ne može učiniti.
Or maybe it's just me.	Ili sam možda samo ja.
But that was too easy.	Ali to je bilo previše lako.
The first is usually not.	Prvi obično nije.
Yes, actually.	Da, zapravo.
He will never tell us who.	Nikada nam neće reći ko.
Maybe it is.	Možda i jeste.
That just wasn't good.	To jednostavno nije bilo dobro.
I never want to go back.	Ne želim se nikada vratiti.
It won't be bad.	Neće biti loše.
She was there herself.	Tu je bila i ona sama.
I didn't come back.	Nisam se vratio.
And he was tired of it.	I on je bio umoran od toga.
Where is my father.	Gdje je moj otac.
But now he had to leave.	Ali sada je morao da ode.
For all the good he does.	Za sve dobro što čini.
I do not know.	Ne znam.
I didn't start working with you for the money.	Nisam počeo da radim sa tobom zbog novca.
I guess she is someone.	Pretpostavljam da je ona neko.
I still know how.	I dalje znam kako.
It's more than home.	To je više od kuće.
But that didn't seem right.	Ali to se nije činilo u redu.
It was hard to come back.	Bilo je teško vratiti se.
Last month he promised again.	Prošlog mjeseca je ponovo obećao.
Your father told me so.	Tvoj otac mi je tako rekao.
Or maybe just me.	Ili možda samo ja.
If he could give it back, he certainly would.	Da je mogao vratiti, sigurno bi.
There is nothing to be desired here.	Ovde nema šta da se želi.
No, you have to go.	Ne, moraš ići.
It never happened that way.	To se nikada nije dogodilo na taj način.
Not so at home.	Ne tako kod kuće.
But here, you can.	Ali ovde, možeš.
He was not well at home.	Nije mu bilo dobro kod kuće.
If you didn't want it, you wouldn't buy it.	Da ga ne želiš, ne bi ga kupio.
This is the first time.	Ovo je prvi put.
he wondered.	pitao se on.
Now you will be able to.	Sada ćete to moći.
And it happens.	I to se dešava.
I could today.	Mogao bih danas.
No one can say yes or no for sure.	Niko ne može tako sigurno da ili ne.
Not until next year.	Ne do sljedeće godine.
You want to .	Želite .
Not only that.	Ne samo to.
Maybe we can help.	Možda možemo pomoći.
I wish we could talk.	Voleo bih da možemo razgovarati.
She said, he said.	Rekla je, rekao je.
That would be too much.	To bi bilo previše.
But she said no.	Ali ona je rekla ne.
Or almost everything.	Ili skoro sve.
More like her.	Više kao ona.
I just don't know when.	Samo ne znam kada.
And we are still working.	I još uvijek radimo.
He did things.	On je napravio stvari.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
That's how it should be.	Tako bi trebalo da bude.
But we both know it was him.	Ali oboje znamo da je to bio on.
And he never loved him.	I nikada ga nije volio.
But please.	Ali molim te.
I hope you will.	Nadam se da hoćeš.
I'm not even sure.	Nisam ni siguran.
And that is what we do.	I to je ono što radimo.
It was hard.	Bilo je teško.
He had a problem.	Imao je problem.
Now he has done it.	Sada je to uradio.
That simply cannot be true.	To jednostavno ne može biti istina.
It was never meant to be.	To nikada nije trebalo biti.
My father did.	Moj otac jeste.
I really wish it wasn't.	Zaista bih volio da nije.
That he was here.	Da je ovde.
She won't do it.	Ona to neće uraditi.
They weren't sure he would come.	Nisu bili sigurni da će doći.
You're absolutely right, but.	Potpuno si u pravu, ali.
That was enough.	To je bilo dovoljno.
Why is it like that.	Zašto je to tako.
Don't talk to me like that.	Ne govori mi tako.
It was very difficult for me to say much about anything.	Bilo mi je jako teško reći mnogo o bilo čemu.
It could be good.	Moglo bi biti dobro.
I would be happy to be there.	Bio bih sretan da budem tamo.
There is no one to talk to.	Nema s kim razgovarati.
It was just something he said.	To je bilo samo nešto što je rekao.
As it should be.	Kako je trebalo.
That doesn't seem right anymore.	To više ne izgleda tačno.
But if she did, she didn't say it.	Ali ako jeste, nije to rekla.
It doesn't happen in a day.	To se ne dešava za jedan dan.
They won't come back.	Neće se vratiti.
But he's going to do what he's going to do.	Ali on će uraditi ono što će uraditi.
It's better than just good.	To je bolje nego samo dobro.
Just like it always does.	Baš kao što se to uvijek dešava.
That one was for me.	Taj je bio za mene.
He works for no one but himself.	On ne radi ni za koga osim za sebe.
It must be from someone.	Mora da je od nekoga.
Can someone help please.	Može li neko pomoći molim vas.
There are no buts, no ifs.	Nema ali, nema ako.
This time she was not alone.	Ovaj put nije bila sama.
You can do a lot.	Možeš mnogo toga.
And so yes.	I tako da.
And no one could know about it.	I niko nije mogao znati za to.
I think so.	Mislim da je tako.
We don't have to do more.	Ne moramo da radimo više.
There were a lot of people.	Bilo je puno ljudi.
You've seen enough.	Video si dovoljno.
That and more.	To i više.
It wouldn't be good if I had one.	Ne bi bilo dobro da ga imam.
Out of the way.	S puta.
Or maybe both.	Ili možda oboje.
And he certainly doesn't know what to do with me.	I sigurno ne zna šta bi sa mnom.
Who's who.	Ko je ko.
Something he said.	Nešto što je rekao.
There probably are.	Vjerovatno ih ima.
With and.	Sa i .
I know this life.	Znam ovaj život.
I never liked the way you think.	Nikada nisam voleo na način na koji misliš.
You shouldn't.	Ne bi trebalo.
That way you'll know everything is working.	Tako ćete znati da sve radi.
But she can't stay.	Ali ona ne može ostati.
You just don't need it.	Jednostavno ti ne treba.
He was looking for you.	On je tražio tebe.
We have three of them.	Imamo ih tri.
Someone had to say that.	Neko je to morao reći.
At the moment, everything is going well for me.	Trenutno mi sve ide dobro.
This will not be easy.	Ovo neće biti lako.
She knows that now.	Ona to sada zna.
He won't stay long.	Neće dugo ostati.
I can only wonder.	Mogu samo da se pitam.
It's just a story.	To je samo priča.
And that's all for now.	I to je sve za sada.
This was my job.	Ovo je bio moj posao.
We have plenty.	Imamo dosta.
You have everything.	Imaš sve.
You know, it was very difficult.	Znate, bilo je veoma teško.
Together, we can do it!.	Zajedno, možemo to učiniti!.
You had it ready.	Imao si je spreman.
He may never see them again.	Možda ih više nikada neće vidjeti.
Too much to say.	Previše da se kaže.
That will be enough.	To će biti dovoljno.
And it really wasn't that bad.	I zaista nije bilo tako loše.
I could have been there.	Mogao sam biti tamo.
Not good, really.	Nije dobro, zaista.
I'll take some.	Ja ću malo.
And we are all there.	I svi smo tamo.
You still don't really know who you are.	Još uvek zaista ne znaš ni ko si.
In fact, that would be a good thing.	U stvari, to bi bila dobra stvar.
Which you obviously are.	Što očigledno i jesi.
Maybe it always will be.	Možda će uvek biti.
You can't know what happened.	Ne možeš znati šta se dogodilo.
She didn't tell him.	Nije mu rekla.
We did what was right.	Uradili smo ono što je bilo dobro.
I never thought this would happen.	Nikada nisam mislio da će se ovo dogoditi.
There seems to be no problem.	Izgleda da nema problema.
He was alone, as always.	Bio je sam, kao i uvijek.
He was alone at the time.	Bio je sam u to vrijeme.
I say you have to be the real me.	Kažem da moraš biti pravi ja.
Why, she didn't know.	Zašto, nije znala.
I had so much help.	Imao sam toliko pomoći.
And we have it.	I imamo ga.
You have to do better than that.	Moraš bolje od toga.
He couldn't believe himself.	Nije mogao vjerovati sebi.
Not only him, but almost everyone.	Ne samo on, nego skoro svi.
Yeah, nothing to see here.	Da, nema šta da se vidi ovde.
I can't help myself.	Ne mogu si pomoći.
He had to know what he needed to know.	Morao je da zna ono što je trebalo da zna.
But it will.	Ali hoće.
Maybe no one knew who he was.	Možda niko nije znao ko je on.
You have to do this for me.	Moraš ovo uraditi za mene.
You have to see it this way.	Morate to vidjeti na ovaj način.
Where it could be, it was.	Gdje bi moglo biti bilo je.
But it won't be.	Ali to neće biti.
I really, really want that.	Zaista, stvarno to želim.
No one could help.	Niko nije mogao pomoći.
He seemed to be waiting for someone.	Činilo se da čeka nekoga.
It still can be.	Još uvijek može biti.
Very good times.	Veoma dobra vremena.
There's just something wrong.	Samo nešto nije u redu.
This is usually not true.	Obično to nije tačno.
It just happens.	To se jednostavno dešava.
This would be it.	Ovo bi bilo to.
I need to talk to you.	Moram razgovarati s tobom.
I won't tell you.	Neću vam reći.
The problem is it doesn't work.	Problem je što ne radi.
And it probably is.	I vjerovatno jeste.
They are never sure.	Nikad nisu sigurni.
He had no idea what to do.	Nije imao pojma šta da radi.
I want a little about that.	Želim malo o tome.
It was either him or that man.	Bio je to ili on ili taj čovjek.
But that's enough.	Ali dosta je bilo.
Not for long.	Neće još dugo.
Indeed.	Zaista.
He has been around for a long time.	On postoji dugo vremena.
I don't even know what to think.	Ne znam ni šta da mislim.
It's hard to come up with ideas.	Teško je doći do ideja.
But he expected too much.	Ali očekivao je previše.
No more time here.	Nema više vremena ovde.
It shouldn't be.	Ne bi trebalo da bude.
I had to do it now.	Morao sam to sada da uradim.
What else do you have?	Šta još imaš?
You could say.	Mogli biste reći.
She was never without it.	Nikada nije bila bez toga.
Something he had to do.	Nešto što je morao da uradi.
I would love to be there.	Voleo bih da budem tamo.
You told me everything.	Sve si mi rekao.
That's the thing.	To je stvar.
You do that too.	I ti to radiš.
It wasn't long enough.	Nije bilo dovoljno dugo.
It's very simple, really.	Vrlo je jednostavno, zaista.
But this is enough.	Ali ovo je dovoljno.
And that is exactly what this is.	A to je upravo ono što je ovo.
They are not a thing.	Oni nisu stvar.
She didn't say much.	Nije mnogo rekla.
Maybe what happened is a good thing.	Možda je to što se dogodilo dobra stvar.
It would be really welcome.	Zaista bi dobro došao.
So she didn't tell anyone.	Tako da nikome nije rekla.
I always say that.	Ja to uvek kažem.
Neither can they.	Ne mogu ni oni.
So, so, so.	Tako, tako, tako.
You're welcome.	Nema na čemu.
And, you know, that would be good.	I, znate, to bi bilo dobro.
He told me to tell the truth.	Rekao mi je da kažem istinu.
I could find him again.	Mogao bih ga ponovo naći.
And he had never worked that way before.	I nikada ranije nije radio na taj način.
All these things.	Sve ove stvari.
This wasn't too difficult.	Ovo nije bilo previše teško.
Now they could talk about it.	Sada bi mogli razgovarati o tome.
It's too much for us.	To je previše za nas.
I wonder if there will be anything else.	Pitam se hoće li biti još nešto.
We did it for you.	Uradili smo to za vas.
I'm really sorry.	Zaista mi je žao.
For a long time no one saw anything here.	Dugo niko ovde nije ništa video.
It was good, that's all.	Bilo je dobro, to je sve.
I'm always glad to see her.	Uvijek mi je drago vidjeti je.
But it still doesn't work.	Ali i dalje ne radi.
It's nothing more than that.	Nije ništa više od toga.
Now I know why you said that.	Sada znam zašto si to rekao.
Maybe he lost someone.	Možda je izgubio nekoga.
He would think so too.	I on bi to mislio.
I heard everything.	Čuo sam sve.
And yes, they are both right.	I da, oboje su u pravu.
And it was all here.	I sve je bilo ovdje.
But he also said no.	Ali i on je rekao ne.
I didn't mean that.	Nisam to mislio.
I'm here, she's there.	Ja sam ovde, ona je tamo.
Everyone knows that.	Svi to znaju.
He had no idea how he got home.	Nije imao pojma kako se vratio kući.
Please can you help me.	Molim vas, možete li mi pomoći.
But this takes time.	Ali za ovo treba vremena.
But that's your team, not mine.	Ali to je tvoj tim, ne moj.
And what if what if.	I šta ako šta ako.
I think everyone should.	Mislim da bi svi trebali.
He does a good job.	On radi dobar posao.
There is a problem.	Postoji problem.
He has to stay.	Mora ostati.
It's not what you think at all.	Uopšte nije ono što mislite.
It still works today.	I danas radi.
It had already begun, even before the trip.	Već je počeo, čak i prije puta.
You've said enough.	Rekao si dovoljno.
Look, you'll just know.	Vidi, samo ćeš znati.
This did not happen.	Ovo se nije dogodilo.
But how to do it.	Ali kako to učiniti.
We never had one.	Nikad ga nismo imali.
The money is here.	Novac je ovde.
I wasn't sure what to do.	Nisam bio siguran šta da radimo.
But it can't.	Ali to ne može.
I think there is something there.	Mislim da tu nešto ima.
I will never do that again.	Nikad to više neću raditi.
I wasn't happy about that.	Nisam bio sretan zbog toga.
We did it the right way.	Uradili smo to na pravi način.
You probably know what that is too.	Verovatno i ti znaš šta je to.
But we don't have to know more.	Ali ne moramo da znamo više.
I never got it.	Nikad ga nisam dobio.
Now that was work.	Sada je to bio posao.
But she doesn't have to be.	Ali ona ne mora biti.
There is me and .	Tu sam ja i .
I knew all that.	Sve sam to znao.
This is not good for us.	Ovo nije dobro za nas.
We didn't have enough time or people.	Nismo imali dovoljno vremena ni ljudi.
Tell him you're here.	Reci mu da si ovde.
It's really that fast.	Zaista je tako brzo.
In fact, that's all we've ever been.	Zapravo, to je sve što smo ikada bili.
One for the road.	Jedan za put.
Or it was.	Ili je bilo.
But he never made it home.	Ali nikad nije stigao kući.
That didn't seem right.	To se nije činilo u redu.
It drives me.	To me vozi.
Don't tell him, please.	Nemoj mu reći, molim te.
Everything they said.	Sve što su rekli.
There's always a reason.	Uvek je razlog.
I like to be busy.	Volim biti zauzet.
I'm pretty easy to work with.	Sa mnom je prilično lako raditi.
What should he do? 	Šta treba da uradi?
They will know you are here.	Oni će znati da ste ovdje.
That was fast.	To je bilo brzo.
I think we can say so, he said.	Mislim da možemo tako reći, rekao je.
I did both.	Uradio sam oboje.
And not in a bad way.	I to ne na loš način.
There must have been a lot of them.	Sigurno ih je bilo puno.
Can you help me.	Možete li mi pomoći.
It was just something.	To je bilo samo nešto.
My friend made one and it was easy.	Moj prijatelj je napravio jedan i bilo je lako.
Besides, you know the job.	Osim toga, znate posao.
You are already there.	Već ste tamo.
I left immediately.	Odmah sam otišao.
So much for that.	Toliko o tome.
It was actually pretty.	Zapravo je bilo prilično.
He was obviously surprised.	Očigledno je bio iznenađen.
I will never do that.	Nikada to neću uraditi.
They are like .	Oni su kao .
None of that can really happen.	Ništa od toga se zaista ne može dogoditi.
I would be of help to him.	Ja bih mu bila od pomoći.
Maybe I have a problem.	Možda imam problem.
There were enough of them.	Dosta ih je bilo.
But you have to know what you're doing.	Ali morate znati šta radite.
Maybe not tonight.	Možda ne večeras.
I knew you would find me.	Znao sam da ćeš me naći.
That won't be a problem.	To neće biti problem.
You could see that.	Mogli ste to vidjeti.
Now you know.	Sada znaš.
And it does much more than that.	I čini mnogo više od toga.
I have never had this problem before.	Nikada ranije nisam imao taj problem.
One has to do it.	Čovjek to mora učiniti.
Thinking of you.	Mislim na tebe.
I asked them a little about it.	Pitao sam ih malo o tome.
What they knew could not help him.	Ono što su znali nije mu moglo pomoći.
He was almost like a man.	Bio je skoro kao čovjek.
He was supposed to help me.	Trebao je da mi pomogne.
He's not good.	On nije dobar.
There is a very good reason for this.	Postoji veoma dobar razlog za to.
Just three months ago.	Prije samo tri mjeseca.
He was there.	Bio je tamo.
It would be enough for now.	Za sada bi bilo dovoljno.
But not like us, really.	Ali ne kao mi, zaista.
She thinks he's more than that.	Ona misli da je on više od toga.
He just doesn't play.	Jednostavno ne igra.
I should help him.	Trebao bih mu pomoći.
It certainly couldn't be.	To sigurno nije moglo biti.
I think she would say that.	Mislim da bi ona to rekla.
There is something else.	Postoji još nešto.
Maybe they're right.	Možda su u pravu.
We all know what needs to be done.	Svi znamo šta treba da se uradi.
It looks difficult.	Izgleda teško.
This one is the first.	Ovaj je prvi.
The truth will always win.	Istina će uvijek pobijediti.
Now I really have to go.	Sada stvarno moram da idem.
We can help.	Možemo pomoći.
He really wants to do things the right way.	On zaista želi da uradi stvari na pravi način.
Maybe he'll see them soon.	Možda će ih uskoro vidjeti.
So it can be done properly.	Tako da se to može uraditi kako treba.
But maybe they aren't.	Ali možda i nisu.
He won't even see.	Neće ni vidjeti.
And they did it.	I oni su to uradili.
We did what we had to do.	Uradili smo ono što smo trebali.
Nothing should be done.	Ne bi trebalo ništa učiniti.
Not yet .	Ne još .
Better than anyone.	Bolje od bilo koga.
As it was, no.	Kako je bilo, ne.
I am very tired.	Veoma sam umoran.
We were here.	Bili smo ovde.
Don't talk much about yourself.	Ne govori mnogo o sebi.
Money is no longer an issue.	Novac više nije problem.
She didn't want to be alone again.	Nije htela ponovo da bude sama.
But we have what we have.	Ali imamo ono što imamo.
It would be better now.	Sada bi bilo bolje.
We have to be a team.	Moramo biti tim.
You want to say yes.	Želiš da kažeš da.
No one was home at the time.	U to vrijeme niko nije bio kod kuće.
Not good, not bad.	Nije dobro, nije loše.
You could do well.	Mogao bi učiniti dobro.
But, apparently, all was not well.	Ali, očigledno, nije sve bilo dobro.
There was something more.	Bilo je nešto više.
He's not here this afternoon.	On nije ovdje popodne.
Until this year.	Do ove godine.
I was there first.	Bio sam tamo prvi.
.	.
In fact, you don’t need it.	U stvari, ne treba vam.
You can't do that.	Ne možeš to uraditi.
They are gone now.	Sada ih nema.
I've seen enough.	Video sam dovoljno.
I was really happy.	Bio sam zaista sretan.
Look, she said.	Vidi, rekla je.
They knew too much.	Znali su previše.
There he was, as always.	Tu je bio, kao i uvijek.
This was so.	Ovo je bilo tako.
Do what you have to do.	Uradi ono što moraš.
I will soon.	Ja ću uskoro.
Yes, indeed.	Da, zaista.
This is not enough.	Ovo nije dovoljno.
Not my problem.	Ne moj problem.
The story is going well.	Priča ide dobro.
Maybe it never was.	Možda nikad nije bilo.
That's okay with me.	To je u redu sa mnom.
We probably should have seen it coming.	Vjerovatno smo trebali to vidjeti.
She said she didn't know.	Rekla je da ne zna.
Everything would be fine.	Sve bi bilo u redu.
Difficult question.	Teško pitanje.
He didn't want to say that.	Nije to htio reći.
She doesn't even want it.	Ona to ni ne želi.
I do everything.	Ja radim sve.
I wonder when that will be.	Pitam se kada će to biti.
I doubt this.	Ja sumnjam u ovo.
It's easy to say, but hard to do well.	Lako je reći, ali teško dobro uraditi.
And that’s something you have to do.	I to je nešto što morate učiniti.
But I got another one.	Ali, dobio sam još jedan.
No one will work.	Niko neće raditi.
That tells me a lot.	To mi mnogo govori.
It's really hard to say.	Zaista je teško reći.
But that was me.	Ali to sam bio ja.
It's like it never happened.	Kao da nikad nije bilo.
We always had it.	Uvek smo ga imali.
I didn't know any of that.	Nisam znao ništa od toga.
Today maybe more than ever.	Danas možda više nego ikada.
You have to move on.	Moraš dalje.
To be sure.	Da bi bili sigurni.
I'll come.	Ja ću doći.
Do as she wants you to do.	Uradi kako ona želi da radiš.
There are several.	Nekoliko je.
It could be, but not always.	Moglo bi biti, ali ne uvijek.
But that's not the problem here.	Ali to ovdje nije problem.
You're back.	Vratio si se.
It already is.	Već jeste.
Nothing now.	Ništa sada.
I can't say who.	Ne mogu reći ko.
It should help.	Trebalo bi da pomogne.
I thought she already knew.	Mislio sam da je već znala.
He expected that.	Očekivao je to.
And he could.	I on bi mogao.
We don't seem to be alone.	Čini se da nismo sami.
This is the right team.	Ovo je pravi tim.
But very good.	Ali vrlo dobro.
I wondered what year to say.	Pitao sam se koje godine da kažem.
He left.	Otišao je.
Like it never happened, or something.	Kao da se to nikada nije dogodilo, ili tako nešto.
I don't always work.	Ne radim uvek.
Both .	Oboje .
I was happy to try.	Bio sam sretan što sam pokušao.
But not fast.	Ali ne brzo.
When she wanted me to know she loved me.	Kada je htela da znam da me voli.
I know how hard it is here.	Znam koliko je teško ovde.
But it's not.	Ali nije.
How today.	Kako danas.
And now this is what he is to us.	A sada je ovo ono što je on za nas.
That's how it was.	Tako je bilo.
The thing itself.	Sama stvar.
There will be nothing.	Neće biti ništa.
No, I never did.	Ne, nikad sam.
I didn't have to be.	Nisam morao biti.
You are this.	Ti si ovo.
We did this too.	Uradili smo i ovo.
But obviously not.	Ali očigledno nije.
But it's hard to be here.	Ali teško je biti ovde.
No, not yet.	Ne, ne još.
I do not love him.	Ne volim ga.
No one would come.	Niko ne bi došao.
We already have them.	Već ih imamo.
I didn't buy it.	Nisam ga kupio.
I must be so sick.	Mora da mi je tako loše.
A lot of money.	Mnogo novca.
No one came back to life.	Niko se nije vratio u život.
There is another reason.	Postoji još jedan razlog.
We can't do it again.	Ne možemo ponovo.
He knew who we were to him.	Znao je ko smo mi za njega.
This should be easy to see.	Ovo bi trebalo biti lako vidjeti.
And my father.	I moj otac.
They both knew it.	Oboje su to znali.
There are enough things to do.	Ima dovoljno stvari za uraditi.
Maybe it could.	Možda bi moglo.
I just want to do this alone, for now.	Samo želim da uradim ovo sam, za sada.
He knew where she was.	Znao je gdje je ona.
This time I'm right for you.	Ovaj put imam pravu za tebe.
I just saw this.	Upravo sam vidio ovo.
Something is wrong here.	Ovdje nešto nije u redu.
That's fine now.	To je sada u redu.
That's what she wants me to know.	To je ono što ona želi da znam.
Obviously, that would be too easy.	Očigledno, to bi bilo previše lako.
It may not seem like a problem.	Možda ne izgleda kao problem.
That was my problem.	To je bio moj problem.
I didn't know what.	Nisam znao šta.
But that doesn't have to be done anymore.	Ali to više ne mora da se radi.
Maybe more than it should have been.	Možda i više nego što je trebalo.
You didn't.	Nisi .
Yes, you can say that.	Da, to možete reći.
You told us both.	Rekao si nam oboje.
He just does it.	On to samo uradi.
That's the real problem.	To je pravi problem.
It took him long enough.	Trebalo mu je dovoljno dugo.
I was right about that.	Bio sam u pravu u tome.
He never saw him.	Nikad ga nije vidio.
Everyone is human.	Svi su ljudi.
You're not the only one.	Nisi jedini.
We should have done it last year.	Trebali smo to uraditi prošle godine.
I'm not that.	Ja nisam to.
Today, anything can be done.	Danas se sve može uraditi.
No one came.	Niko nije došao.
I really wish it were.	Zaista bih volio da je tako.
All is not as it seems.	Samo nije sve kako izgleda.
I thought he would.	Mislio sam da hoće.
The only reason for.	Jedini razlog za .
You are better than us.	Ti si bolji od nas.
It's almost nothing.	To je skoro ništa.
Work with it.	Radite s tim.
Everything will be fine.	Sve će biti u redu.
But now maybe not.	Ali sada možda neće.
It's as if they know them themselves.	Kao da ih i sami znaju.
It won't do any good.	Neće biti dobro od toga.
He doesn't have to work anymore.	Ne mora više da radi.
There was no house and me.	Nije bilo kuće i mene.
He goes alone.	On ide sam.
And a very good thing.	I veoma dobra stvar.
In fact, it has already happened.	U stvari, to se već dogodilo.
You must be back soon.	Morate se vratiti uskoro.
So not much to say.	Tako da nema puno za reći.
I know people will.	Znam da će ljudi.
One is .	Jedan je .
He was glad.	Bilo mu je drago.
But that was a long time ago.	Ali to je bilo prije dosta vremena.
I'm sorry, she says.	Žao mi je, kaže ona.
And one for me.	I jedan za mene.
But not anymore.	Ali ne više.
It's not.	Nije .
You are more than that.	Ti si više od toga.
I always thought it would be me.	Uvek sam mislio da ću to biti ja.
I'm almost done.	Skoro sam završio.
It wasn't allowed.	Nije bilo dozvoljeno.
It works fine now.	Sada radi dobro.
You knew this.	Znao si ovo.
We are doing something right.	Radimo nešto kako treba.
I've been a lot.	Bio sam mnogo.
And you can just see it.	I možete to samo vidjeti.
Why was this there.	Zašto je ovo bilo tamo.
You said .	Ti si rekao .
But even more, we are increasingly him.	Ali još više, mi smo sve više on.
I'm still not sure why there were so many people.	Još uvijek nisam siguran zašto je bilo toliko ljudi.
I don't know for sure.	Ne znam sigurno.
I think it was pretty good.	Mislim da je bilo prilično dobro.
I have to say something.	Moram nešto reći.
Do this today.	Uradi ovo danas.
If she was alone, it would be fine.	Da je bila sama, bilo bi u redu.
We are even.	Mi smo čak i.
I wonder how that happened.	Pitam se kako se to dogodilo.
She just works.	Ona jednostavno radi.
me? 	ja?
She's not like you.	Ona nije kao ti.
I have something on me.	Imam nešto na sebi.
You probably know who does it.	Verovatno znate ko to radi.
And people know things.	I ljudi znaju stvari.
It was for me.	Za mene je bilo.
He asked for help.	Tražio je pomoć.
Can you .	Možeš li .
Maybe we'll be fine.	Možda ćemo biti dobro.
I've never done that.	Nikad to nisam radio.
You are good.	Dobro si.
Much, much more.	Mnogo, mnogo više.
I just heard.	Upravo sam čuo.
I think you should stay here.	Mislim da bi trebao ostati ovdje.
This is clearly not the case here.	Ovdje očigledno nije tako.
I need something.	Treba mi nešto.
No one had much to say.	Niko nije imao mnogo toga da kaže.
I wouldn't want to do that.	Ne bi htela da to uradim.
That's not a question.	To nije pitanje.
Can someone help me.	Može li mi neko pomoći.
It's not about that.	Ne radi se o tome.
Things may never be right.	Stvari možda nikada neće biti u redu.
This was simply not true.	Ovo jednostavno nije bila istina.
I'm sorry it took so long.	Žao mi je što je tako dugo trebalo.
You just have to go with it.	Morate samo ići s tim.
I'll go home too.	I ja ću ići kući.
.	.
It's business as usual here.	Ovde su stvari kao i obično.
What are you doing.	Što ti radiš.
But for now that's all they know.	Ali za sada to je sve što znaju.
But she didn't say no either.	Ali ni ona nije rekla ne.
It's a real day.	To je pravi dan.
You don't want it to be either.	Ni ti ne želiš da bude.
And that's why we can't be sure.	I zbog toga ne možemo biti sigurni.
But only you know that.	Ali samo ti to znaš.
We did everything we needed to do.	Uradili smo sve što smo trebali.
You can help me here.	Možete mi pomoći ovdje.
He saw what he saw.	Video je ono što je video.
I will tell you.	Ja ću vam reći.
I am not your father.	Ja nisam tvoj otac.
To never see her again.	Da je više ne vidim.
It just doesn't work that fast.	Jednostavno ne radi tako brzo.
But it was difficult.	Ali bilo je teško.
And it's still not enough.	I još uvek nije dovoljno.
I'm there.	Ja sam tamo.
That's exactly what we're going to do.	To je upravo ono što ćemo učiniti.
Or they could.	Ili bi to mogli.
It always seemed that way.	Činilo se da je uvijek tako.
Maybe there's something he can do.	Možda ima nešto što može da uradi.
And he's there.	I on je tamo.
Do that.	Uradi to.
That was indeed true.	To je zaista bilo tačno.
He will help us.	On će nam pomoći.
He knew it wasn't.	Znao je da nije.
a.	a.
This can always be done at any time.	To se uvijek može učiniti u bilo koje vrijeme.
You certainly don't have to do them all.	Sigurno ih ne morate raditi sve.
How much further.	Koliko dalje.
We don't know when it will be.	Ne znamo kada će biti.
